      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It now seems likely that the negotiations for enlargement of the European Economic Community will be completed by the end of the year.  We would expect, in the course of 1972, to pass the appropriate legislation to enable us to submit any necessary Constitutional changes to the public by way of referendum so that we would <Col N="3" /> be in a position to accede by the 1st January, 1973.</P>
    <P>The precise nature of any Constitutional change will be proposed to the Dáil in due course with the draft legislation providing for the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the local elections are scheduled for June of 1972, may I ask the Taoiseach if one might anticipate that the referendum and the local elections would take place in the same month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say when it is intended to introduce the vote at 18 and if this might be introduced together with the other changes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the other day that in case there might be any doubt about the issue of voting for or against changes in the Constitution affecting membership of the EEC, I would take that into consideration before I would introduce any other issue into a referendum or before I would introduce any other issue on the same day as the referendum.  It would be hoped to go ahead with the question of the vote at 18 as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not yet made up his mind whether we are to have a referendum in connection with changes in the Constitution relating to our membership of the EEC. We also need other changes in the Constitution.  Is it anticipated that we shall have two referenda, one which will be related directly to the EEC and the other to general changes such as giving the vote at 18 and the deletion of certain Articles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the first part of that supplementary was a statement or a question. It is more than likely that we will have to have a referendum before we can accede to membership of the EEC. I would like if possible to have a referendum on the other matters such as the vote at 18 on the same day because this would avoid expense and other kinds of activities that we would not wish to duplicate but in case there might be any confusion in the minds of the public, it might be better&mdash;I am not certain whether it would&mdash;to have only the one issue but whether we will have a referendum on a particular day each change would have to be a separate issue.</P>

      <P>Reliable figures of net emigration are available only for intercensal periods.  Between the censuses of population in April, 1956 and April, 1966, the total net emigration was 292,608 persons.</P>
      <P>For periods since the last census of population the only indicators available of net emigration are the figures for the net outward passenger movement by sea and air.  For the five-year period ending February, 1971, the net outward passenger balance by sea and air was 88,207 persons.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that, while the net passenger balance proved to be close to the net emigration recorded for earlier intercensal periods, this was not the case in the 1961-66 period.  In the 1961-66 intercensal period the net passenger balance figure was considerably in excess of the true net emigration as calculated from the census results.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is at present no national fixed income boundary between the lower and middle income groups for the purposes of determining entitlement to health services.  In the circumstances it is not possible to give firm statistics under the headings referred to in the question.  It is broadly estimated, however, that about 60 per cent of the population is the middle income group.  The number of insured persons in that group would be about 600,000 while self-employed persons and those of independent means would probably be in the region of 170,000. Most of the latter would be heads of households.</P>
      <P>The foregoing figures are on the basis of preliminary estimates and I give them with the qualification that more precise estimates at present in process of preparation may show a considerable variation from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information he has given me but in view of the fact that the new health scheme, which the Minister for Finance announced, will come into operation on 1st October next, could the Minister explain how it is proposed to ensure that those who are in the middle income group will be paying a certain sum which, apparently, the Department have not yet decided, to make up a £2 million fund on 1st October if they do not now know or have only a hazy idea, as the Minister <Col N="12" /> said, of the number actually involved in the group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who have medical cards will not be required to contribute.  That is one distinction one can make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fringe of people between the lower income group and the middle income group which is related to eligibility which varies throughout the country and so I cannot give any more precise estimate than I have given to the Deputy.  A person who is not the holder of a medical card and who is under the income limit to be prescribed of £1,600 or £60 valuation will be required to pay contributions.  I cannot make it any simpler for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Minister to make it too simple; otherwise it might have a peculiar effect.  We are not accustomed to that kind of thing. Does the Minister not agree that in view of the fact that it seems to be almost impossible to estimate or pick out the people who are in the so-called middle income group, nobody can estimate that the proceeds of an amount of £x multiplied by the number of those people would produce £2 million? That is what I would like to know.  It is not the Minister who is responsible, I am quite sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an approximate calculation based on the figures I have given of the numbers of persons who will be paying.  It is based on a rough estimate from the number of people who already go to hospital and who are listed in the various health authorities as having the right to hospital treatment under the middle income group.  It is a rough estimate; I have just made that admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the number of people from the group who go to hospital would bear no relation to the number of people in that so-called group?  Is it not true that what has happened is that you have the sum of X and Y but do not know the value of either X or Y?</P>

This has been given in the second biennial report presented to the Council of Europe in December, 1970, which will be considered later this year by the Committee of Independent Experts.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I am satisfied that Ireland implements Article 15 of the Charter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will indicate the latest trend in tourist bookings for the 1971 season; and the likely prospects for the season with special reference to (a) Britain, (b) Europe and (c) North America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the latest market intelligence indicates an improvement on the previous report in the level of advance bookings for the 1971 season.</P>
      <P>The indications for the season are that there will be an increase in traffic compared with 1970 and that tourist numbers should increase by 6 per cent from Britain, 2 per cent from Europe and 12 per cent from North America. I must emphasise that these figures are based on the best information available at this stage and that they will be subject to review as additional reports come to hand.</P>

I am prepared to produce evidence to indicate this.  If the Minister would inquire at Bray and other east coast resorts which are dependent on British traffic he will find bookings are down 20 to 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should appreciate, as I have stated, that bookings are up.  The overall anticipation is, as I have mentioned, a 6 per cent increase from Britain and a 12 per cent increase from North America.  A further matter on which I should like to advise the Deputy, who is I appreciate concerned to get the true facts, is that there is a strong pattern in tourism not only here but all over the world of a definite reduction in bookings as far as tourists are concerned.  The growing trend is not to make bookings in advance but to book on the spot.  This is making a tremendous difference to tourist patterns all over the world and makes very doubtful any assertions at this stage based on bookings alone.</P>

Some areas are up dramatically; some carriers report an increase of 30 to 40 per cent in their business and so do some hotels but other hotels report a reduction.  The pattern is changing but the overall figures at this stage on a conservative basis, conservative in relation to other figures I have here, suggest a 6 per cent increase from Britian and a 12 per cent increase from North America.</P>

      <P>As I stated recently in a Press release, I have no responsibility for the operation of student exchange programmes.  I am concerned solely with the authorisation of the flights incidental to such programmes. For the purpose of safeguarding the interests of students participating in these flights, I require the promoting organisations to show their suitability to organise such charter flights.  The Irish Student Travel Service (USIT) and the Irish Student Employment and Travel Association (ISETA) have operated successful student exchange programmes over the past few years and have been approved for this summer.</P>
      <P>ISETA have been having difficulty in obtaining visa clearance in the United States for the students booked with them.  On assurances from USIT that they would collaborate with ISETA in the operation of their programme, including the provision of visas, I withdrew the approval given to ISETA.  However, USIT have not found it possible to agree a basis for co-operation with ISETA.</P>

      <P>The various incentive schemes for hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation were introduced for the purpose of stimulating greater development in that sector of the tourist industry.  These schemes, which have been reviewed and modified from time to time to meet changing needs, are administered by Bord Fáilte. Since the schemes were introduced, the board, in examining grant applications, took account of a number of factors, including the location of the project, <Col N="22" /> the amount of existing accommodation in the area, the market needs and marketability of the proposed accommodation, the type and price levels proposed, the estimated cost of the project and the background of the developer with special reference to his experience in the hotel and catering industry.</P>
      <P>In the light of the current competitive position in international tourism and the amount of accommodation development that has taken place, the board have been placing greater emphasis in recent times on market needs, marketability, price level of the proposed accommodation and the ability of the developer to generate new traffic.  This modification does not represent a radical change in policy but reflects an adjustment of emphasis related to prevailing circumstances. These marketing criteria are being applied to all cases now being dealt with by Bord Fáilte.  As Deputies are aware, the board have not been entering into any new grant commitments for the past two years and the general position about future accommodation development is at present under consideration.</P>

What we have stopped are grants for new hotel projects pending the consolidation of the general hotel accommodation we have, consolidation in the sense of extensions and facilities in relation to existing accommodation and the filling of that accommodation for a greater part of the year.  It is a question of changing the emphasis of <Col N="23" /> our tourist investment from providing more accommodation to consolidating the accommodation we have and selling it better.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the Minister that the accommodation we have may be more than adequate for our tourist needs this year and, perhaps, for the next few years, does the Minister not agree that there is a danger that the more expensive type of hotel, which can afford to indulge in this type of marketing abroad, is more likely to qualify for grants than the small hotels which, I believe, there is need for develoing?</P>

      <P>Under section 45 of the Currency Act, 1927, as amended, the design of legal tender notes is a matter for the Central Bank, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the bank has felt for some time that the designs of the legal tender notes, which were adopted over 42 years ago, fall short of present day standards of design and security and should be replaced.  The bank has not yet made any official proposal to me in the matter.  I am sure, however, that it will do everything feasible to secure that the best possible new designs will be obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any significant demand for the introduction of an extra coin at this stage.  In any event I think it is too early to reach a decision on whether a coin between 10 new pence and 50 new pence should be added to the new decimal coinage. The question can be considered in the light of further experience of operating with the existing series of six decimal coins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one argument for an additional coin, but there is also the question, if we were to have one, should it be 20p or 25p.  It is too early to assess whether it is necessary and, if so, which kind of coin is needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported on Wednesday last I had more or less covered all the aspects of the Budget, but before concluding I want to refer to the cuts that have been made in the Road Fund grant as far as my constituency is concerned.  I am at a loss to know why such drastic cuts were made.  The national primary road grant has been cut by £15,000, the upkeep of the national primary roads has been reduced by £7,929 and the <Col N="47" /> upkeep of main roads by £6,321, making a total cut of £29,250.  At a time when the Government speak in terms of progress this is an alarming situation. I can understand the reason.  Of course I should not say I can understand it but I think the reason is clear. It is that the Government have not got the funds at their disposal.  This is to be seen clearly in the matter of reconstruction grants and other grants. These should be available to the community but there are delays in payments.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the question of housing.  The Government are doing nothing, they are standing still in respect of housing at a time when the problems in my constituency are grave. People are waiting for houses and the list is so long that it will be years before people in need of rehousing in my constituency will be reached.</P>
      <P>I dealt last week with the question of company taxation and I said that the 58 per cent tax on companies will put many firms into liquidation, will bankrupt them.  It is happening week after week but the Government are standing idly by waiting and watching, making no effort whatever to rectify the position.  In the past 12 months during the bank closure they were warned continually by this party. Seven or eight years ago a Deputy on this side of the House, a member of this party, warned the Fianna Fáil Government under the leadership of the late Mr. Seán Lemass that the country was rushing headlong into inflation. The Deputy who issued that warning was Mr. James Dillon.  Surely Fianna Fáil were warned in time but they took no action and we have the results today.  Anybody who reads today's newspapers can see the advice given by the Central Bank.  Inflation is riding high.  As I have said, week after week firms are going into liquidation. Yet the Government try to give the impression that everything is under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to ask the Minister for Finance what the Government intend to do to improve the position of the agricultural community, of farmers' incomes.  In the past couple <Col N="48" /> of years we saw the treatment meted out by former Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries to the farming community. We saw farmers sitting out in Merrion Street on cold winter nights. We saw seizures of farmers' property in my constituency.  In these circumstances, how this divided Fianna Fáil Government can cling to office is something I cannot understand.  The manly thing for the Taoiseach to do would be to grasp the nettle and ask the Irish people for their decision.  I am sure that when that decision is given we will be sitting over there on the opposite benches.</P>

      <P>I will confine my remarks to the social aspects of the Government's programme as evidenced in this Budget. It is appropriate that I should do so for two reasons, (a) the special responsibility I have in this immediate area and (b) because this Budget has been described by none other than Deputy Noël Browne as a socialist Budget.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects on which I should like to dwell.  The first is some outline on the schools transport programme and on the effect which this has on the educational programme generally and of course then on the social environment of the country.  The House will be aware that from time to time over the last few months, and indeed for the last year, I have been pressed by Deputies to extend certain facilities and, in fact, to amend the school transport regulations to include in the system young boys and girls who are at present not being included.  I have repeatedly given the reasons why the regulations were introduced as they were and have endeavoured to show that in fact they have been applied in a reasonable and humane fashion.  I would like to assure the House at this stage that this will continue to be our approach.</P>
      <P>Lest the constant suggestions of certain Deputies would give the public the impression that very little has been done in this area and that the Government have simply been giving the impression that a lot has been done, but that in fact the real truth is that very little has been done, I could very briefly outline (a) the increase in cost in the school transport programme which in itself is clear evidence of the extension of this programme since it was introduced in 1966-67 and (b) by way of confirmation, and this is much more important in the costings, the increase in the number of pupils who have availed of this service since the introduction of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one goes back to April, 1967, there was at that time a very limited form of transport available for some pupils in the primary schools.  In fact it was so limited that it applied only to something over 2,000 pupils.  When the scheme was introduced in September, 1967, it catered for a total of approximately 50,000 pupils in the following <Col N="50" /> year, that is, a breakdown of 11,000 in the primary schools and 39,000 in the post-primary schools.  In the following year, beginning September, 1968, that number was increased to 83,500, catering for 20,500 in the primary schools and 63,000 in the post-primary schools.  In the following year again that was increased to 95,000, catering for 28,500 in the primary schools and 66,500 in the post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>In the year commencing September, 1970, the total number availing of the transport scheme was 111,000, which, broken down, related to 72,000 in the post-primary schools and 39,000 on the primary side.  In the year beginning April, 1971, the year which we are at present concerned with, the total number at present benefiting from this programme is 116,000 which breaks down into 71,300 on the post-primary side and 45,300 on the primary side.</P>
    <P>First of all, it is very clear from that that in the four years since its implementation the numbers of pupils benefiting from the scheme have increased from 50,000 to 116,000.  This is a clear indication of the benefit which accrues to the students themselves and, even more important&mdash;this is what I would like clearly to outline here&mdash;the commitment of my Department to ensure that this ever-increasing and expanding graph will be continued until all children who in fact come within the scheme can be effectively accommodated.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go through a discussion on the regulations which apply to the transport scheme.  It is for this reason that I decided some time back to circulate to the Deputies and the Senators on all sides of both Houses a comprehensive outline of the reasoning behind the scheme, the manner in which it was administered and the appropriate agencies through which it was administered.  I hope this circular which we prepared for the information of all concerned and for the managers and principals of schools, who are concerned as well, will help them to share in a responsible way in the implementation of this very important programme.  I would like to say it is naïve of Deputies to suggest in the House here that we can simply reduce the existing age limits, cut down on <Col N="51" /> the existing mileage limits and in fact scrap them altogether, almost for the same cost.  Nobody would be more ready to do that than I or the Government but the reality of the matter is that within the immense development in this area and within the immense increase in costs, to which I shall now refer, all of us must treat it in a responsible fashion.  I would like to say also that it was never the intention, and obviously never could be the intention, of the free transport scheme for education that all children would be carried to every educational centre.  I do not think any Deputy would suggest that this should be so and, accordingly, it seemed desirable and reasonable that regulations would be drawn up which would be based on age and distance.</P>
    <P>The regulations broadly are that children ten years of age and under, if they are two miles or more from the centre of education, qualify for transport and that children at the primary level between ten and 14 years of age who are three or more miles from the centre of education qualify for transport. Over and above that we have made it very clear that where there is room in a bus we will at greatly reduced rates, which were referred to at Question Time recently, be very glad to accommodate pupils who do not qualify within those age/distance regulations. We have been doing so as much as possible.  I would like to take this opportunity of acknowledging the concern of Deputies on all sides of the House in bringing cases to my attention in this area and to assure them that it is our continued intention to accommodate such pupils who do not immediately qualify where there is room in a bus at what I regard as almost a nominal charge but certainly a greatly subsidised charge.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into a debate on the transport scheme but I should like to look on the other side so that I can responsibly and objectively state that we are going as far as we can and indeed we have gone very far within the reasonable limits which any such programme will impose financially. The cost in the year 1966-67 of the <Col N="52" /> transport scheme, primary and post-primary, was £74,000 approximately. In 1967-68 that figure increased to £1,286,000 approximately.  In the following year it increased to £1,953,000. In the following year, 1969-70, it increased to £2,297,000 and in the year 1970-71 it increased to £2,918,000.  This year it is reliably estimated it will not be less than £3½ million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, the Deputy will probably find that the number of buses has considerably increased but it is also in some respects due to the increased charges.  However, it is due mainly to the increased number of pupils being carried.  One can see immediately that this is a vastly expanding area and in reference to Deputy Tully's question I should like to state as a fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that not all pupils, whom we gather would be entitled to transport facilities, are as yet availing of the service.  It is for this reason that we are anxious to know about all such students and it is also for this reason that I have circularised Deputies and all concerned, so that we will be aware of this and will be able, as soon as possible, to provide the services to which each child is entitled. Any national programme of this sort must be available to all, irrespective of where they live, provided they fulfil the conditions.  It cannot be and it should not be implemented on the basis that if you happen to be fortunate enough to live in an area in which there is either a progressive and enlightened <Col N="53" /> manager, or principal, or even Deputy, you will be lucky enough to be carried but on the other hand if you happen to be unfortunate enough to be living in an area in which there may be an uninterested manager, or principal, you could be waiting for quite a while for an entitlement which is yours under law.</P>
      <P>This is an aspect of our educational programme which every Deputy can immediately acknowledge.  I do not want to enter into the other side of the educational programme except to say that obviously the Minister has regard, in all decisions relating to the rationalisation of primary and post-primary education, to the educational benefit of the children themselves.  In doing so the actual cost sometimes of the transport scheme which has to be provided when a school in a remote area is closed down may be more, and in some cases has been more, than the actual cost of maintaining the old school, when you take one thing with another.</P>
      <P>It should be evident from these figures that the first concern of the Minister and the Department, and all concerned in this area, is not cost, although cost is a major concern, but the best education, at every level, primary and post-primary&mdash;and indeed university, which of course does not arise in regard to a transport scheme&mdash; for all children.  It would be well if Deputies would bear this in mind when they are making recommendations, or expressing criticism in relation to the closure of certain schools in rural Ireland, sometimes with the suggestion that this is being done because the Government find themselves unable to finance the existing programme.  Far from it, it is being done for only one reason and that is the only reason that could apply&mdash;the educational betterment of the children concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to refer to another matter which relates to the social aspect of the Government's programme and that is the youth and recreation programme which was launched by my predecessor, the Minister for Local Government.  Before dealing with this I should like to place on record, as I had not got the opportunity of doing so <Col N="54" /> before, my appreciation and thanks to the press and all the news media for the great encouragement they gave to me and those bodies associated with me in promoting this very important area in any country's programme.  This probably stems from an awareness at large that for a considerable time we have been rather casual in our approach to the need for an enlightened programme of physical recreation and also rather casual about the desirability of co-ordinating the whole programme of youth and community activities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If anything has become clear to me since I became involved in this area it is that there is a great fund of energy, enthusiasm and dedication throughout the community in regard to the implementation of an enlightened national policy, either in the field of physical recreation or in the field of youth work and youth clubs generally.  What has also become quite evident to me is that much that happened in the years prior to the establishment of the National Youth Council&mdash;if we look for a moment at the youth programme&mdash; happened in a rather haphazard way and happened because of the energy and enthusiasm of particular people. The result was that magnificent voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and various other youth and community organisations, springing up for their own purpose and for very desirable ends, were not necessarily contributing from the fund of their experience to others operating in a similar area.  For that reason the National Youth Council was established&mdash;I will not say under the late Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, but certainly with his active involvement.  He attended the very first meeting of the council in 1966-67. One of the purposes of that council has been to act as a national centre and a national co-ordinating body for all youth activities.  This does not mean that the programme undertaken by any of the individual organisations affiliated to the council are subject to the authority or direction of the council but simply that the council represent each one of them on their executive committee. As well as that, the council are <Col N="55" /> able to channel from one organisation to other organisations the best and most enlightened proposals and activities in this area.  They are also able to channel the most enlightened thinking operating at international level to the benefit of the various member organisations.</P>
    <P>May I, just as an indication of the Government's awareness and concern in this area, point to two specific instances recently when I had the honour of being the only Government representative, or should I say the only Government representative who had responsibility in this area, attending two very significant aspects of youth work.  Last November I attended an international conference in Munich of all the European youth organisations, east and west, with observers from outside Europe and which was held under the auspices of the German National Youth Organisation and also under the auspices of the SENYC and the WEY, both being European organisations east and west.  Apart from the representative of the Federal German Government who opened the conference, I was the only representative from any Government who attended all the sessions.  The fact that the Government instructed me to attend showed their awareness of the importance of community involvement with the young people and their affairs.  I had an opportunity of getting to understand the thinking of the young people in Europe.  This was of significant benefit to me.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Council and my Department enjoy a complete understanding.  The Government do not direct all youth policies to the exclusion of the bodies concerned in this work.  This is important when so many people are concerned about the breakdown between national thinking and community thinking at certain levels. Each of these youth bodies is autonomous in the administration and direction of their affairs.  They take their own decisions.  The Government provide financial assistance.  We use the youth organisations as enlightened agents of the national policy.  This allows the Government to avail of <Col N="56" /> their undoubted dedication and commitment to providing a happy and secure society for the young people of the country.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of the Government policy on youth programmes has been under discussion.  There has been consultation. There have been recommendations from the various bodies concerned.  It has been suggested that the Government have no regard for community thinking and that there is a clear cleavage between Government thinking and community activities. This is not so.  There is a close understanding of the problems and a good working relationship between the Department and the youth organisations. This is a matter of great benefit to all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Members of the House should be aware of the financial assistance which is available through the various youth organisations.  This year's allocation from my Department was something less than £40,000 which was paid directly to youth organisations.  There are other sums which are seldom noted by the public.  It is important to bring these matters to the attention of the House.  The Government finance the programme of many youth organisations. Comhairle le Leas Oige are committed to working under the aegis of the Dublin Vocational Educational Committee in sponsoring enlightened youth programmes in the vocational schools.  This body received a subvention of £72,000 this year from the Vote for the Vocational Educational Section of the Department of Education. Macra na Tuaithe are concerned exclusively with farming organisations and they received £17,500 this year from the Department of Education. This was an increase of £8,500 on last year's allocation.  I may be forgiven for outlining the activities of the various organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are many areas, directly or indirectly, in which the Government involve themselves in enlightened community development. The Budget is concerned with the actual financial allocations to the various areas of need throughout the country.  Social welfare assistance is one of the priorities of the Budget.  The amount of money allocated is not necessarily the ultimate criterion.  In conclusion, I would like to mention that the amount of money which is being made available and which is acknowledged to be limited&mdash;more money must and will follow&mdash;has been able to assist greatly in the development of enlightened community policy. This and other Budgets which will follow will ensure that such a programme will continue and that funds will be expanded to the betterment of our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said about the spending of this money for recreational purposes.  It is easy to allocate money for recreational purposes but in built-up areas in Dublin Fianna Fáil men are building in open spaces and making money overnight.  Deputy Tully asked how many buses were carrying children to the schools.  The number of buses has not increased, but everything else has increased.  The Fianna Fáil Government tell us that several million pounds' worth of houses have been built.  They forget to tell us the number of units which were built. The OECD report showed that the number of houses built here per thousand of population was the lowest in Europe.  The Government have also reduced the size of the houses.  The Parliamentary Secretary or any other Fianna Fáil Deputy can come in here with one side of the story, but not the whole truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget has solved nothing.  It does nothing to improve the economy of the country.  There is nothing in it <Col N="58" /> for the workers.  The workers are minus £11 the same as the millionaires.  The social welfare recipient gets 10s.  He got 10s four or five years ago.  At that time a phased wage demand would have been about £2.  A phased wage demand now is in the region of £4, or £4 10s, or £5, and the social welfare recipient is still getting 10s.  He should get £1 at least.  An outsider would call this Budget a Mickey Mouse Budget but, if he looked at it closely enough, he would call it an insurance Budget, a Budget to ensure that Haughey and Blaney and other people would not vote against it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensure that Deputy Haughey, Deputy Blaney and other dissidents would not vote against it.  There is practically no change in it. It is a <i>status quo</i> Budget.  There is no effort to grasp the nettle now because, if there were, these people would vote against it.  It is also meant to ensure that over the next 12 months, if any of the dissidents vote against the Government, the Government can go to the country without having brought in a harsh Budget.  This Budget was thought out for the Fianna Fáil Party rather than for the Irish nation.  I would hate to have been a civil servant sitting behind the Minister when he was drawing up this Budget.  No civil servant would recommend it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>To me, taking £11 from a worker is inflation.  Instead of taking money from him, we should be increasing the personal allowance.  The 10s given to the social welfare recipient, the unemployed person, the widow, the sick, and so on, does not cover the increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months, and it does not take into account the increase there will be in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance limit has been increased from £1,200 to £1,600.  Surely it is time that the amount of income allowed to a non-contributory old age pensioner was increased from £4 to £6? <Col N="59" /> There are many other items that could be improved if the Government did their job properly.  On top of all that we have in the region of 71,000 unemployed. That is not my figure.  That is the figure given by the Central Statistics Office.  We could add 20,000 or 30,000 to that figure if we took into account those taken off the dole and persons retiring at ages 65 to 70 who are normally unemployed.  Even taking the figure of 71,000 unemployed, that is a disgrace to any Irish Government. In the West we had the Minister for Lands cutting down the number of forestry workers.  The road grants were reduced four or five years ago.  I know one county in which they were £120,000 and they have now been reduced to £80,000.  This means there is less work for the people.  In Ballina with a population of 5,200 there are 1,400 unemployed, that is 27 per cent. There are rows in England if the figure reaches 10 per cent in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>This Government pay lip service to the Irish language in the West.  They will have to pay that lip service to a different area very shortly because there will be very few people left in the West.  To speed up this depopulation of the West the Government withdrew the dole.  They hoped to save some money on the Irish language.  What the British planted by force the Government are deplanting by starvation. The Government could not care less. If you ask a question here you can get an answer in Irish but the Government are doing nothing for the West.  Lip service is all we get instead of something practical.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned that £550,000 was allocated in the Budget for the payment of unemployment assistance to men without dependants in the urban areas.  This was included because of pressure from the Opposition. If we look at the Book of Estimates we see that they were saving £1,600,000 a week before the Budget was introduced.  No error was made in regard to the withdrawal of the dole. I can tell the House that because, on that day, when it leaked out from Limerick, so far as I know, we rang <Col N="60" /> the Department of Social Welfare and they said it was not their decision. We then rang the Taoiseach's Department and they said: &ldquo;That is correct. The dole is gone.&rdquo;  We asked them why and they said they would ring us back and tell us.  They did not.  I have two witnesses to this.  We waited and they did not ring us back.</P>
    <P>One of the worst things I have noted about the Fianna Fáil Party is that when they get into trouble the Minister runs, washes his hands of it and says: &ldquo;It was not my fault.  It was a civil servant's mistake.  It was explained wrongly.&rdquo;  If you are an owner of a premises you take the knocks when they come because you also get the glory.  You do not hide behind somebody working below you.  It is a disgrace for any Minister to do this.  I do not really know for how long Fianna Fáil Ministers have been doing this.  I saw it at the Arms Trial.  Every ex-Minister who was blamed at that time ran and left the blame on the civil servants.  During the dole crisis we saw how the Minister washed his hands of the whole job.  The Department of Social Welfare were blamed.</P>
    <P>We heard from Fianna Fáil Deputies and from Fianna Fáil cumainn how disgraceful it was to withdraw the dole. They likened it to the reduction in the old age pensions of 10s to 9s during the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. Let us look at the circumstances.  In 1927 in every country in the world wages were reduced when the cost of living went down and they were increased when the cost of living went up.  I am not saying I agree with the reduction of the old age pensions in 1927 but 9s at that time was one-third of the average wage.  The amount of the old age pension today is not one-third the average wage.  In 1927 the economists thought they were right and they advised the Government accordingly. In fact, they were wrong.  I do not think anyone advised this Government to withdraw the dole.  A Government that took this action should get out of office.</P>
    <P>I am worried when the Minister for Finance hands out money to inefficient Ministers.  In the past 12 months we have heard political commentators, <Col N="61" /> the newspapers, and to a certain extent Telefís Éireann, say that this is the worst Cabinet we have ever had in Ireland and, goodness knows, we have had some bad Cabinets.  I agree with the view expressed in the newspapers when the Cabinet are working but in the past 12 months they have not been working.  They were looking over the shoulders of their colleagues, trying to hold on to their jobs and hoping to stay in power for three years and get a pension.  Many political commentators wanted to know why the Opposition did not get Fianna Fáil out of office. It is quite simple: the Ministers want to hold on to their jobs and the person in the second seat for Fianna Fáil in any area&mdash;as the late Deputy Mick Donnellan used to say &ldquo;the hind teat&rdquo; man&mdash;does not want a general election no matter what his feelings.  They want to stay in power at all costs.  This is the mark of an inefficient Government who think of themselves and have no regard for the people.</P>
    <P>We have seen the new Ministers spending much of their time in front of photographers in the hope of gaining publicity in order to top the poll in their area.

      <P>I am dealing with the waste of money allocated by the Minister for Finance.  I am only saying in passing that he is not doing his job in the Department.  In this city we have seen the Minister for Justice sidestep issues because they would cost money. I am bringing this matter up because the Minister for Finance told us he was going to save £7½ million although I do not know where he is going to save it.  I want to know if this saving is being made in the Department of Justice.  The gardaí in this city and throughout the country are under strength.  We have seen the Minister increasing the parking fine from £1 to £2 because he said the cost of living had increased to such an extent that £2 was only worth £1.  He does not say that <Col N="62" /> when social welfare matters are being considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Burke asked the Minister the number of gardaí in Galway and in various suburbs in Dublin. As far as I can remember, it was 75 in Galway and 30 in Ballyfermot despite the fact that the latter has a population double that of Galway city.  By keeping the gardaí under strength we are not saving any money.  In fact, malicious damage and the cost to business in having detectives guard property are costing the country much more than if the gardaí were paid adequately. The number of gardaí at Coolock has increased from 22 to 36 men and this is not nearly enough. Pressure is coming from the residents of this city.  The Minister's reply to all representations is that there is a commission sitting.  I have seen reports of people who were carrying guns illegally but nothing was done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>After agriculture, tourism is our biggest industry but here again we have failed completely. There are no economically priced hotels or package tours, for instance. The booklet setting out hotel prices was not published until a couple of months before the season began.  In any other country in the world such information would have been published during the previous season.  In our case it was published this year in February so that until then no travel agent was in a position to give anybody any information on hotel charges.  If the Minister responsible for tourism has no problems of his own, the country certainly has problems.  It is a question of either the Minister or Bord Fáilte going.</P>
      <P>We were told recently by the Taoiseach that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement has only marginal effects in regard to the failure of some Irish industries.  At the time the agreement was signed, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about the need for rationalisation and said that we must prepare for EEC membership. I think it was Deputy Treacy who said that he did not see why we should rationalise and do ourselves so much harm in order to be ready for the bigger market of the Community. These are two different concepts because, in the bigger market, we will have a better chance.  We are limited to some extent in so far as England is concerned but there will be no limitations within the Community.</P>
      <P>There has been much rationalisation in so far as the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is concerned, not necessarily in relation to the agreement but in order to follow the advice of Government Ministers.  This rationalisation resulted in mergers which, in many cases, put people out of employment. The legislation that was promised to ensure that such workers would obtain alternative employment has not been introduced.</P>

    <P>Death duties have been increased to <Col N="64" /> 55 per cent.  Some people may say that this will not matter very much because only the rich will be affected but of course that is not the case.  It was said that only very big companies would be affected by the introduction of the 58 per cent company tax but it is a well-known fact that jobs have been lost because of that 58 per cent.  The tax should have been on dividends or on salaries but if it had been on salaries I suppose some higher civil servants as well as some Ministers would have been caught in the net.  Personally, I am not against company tax but I could not approve of it when its application puts companies out of business, thereby causing unemployment.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of death duties.  If, as I said here before, two directors of a company die within a short time, this results in the payment of double duties which might well mean that the premises concerned would have to be sold.  The new owner would have no obligations towards the staff.  If he has come up the hard way he will be likely to employ his own staff who have helped him.  In any case, he will be likely to employ young staff.  This results in older people being put out of employment and having to be supported.  Therefore, out of the £1 million per annum that will accrue from this extra taxation, how much will it cost to maintain those who will have been made redundant?  The net gain to the Exchequer will be very small.</P>
    <P>A certain amount may accrue from any particular taxation but we must remember the proportion that will go in administration.  For example, in relation to motor taxation, there are staff and buildings to be maintained throughout the country.  Tax collection should be centralised.  It is my belief that any one such factor as death duties, company tax or the Department of Industry and Commerce could have such adverse effect on a company as to cause unemployment.  That is what worries me.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in wages of between 20 and 30 per cent but nobody is allowed to recover more <Col N="65" /> than 7 per cent of that increase.  If there must be a squeeze, I have no objection so long as the squeeze applies all round.  However, our company tax has been increased to 58 per cent at a time when our competitors in England are paying only 40 per cent &mdash;theirs having been reduced from 42½ per cent whereas ours was increased by 8 per cent.  We must compete on the home market and no company anywhere can export successfully unless they first build up a good home market.  There are one or two companies in Ireland who have been successful but they are huge multi-millionaire companies with branches throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the contribution made on the 18th May, 1971 by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Dublin Central as reported at column 1793 of the Dáil Debates for that day. This reflects something that I said in the same context.  I said that during the maintenance men's strike there should have been an embargo on the importation of biscuits.  My reason for saying this was that if our people got used to the flavour of foreign biscuits they would be encouraged to buy these in future even if they were a little dearer than our own.  I quote what Deputy Fitzpatrick said:</P>
    <P>Many big retail combines have established branches throughout the country.  Many of these firms are English-based.  There is much foreign competition in the distribution trade.  I personally cannot see how foreign capital can benefit the retail sector of the business, but these large combines have channelled their resources and, as they have many branches in England and also manufacture their own lines of branded goods, they could operate to the disadvantage of our manufacturers here. They might promote the goods manufactured in their own bases to the disadvantage of Irish-manufactured goods.  Our goods must get comparable prominence to that given to the goods manufactured abroad. If the quality of the goods is right they will sell well.  When we enter the EEC we will enter a large Community and those who are efficient <Col N="66" /> and project the right image will benefit substantially.</P>
    <P>How can we start at a disadvantage of 18 per cent on company tax in the home market?  It cannot be done.  Take the combines that are here at present in the retail trade, say the grocery trade &mdash;when we are in the EEC and we have free trade they will sell and push their own products in their supermarket chains here.  It does not matter much whether they make money or not in the supermarket chains here because they will have 18 per cent more profit in their company in England and they will make their money there.  I think it was to Mussolini that one of the big petrol companies complained that they were making no money in the country and said: &ldquo;You cannot control the price.&rdquo;  But he controlled it because he found out that while they were not making money in Italy they were making it in America.  That is what will happen here unless we get our company tax down to the British level.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned that there is a dividend tax in Britain that comes out of the company and the Minister said that if you paid 4 per cent dividend tax you paid more tax in England, that you only pay 44 per cent here.  So what?  I have no objection to taxing dividends. If you want to stop spending that is the way to tax but do not hurt jobs. Any Minister or civil servant who brings in such a provision knows nothing about business.</P>
    <P>We heard from the present Minister for Finance when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce that car assembling would last until 1980.  I do not know how he could say that because when you get into the EEC you can buy a car in Germany, or Italy, and drive it into Ireland; you do not have to buy it here and there would be no duty on it.  If you get that agreement you must sacrifice something else and I think it would be something on the agricultural side.  This is what I was told when I inquired from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I do not believe for one second that the Fianna Fáil Party have any interest in saving car assembly until 1980 because they made the agreement with the present importers <Col N="67" /> of cars that no other make, whether Russian or East European, would be allowed in.  They guaranteed that they would assemble cars up to a certain price which, I think&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;is £1,200.  We shall have only one or two years, perhaps, to go until every car is above £1,200.  I know at present at least 25 of the car assemblers&mdash;I cannot speak about Cork&mdash;in Dublin have been let go and others are on short time.  By 1973 probably 50 per cent will be gone.  The Government will have no worry about them; they will either be absorbed or will be working in some other country.  The Government could not come out and say that honestly; they let it die out gradually, let the workers believe and give the Government their votes for a number of years but when the workers would be gone to England it would not worry the Government any further. They are just playing politics with the lives of families.</P>
    <P>We have heard all the Ministers and the Taoiseach shouting about wages, saying workers should not seek more wages, that they are increasing costs and creating inflation.  I should like somebody to think back to this time 13 or 14 months ago shortly before the 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax. All the financial writers and economists were saying that anybody who would touch turnover tax would create the greatest inflation and that that would be the worst thing that could happen. The Central Bank also said it but our Government thought differently.  Now they are criticising people for seeking extra wages when it is the Government who have increased the cost of living more than anybody.  I do not know what this 2½ per cent brings in but I suppose the Government get £40 or £50 million out of it but the extra increases on top of whatever the Government get would mean a fair amount of money.</P>
    <P>I was elected in 1963 and we saw at that time how much the 2½ per cent turnover tax cost and how much the cost of living went up.  But they tried it again last year and put up costs again. This was not enough and they had to come again in the autumn with the <Col N="68" /> corporation profits tax.  They had a wage freeze which they withdrew eventually.  They say there is dividend control which to me is the greatest nonsense because whether you are an efficient or an inefficient company you can only pay out the same amount of money.  Nobody will bother to pick a good company to invest in.  I believe they should be allowed to pay what they like but, when the dividends come out, hammer them.  That is the way to do it.</P>
    <P>I suppose every man is vain to an extent but when the Minister brought in the corporation profits tax he was lambasted publicly by every business group and, I believe, privately by the trade unionists because there was less work available.  Employers could not afford to compete against English products on the home market and had to let staff go.  If the Minister were a man he would have admitted that he made a mistake and said he would withdraw that tax and put it on dividends or get the money some other way.  Instead, he tried to get out of it by helping a few companies.  I know the argument.  I met three or four of the employer groups.  They had put up the legitimate argument that they had not enough money to compete.  It was very difficult to buy new machinery, in fact, it could not be done because there was no reserve.  The Minister, to placate some of them and prevent the whole of the employers and employees organisations coming down on him said: &ldquo;We will give you machinery tax free in the coming two or three years but not this year and you can write it off in one year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, I think this is not facing the facts as they are.  I think that most of the machinery that would be bought, say, in a retail trade, would be new machinery for decimalisation.  If a company buys a computer for decimalisation it is allowed to write it off immediately; this provision is not necessary. This provision is an attempt to placate employers.  If the Minister wants Irish companies to be able to compete with English companies he must reduce company tax to the rate of the British company tax.</P>
    <P>We have seen the shoe industry go <Col N="69" /> to the wall and many people are unemployed as a result.  The remaining companies are barely existing and are suffering a tremendous drop in profits.</P>
    <P>On 29th April, 1971, at column 851, Volume 253 of the Official Report Deputy Cosgrave said:</P>
    <P>Under the Capital Budget it is proposed to increase the amount of money made available to the IDA from £18.5 million to £23 million&mdash; an increase of approximately 22 per cent.  This is to provide and stimulate industrial employment and to provide and assist the establishment of new industries.  At the same time, we are continuing with proposals that raised company taxation in the supplementary Budget last year and which brings us to as high a rate, and in the upper limit higher, than similar taxation in Britain.  On the one hand, in the most expensive possible way, we are trying to generate and establish new industries and, on the other hand, we are taxing excessively industries that are established and that have been, and are, providing employment.  We are preventing them from expanding, developing and meeting the problems they must face in competition with other countries.</P>
    <P>I would say at home mainly but also in foreign markets.  Deputy Cosgrave continued:</P>
    <P>One of the effects of company taxation has been to increase the tax taken from companies in respect of the Budget of last year from a total of £3.5 million last year to £6 million in a full year.  This is being done when the growth of imports from British firms to this country has doubled in the last five years.</P>
    <P>The Government proposals have not been adequately thought out. There is growing feeling that the failure of the Government to adopt a consistent, coherent policy in regard to industry and finance has been shown in this situation.  The figures to which I have referred indicate the situation that has developed in industry compared with that which obtained prior to the Supplementary Budget of last year.  This year we reached the half-way stage in the <Col N="70" /> working of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  Since the agreement was concluded imports from Britain have doubled and most firms are finding it increasingly difficult to compete with British imports.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Department of Finance gets a business brain the better because I cannot see how any company can compete with foreign companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that wage increases are the cause of most of our troubles and I agree this is partly the case but the wage content of an industry can be as low as 2 per cent or as much as 20 to 30 per cent.  If a commercial traveller buys a car he has to pay 20 per cent wholesale tax and 5 per cent turnover tax on top of the duty on cars which means he has to pay much more for a car than his English counterpart.</P>
    <P>Overdrafts are a thing of the past. If one wants to borrow money one has to go to a merchant bank.  If a large sum of money is wanted the merchant bank will only lend it on the understanding that they get a cut in the profits.  They will lend money at a lower interest rate provided they get a bigger cut in the profits and the bigger the cut in the profits they get the lower the interest rate will be.  If a person went into a bank after the bank strike and asked to borrow money he was told to come back the following March, but when he asked what the chance of borrowing money next March would be he was told it would be nil.  The Minister talks here about control but there has been control for the last two years although it has not been called a &ldquo;credit squeeze&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that Government expenditure has contributed to inflation.  At column 692, Volume 253 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>For some time the Government have been concerned because public expenditure has been rising at a rate substantially faster than national production.</P>
    <P>To me that means the Government are getting money but are investing it badly.  If money is invested properly there should be a return on it of even <Col N="71" /> 2 or 3 per cent.  It appears that the Government are spending money but are not getting any return on that money.  In the course of his Budget speech the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the impact of price and wage inflation on the labour intensive public sector, for which pay alone now amounts to £154 million, and one the wide range of goods which must be purchased out of Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>As far as I can work out, the tax on cigarettes and drink is paying for at least three-quarters of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Someone mentioned a figure of £4.6 million that farmers are alleged to be getting.  I wonder how much of that £4.6 million will go back to the Government.  The farmer cannot give a marriage settlement to his son.  In the cities and towns owners of property are inclined to hand that property over to their children but, in the country, the children are often 40 or 50 years old before they get the property.  On an average 60 or 70 acre holding death duties will account for 10 per cent. In a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> today it was reckoned that a 75 acre holding was worth £22,000.  If a farmer wants to clear off a debt on a holding the only way he can do it is by selling portion of the holding.  But he is not allowed to sell.  If he owes something in the region of £3,000 where will he get that £3,000?  He will have to pay 9 per cent interest to the Revenue Commissioners. It seems contradictory that one Department of State should insist on making farms into larger units while another Department of State puts farmers into debt.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Deputy Sweetman and I objected strenuously to the capitalisation of land.  I think this was introduced by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance.  It was subsequently withdrawn by Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Finance.  Capitalisation meant that, if one sold land, the Government took two-thirds.  Our main objection was to the loopholes.  One could form a company and get away with it.  Secondly, there would be no land for building.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> Deputy O'Kennedy, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, said that here in Dublin we have huge open spaces.  In most areas in Dublin there are no open spaces.  Of course, when the Minister describes the amount of money spent on housing, he gives the total amount, not the units.</P>
    <P>I have a sort of vested interest in drink, not a very big one.  In 1968 beer went up by one penny.  The pint was a great deal cheaper then than it is now.  The proportion would be bigger than it is now.  The Government expected in 1968 a yield of £1.4 million. Beer was increased in 1968 again in November by two pence and the yield was expected to be £1.1 million.  The total, therefore, in 1968 was £2.5 million. The actual total was £3.74 million. By increasing the price of the pint this year by 1.3 new pence the Minister expects a yield of £1 million.  Surely there is something wrong in his estimation here.  There seems to be a lack of proportion.  Who is codding whom?  In 1964 the total income from beer and spirits was £21.6 million.  To 31st March, 1971, the total income is just £60 million, practically three times as much.  In 1964 the yield went up by £24.7 million; in 1965 it was £27.33 million; in 1966 it was £32.32 million; in 1967 it was £34.89 million; in 1968 it was £41.45 million; in 1969 it was £54.05 million and in 1970 it was £59.15 million.  The estimated figure for 1971 is £60 million.  How wrong has the Minister been in his calculation? In November, 1968, it went up 2d.  The total estimated yield was £2.5 million; the actual receipts were £3.74 million. In April, 1968, foreign spirits went up 6d a glass; the Minister expected £0.35 million.  All other spirits went up by 2d a glass; he expected £.4 million; that is £.75 million for spirits and £2.5 million for beer.  That works out at £3.25 million.  The actual receipts were £7.61 million.</P>
    <P>In the 1969 Budget beer went up by 2d.  The Minister expected a yield of £2.6 million; he got £7.92 million, almost five times more than he estimated. In spirits he estimated a yield of £1.33 million; he got £4.63 million.  In fact, the total estimate for 1969 was £3.93 million, and the Minister got £12.55 <Col N="73" /> million.  That is some estimation.  A child of two years of age could estimate better than that.  In the 1970 Budget, he could not estimate the turnover tax but the increased receipts were £3 million. In the 1971 Budget he has put approximately 1.30p on drink.  The Minister says he will get £1 million, but I would say he will get £3 million or £4 million; and spirits will be up £1 million more than he estimated.</P>
    <P>We cannot believe what we hear in this House at all.  The figures are picked out of the air.  There is no proper check.  Every year, taking cost price, the Minister has been wide of his estimate by a couple of hundred per cent. Some months ago a Minister from another Department said on Telefís Éireann that drink could not take any more tax; the licensed trade would charge so much and that would be it. In his Budget speech the Minister said the brewers and distillers had looked for half a new penny and he was giving them .45p.  He said he would round it off to one new penny.  His excuse for this was that you could not charge for a half pint.  The way he put it the public would be led to believe that he was giving the brewers and the distillers something and the retail trade something.  He did not say, however, that the retail price would be increased, as it had to be, because as the cost goes up you must charge at least the cost.  He intimated that the licensed trade were getting something.  While he may have given the people that impression let me say here and now that the trade got nothing whatsoever on beer or stout.  They got one-seventh of a new penny on spirits.  One-seventh of a new penny is not bad, but one-seventh of a new penny on a glass of brandy at 12s 6d or 64p approximately is hardly significant.</P>
    <P>In putting a tax on beer the Minister says he will get £2 million.  If he had left it alone, buoyancy would have given £3.5 million more.  Other countries are running their tourist business on cheap drink and cheap holidays, but the Minister is killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>
    <P>The licensed trade must face this taxation.  While I am not looking for <Col N="74" /> increases in prices we must consider the position of a company in this business who now pay 8 per cent more tax than heretofore.  While everybody else gets an increase in income to meet increases in costs, companies engaged in this business have to face increases without adequate compensation.  I mentioned earlier that a company to succeed must have a very good home market.  Each item more they sell at home reduces the cost of the other items and makes them more competitive on the export market.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one of the major breweries in these islands, with a worldwide reputation, which has contributed in no small measure to the expansion of this country and represents an asset in the region of £7 million or £8 million to our balance of payments &mdash;it could be more now; it was £7 million or £8 million a few years back. Due to economic pressures and the high taxes that have kept sales of their product down here to an extent&mdash;I know sales have increased marginally here each year but in other countries there have been greater increases&mdash; they are now to start another brewery but they are not looking at Ireland, they are looking at England.  They will build it in England.</P>
    <P>The tax on beer here is, I think, 5d more than in England or in the North of Ireland.  This tax is killing a very good brewery or breweries in this country.  I am thinking particularly of one that has always been here.  The Government are taking the cream of all the work of this brewery or these breweries and using it in some bad industries.  They are taking it from a good industry from the point of view of balance of payments and of employment and from people who give a great deal in the way of charity, sponsoring races and things like that.  The Government are taking the cream and the licensed trade and the breweries have ended up as unpaid tax collecting agencies for the State.</P>
    <P>Farming is our main industry; tourism is our second most important industry and the drink trade is the third.  Farming and tourism are subsidised. The drink trade is penalised.  I <Col N="75" /> am speaking for the breweries, not for the licensed trade.  I heard today that we are to give another grant to an industry in Donegal.  That industry was given something like £100,000.  It failed. Another company took it over and got another £75,000 or £100,000.  It failed, and today it is in trouble again.  It is a worldwide company.  A subsidiary of Lever Brothers had it for a period and they failed.  I hope this company will prove viable and I hope the Government are correct.  There is no good in giving money today if a company is liable to go broke in two years time. To hammer a business that makes a lot of money for this country in order to help industries like this is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Tax on drink and tobacco is almost paying the Civil Service.  Perhaps some road tax is added in.  There will be £65 million collected on drink next year.  Since 1964 there have been 13 changes in the price of drink; 88 per cent of the increases have gone directly to the Government with nothing for anybody else.  Ninety per cent of all increases since 1964 up to the introduction of decimalisation went to the Exchequer.  Up to date, the Government took approximately 1s., the brewers got 2.47d and the retail trade got 4.239d, or the Government got 4.8 new pence, the brewers one new penny and the retail trade 1.78 pence. The brewers and the retail trade have had to pay somewhere in the region of a 50 per cent increase in wages since 1964, with much shorter hours, that is £14 to £22 approximately a week with shorter hours.</P>
    <P>The duty collected by the Government on stout, taking Dublin prices, is 1s 9d whereas in 1964 it was 8.69 old pence, on beer it is 1s 7½d, on Irish whiskey it is 3s 9d&mdash;it was 2s 1d approximately in 1964&mdash;on brandy it is now 5s, it was 2s 1d in 1964.</P>
    <P>Our priorities are completely wrong. The Minister did say that he will have to look at taxation again.  Any business person who would take money from a good business and put it into a risky one would be stupid.  This is what we are doing at the moment.  All one has to do is to be a member of <Col N="76" /> Fianna Fáil and he can come along and say he has a client who wants to start a factory that will give employment to 200 people.  He opens with two or three people, gets a Government grant and then goes broke.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the rate of inflation in the last few years I cannot see anybody saving.  I would like to see people saving.  We are told we need £600 million or £800 million per annum invested up to 1980 for full employment.  This is a Government statement so you cannot believe it anyway but it has been made.  Who will save having regard to the rate of inflation we have?  A person would be better off buying a suit, buying a house or buying a piece of land than saving.  We are now paying on borrowed money over £100 million.  That is a little less than one-fifth of our Budget.  No proper business would borrow at that rate.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach calls an election many Ministers will lose their jobs and many Deputies on the hind tit will go.  That is why they are staying in. The only way we can get rid of some of that Government, if not all of them, is to have a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would describe this as a milk and water Budget.  In fact there is more water in it than milk. However, this is not the Budget I had feared so much but part of a series of Budgets we will have before the year is out.  I fear we will have one in the autumn and a few in between, during the summer recess.  I refer to what has happened in past years.  There were increased postal charges from which the Government cleaned up £2 million. That was done during a recess period. I got the information in reply to a question.  It stated that the amount collected in respect of increased postal charges to 31st March was £1.7 million, plus a further sum of £300,000 due by Government Departments. It was amazing to read the Official Reports for last week when we had Deputy de Valera of the Fianna Fáil Party saying this on 18th May:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of this country in <Col N="77" /> general terms are largely contributing to the inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>He is one of the leading lights of Fianna Fáil.  He went on, at column 1859:</P>
    <P>However, if my information is right we are now at the point when there is so much credit taken by the State that there is insufficient credit available to the private sector.</P>
    <P>That is very disturbing but it is time to see Fianna Fáil getting disturbed. This is the situation that this Budget has created or rather not remedied. We have seen the happenings throughout the country during the past year. The first duty of a Government is to govern but the present Government are not able to govern their own party and how then can they hope to govern the country?  When you see such low standards in high places is it any wonder that people cry out?  A leading Fianna Fáil man pulled me up and said: &ldquo;When are you going to get them out&rdquo;?  I looked at him because I did not know what he meant.  &ldquo;Such graft,&rdquo; he said.</P>

      <P>There is so little in this Budget to come to that it is no wonder the youth of the country are growing cynical.  There are banners going up and the youth are prepared to follow any banner.  This is due to lack of Government policy.  Youth today are crushed by taxation.  If they want to build a house they find the cost has increased by £1,000 in the last year or so.  If they put in a few hours overtime the taxman comes along with one hand and the local council come along with another demanding an increase in differential rent.  There is no incentive for youth to put something into the bottom drawer in preparation for the future.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder housewives are getting fed up.  They have no business walking into a shop today unless they have at least £1.  They do not need their shopping bag because they can take out in the heel of their hand what they can buy for £1, but if they have a shopping bag with them they will have to search at the bottom of it.  That is the way I measure this Budget.  I referred earlier to the graft.  It is disgusting. We have been taken over by racketeers and paw-greasers who are able to slip the £100 under the plate at the big dinners, the Taca dinners. I have heard that it has been reduced to a fiver for the small lads, that the big fellows have disappeared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to lack of policy.  When you see rats deserting a ship there is something wrong.  I asked a question last week in relation to my county as to the amounts paid from the Road Fund for 1970-71. The amount collected in my county was £585,391 and the amount paid out in grants by the Government was £548,191, practically £40,000 of a raid by the Government on the Road Fund. We were notified at yesterday's county council meeting that there is a further cut of £25,000.  What has happened to that money?  Has it gone to pay the Tacateers around the country&mdash;has it gone to pay them grants for this and that?  It is about time this was looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the dole cut in the west.  I never held that the dole was the last word but I challenge some members of the Government to go down and live in the west and to leave their cheque books behind them and to see the conditions some of these people are living in.  The people down there never had cheque books.  The unfortunates who were on the dole were those unfit to go to England or who perhaps had to look after aged parents and could not go to Coventry to join brothers or sisters.  I have always considered the dole as a stopgap but before it was taken away something should have been done to provide work for the people.  If some of the Ministers went down to parts of County Galway they would know that there is nothing there but rocks.  The people in those areas have nothing except what they get from England.  It is no wonder that there is a padlock on many of the doors in that area.  It will not help the unfortunate people in that area if the dole <Col N="80" /> is cut off without something more than a few weeks work on the boreens being provided.</P>
    <P>I have known the tactics of Fianna Fáil at election time along the west coast from Donegal to Kerry.  I have known gentlemen who threatened people when they went in to vote that if they did not vote Fianna Fáil and vote out loud the dole would be taken off them.  Will some of those gentlemen now go back to those people and explain why the dole was taken from them?  Those threats were held over those people for years.  Deputies from Donegal and Kerry saw exactly the same thing happening.  If some of our Ministers went back to some of those rocky places in the west I wonder how long they would exist?</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the leader of our party, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, for being brave enough to be ready to take over the ship of State. I must say, however, that he is of the same calibre as his father who took over the ship of State under worse conditions, possibly.</P>
    <P>It is rather strange that there is a cut back in road schemes, drainage, forestry and in expenditure on land with resultant disemployment throughout the west.  The capers of Ministers and ex-Ministers over the last year will have a reaction on tourism.  I see the number of GB registered cars this year compared with the number last year around the west and I hear the people asking what will happen this year. Fewer people are coming to the country this year because of the capers of those Ministers and ex-Ministers during the past year and also because of the increase in the cost of living.  We have empty hotels and this is a sad day for us because so much money has been put into hotel building.</P>
    <P>Every town in this country has a waiting list for houses.  I could spend a long time telling the House about the number of cases in my constituency of five, six and seven persons living in one room.  Something is being done now but it will not compensate us for the loss of houses which should have been built over the years.  The same applies all over the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> Fianna Fáil policy in the past closed down railway lines all over the country. After that they started closing down schools and now the Garda barracks are being closed.  Is that a sign of progress?  Is that not a sign of a shrinking population?  The last things which should be closed are the Garda barracks.  We find the number of gardaí reduced at a time when there was never greater need for law and order in this country.  The Minister for Justice tells us that it would cost too much to increase the Garda force.</P>
    <P>We have no money to extend the electricity scheme to farm houses in the west which can cater for farmhouse holidays.  People have been crying out for years to have their houses wired for electricity.  We are told that they did not sign some years ago when the ESB were canvassing.  If the old people did not sign for electricity at that time it is most unfair that the children should have to pay for the original sin of the parents in not having done so.</P>
    <P>It has been said the people in the west are all living on the dole.  Did the Minister ever go to Galway station and see the 3.50 train departing on a Friday evening with the suitcase brigade on their way to England?</P>

      <P>At the same time I would not like some fellow to put something on the record which is not true.  What this country requires is strong Government.  A few years ago we had Fianna Fáil talking about &ldquo;strong Government&rdquo; but it is a jellyfish Government.  It has a leader who is like a jellyfish among a school of sharks.  What chance has the country got?  By their fruits you shall judge them.  It is a sad day when you see Old Mother Hubbard going to the cupboard and not even a bone for the dog.  That is the position now with Jack or, I should say, Sir, the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a document in which I am interested.  It is a catalogue produced by the liquidators in regard to a firm in the industrial estate.  I do not gloat over things like this.  I know that there are teething difficulties in regard to industries but our town is improving and I do not like to see this sort of thing happening.  It is sad that this is the second industry to fold up in a short period.  Fortunately there were not many employed there.  I hope that some of the big industries will not fold up because it would be a calamity.  If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach wants to say that all is well in the west I will give way to him but <Col N="83" /> he will not say it outside the church door in some of the places to which I would like to invite him.</P>

      <P>I will now come to the main provisions of the Budget many of which are for the less well off sections of the community.  The personal rate of the old age contributory pension has been increased substantially; the old age non-contributory pension has also been increased; the widows contributory pension and non-contributory pension have been increased; the deserted wife's allowance has been increased; the personal and adult dependant rates of disability benefit have been increased, as well as unemployment benefit, the retirement pension and the maternity allowance. Orphans' allowances and unemployment assistance have likewise been increased.  The special needs of widows and deserted wives with dependent children have been the focus, as the Minister said, of a growing measure of public attention in recent years.  The Minister in his wisdom has also decided to improve the benefits in this field.  The Minister has done something which appeals to me particularly and that is that he has substantially improved the position of deserted wives and for the first time he has done something for the unmarried mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer here if I may to the Women's Lib organisation, so much abused by Miss Mary Kenny of the Irish Press.  We did not need an organisation led by her to tell us about our obligations to deserted wives, to the unmarried mother, or to the position of the illegitimate child in our society. There are Deputies on all sides of the House who over the years have spoken forcefully in favour of this deprived section of our community.  When I say &ldquo;deprived&rdquo; I mean that they were deprived at that time but we recognised belatedly or otherwise that we had an obligation to them.  While they are not as well off as we would like <Col N="86" /> them to be they are, nevertheless, less deprived.  We did not have people like Miss Kenny and her friends to tell us what our obligations were in that context.</P>

      <P>I would not like to think I spoke twice.  We do not have to be told of our obligations by this organisation. There are other things in life.  This organisation should concentrate more on the position of widows in our society and on the other sectors of our community whom I have mentioned. I will upset Deputy Tully if I go on.  He is sensitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I live just as well as Deputy Andrews and my morals are as high as his.  The Deputy was attacking someone who is not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not attacking her.  I have said that several times.  I would like to mention the first-class <Col N="88" /> beginning made by our Minister to improve the position of the unmarried mother who undertakes the care of her child.  Under the existing law she did not qualify for the housekeeper's allowance.  The Minister now intends to provide that the allowance will be granted where the mother is engaged in full-time employment and requires the services of a housekeeper.  This is only right.  The Minister is to be congratulated on his approach to the position of these unfortunate women.</P>
      <P>The position of the less well-off members of our society is being looked after.  People criticise the amount of money given in social assistance.  I have listed the social welfare beneficiaries. It is important to mention the classes of persons who have been provided for in this Budget.  One would imagine from listening to various Deputies that nothing was being done for these people.  That is why I listed the various classes of persons who have been given increased allowances. Let us consider the old age contributory pensioner.  His pension will be increased by 50p to £5.50 per week.  We would all like to give £10 per week to each of these people to ensure that they would be well provided for for the rest of their lives. I hope that the day will come when this can be done.  We have to distribute the moneys available as equitably as we can among the less well-off sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This comes under the general umbrella of the new words, &ldquo;the quality of life.&rdquo;  What do we want for our people as a whole?  The expression &ldquo;the quality of life,&rdquo; includes cultural, social and economic well-being.  If we could give extra money to the mentally ill, the deserted wives, unmarried mothers and widows we would be improving their quality of life.  They have a certain quantity at the moment but it is also quality they are entitled to.  In a suburban constituency such as the one I come from we find in a number of instances, widows living on the State basically and having, in the main, to eke out a fairly tough existence having regard to the amount of money they are receiving at this particular point in time.  Added to what <Col N="89" /> they get from the State we must take into account other fringe benefits for certain sections like free electricity, free television licences, and so on. But this is just not good enough.  This is not what we want.  If we give people £5 a week and all the other little bits and pieces, they are still eking out an existence.  We just cannot sit back and say we are satisfied with that.  If we are not satisfied with all the benefits in this Budget, we hope that we can recognise here an awareness of the fact that we want to ensure that this type of person is looked after by the State.</P>
    <P>This is what I mean by a quality of life.  Is a widow not entitled to enjoy the cinema or the theatre or whatever recreational facilities are available, and they are few except for those provided by voluntary organisations?  I should like to pay a particular tribute to the voluntary organisations who help the aged, the mentally handicapped and the less well-off sections of our community. If we did not have these voluntary organisations assisting us, I imagine that the whole structure would collapse, or almost collapse.  They are doing a magnificent job all over the country.  We must keep the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in mind.  They do it for nothing.  Perhaps many of them do not want recognition but they should be recognised for the work they do for and on behalf of the community.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the point I was making about the widow or the less well-off member of the community. Is she less entitled to enjoy the amenities which are available, limited though they are?  She is entitled to enjoy whatever amenities are available. She is entitled to them free.  I would urge on the Minister when he is introducing his Budget next year to try to extend these amenities to her.  Deputy de Valera spoke about the free gift philosophy.  I agree with him when he says that is a wrong philosophy for those people who are well able to manage for themselves but still put the hand out.  That is what I imagine Deputy de Valera means by the free gift philosophy.  I do not want to suggest that I am encouraging the free gift philosophy but I would ask the Minister to consider the position of the <Col N="90" /> aged, the mentally handicapped, and so on, and to provide them with free access to cinemas, and so on.  I know that certain concessions are given very decently by the owners of the cinemas but I wonder could the Minister extend the concept of free electricity and free television licences even to some small degree to ensure that these people have some peace of mind.</P>
    <P>They have given their lives to the service of the nation no matter at what level of society they worked, be it as a labourer brushing the streets or at the top of a department store empire.  In their own way they deserve the dignity of the office they hold.  This is the sort of society towards which I should like to move, a type of classless society in that context of class: the breaking down of class barriers.  This is what I should like to see and we could bring about that situation if people were made to integrate more because the people I am speaking about, the social security classes cannot integrate by virtue of the fact that they just have not got the cash.  It is a tragedy of life that basically society depends upon money.  Perhaps some time somebody will try to think of some way of running society other than with money. It is a pity that it should be money, but it is.  That is the reality of life and that is why we have annual budgets in this State and in any other State in the world.</P>
    <P>I should like to leave that subject now and come to the question of the EEC.  This has been well covered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs but, listening to some, you would imagine that the Minister has given no information in relation to his involvement in our negotiations to become a member of the Six, or the Ten as it will be then. I should like to pay tribute to the amount of literature that has been forthcoming from the Department of Foreign Affairs on the subject of the EEC.  Anyone who has any interest in the Common Market will appreciate the type of information that has been forthcoming from the Department and the Minister.  The Minister makes many speeches on it and he is good enough to issue his Press releases to, I presume, all Deputies from all <Col N="91" /> parties.  If you have a function to cover on a particular night and you want to speak in the context of the EEC, there is no easier place to go to than the Department of Foreign Affairs which has a special section dealing with the EEC.  You can get any amount of literature there that you require. This might give the lie to those people who suggest that information on the progress of our negotiations for final entry into the EEC is not forthcoming. It is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of other points that could be made. There is an over-emphasis on the economic value to our nation of entry into the EEC.  The economic aspect is most important&mdash;but we must also consider the cultural value and the social advantages to our nation on our entry into the EEC.  We are exposing ourselves to a vast Continent of people.  Those of us who have had the privilege of visiting France on quite a number of occasions, either in connection with our Parliamentary duties or otherwise, will appreciate the wide variety of opportunities for cultural advantage to our nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of Paris.  If we had this movement of people, for example, between Paris and Dublin, our people and the people of France would benefit.  Sufficient emphasis has not been put on this aspect of our entry into the EEC.  I accept that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is correct in his approach that economic well-being is one of the main considerations, if not the main consideration, in relation to our entry into Europe.  The advantages in the abolition of boundaries between France, to some extent Germany, and the other countries who are members of the EEC should be emphasised.</P>
      <P>In regard to our fisheries policy&mdash;this answers the suggestions of Deputy Corish and Deputy Tully that the Government are putting out propaganda&mdash; the Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed emphatically his fears for us under the fisheries policy of the EEC. He has spelt out fairly and honestly that he has tough negotiations to conduct to ensure that our fishing industry is protected within the limitations imposed on any negotiator under the terms of the Treaty of Rome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is telling the truth and I know that he is negotiating very hard in relation to the protection of our fisheries.  I represent an area which has a substantial fishing fleet.  I have mentioned on many occasions the progress made by the fishing fleet at Dún Laoghaire and the fears of the people there in the context of the fishing policy of the EEC.  I have spoken with the people concerned on a number of occasions and I share their fears, which are quite clear and valid.  A message should go from this House that we will do everything possible to ensure that their fears will be allayed. I do not wish to say more on this matter at this point because I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not yet completed his talks and that he will continue to negotiate and drive a hard bargain for our fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that might be mentioned in the context of the Minister's Budget Statement is the national pay agreement.  The Minister stated quite rightly that this has been a step forward in the containment of the monster of inflation and that it is also a major step forward in the field of employer/ employee relations.  With all other Deputies, I appeal to all to ensure that the terms of this agreement are adhered to.  At this moment we are going through a difficult situation.  If we <Col N="94" /> can maintain, as the Minister urges, the national pay agreement we will contribute somewhat to curtailing the inflationary situation.  The Minister has also stated that we can expect an increase to some degree in our growth rate in the coming year and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with social welfare matters.  May I mention that to me the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is anathema and brings to mind the middle of the 19th century.  I would urge the Minister for Finance to suggest to the Minister for Labour and Social Welfare that it might be a good idea to follow the example given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs who recently changed the title of his office. Instead of a Minister for Social Welfare we might have a Minister for Social Security.  When we provide people with their entitlement it should be for their security.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister who is present now for introducing a Budget with a social conscience which is held high in the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget has been presented in a year of tremendous inflation.  Today in reply to a question I was told that between February, 1970 and February, 1971 the consumer price index rose by 10 per cent.  This is an astonishing figure and it is most unfortunate for the poorer sections of the community in particular. Anybody depending on a fixed income would have to rely to a large extent on money sent from abroad.  The increases in social welfare benefits will be more than offset by price increases.  This inflation is continuous and has been accelerated during the past year.  I expect that when the figures are published for the period since the change over to decimal currency, they will indicate yet another increase in the consumer price index.  In spite of all this the increases to recipients of social welfare assistance will not be applicable until 1st August while the increases in benefits under the insurance schemes will not apply until 1st October. In effect, the increases given will <Col N="95" /> merely allow the recipients to maintain their present meagre income.  Inflation is eating up our economy and eroding the gross national product.</P>
      <P>It is important that parity of pensions be established for all State and semi-State employees, in particular gardaí and teachers.  The sooner this parity is established, the better.  I am not satisfied either with the military service pension.  This is far too meagre.  The position in relation to widows or recipients of old IRA pensions is ludicrous.  I quote from the Minister's Budget speech as reported at column 708 of the Dáil Debates for the 28th April:</P>
      <P>I have decided, therefore, that the widow of such a pensioner will be eligible to receive a pension equal to half her husband's pension subject to a minimum of £1 a week.</P>
      <P>What a life any woman would have on £1 a week.  It is disgraceful even to mention such a figure.  Who could survive on that amount?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the businessman in our society.  He, too, is affected by the high rate of inflation. Perhaps the businessman of today, by reason of wholesale and turnover tax, is the major tax collector for the Government.  A limited company are subject to a tax of 58 per <Col N="96" /> cent on their profits.  This rate is atrociously high especially when we consider that our unemployment figure stands at more than 70,000.  Instead of businesses being helped to expand and provide employment, this tax will hamper them.  This increase was the most unjustifiable increase that could have been imposed.  A company need profits to plough back into the business.  They need profits in order to modernise and be in a position to face great competition, whether within the EEC or otherwise.  Obviously the Minister does not understand this.  Increases in wages and in overheads are putting some businesses out of existence.  Exports should be encouraged by some type of relief to exporters.  This might be done, for example, by way of low rate borrowing through the banks or by reliefs of taxation.  We must increase exports.  The recent figures in relation to foreign trade give cause for much alarm.  Our balance of trade gap is widening again and could very well lead to a balance of payments deficit this year that would be in the region of £90 million.  A country with a balance of payments deficit of that extent could not carry on, especially after deficits of more than £60 millions in two consecutive years.</P>
    <P>The Government appear to be disinterested in the whole problem of exports and in helping exports.  They should do everything possible to help exporters and, in particular, the old established firms who have given employment in this country for a long time but who now are finding it very difficult to survive because of unit costs that have increased at a faster rate than has been the case in England and in most of the EEC countries.  Unless we can come to terms with the problem we shall price ourselves out of our export markets.  The result of that would be massive unemployment&mdash; unemployment that would increase the present level to, perhaps, 140,000 people.</P>
    <P>When I heard that the consumer price index showed an increase of 10 per cent the first thought that occurred to me was that nobody in his right senses would invest in fixed interest securities.  In the case of the national loan, the dividend is 9½ per cent but <Col N="97" /> with a rate of inflation of 10 per cent, not only does the investor lose on his capital but the income from the investments is insignificant when related to increases in prices.  Nobody in his right mind would invest in national loans because he can get better returns by buying property and, perhaps, this will have a very significant part to play this year when the Government look for money from the Irish people.  They may not invest; they may invest elsewhere. The Government appear to be disinterested in this aspect of getting funds.</P>
    <P>The bank strike had a disastrous effect on business people.  It led, and will yet lead to a large number of closures of good firms giving solid employment.  Because of the bank strike, because the whole matter of trade credit is now in question there may be a large number of closures.  I hope there are not, but if there are, the responsibility lies on the Government. There is no point in blaming anything else except their mismanagement of the economy, not so much in 1970, but since 1967.  We cannot again have a bank strike; we must not have one.  The fact that the Government allowed it to go on for so long and did nothing to resolve it or prevent it reflects very badly on the whole Cabinet and especially on the Taoiseach. It has done irreparable harm to the country.  Some time ago I advocated that there should be a 60-day cooling off period in essential industries, such a period to be ordered by the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>This was pooh-poohed by the Minister for Labour.  This works in America.  It may not be the full solution to an industrial dispute&mdash;I doubt if it is&mdash;but it allows a certain time in which negotiations between the parties may take place and gives mediators an opportunity to come to some conclusion which will result in a peaceful solution.  I here and now advocate this 60-day cooling off period for essential industries.  Whatever happens we must never again have a bank strike.  Strikes in general are a sad fact of life in Ireland, especially in the past few years.  I do not blame any one party; it is just a fact of life.  I think the main <Col N="98" /> cause has been the terrible inflation which, as far as I can see, has been encouraged by the Fianna Fáil Government; certainly, they have done very little to stop it.  The worker has a right to organise in trade unions; he has a right to strike.  I appeal to unions to restrain themselves where at all possible and, if necessary, put the interests of the country before their own interests however just these may be.</P>
    <P>I advocate a system of employment contracts over, say, two year periods, which will allow for greater security of employment for workers and will give employers a period in which they know what their wage costs will be. It would be a positive step forward in the field of industrial relations to have something like this.</P>
    <P>Personally, I was appalled by the decision on the dole.  It was not a mistake, as was pointed out by Deputy O'Higgins in his speech on the Budget. Its deletion was in the Book of Estimates. It was not a mistake of civil servants.  It was an attempt by the Government to force an issue which is most unjustified and certainly most unpopular.</P>
    <P>I have my own views on this.  I feel that an ordinary person is not in favour of giving money to wasters. The ordinary person working for a living or running a business does not favour money for wasters by way of the dole but no attempt has been made to segregate wasters from people who cannot find work or are unable to work or people slightly handicapped and living with a relative or relatives and whose only source of income is the dole.  The employment period order made no attempt to distinguish between such people.  The Minister did make a change in that he allowed people over 50 to get the dole again but there was no attempt to segregate the people who want to work and cannot get work or are unable to work from those who do not want to work and would not work.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any valid reason for distinguishing between rural and urban workers in this matter if it is properly operated.  People in places like Waterford can be just as poor as people in the west.  Apparently, the Minister does <Col N="99" /> not want to realise that.  The whole episode was in very bad taste and reflects sadly on the Fianna Fáil Government and Party which is supposed to be the party of reality.  The whole issue shook them because two of their members abstained and one voted against the proposition.  I wonder what disciplinary measures were taken against the two who abstained.  The Taoiseach said that he would deal with the matter in his own good time.  I think he said that about every important problem facing the country.  I wonder when that time will come.  Perhaps when he is in opposition.</P>
    <P>As regards the farming community, the milk price increases are so fractional that the Minister had to try to hide them in the guise of old pennies and new pennies.  The rate for the first 7,000 gallons went from 11 old pennies to five new pennies.  I do not know why the prices were not given in terms of new pennies all through.  In fact, the first 7,000 gallons will get an increase of one old penny which is less than half a new penny.  This marginal increase will only accelerate the number of farmers leaving the land.  This is already reflected in the fact that there are no stocks of butter available for export.</P>
    <P>The Government's agricultural policy has been proved to be very bad.  In the early sixties the Government told farmers to go into milk and this they did. Farmers spent thousands of pounds setting up milk parlours, but it has now been decided that milk is not the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; and farmers who now find milk is unprofitable are switching back to beef.  The reason for the change in Government policy in relation to milk was the oversupply of milk on international markets, but we now learn that milk is not oversupplied in either the EEC or Britain.  I do not know how the Government will be able to switch policy in mid-stream and encourage farmers to go back to milk but certainly one old penny will not encourage them to do so.</P>

If we are to save our fishing industry it may be necessary to retain the 12 mile limit with regard to fishing.  It is essential before we go into the EEC that we lay down a proper conservation policy and a proposed regional policy.  What are the Government doing?  They are doing nothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also necessary to check on technical regulations but apparently the Government are not interested.  The present policy of the EEC in relation to fishing allows for free access to all fishing grounds.  The Community do not want any applicant country to try to change that policy until they are members.  I submit it may be too high a price to pay.  It is now we should be laying down conservation policies and regional policies and we must drive a hard bargain if we are to go into the EEC.</P>
      <P>In relation to our application to join the EEC the Government keep saying that the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party are divided on the issue, but what if we are divided on the issue?  What if the Labour Party recommends to its supporters that EEC is not good for Ireland and the Fine Gael Party recommends to its supporters that the EEC is good for Ireland? The fact is there must be a referendum before we can join the EEC.  It is up to the people to decide whether or not we go into the EEC; it is not the decision of any one political party.  I do not see how that argument holds any merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lack of housing in urban areas is <Col N="102" /> at a crisis level and Waterford city is a very good example.  The number of corporation houses completed and available for letting in 1968-69 was 72; in 1969-70 it was 67 and in 1970-71 it was nil.  No houses were completed in a city chosen by the Government to be a growth centre.  How can there be a growth centre in Waterford if houses for workers are not being built? Time and again I have heard people in England saying &ldquo;I would come back and work in Waterford if I could get a house&rdquo;.  The sad fact is that there are no houses available in Waterford. There are 15, 16 and 17 people living in the same house; families with five and six children are living in overcrowded conditions and families with two and three children are living in two-roomed flats.  This great Government Party are giving the people plenty of talk and many White Papers but they are not giving them houses.  From January, 1969, to May, 1971, the number of people living in overcrowded or unfit housing conditions jumped from 389 to 468.  These figures would be much worse but for the private builder who has built quite a number of houses in Waterford.  The cost of these houses is beyond the capacity of the ordinary worker to pay but he is forced to buy them.  I know workers who have bought such houses and I wonder will they&mdash;I hope they will&mdash;be able to meet the payments. It is very sad for me as a public representative and a member of Waterford Corporation to have a steady stream of people coming to me looking for houses.  It is a crying shame that they should have to do so and the Government must bear full responsibility for this position.  There was a scheme of 180 houses ready to be started in 1969 but the Department of Local Government dragged their heels and it is only now that the scheme is commencing.  In four years no houses were built.  This was disgraceful.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the speech made by the Taoiseach over the weekend.  It is reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 24th May.  He was Honest enough to admit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Over the past year the country experienced severe economic difficulties <Col N="103" /> in the form of strikes and inflationary rises in prices and costs.</P>
    <P>Of course, what we all hear in this House is that everything is under control. There is no crisis, no problem. What split?  The Taoiseach referred to the Fine Gael Ard Fheis:</P>
    <P>At the Party Ard Fheis it ensured that a firm decision was reached on nothing.  The reference back to the Party's executive of decisions on important issues had, of course, a nummer of advantages.  It concealed the depth of division within Fine Gael on practically every important policy issue.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is the last man who should refer to party splits, or differences, or divisions.  He is supported by the votes of dissidents who have not the courage to unseat him and he himself has not the courage to tell them to get out of the party.  It is from this the country is suffering.  We have, as a result, a very second class Cabinet. Indeed, I doubt if the Cabinet are controlling the country.  I believe the civil servants have had to come in and manage the affairs of State.  I cannot understand how the Taoiseach could even bear to mention divisions.  There are long knives behind his back, ready to be unsheathed.  What discipline did he bring to bear on the members of his party who abstained from voting on the dole issue?  Had he been a strong leader they would have been out of the party and that would be that.  The fact is Fianna Fáil have not got a strong leader.</P>
    <P>Prices are out of hand.  Inflation possesses the country.  The Government have been unable and, indeed, unwilling to tackle this problem for the past few years, despite the continuous advice from reputable people.  The Government have either been unwilling or unable to follow that advice.  There is no longer any national pride in our country.  The people have lost their pride in Parliament.  They have lost their respect for the Members of this House.  This is the result of certain events in the past.  It is time we had an election, cleared the air and cleared Fianna Fáil out of office.  Let Fine Gael, an honest Government, take over <Col N="104" /> and let us have a competent Government.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to extend the health services to farmers and others in the middle income group.  I shall be very interested in the actual scheme.  I am very dubious about it.  The health services need radical improvement to cater properly for the people.  I hope the regional health boards will do something practicable because very little has been done up to this.  A great deal has been said but very little has been done to improve the health services.</P>
    <P>What will be the overall effect of this Budget?  Will it help to make Ireland a better place in which to live? I am very doubtful that it will.  Will it create an atmosphere favourable to industrial, commercial and agricultural expansion?  Again, I am very doubtful that it will.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that this Budget will do harm. The 58 per cent taxation on company profits is very disturbing.  What does this Budget do to combat inflation? Nothing at all.  The Government are not capable of solving the problems facing the country.  They have not got the ability within the Cabinet to face up to the problems confronting the country.  The ordinary man in the street is very upset about the Government and about the role of Dáil Eireann. It is the duty of the Government now to seek a mandate from the people, to go into opposition as a result of that mandate and, in opposition, get rid of its boils and blisters and the malignant growths within itself. It is time for an election and the sooner we have one the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget is not a true picture of what is happening.  It is not a true picture of the state of the country.  We have a widening trade gap, galloping inflation, rising unemployment as a result of Government mismanagement, and worse, dishonest management for party reasons.  Those of us who are experienced in political life know that the purpose of this Budget is merely to tide the Government over; we will have another Budget later in the year, if Fianna Fáil are still in office.  Nobody need have <Col N="105" /> any doubt about that, not even the Government themselves.  Even the Minister for Finance, the man who framed the Budget, is well aware that, if he is still in office, before the year ends he will introduce another Budget and he will increase the size of the blister he has raised in this one before the end of the year.  This is a dishonest practice.  The problems of budgeting should be tackled at Budget time only. Otherwise the Budget is a confidence trick on the people.  This Budget is the greatest confidence trick on the Irish people since Paul Singer.  The people have no trust whatever in the Government. They know them for what they are.  They have given bad example. One of the worst aspects of their handling of affairs is the way the law is being brought into disrepute, with people committing offences and being sure that nothing will happen them, that they will walk out of the court free.</P>
      <P>When the Government were elected the majority of the people said: &ldquo;No matter what we think or say about them they will give us stable government.&rdquo; Now the people have found them out and if there was an election tomorrow the Fianna Fáil Party would be &ldquo;also rans&rdquo;.  They have been 30 or 40 years in office.  They have had every opportunity to give this country good government and they have failed. This Budget will result in barely enough money being collected to tide them over for a few months until they impose the second Budget.</P>
      <P>Inflation is galloping.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said a while ago that the Government have raised the allowances to widows, old age pensioners and other social welfare beneficiaries.  The increases given will not be sufficient to meet the increased cost of living.  The cost of the loaf increased by over 12 per cent. The cost of running a car increased by 24 per cent last year.  Telephone rentals increased substantially.  Bus and rail fares increased by 23 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything the Government ever gave, the dole, every carrot they ever hung in front of the people was given for one purpose only and that was to get votes.  They went around the <Col N="106" /> country and said: &ldquo;We will give you an increase in the dole, an increase in your pensions.  If we are put out of office you will never get those increases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A recent investigation by the Consumers Association has revealed an increase of 20 per cent on essential goods.  Is it not time to peg prices down so that people will be able to buy what they need without increases in social welfare which are eroded by inflation?</P>
    <P>What has this Budget done for tourism? Everyone associated with the tourist industry is aware that tourist bookings this year are considerably reduced.  I would not blame tourists for that because rising costs here have made our competitors more attractive. One would have thought that the Government would make a special effort, through publicity and otherwise, to recover last year's losses.  I know one hotelier who has cut his tariff by 25 per cent for the month of June in order to keep his hotel full and to keep his staff employed.  Tourism is our most important industry and has helped the economy considerably over the years.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money is poured into semi-State bodies, but these organisations can refuse to give any account of how this money is spent.  The Government should ensure that any money that is handed out by the State will be the subject of discussion in this House. This is the only country in the world which does not question how this money is spent.  In answer to a question recently the Minister for Finance told us about the importation of transparent sheets.  It was very difficult to find out from him who was allowed to import these sheets.</P>

That man had four vans and four loudspeakers out in the Kildare by-election.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is looking at me.  It was only right to give him a permit to bring in these sheets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> As far as I can see, only one provision was increased in the Budget. That is the £3,500 extra given to the Secret Service.  That could be money well spent.  If it had been given last year we might know more about the arms and other things that came into the country and who was responsible. That increase was necessary but I do not think even that will help too much.</P>
    <P>What have we done for the Irish Army over the years?  What has been done for them in this Budget?  Have they ever been put in a position to defend this country?  We have had the Republican Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, in office for many years.  What have they done to strengthen our Army or to build it up?</P>

      <P>I had not mentioned figures even.  In deference to your wishes I will leave it but everyone knows about it and there is no need for me to say an awful lot about it.</P>
      <P>One of our most important industries is the dead meat industry.  There is a large amount of money and a large number of people involved in it. What has been done for it in this Budget?  The beef, mutton and lamb export supports have been cut by £1,350,000 at a time when our competitors in the north of Ireland and elsewhere are getting supports to enable them to beat us on the market.  This is one market where we could stand up to any fair competition.  People concerned with the dead meat trade have made their feelings known through the public Press and at meetings. Whatever they say about Deputy Blaney, when he was in office he provided money for agricultural export supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget made no provision for the eradication of warble fly.  We spent <Col N="109" /> millions of pounds on this and before we could finish off the job the Government cut down the grants.  Last year several herds of cattle were re-infected. If the eradication scheme had continued for another year we would have rid the country of this pest and we would have increased the value of our cattle and hides very considerably. I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary present to take a look at agricultural supports and out of the millions to provide something to finish off the warble fly.</P>
    <P>The provision for the purchase of land has been reduced considerably. While we often blame the Land Commission, they have done a fairly good job and I would say they have been reasonable with the people.  It is bad business to reduce that allocation.  It will affect forestry and it will affect employment in forestry which has been reduced considerably in the last few months.  It will affect the transfer of land to applicants who have been awaiting it for many years.  This is saving money in the wrong direction. In the Forestry Division many men have not been taken back for spring work and many of them are in a very bad way.  The amount for rural and urban schemes has been reduced by £28,500. Those schemes gave work during the winter when employment was not plentiful. They did a lot of good work in rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>It would be a great day for this country if we had only one Budget in the year, if people knew exactly where they stood and what they were facing at the beginning of the year.  Therefore, I hope this Government, or whichever Government are there in the future, will see to it that we get one Budget each year like in every other country so that we will be able to anticipate what will happen during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The reaction I have found to this Budget is something similar to that of Deputy O'Sullivan. The question everybody has been asking throughout Cork city and county is whether this is a balanced Budget, whether it is a Budget which will arrange the financial position of <Col N="110" /> the country for the current year.  When one goes over past figures one wonders at what stage do we prepare our annual national Budget.  We have been finding price increases, cost of living increases, proceeding remorselessly the whole year round.  Last year was a classical example of this and people are a bit suspicious of this year's Budget.</P>
      <P>We must all concede that any Minister for Finance charged with the responsibility of budgeting for a year ahead has a difficult task.  He has a difficult job for the weeks and months preceding the introduction of the annual Budget.  This takes up a lot of the Minister's time and that of his officials. The person responsible for preparing the annual Budget has to look at the economic situation and this is the target to be aimed at by the Minister for Finance and his officials.</P>
      <P>We have been saying on this side of the House that a situation has been developing through which there is an ever-widening gap between rich and poor, with the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer.  In my humble opinion, the whole system is wrong and although I do not intend to delay the House too long and do not like to repeat what other Deputies have said, there is one aspect which bears repetition.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and I are members of Cork County Council.  This year when our annual estimates came up we deferred consideration of them because we had not been informed by the Minister for Local Government of the allocation from the Road Fund for the current year.  We had reached the last day before we had to strike the rate.  The county manager and his officials and Members of the Oireachtas who are also members of the Cork County Council had made a representations to the Minister to notify the council of the amount to be given for the upkeep of our county roads.  Despite repeated representations we were left in a situation where we had to estimate in anticipation that the grant from the Road Fund would be the same as last year.  We budgeted on that basis and the rate was struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> Three weeks later, because of the bad news he had, the Minister for Local Government informed the council of a reduction of £88,600.  Two years ago, against a background of rising costs, rising wages, rising prices of materials, the road grant to Cork was reduced by £100,000.  I realise that in the serious economic position we find ourselves at the present time, retrenchment is necessary.  We have a situation now where because we have not sufficient money the engineers and the county manager in Cork will have to go back and prepare their figures again because their original figures were in anticipation of the amount being the same as last year.  There is such an appalling lack of communication and such a dictatorial attitude in the Custom House that in Cork we are now faced with the task of informing 40 or 50 road workers that they are to become redundant because the Road Fund allocation is not sufficient to pay them.</P>
    <P>This is what gives me such a feeling of frustration.  When it is necessary to have retrenchment because of a bad economic crisis it is the lowest paid, the poor, the defenceless, who have to pay the piper.  We have an economic crisis brought about by years of Government mismanagement but it is poor people who have given as long as 25 years of service to the local authorities on the roads who will become redundant and accordingly suffer.  If it is necessary to have retrenchment because of economic crisis the people who should be protected are those who are least able to bear the economic situation.</P>
    <P>At this stage, one must agree that a tightening of belts is necessary, that a tightening up of expenditure is necessary, but in the process one should look up through the strata of society, above the road worker who has to exist on such a small wage.  In the concluding portion of his Budget Statement the Minister said this Budget was an effort to stem inflation.  There is nothing in it that will in any way deflate the economy.  In this situation, if one agrees that retrenchment is necessary one will have to look at other <Col N="112" /> levels of society through which to economise.</P>
    <P>If the economic situation is as serious as we are led to believe&mdash;we have seen the danger signals&mdash;we must ask ourselves can we afford the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Can we not economise at this level?  In such a situation can we afford 144 Dáil Deputies and 60 Members of the Seanad?  Can we afford the number of Ministers we have?  Can we afford the number of Parliamentary Secretaries?  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments have increased the number of Parliamentary Secretaries.  There seems to be no control. It is here we must look if there must be economies.  If we have to cheesepare let us not do it at the expense of the defenceless, of the poorer sections of our people.</P>
    <P>We have been behaving as if we were in a capitalist society and that is why I feel strongly when no evident effort is being made for the security of the people who are the backbone of the country, the working people.  In my opinion, when you find a serious situation like that which exists now it is a terrible state of affairs to render workers redundant.  None of them wants to register at labour exchanges or to draw unemployment benefit or assistance.  Those people prefer to work and we should do everything we can to ensure that work will be provided for them.  We have paid quite a lot of lip service in this House to the problems in rural Ireland.  We talk about the manner in which it has been denuded of its population.  Despite this we do nothing to ensure that sufficient work is provided to encourage those people to remain at home.</P>
    <P>There was quite a lot of talk during conservation year about conserving our beauty spots and our scenic spots along the coast and in the remote parts of rural Ireland.  The best way to preserve our beauty spots and beautify our countryside is to keep the population there and to provide work for them. The Government throughout the long number of years they have been in office have done very little, in my opinion, to preserve the population in rural Ireland.  If social and economic life in the remote parts of the country <Col N="113" /> are to be encouraged a certain density of population is needed.  Typical of that situation is the position in relation to the road workers.</P>
    <P>In 1965 there was a forestry labour force of 6,800 and in 1971 approximately 3,800 forestry workers are employed.  The only thing the Government did to try to maintain the population in rural Ireland was to provide the dole for them.  The dole is demoralising to many of our small farmers but we have to have it until such time as we provide work for those people who are the most hard working section of the people.  When you have people waiting each week for unemployment assistance and when this continues on into the rising generation I am afraid we are killing initiative.  The situation will become very serious if we do not provide employment for those people.</P>
    <P>I believe we have not made the most out of afforestation.  We should have had a more intensive afforestation drive.  Anybody who travels in the west of Ireland from Kerry to Donegal will find that there are vast tracts of land suitable for nothing else.  What is happening?  The Forestry Division of the Department of Lands acquire land for afforestation which should be divided up among smallholders to give them viable holdings.  Representations are repeatedly made by public representatives to have this land handed over to the Land Commission for the benefit of the local people but the Forestry Division continue to plant that area.</P>
    <P>The whole system is crazy.  This Government, because of their long years in office, have become immune to criticism.  It is high time we had a change of Government.  Because the Government are in office for so long I believe we are in a very serious economic situation.  We should be making the necessary preparation for what will be the greatest challenge this country has ever faced, our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to agriculture. The Minister in his Budget speech said that increased concessions were being given to the farming community. Many Deputies in this House <Col N="114" /> have tabled questions in relation to farm incomes and the answer we get from Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries, both the present Minister and former Ministers, is that the Exchequer is now called upon to pay to the tune of over £100 million to agriculture.  I do not know whether the rules of this House will allow me to go into detail in regard to expenditure in relation to agriculture but I think that the people who are called on to pay taxes should be told what way the money is spent by the Government.  There is a belief, because of the situation created by the Government, that the people who are engaged in agriculture are parasites, that they are living on the backs of the taxpayers.  Every year there is an increase in income tax, beer and cigarettes and the town and city people think that the money is for the farming community alone.  I should like a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to be honest and state the amount of State aid paid to the farming community.</P>
    <P>A committee was set up a few years ago to examine State aid in relation to agriculture.  They claimed that the money spent directly in relation to agriculture was £46 million, not the £100 million claimed by the Government. They went further and stated that there were even hidden subsidies for the consumer and charges made to the farming community which should be included in Education, Industry and Commerce and in other Departments.  This is a very serious situation.  We are too small a nation to create divisions between town and country.</P>
    <P>We should examine the contribution which the farming community are making in relation to the gross national product, employment, our export trade, which is our greatest earner of foreign currency, and the number of people who are indirectly employed because of the agricultural community. The farming community and particularly the dairy farmers of this country have their incomes eroded.  It is, therefore, a tragedy they are not united because they are not in a position to exert the pressure necessary to get anything from the Government.</P>
    <P>We had a situation in which an order <Col N="115" /> was made by the Government.  A few backbenchers in the Fianna Fáil Party, as well as a few local cumainn throughout the country, were able to bring enough pressure to bear on the Government to reverse the decision made at Government level.  This shows they are a Government from whom you can get nothing unless you bring the necessary pressure to bear on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs told us that in 18 months time we will be members of the EEC.  Is Dr. Hillery or the Government satisfied that we are ready for this great step, particularly in relation to agriculture?  This is the only section we can benefit from within the Common Market.  There are disadvantages and problems in joining but there is nothing being done in relation to those disadvantages and those problems.  Have we geared ourselves to meet the competition which we will meet in much more sophisticated markets in Europe?  Have we done everything possible to rationalise and modernise our creameries, our processing plants and our transport?  The farming community have, against almost impossible odds, made efforts to modernise and become much more efficient.</P>
    <P>We hear the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries talking about the concept of group farming.  Of course this is something about which you can talk here or at cumainn dinners but then do nothing about it.  The Minister says that group farming is necessary and, even though some people regard it as an alien concept, the farmers are now prepared to take a new look at this concept.  I know two dairy farmers who grouped together and sent their milk to the creamery.  The Minister felt that this was a good start, that it was giving an example and it was approved by the agricultural advisory service but the Minister also said that the phased increase in the price of milk applied to them.  This means that the more milk they produce the less they will get. This is a backward step and is militating against quality and efficiency.  We should stop talking about this sort of thing and instead we should have more action.  We have been talking about the rationalisation of the creamery industry <Col N="116" /> since 1960 and in all we have had about five reports on the matter.  If it takes ten years to rationalise this industry and to take action which is very necessary we will become the lame duck of Europe and neither the farming community nor anybody else will benefit from membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>We have a very serious situation in regard to our economy for three main reasons: over-taxation, rapid inflation and the highest unemployment figure ever.  Any one of these ailments would be serious but when the three are combined and when you have a divided Government then the situation becomes particularly serious.  The inter-Party Government introduced certain inducements to attract foreign investment and foreign industrialists, particularly to rural Ireland, but the high cost of living and the over-taxation of the personnel involved are nullifying those inducements.  Nothing is being done about this.  Nobody can deny that a number of factories are closing down and that more and more workers are either going on short-time or are becoming redundant.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said that the Budget was a Budget with a social conscience and he outlined the concessions given to those in receipt of social welfare benefits. The non-contributory old age pension today is £4.65.  Can anyone imagine a person being able to live on less than £5 a week in view of the high prices of food, clothes, coal and all the necessaries of life?  Here we have an example of the penny-wise pound-foolish policy of the Government. What happens is that these people become destitute, particularly those living on their own; they begin to suffer from malnutrition and they are moved into a hospital or a home and become a charge on the rate to the tune of £10 or £12 a week.  The Government cannot see that if extra money was provided for them they would be encouraged to stay at home.  Indeed, I should like to pay a special tribute to the voluntary organisations who look after the aged, the infirm, the poor and those in need of assistance.  I know many people in my own area, professional people and others, who give their time, even on Sundays, to do <Col N="117" /> such laudable work as providing meals-on-wheels in order to assist the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House believe that there is no alternative to consulting the people at this point in time.  The Taoiseach should dissolve the Dáil and let the people decide. When the Minister is replying to this debate will he tell us if the value added tax will apply to the livestock trade, the marts and the farming community in general?  I hope that before any action like that is taken there will be consultation with the farming organisations because they are the people who are aware of the problems. If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries had taken advice from them he would be far better off than he is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which can be said about this Budget is that it does not give too much and it does not take away too much, or certainly not obviously so.  During the past year the anticipated growth rate was not realised and reached only 1½ per cent. This indicates that the policies which are being pursued are not adequate enough and have not got the necessary impetus to bring our economy to the required level and to provide full employment, Our economic difficulties over the past few years have been such that we have failed to achieve our national targets and this is a matter of concern.  Industrial output has shown only a very small increase and this I suppose is mainly due to dislocation caused by strikes.  That would be a contributing factor.  It is something to which the Government and the Department of Labour could direct more attention.  If we cannot solve the problems which are causing disruption in the industrial sphere we cannot hope to go into Europe with the objective of achieving a standard of living comparable to that among the other members of the EEC.  That tendency in people who should be led by their unions, who should be advised by the people assigned to the different unions, is a cause of great concern to our people.  Unofficial strikes have caused hardship to more homes than any other cause.  The Department of <Col N="118" /> Labour or any Department responsible for the unions should definitely do some research and attempt to remove this problem.  In County Clare the relationship between management and worker is excellent.  Clare can boast of being a practically strike-free county.  This is because of the proper approach by management to their workers and because of the proper understanding between trade union officials and those who deal with labour relations.</P>
      <P>The Votes for the different Departments can only be judged by the achievements that will be shown in the forthcoming 12 months.  It is obvious that the policies being pursued over recent years have not brought great prosperity to the less fortunate people in the remote areas of Clare.  In spite of campaigns with the publicly announced objective of raising the living standards of the people in the west of the country many western areas are still undeveloped.  Moneys allocated do not seem to reach the most necessitous people.  The milk price has been increased by 1p per gallon.  This increase has been granted to the dairy farmers.  The man with the small output gets the least return.  This miserable increase does not encourage people to continue dairying in areas where there are long seasons of keeping stock indoor and where the feeding costs are out of proportion to those incurred on better quality land. There is no encouragement for the small farmers, who are the backbone of the beef industry, to continue the production of young stock.  Our markets depend on these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to speak about the allocation of grants by the Department of Local Government and the necessity to increase particular grants.  For the past 20 years there has been a grant called the essential repairs grant.  This scheme has been in operation for a long time and under it an allocation of £80 has been given for repairing a building which is structurally sound in order to prolong its life.  It is amazing that the present Government have not seen the necessity of increasing the amount of that grant to people of limited means.  This indicates that this Department <Col N="119" /> are completely out of touch with the people in the lower income group, the less vocal people who will never form a pressure group.  Is it necessary to be a pressure group to gain recognition?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They were introduced about 20 years ago in my county.  Their introduction was a matter for the local authority who decided when to adopt the scheme.  Some counties did not adopt the scheme while others did so. It was entirely a local matter.  The Department have kept that grant at £80 despite the rising costs of building materials.  This indicates that the Department are out of step with present-day trends.  The county councils in different areas have increased the grants.  They have paid £200 or £300, depending on the reports of their officers who assessed the means.  It is about time that the Department began to consider the people in the areas where there are thatched houses in need of repair.  There are many such houses in Clare and Donegal.  These people need attention.  The giving of reconstruction grants of £120 and £140 for three-room or four-room houses is not sufficient with present-day costs.  It cannot be denied that the grants have not been increased sufficiently over the years.</P>
      <P>Simple points are often overlooked while concentrating on big things.  I refer specifically to the people in the horse-breeding areas.  Village blacksmiths and farriers are no longer employed. These people are moving away from the rural scene and nothing has been done by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to train new apprentices to these trades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but I should like some sum to be provided in the Budget to be expended through the Department of Agriculture on training the people I mentioned.  Our craftsmen should be remembered.  The craft of our farriers is a dying craft.  They should share in our national wealth in some way.</P>
      <P>Serious problems have arisen in our tourist industry over the past 12 months.  The fact that our hotels are being closed and advertised for sale in the British newspapers is a cause for concern.  Huge sums of money were allocated to investors in this industry. One wonders about the wisdom of that now.  There is a hotel in my own town which has closed.  A huge sum of money was allocated to a Dutch company.  The smaller hoteliers and guesthouse proprietors should get more consideration. This would help tourism in a very real way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very obvious that the countries in the Common Market are pooling their resources and doing everything as a group to attract tourists.  I do not know what contacts we have with the tourist groups in the Community but I know that they are breaking down every barrier possible to attract tourists and they are succeeding to a very large extent.  I do not know what has been done to attract German tourists to this <Col N="121" /> country.  On the figures for all European countries the Germans are the greatest tourists.  There is a wonderful potential there for us and I wonder has it been explored.  This year we are facing another difficult problem in relation to tourism.  I am afraid that the projections will not be fully realised. We cannot accept excuses from those responsible for promoting this aspect of our national industry.</P>
    <P>Very peculiar things can happen within Departments at times.  I want to mention a sporting activity within the ambit of the Department of Defence.  It would have taken an allocation of perhaps £50 or £100 or a few thousand pounds to send a cross-country team abroad which would have been representative of our Army and our voluntary forces and the FCA. These men have superb stamina.  They trained within their different command and brigade areas.  They represent the best in this country and yet&mdash;I do not say the Minister was responsible because he has a sporting outlook&mdash;when it came to their representing this country at an annual international event, we could not put up a small sum to send them abroad.  That was about the smallest thing that could happen particularly at a time when the morale of the State could do with a little boost.  I hope that will not happen again this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the industrialisation of the west which is to take place over the next four or five years, and the plans which have been made by the responsible authorities who are assigned to the different regions, it is a most disappointing and worrying feature that we have not yet helped the people in the remoter areas.  It is extraordinary that after years of industrialisation we have failed to set up any adequate industries in the areas where there is the greatest depopulation, industries which would absorb the young people who have to emigrate. The figures for emigration in the western countries are alarming. The Government must accept full responsibility for this.  There is very little use in saying there has been a concentration of industry in certain areas.  If you want to be successful you must have a <Col N="122" /> policy for people.  An overall figure does not represent what has been done in a particular area.</P>
    <P>The Save-the-West campaign which has been publicised over the years has not been successful.  Something should be done at this stage before it is too late, particularly if we are going into the European Economic Community and the phasing out of small farms seems to be the policy we will have to adopt if we accept the Mansholt policy in full.  While we have the management of our own affairs we should set up some agency to establish small industries pretty rapidly in remote areas. The county development teams have done a good job.  They have worked hard.  I always feel there is some hidden hand whose influence directs and channels money into other areas despite the work done by those development teams.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to, compliment the Minister on the manner in which this Budget was presented.  I think it is a reasonably sound and well balanced Budget.  The less well-off sections of the community are being looked after and, on the whole, it is a good Budget.  I welcome in particular the increase in social welfare benefits. Over the past three years we have seen substantial increases in social welfare payments and, even though we would like to see those recipients getting more, I am glad that the Government were in a position to go as far as they went. We have made great strides in social welfare when one recalls that a few years ago we did not have any scheme of contributory pensions.  I welcome the increases given and also the increases in unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For agriculture the Government increased expenditure this year by approximately £6 million, mainly by way of price support for milk and beef and for hogget, ewe and sheep subsidies. So far as milk is concerned, a serious problem exists in the dairying counties.  There is a situation whereby milk suppliers to certain branches of the creameries are paid 2p or 3p per gallon less than suppliers to creameries that are organised and operated by the Dairy Disposal Board.  There are <Col N="123" /> reasons for the difference in prices but there should be a uniform price for milk.  It is not fair that dairy farmers because of their location are paid less per gallon.  It is not fair that dairy farmers in the Kenmare/Cahirciveen/ Castletownbere areas are paid less than suppliers in other areas because the costs are higher in these districts.  The sooner the Dairy Disposal Board proceeds with proposals for rationalisation the better.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy in regard to the payment of subsidies for mountain sheep is worthwhile particularly when one remembers that the sheep farmers are not paid a reasonable price for wool.  The mountain sheep farmers would find it very difficult to make a living were it not for these substantial subsidies.</P>
    <P>It must be a strain on any Minister for Finance to raise revenue in order to pay for the ever-increasing cost of running the State services&mdash;services which are expanding and improving every year.  We know the tremendous improvements that have been made in the educational system and in the building of schools.  In addition there is the cost of the fairly comprehensive free transport system which ensures that children are taken to post-primary schools, and to primary schools in many areas.  It is well to remind the public that these schemes cost a considerable amount of money.  The free transport scheme is much appreciated particularly in the remote areas because it enables children to obtain an education they might not formerly have been able to avail of.  It is my belief that the free transport scheme is even more important than free education; the fact that children are conveyed to schools in some cases 20 miles away is a tremendous advance and the cost has been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In regard to health services, the costs are soaring every month.  We often hear people say that the Government should cut back on spending but even by going through the various services it is difficult to find what can be cut.  Expenditure on health has increased at a tremendous rate, due mainly to increases in salaries and <Col N="124" /> wages and the cost of drugs and medicines. The staff employed on our health services are doing a good job and are entitled to be well paid.  I am a little dubious about the increase in expenditure in regard to drugs and medicines.  It is amazing that there is such a difference in the cost of drugs and medicines in the various dispensary districts which have approximately the same ratio as regards population and medical card holders.  There is room for investigation here and perhaps as a result of that investigation a saving could be achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the system of distributing drugs and medicines by the psychiatric services.  The system whereby nurses travel around and distribute drugs leaves much to be desired. A monthly or, at least, an annual record should be kept of the quantity of drugs and medicines in stock.  In saying that I am not inferring that drugs and medicines are being misused but there could be a certain amount of wastage and this would require investigation.</P>
    <P>In contributing to this debate, I must not forget to mention tourism because I have no doubt but that the decline in tourism will have a serious effect on the economy and the business of the country.  Personally, I do not think we will fare out as badly as some people are predicting.  The main problem, in so far as I see it, is in relation to the costs of travelling to this country. People to whom I have been speaking recently while they were on holiday here, have complained of these costs. They have commented that the Irish Sea is definitely a very costly stretch of water to cross.  The Government should consider the possibility of subsidising the fares of those travelling to this country.  If the air and sea services could be subsidised in respect of those travelling from England and the Continent, we would be bound to attract more tourists.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned while speaking on the increase in social welfare, how grateful I am to the Minister for providing a new scheme of pensions for the widows of military service pensioners under the Army Pensions Act.  I have made representations <Col N="125" /> to the Minister for Defence on a number of occasions in connection with this matter and now that the scheme has been introduced, I hope it will eventually be expanded to include also the widows of special allowance recipients under the Army Pensions Act.  The scheme is very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is also gratifying to note that provision has been made for increasing the pensions of retired public servants. Generally speaking, pensioners and their dependants are entirely dependent on the amount of their of pension and we have a duty to ensure that all our pensioners are provided for.</P>
    <P>Some effort should be made to provide more money, by way of subsidy or otherwise, to the ESB so that the very high special service charge in rural areas might be reduced.  I know that the ESB were given money a couple of years ago to help them reduce this charge but the charges are still excessive and well beyond the capacity of many smallholders in rural areas.  We are all aware that electricity is very important and nowadays it is vital that it be extended to all rural areas if we are to encourage our people to remain in the more remote rural districts and if we are to encourage other people to take an interest in these districts.  I have known of some cases where the special service charge ranged between £8 and £10 every two months. Certainly, this charge is beyond the capacity of most people in these remote areas.  Either money should be allocated to the ESB or they should be authorised or instructed to raise money so that a reduction in these charges could be effected.</P>
    <P>Some scheme should be devised also for the purpose of executing small drainage schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The money provided in the Budget for drainage should be distributed more equitably throughout the country and it is my opinion that 10 or 15 per cent should be set aside from the arterial drainage schemes and used for the purpose of small drainage schemes.  I shall say no <Col N="126" /> more on that but it is a matter that would be well worth investigating.  It is probable that the amount involved would not be missed from the major schemes each year.</P>
      <P>We are making good strides in so far as the provision of small industries is concerned but I should like to see a proper manpower survey being carried out in every county and, indeed, in every parish in the country.  This should be done by some State organisation.  In Kerry, for example, the county development team were authorised some years ago to carry out such a survey but as far as I know it has not been completed.  It is vital that a manpower survey be carried out and that copies of it should be available in public libraries and public offices throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am a firm believer in a combination of part-time farming and employment in industry.  I have seen this combination work extremely well in east Kerry and I am sure that the agricultural officers in that district will agree that the small farmers who are employed part-time also in industry are making more money out of their land than before because they have more money to put into it which means that they can improve it and get the maximum from it.  We should intensify our efforts to provide small industries for rural towns and villages.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I think this is a good Budget, that the less well-off sections have been looked after and that the taxation imposed will not hit any section unduly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not the share the optimism of Deputy O'Leary or of the Minister for Finance in regard to the Budget. Deputy O'Leary describes it as a good Budget in which the less well-off sections were brought more into line with the rest of the community.  He mentioned great strides in social welfare, unemployment assistance and benefit and increases for agriculture. I believe that the Minister in increasing income tax should have differentiated between the less well-off and the wealthier.  It is unfair that an ordinary worker who is liable to income tax should pay the same increase as the person with the high salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> On the social welfare side, there is much to be desired.  One problem that I personally have had to deal with very much&mdash;I am sure that every other Deputy also had the same experience&mdash; concerns the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  Like the old age and widows' pensions, the disabled person's maintenance allowance is a vital service.  It is an income for those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to provide for themselves.  I have found, as I am sure many others have found, that unless these people are almost penniless they do not qualify for any payment.  The Minister could have done something for them in the Budget because I consider that many of these people at this time are living in very poor circumstances, some as a result of accidents; others were born invalids.  The Minister should have given priority to their needs when formulating his Budget.</P>
    <P>We have been told of increased provision for agriculture.  It is all very well to have banner headlines in the newspapers to the effect that there is an increase of £8 million for agriculture but to the farmer&mdash;I am speaking on behalf of the small farmers particularly&mdash;what matters is what that increase means to him in terms of money in his pocket.  There is not much relevance between the figure of £6 million or £8 million and the one old penny per gallon on the price of milk.  I will admit that in certain cases we have overproduction of milk but was it not the Department that advocated increasing stocks and more production? In those circumstances it is not fair that the price should remain practically uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I note that the amount provided for the warble fly eradication scheme for 1971-72 is £50,000 while in 1970-71 it was £68,000, a drop of £18,000. It is hard to understand the reason for this decrease in view of the fact that at present cattle for export to Northern Ireland are being turned down daily on inspection at points of entry because they are found to have warble infestation.  This scheme, if you could call it a scheme, was to my mind, a total failure.  I cannot understand how <Col N="128" /> the Minister can justify a decrease this year of £18,000 in the allocation for the scheme.  I should have thought it was one scheme where the figure should have been increased if, as is essential, we are to export more cattle and we know they are ineligible for export if affected by warbles.  The Minister should have made some provision against this.</P>

      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling. I was glad to hear some mention of farm guesthouses.  As a representative from a congested constituency comprising mainly small farmers, I find that the Government have done very little to promote tourism.  Many large hotels have been built and many large grants paid but some money should have been set aside to assist people who are prepared to accept tourists on a farm guesthouse or private guesthouse basis.  On several occasions I have accompanied people requiring assistance to the tourist office&mdash;these people kept guests before the tourist companies came into being&mdash;but unfortunately, no such scheme was available apart from one where assistance could be given up to a maximum of £500.  It is a pity more money was not made available for the type of tourist who prefers to stay in a private house.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy O'Leary use as an argument for the drop in the number of tourists the cost of flying or getting to this country.  I am not an authority but I wonder if it is any more expensive to travel to Ireland than to any other country. Certainly, people living in Northern Ireland do not need to take either an aeroplane or a boat.  The cost of getting here is not very great, but unfortunately because of things done by some members of Deputy O'Leary's party people in the North are not particularly keen to come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> Something else which the Minister should have included in his Budget was adequate grants for the reconstruction of farmhouses and houses in general. There are many houses throughout the country which are not in as good repair as they might be but the present reconstruction grants are totally inadequate to enable people to put them in good repair.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that potatoes ex-farm are on sale at the present time at £7 a ton whereas potatoes in Northern Ireland are on sale at £18 a ton.  The Minister did not do anything about this either in this or any previous Budget.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary in the course of his speech suggested that more money should be given to minor drainage and I could not agree more with him on this point.  He suggested that money for minor drainage should be diverted from arterial drainage and there I beg to differ.  During the last five years £1? million has been given to factories which have closed down or partly closed down.  If that sum of money has been put into something like drainage it would have shown advantages for many years to come. I am not in any way against industry, I believe industry is essential in rural areas if we are to maintain employment opportunities, but there are industries and industries.  There are industries in receipt of substantial aid from the Government which are not worthy of being called industries.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker said that the sooner the Irish workers realised that striking for the sake of striking does the country no good, the better.  I wonder if workers really strike for the sake of striking?  At the present time two companies whose employees seem to be striking every other day are semi-State companies, namely, CIE and the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is something wrong at management level in these two semi-State companies? I wonder if worker participation might not be the answer to many of the problems?  I do not agree with <Col N="130" /> throwing the blame on workers.  If workers were given an opportunity to participate in the role of management many of the strikes which now take place might not take place.</P>
    <P>The health service leaves a great deal to be desired.  The cost of the health service to the ratepayer in 1954 was 5s 4d in the £ and in 1971 it is 32s 5d in the £, which is six times as much.  I do not think the income of any section of the community has increased six times in that period.  Yet everyone is expected to pay now six times as much as he paid in 1954 towards the cost of the health service. The sum involved is even greater if we take into account the fact that the £ today is worth 10s as compared with 1954.  When these factors are taken into account it will be found that the less well-off section of the community are worse off today than they were some years ago.</P>
    <P>Very little has been done to help the small farmer survive.  During the period of office of this Government, 380,815 people have emigrated.  This is a sad reflection on any Government and I do not know how they can brag in face of these figures.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I submit that if the Government had been watching carefully over the affairs of the country during the last 12 months with a view to expanding and increasing our markets instead of bickering among themselves, this country might today and next year be much better off.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to contribute to this debate when I heard that the Party Whips had agreed on a time to complete on the debate because I believe when such an agreement has been made the maximum amount of time should be given to the Opposition to express their views and for that reason I do not intend to detain the House very long.</P>
      <P>Up to the time the Budget was introduced all we heard was talk about extravagant Government expenditure. It was said the Government were giving a lead to inflation as a result of the excessive expenditure in which it had engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> Since the Budget was introduced, and particularly under subhead 8, for which I am responsible, we are now being criticised because the Government has cut back on expenditure in certain fields of activity.  The Minister, I think, covered this quite extensively in his Budget Statement.  There is no doubt in the world but that you cannot provide extra services and reduce Government expenditure at the same time. That is just not on.  Right up to the Budget the demand was for a reduction in Government expenditure but when that reduction took place and departmental activities in certain fields were curtailed Opposition Deputies found that their own particular pet projects were affected and they immediately became very annoyed with the Government for having gone along with the idea of reducing Government expenditure.</P>

      <P>I sat in this House for two hours today and I did not interrupt anybody.  I was tempted to do so.  I was tempted to use the Deputy's arguments, but I did not do so.  We have this eternal problem and the former Minister for Finance, when he returned from official business in South <Col N="132" /> America, said that he was asked what he thought was the greatest problem that could beset a nation and he replied &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;.  All the talk up to now here has been about inflation.  We are still condemned because there is an inflationary situation and because the Government is trying to give a lead to private enterprise now &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; is the in word.  If the Opposition will take up the Capital Budget and look through the various items carefully they will find that under the heading of building and construction, which is not an inflationary expenditure, the provision last year was £35 million.  The out-turn was £33 million.  Presumably the cement strike was responsible there. The estimate for the current year is £36.82 million.  This is an increase in useful expenditure, expenditure which will provide employment and services for our people.  The provision for sanitary and miscellaneous services last year was £6 million; the provision this year is £6.5 million.  Last year the provision for education was £11.2 million; this year it is £12 million.  The provision for hospitals last year was £3.6 million; this year it is £3.9 million.  The provision for building and construction last year was £2.10 million; this year it is £2.18 million.  The provision last year for ports and harbours was £6.6 million; this year it is £6.9 million.  I expect to exceed that figure a little bit. The provision last year for tourism was £2.8 million; the provision this year is £2.99 million.  The provision for agriculture last year was £15.41 million; this year it is £15.51 million.  The increased expenditure is non-inflationary expenditure.  It is expenditure devised for the purpose of creating increased activity within our economy and increased employment.  The cuts have been made under heads which might be considered inflationary in their content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has suffered some cuts.  I am not too happy about them but, if it is Government policy to cut Government expenditure for the purpose of fighting inflation, then it is my job to administer the Government's decision.  The Minister highlighted the crux of the problem when he said that the sharp increases in prices in recent years reflect the rising <Col N="133" /> trend in demands for greater money incomes and scarcely a week passes without claims for increases well above those the rise in national production would justify; these claims have been pursued under the threat of disruption of business and private employers have tended in recent years to buy peace at any price.  I should like to compliment the Irish Congress of Trade Unions here.  First, they formulated the national wage agreement.  I hope it will run its course.  There are signs which might indicate that it will not run its course but the Irish Congress of Trade Unions showed maturity and wisdom and leadership when they got individual unions affiliated to congress to accept this national wage agreement. Secondly, they issued a document in relation to price control.  Whether or not this is accepted by the Government, I should like to compliment congress on their enterprise and the effort they put into this document. Quite some years ago, when I was an Opposition Deputy, the late Jim Larkin, not long after my late father produced a document on how we should approach a planned economy, said to me that that was what we should be doing, planning for the future instead of worrying about the 1913 tactics.  He said the past was gone.</P>
    <P>The Government must declare its policy for the future and the Government has declared this year that, as far as it is concerned, any increased expenditure will be non-inflationary so far as that is possible.  It is very, very difficult to have a non-inflationary Budget because the possibility is that in certain sections people may have to be disemployed.  To counter that special provision has been made for an extra £500,000 to the Department of Local Government.  So far as the Office of Public Works is concerned, I am at the moment engaged in discussions with the Department of Finance and I think that, as a result of the suggestions I have to make, we will be able to avoid this situation.  I have got extra money for building national schools.</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of talk to the effect that the Government should take deflationary action.  The most deflationary action the Government has taken in the past 12 months has been the increase in corporation profits tax.  Many people I know in business have said to me that this is probably the most deflationary action the Government can take.  Without saying that I agree entirely with a tax of this sort in the mid-season, I do agree that the Opposition were demanding that a deflationary measure be taken by the Government.  The Government took it and then all hell broke loose. We have not only Fine Gael and Labour speaking with opposite tongues, but we have Labour speaking with two tongues and Fine Gael speaking with two tongues.</P>

      <P>We had the Parliamentary Secretary speaking a few <Col N="138" /> moments ago with his tongue in his cheek about the united Government we have.  All our woes, all our ills, and the fact that the economy is bad, that the trends are bad and that the prospects for the years ahead are bad, are due to the Government we have in office, due to the fact that we have no leadership, that the ship is rudderless, that the Government are disunited.  Instead of being united and working together in the interests of the people they are watching each other and wondering when the tomahawk will be stuck in some of their Minister's backs or they are wondering indeed in whose back it will be stuck.  The Taoiseach last year had to sack three Ministers.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that we were dissatisfied because there were cuts under certain headings.  Certainly the people are dissatisfied at present because it is the people on the bottom rung of the ladder who are suffering.  There is less money for the ordinary worker on the roads in every county in Ireland.  There is not a county that will not have to reduce the number of road workers. There is less for the forestry workers. Deputy Creed gave figures today which showed that there are only half as many employed on our forests as there were a few years ago.  In the Inland Fisheries the ordinary men who last year got nine and ten months' work were taken on this year in April and they have been let go already in Westmeath. The same thing is happening throughout the length and breadth of this country.  In Westmeath in 1965-66 we got a road grant of £267,000 and a road worker's wage was then £8 per week.  At present it is £16 and this year <Col N="139" /> we have got £261,000, a reduction of £6,000 despite the fact that money values have decreased by at least 33? per cent and that road workers' wages have doubled.</P>

In that year there were 30,384 civil servants costing £19.6 million.  How did Dr. Ryan keep his word to the Irish taxpayer?  He kept his word just as he kept it in regard to health charges.  I happened to be on a deputation which went to him about health charges.  He told us he could assure us that they would not cost more than 2s in the pound.  Now in many counties they are costing 40s in the pound.  However, Dr. Ryan told us he would have a saving in the Civil Service, that he would reduce the number of civil servants&mdash;and this is on the records of the House&mdash;in 1964 with 30,384 civil servants costing £19.6 million.

You have knocked those unfortunate people off the dole.  You have little regard for the poor of Ireland now although you climbed to power on their backs and used them as long as you could.  Deputy Lenehan said in this House that the poor put you in for a long time and if they continued to vote Fianna Fáil.

      <P>Unfortunately with the high taxation, the Irish people cannot enjoy themselves.  However, in that regard the Fianna Fáil Government keep their promise to the Irish people by increasing the number of civil servants by 8,000 and by increasing the amount spent on them from £19 million to £49.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lemass, also criticised our party, or the people on this side of the House and said we were looking for a reduction in taxation and that we were not satisfied now because certain cuts had been made.  Certainly we are not satisfied <Col N="141" /> with the cuts that have been made because it is the poorer sections that are suffering.  I should like to remind him of promises made in the past.  I am old enough to remember when it was only costing £36 million to run this country and when Fianna Fáil promised, if elected, to reduce it by £2 million.</P>
    <P>We know how they kept that promise. I remember Deputy Seán Lemass in this House in 1956 stating solemnly that Fianna Fáil policy for the future was that if there was any increase demanded in taxation or rates the Estimates would have to be pruned and the cloth cut according to our measure.  If the Minister for Finance does not believe me I will get the quotation and give it to him tomorrow.  It took £105 million to run the country then and Fianna Fáil have managed by increased taxation to raise the bill to £430 million. I am also old enough to remember when Fianna Fáil came in promising to reduce taxation and to give complete derating.  The average rate in Ireland then was 6s 4d in the £.  How did Fianna Fáil keep that promise?  The Minister knows that the average rate now throughout Ireland is between £5.50 and £6 in the £.  In the 1959-60 £21 million was collected from the ratepayers and in 1970-71 £59.3 million, almost £60 million, was collected from the ratepayers because of a Government who in Opposition promised complete derating.  The rates are now yielding half the amount it took to run the entire country when Fianna Fáil in 1956 promised complete derating.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to make it clear that we have had periods of no inflation in which all the rules were kept and in which everybody, including the workers, seemed to be satisfied. Then the rules were broken because <Col N="145" /> people became anxious to increase earnings as rapidly as possible without restraint as to cost or the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that the people who have broken the rules and regulations as regards inflation are the members of this Government, for political expediency when they wanted to buy votes.  I give them credit that at no time in the history of this country have they hesitated to spend the people's money to buy votes.  They did it in 1963 when there were two by-elections pending.  They did it before the 1968 general election.  You cannot expect the people to have faith in the Government.  You cannot expect anybody in this country to believe any thing they have to say.  In 1963 a booklet was published called <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  An appeal went out to the workers not to look for any further increases; everybody was to tighten their belts.  Then the election came and the Government sensed defeat in the by-elections.  What did they do?  The Taoiseach at the time with one stroke of the pen said the gap had been closed.  It was closed immediately. Why?  Because Fianna Fáil wanted to win the two by-elections.  They gave a 12½ per cent increase at that time which was inflationary.  They did this out of political expediency because they wanted to hold on to power, to keep their hands on the loot as long as possible.  This Government then have the audacity to turn around and blame the workers for failing to do what they asked them to do.</P>
      <P>We also remember that on 19th March, 1969, Deputy Haughey went on television to say the country was again in peril.  The workers had to tighten their belts; there could be no further increases.  The poor, unfortunate Ministers even announced they were prepared to have a reduction of 14 per cent in their own salaries.  There was a financial crisis.  They appealed to the people for restraint.</P>

There was no problem, according to the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brian Lenihan. There was no crisis, according to the Taoiseach.  The slate was wiped clean and everything in the garden became rosy.  They introduced an inflationary Budget to buy the people's votes.  Unfortunately, between that, visiting the convents of the country and shaking hands with the nuns, they were successful. They fooled the people and got back again.</P>

      <P>In the same Dáil debate the Minister went on to state at column 133:</P>
      <P>I was referring to everybody in the economy breaking the rules which Mr. Ted Heath, Mr. Harold Wilson and their Governments have been begging everybody to keep during the past 15 years&mdash;that incomes do not rise more than production. It is a very common cry and there is no slur cast on anybody. The two countries have been breaking the rules continuously, and we have been breaking the rules particularly badly in the last two years just as the British have.  It is no good the Deputy trying to suggest that I am casting a slur on anybody.</P>
      <P>He was telling the House that what was happening in England was happening here.  He said the two countries had been breaking the rules for two years.  At column 134 he stated:</P>
      <P>The year 1967 was a fairly good year in which the economy began to grow again at the previous rate but with it emerged evidence of inflation and we have inflation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that we should ask the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary what they have done since as regards inflation.  They pursued a policy of inflation during the past five years, according to their own evidence.  We pointed out to the Government that they were pursuing an inflationary policy and we pointed out the evils that would ensue from such a policy, but they heeded nobody on this or on any other side of the House. They continued on because they were divided.  There was no such thing as collective responsibility.  You had half <Col N="148" /> a dozen Taoisigh, Ministers going their own way, no co-operation and no co-ordination of effort and no work being done for the country.  If there were a Nobel prize for the art of survival certainly the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Government would get it. Of course there is a very good reason why they want to stay in power.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to point out that the annual rates of erosion in currency in 1969-70 were as follow: Belgium 4 per cent, Denmark 5.2 per cent, France 5.4 per cent, Germany 3.6 per cent, Holland 4.1 per cent, Ireland 7.4 per cent, Italy 3.7 per cent, Japan 7.5 per cent, Sweden 5.8 per cent, the United Kingdom 5.3 per cent and the USA 5.7 per cent.  Therefore with the exception of Japan our money has lost value at a quicker rate than that of any other country.  The housewives know it; they know that the £ is jet propelled.  The Government are also to blame for this and the Taoiseach is standing idly by while this is happening.  We have fewer people at work today; factories are closing down; over 7,000 have lost employment in industry in the last year while more are on short time, and something like 70 to 80 hotels are on the market. When we talk about tourism there is no point in the Minister for Transport and Power blaming conditions in the north for what has happened because conditions here, with members of our own Government, and with ex-Ministers were as bad as they were in the north.  With the exception of the President of Egypt, who recently had to sack five Ministers, there are very few other countries which had to sack people as our Taoiseach had to.  He had to sack three members of the Government and two others left a short time afterwards.</P>
    <P>The time has been reached when the usual repetitive arguments produced here to justify the upward swing in Government expenditure fail to reflect the real gravity of the position.  For many years we had been accustomed to hearing that the burden was close to the endurable limit.  The late Seán Lemass told us that in 1956.  Mr. Seán MacEntee said the same thing in 1957 when he was in Opposition.  Expenditure <Col N="149" /> is careering upwards and we are entitled, as Mr. MacEntee was entitled in 1957, to ask: when will the rake's progress stop?  Over a number of years the rate of growth in current public expenditure and of non-productive capital items has far outpaced the real growth of the economy as a whole.  When that happens an economy and a country are in real trouble and our people and our economy are in real danger at present.  In the last 14 years the cost of running the country has increased from £105 million to £525 million.  During the same period we borrowed, from at home and abroad, over £700 million. This year we propose to borrow many more millions.  We have at present a record national debt of £1,114 millions which costs £113 millions to service. The debt is increasing every year.</P>
    <P>At present the county councils owe £300 millions and the State and semi-State bodies owe almost another £100 millions.  Today we were informed that we are to borrow more money from the World Bank to finance education. We know that if you obtain an overdraft from a bank and spend the money foolishly&mdash;which is what happened in this Government&mdash;the day of reckoning must come.  If a man borrows money and as a result increases production and puts himself in the position that he is able to pay back the interest and part of the principal each year then everything will turn out all right in time but here we are going deeper and deeper into debt every year.  Generations yet unborn will have to pay for the burden that is being placed on them by the present Fianna Fáil Government.  They are borrowing for only one reason and that is that they want to stay in power.  What the Government should be aiming at is to increase production, baking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a larger national cake.  You are not worried about the Just Society.  We stand for a more equitable distribution of the national wealth.  Instead of the deserted homes one sees in rural areas and people having to emigrate to England we want to see more people working on the land, more people being reared and educated in this country and then when they are educated we want to see them getting jobs at home.  We want to see more houses built, to hear the patter of little feet on the kitchen floor and the smoke twirling up to the sky.  That is the type of society we want to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>You would not do that by doing what Fianna Fáil are doing today, making the rich richer and the poor poorer.  People are getting increases of £9, £10 or £12 a week while at the same time the unfortunates who are on the dole are getting only £3 or £3 10s to keep them alive.  You had that ruthlessly withdrawn but the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, and the newspapers were on the ball immediately and as a result Fianna Fáil, with their eye on the next election and knowing what public opinion can do, changed it overnight and at least gave it back to some of the people. Then what happened?  The civil servants were blamed.  The Minister was playing golf on that day and he could not be got.  On such an important occasion when people were looking for information he should have been contactable. The Fianna Fáil Party claim to be interested in the farmers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the total number of the following boats in Ireland as well as the number of newly added similar boats during the last five years: (1) sailing boats with keel under approximately 30 feet, (2) sailing boats with keel over 30 feet, (3) motor boats (displacement boats) in length approximately 20-30 feet, (4) motor boats with speeds between 7 and 15 knots and (5) motor boats with the effect of 20-40 horsepower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information on record in regard to Irish-registered vessels is that contained in the statutory register maintained in the General Register and Record Office, 27 Eden Quay, Dublin, pursuant to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955, which is open to inspection at a fee of 50 pence. The register does not, however, record length of keel or speed of vessel.  I should also explain that vessels not exceeding 15 net tons other than fishing boats are not required to be registered.  The statistical data required by the Deputy are not therefore available.</P>
