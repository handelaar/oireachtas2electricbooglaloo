The fact that the lands involved were partly freehold created some complications in relation to a subdivision and this delayed completion of the transaction. These difficulties have recently been cleared and it is hoped to complete the sale in the near future.  The way will then be clear for payment of the purchase money.</P>

The estimated average increase in gross agricultural product per person engaged in agriculture in the years 1969 and 1970 was 2.1 per cent per year.  The 5.1 per cent figure was a projection based on certain assumptions, which may or may not be realised, and, having regard to the fluctuations inherent in agricultural production and in markets and prices, it is not possible for me to forecast at this stage whether the projection will be fully attained.</P>

      <P>Factory slaughterings of lamb for export in recent weeks have been higher than at this time last year.

Even if only a small number were sent it might relieve the pressure at the moment.  This is a very important trade and if it were properly looked after it could bring great benefits.

The rate is laid down in section 26 of the Debtors (Ireland) Act, 1840, and interest on judgment debts is also regulated by the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1962, the Circuit Court Rules, 1950, and section 47 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 (which applied section 26 of the Debtors (Ireland) Act, 1840, to Circuit Court judgments).

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>There is no record or information in my Department of any such matter but, as I did not hold the office of Minister for Justice during the period to which the allegation clearly referred, namely the period from August, 1969 to April 1970, I also checked with the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, and he in turn, at my request, checked with his officers in Garda Headquarters and also with the appropriate divisional or district officer for every area adjoining the Border.  This check covered the entire period in question with a margin to spare and it extended not only to any order or directive but also to any suggestion of any kind whatsoever on the lines indicated.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner's reply, based on this comprehensive check, is that there was no such order, directive or suggestion. It may be relevant to mention that, at intervals throughout the period in question, various seizures of illegally-held arms were made by the gardaí and a number of people were prosecuted for illegal possession of arms or explosives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount seized by the gardaí from subversive organisations during the period 1st August, 1969 to date is 13 machine guns, 18 rifles, <Col N="666" /> of ammunition, 39 detonators, 11 grenades, 31¼ lbs of explosives, five coils of fuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

Despite the fact that 13 machine guns, 18 rifles, 31 pistols and a number of other weapons have been found, not a single person is in jail for those offences.  Will the Minister not further admit that seven men were found in Dundalk with machine guns, rifles, ammunition and explosives and that on a direction from the Attorney General they were allowed out under the Probation Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that statements are being issued by members of illegal armies and that such statements are appearing in Irish newspapers; if he intends to take any action in the matter; and, if not, why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware.  The sending of such statements for publication in a newspaper or periodical publication is an offence and so is the actual publication in a newspaper or periodical publication.</P>
      <P>It is usually impossible to obtain evidence that would identify the originators of these statements and sustain a prosecution against them.  Partly for this reason, that is to say because the principal offenders cannot ordinarily be identified, there has been a reluctance to prosecute newspapers.  There is, however, an additional and more important consideration and that is that, in relation to the publication of propaganda obviously emanating from subversive sources and very often actually claiming credit for serious criminal offences, the Government hopes that the news media will exercise a responsibility above and beyond anything enjoined on them by the criminal law.</P>
      <P>I would like, therefore, to take this opportunity to appeal to all concerned to review the position immediately and to take account not only of their own clear legal obligations but also of the interests of public peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The news media will, no doubt, realise that the publication of propaganda statements of this nature emanating from subversive sources is of considerable benefit to these subversive organisations and gives them a <Col N="673" /> significance in the public mind out of all proportion to their very small numbers.</P>

Is the Minister not aware that Mr. John A. Costello when he was Taoiseach went to the newspapers?  Is the Minister not aware of the fact that statements are being published and that this is making the joining of the IRA a romantic idea?  It is doing harm to many of our young people.  Is it not time that the Government took action and governed in the interests of peace?</P>

      <P>As Members of the House are aware, illegal activities of certain organisations and groups have been a source of concern for some time <Col N="674" /> and the possession by these groups of illegal arms and explosives is likewise of concern.  As I have already indicated today in my reply to an earlier question, various seizures of illegally-held arms and explosives have been made by the Garda during the past two years.</P>
      <P>In the recently-circulated Firearms Bill, 1971, increased penalties are provided to deal with persons convicted of the offence of being in unauthorised possession of certain firearms and ammunition.  I am having the law in relation to possession of explosive substances examined in my Department and I hope to introduce a Bill to deal with that aspect at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly all this is in my question.  There is the blowing-up of vessels, appearances on television, occupying of houses, people strutting on the streets with impunity.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

If the Bill which I have had before the House for several months had been passed by this House and by the Oireachtas it would have been possible to prosecute those people.  As soon as the Bill is passed people of this type will be prosecuted.  Everyone knows that the Garda are making every effort under the law of this country as it is at present to deal with this threat.

      <P>In general terms the answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  There are very old offences under Forcible Entry and Forcible Detainer Acts of the 14th century which probably would constitute these affairs as offences.  But it is the view of the Attorney General and has been for some time his view, with which I concur, that it is not right in this day and age to prosecute people under statutes of 1381 and that period. That is the reason why I have the Forcible Entry Bill before this House. Now that the House realise the problems I hope they will accommodate me in securing a speedy passage for the Bill.</P>

The only variation of this policy is the Annual State Commemoration at Arbour Hill for those who died in 1916.</P>

      <i>Review of 1970</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is customary at the outset of the budget statement to review recent economic trends and to sketch the prospects for the year ahead.  The summary of the economic background is, as usual, brief because the ground has been covered in detail in recent publications.</P>
      <P>The year 1970 was a mixed year for the Irish economy as it was for quite a number of other economies.  Growth slackened and unfavourable trends in incomes and prices developed.  However, exports retained their buoyancy and there was an improvement in the balance of payments on current account, although the deficit was still large.</P>
      <P>National output expanded by 1½ per cent.  The sluggishness of industrial production, caused mainly by industrial disputes, was largely responsible for this relatively slow growth.  Nevertheless, employment outside agriculture continued to rise although not strongly enough to absorb the outflow of workers from agriculture.  Agricultural output showed only a small increase over the year.</P>
      <P>Further large increases in incomes were recorded with the total non-agricultural wage bill rising by 13 per cent.  This, together with other factors such as higher import prices, led to a very high increase of 8¼ per cent in consumer prices.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Outlook for 1971</i>
      </P>
      <P>The indications now, however, are that the economy is on the mend. Activity is reviving and the industrial peace we all hope for should provide a more stable environment within which this recovery can continue.</P>
      <P>Much will depend on the trend of income increases in 1971.  Present indications are that the increase in the non-agricultural wage bill will be some percentage points less than in 1970, notwithstanding the substantial carry-over effects of the high settlements reached last year.  Allowing for an anticipated improvement in productivity, this would mean a more favourable cost/ price position.</P>
      <P>Demand at home is expected to recover from last year's relatively low level.  The volume of consumer spending may rise by 2½ to 3 per cent as against last year's rise of about 1½ per cent.  Investment, aided by a revival in building and construction, is expected to be well above last year's low level and should lead to a welcome increase in opportunities for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would hope that industrial exports will continue to climb steadily with the aid of improved competitiveness. The prospects for agricultural exports are quite favourable.  On the debit side, the higher level of activity this year may be expected to boost the import bill.  Large imports of capital goods, including some £25 million for aircraft, are expected.  Given a reasonable increase in net invisible earnings, the balance of payments on current <Col N="687" /> account (excluding imports of ships and aircraft) should, however, show an improvement.</P>
    <P>Present indications are that the economy should grow at about 3 per cent this year.  While this is below our aspirations in other circumstances, it would be a welcome advance on last year and is probably the most we could hope to achieve without reinforcing inflationary trends.</P>
    <P>
      <i>EEC</i>
    </P>
    <P>On the international plane, our negotiations for entry to the EEC are proceeding satisfactorily.  As indicated in the comprehensive review recently circulated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, discussions in the coming months will concentrate on the transitional measures in the industrial and agricultural sectors and on the applicant countries' contributions to Community finances in the transitional period.  The successful conclusion of these negotiations this year should enable our accession to the Community to be made at the beginning of 1973.</P>
    <P>We have therefore little more than a year and a half in which to complete our preparations for membership.  If the economy is to be able to meet the obligations which that will impose &mdash;and I must stress that the new environment in which it will have to compete will be radically different from that to which we have become accustomed&mdash;we must now eradicate those factors which have retarded growth over the past two years.  This gives added urgency to the central theme which I shall be propounding in this budget&mdash;minimising the inflationary pressures in the economy and strengthening the factors conducive to steady and sustainable growth.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Price Increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>The accelerating trend in price increases in the past two or three years gives grounds for anxiety.  In the early sixties, consumer prices increased by an average of 3 per cent a year but in the three years 1968 to 1970 the rise averaged almost 7 per cent a year.  Undoubtedly there are some elements in the price increases over which we have little or no control.  These consist <Col N="688" /> mainly of the effect of rising import prices and those increases in agricultural prices which are largely determined in external markets.  Our situation is inescapably influenced and affected by what is happening in the world around us and in the countries with which we trade.  Economically the map is deceptive.  There are not islands on the economic globe.  Having made that point, however, I wish to emphasise that the main cause of our inflation has been accelerating wages and salaries and increased indirect taxes&mdash; which themselves reflect higher wage and salary costs for services provided by government.</P>
    <P>In this situation fiscal and monetary policies can help and, indeed, must be designed to avoid creating a climate in which inflationary pressures would be likely to emerge.  However, while such policies may slow down inflation, they will not halt it unless applied with a severity which would be unacceptable in terms of sharply increased unemployment. We reject the concept of strength through misery.  The main emphasis, therefore, must be on prices and incomes policy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Pay Agreement</i>
    </P>
    <P>The National Pay Agreement could be an important step forward in containing incomes inflation.  We must, however, be realistic about it.  The agreement is clearly inflationary.  Its main importance is the hope it holds out that current inflationary pressures can be moderated in an atmosphere of industrial peace.  We must ensure that the agreement is a permanent advance and not a &ldquo;once-for-all&rdquo; effort which, when it terminates, will leave the basic problems much as they were before.</P>
    <P>If the agreement is fully observed, the year 1971 could mark a break with recent experience of rapidly rising money incomes pushing costs upwards even more rapidly.  Even a short and modest respite might drive home the lesson that money incomes which outstrip the growth in national productivity bring lasting benefits to none, cause hardship to many and jeopardise the economic prospects of all sections of our community.  I should like therefore to stress as strongly as possible the <Col N="689" /> importance of giving the hard-won terms of the national agreement a fair chance of succeeding.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's hope that the agreement will lead towards a better system of income bargaining and industrial relations with less disruption of employment and a welcome reduction in unemployment.  Improvements in the system have the support of those involved and it was for this reason that the Government welcomed the NIEC Report on Incomes and Prices Policy which made proposals for new institutional arrangements and highlighted certain deficiencies in our present system of collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>The agreement emphasises that the rate of increase in costs and prices must be moderated substantially and sets out the ways in which wages and salaries should develop if this is to be achieved. The Government, for their part, intend to press ahead speedily with steps to ensure that non-wage incomes will be subject to the same sort of discipline as wages and salaries.  Legislation is being prepared by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to amend the scope of the Prices Acts and the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts and to extend them to activities and services not at present covered.  The present arrangements for price control are being reviewed with a view to improving their effectiveness and the submission made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is being sympathetically examined.</P>
    <P>The Government have already announced the conditions under which pay increases will be accepted as justifying higher prices.  Price additions must be fully justified and must conform with the terms of the National Pay Agreement.  While the agreement should contribute to an easing of inflationary pressures, it will not result in any immediate or spectacular easing of the pressure on prices.  I want to stress this in case there is any misunderstanding. There will be further price increases this year.  Apart from higher import prices, the large money increases given in the 12th round are still affecting prices and will continue to do so during most of 1971.  I am hopeful, however, that, if the agreement is respected by all concerned, the <Col N="690" /> rate of increase in prices will slow down in 1971 and that there will be a further improvement next year.  If this can be achieved, the stage will be set for a further advance towards increased employment and higher real incomes, particularly for the lower-paid and for those depending on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Demand management</i>
    </P>
    <P>A recent OECD report on inflation has stressed that member countries should pursue cautious demand management policies in 1971.  It recommended that, until price increases level off and show a more stable pattern, countries should be willing to accept a temporary reduction in growth below what might otherwise be possible.  The relevance of this advice for Ireland is clear.  We are faced with three interrelated problems of rising prices, excessive external deficits and a growth rate below our long-term potential. Our objectives are also threefold&mdash;to moderate the growth in prices, to reduce to manageable proportions the external deficits and to increase the national growth rate.  In the short term we cannot advance on all three fronts simultaneously and with equal effect. Economic policy must, therefore, aim at striking a reasonable balance between these objectives.  There is clearly no point in aiming at maximum growth in the immediate future if this would push both the external deficit and prices to dangerously high levels. This would mean purchasing short-term growth at the expense of longer-term prospects for sound and sustainable expansion.</P>
    <P>Inflationary costs and price increases go hand in hand with balance of payments difficulties.  Loss of competitiveness through higher unit wage costs results in greater imports and lower exports.  The OECD report on Ireland warned us that the increase in our export prices in 1970 was amongst the highest in OECD countries.  We are fortunate in that the underlying trend of both national production and the balance of payments is towards improvement and that our official external reserves have been rising, but the level of the external deficit still remains <Col N="691" /> much higher than would be considered desirable in the long term.  The upward trend in reserves reflects the large continuing net capital inflow and thus the confidence of external investors in the economy and its future prospects. However, annual repayments of profits, interest and capital automatically tend to rise with increases in the net capital inflow and will constitute a greater annual liability in the balance of payments in future years.  For this reason demand management policy must be directed towards keeping the balance of payments deficit within reasonable bounds.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Monetary policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The past year has been one of exceptional difficulty for monetary policy.  Because of the inflationary pressures in the economy and the balance of payments position, continued restraint of credit growth was necessary and the Central Bank guidelines provided accordingly.  In the event, the effectiveness of these guidelines was impaired by the bank closure which&mdash; although the situation has not yet been fully clarified&mdash;appears in its overall effect to have been inflationary.  In present economic circumstances, continuance of restraint in the coming year is unavoidable.  The Central Bank will issue credit guidelines to the commercial banks in the near future and has already indicated that the total appropriate increase is likely to be about the same as that originally advised for last year.  These guidelines will continue to give priority to productive purposes. Consumer credit must continue to be kept under control in the coming year and for this reason the hire purchase restrictions introduced early last year, which have not been as effective as was expected, must be continued.</P>
    <P>The reduction in lending rates for industrial, commercial and service enterprises, which was announced to-day by the commercial banks follows a general downward tendency throughout the world.  I wish to make it clear that this welcome reduction in the cost of credit does not imply any lessening of the need to curtail the expansion of credit in the coming year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" />
      <i>Inflation and the budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>For some time the Government have been concerned because public expenditure has been rising at a rate substantially faster than national production. If this were allowed to go unchecked, it would soon give rise to financial and economic problems of an acute and dangerous kind.  There are many reasons for the upward trend. They include the need to provide services and finance on a growing scale for agriculture, commerce and industry; the desire of the Government to meet the pressing demands of social justice; and the rising cost of servicing the national debt.  These and other forces operate to expand the role and cost of Government.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the impact of price and wage inflation on the labour-intensive public sector, for which pay alone now amounts to £154 million, and on the wide range of goods which must be purchased out of Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>A substantial part of the claims of the weaker sections of the community on the public purse is needed solely to maintain their position in the face of rising prices.  All these additional costs must be met before improvements in services or benefits can be considered. Financing these costs can, of course, be itself inflationary because of the effects of extra taxation on both prices and incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Control of expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is essential therefore to slow down the rate of growth of Government current expenditure to something more closely approaching the automatic growth in revenues at existing rates of taxation.  The economy could not continue to devote to public expenditure the rising proportion of gross national product which became commonplace in the past decade.  Concerted steps are therefore being taken to improve the arrangements for planning, approving and controlling the budget.  New procedures are being instituted to ensure that expenditure is more closely aligned to the resources likely to be available. At an early stage in the preceding year, the level of aggregate expenditure for the coming year will be determined by <Col N="693" /> the Government in the light of such factors as the yield of tax revenues at unchanged rates, the desirable level of domestic and foreign borrowing and current and prospective economic trends.  This aggregate will be divided into block allocations for each service and Ministers will then be free, within broad limits, to decide the detailed subdivision of their allocations.  This should strengthen the resolve of the Departments to discover ways and means of increasing the efficacy of each £1 spent and to optimise the benefits to be derived from their limited allocations. The fact that block allocations will be determined well in advance should assist Departments in making the policy and administrative changes required to keep expenditure within the limits assigned to them.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Programme budgeting</i>
    </P>
    <P>Experimental studies in programme budgeting have been proceeding in the Department of Education and in the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Lands.  Draft programme budgets for those services covering the period up to 1975-76 have recently been completed.  Four more Departments have now been included in the experiment and it is intended ultimately to cover all Departments at a pace determined by the availability of certain skilled staffs which are quite scarce at present.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Multi-annual budgeting</i>
    </P>
    <P>As an interim measure until programme budgeting becomes fully operational, multi-annual budgeting on what might be described as traditional lines is being developed.  This involves extending the present annual expenditure estimates for a further two years ahead&mdash;that is, estimating for three years in all&mdash;and making provisional allocations in respect of those estimates based on a projection of resources. This procedure should enable more systematic control to be exercised over expenditure in the light of expected resources and facilitate Departments in planning their expenditure over a longer period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The public service</i>
    </P>
    <P>The staffing requirements of the public <Col N="694" /> service are determined by the extension and improvement of Government services.  At present the remuneration of the public service in all its branches &mdash;civil service, Army, Garda Síochána, teachers, health staffs and so on&mdash;pre-empts a considerable proportion of total revenue.  It will cost £154 million in 1971-72 out of a total expenditure figure of £542 million.  Apart from its large and growing size, the pay cost of the public service creates major budgeting problems in a time of rapidly rising pay such as we have experienced acutely in recent years.  It is now difficult to predict and provide accurately in a budget for the cost of pay increases likely to occur in the year ahead.  With a total remuneration of £154 million, even a small deviation can entail several million pounds. When it is considered that public service pay is affected by national pay rounds in outside employment generally, by particular pay adjustments in comparable sectors of outside employment and by claims to alter or maintain differentials and relativities within its own grading structure, the difficulty of precise budgeting for public service pay becomes apparent.</P>
    <P>As the second phase of the twelfth round agreement for the public service generally covers the calendar year 1971, the cost of remuneration can be estimated with greater certainty than was possible last year, but there is nevertheless an area where the estimates are still somewhat tentative.  The amount to be provided for the removal of existing anomalies within the terms of the National Pay Agreement cannot be predicted with confidence.  The best estimate that can be made to cover both this and the cost of the 13th round after January, 1972, is, on present information, £6.5 million.  This sum has been included as a contingency in the pre-budget estimates.</P>
    <P>The Government are seriously concerned at the extent to which national budgetary and financial policy has been upset in recent years by the need to meet additional pay liabilities far in excess of the amount provided in the budget.  In the supplementary budgets introduced in 1968 and 1970, public service pay increases were one of the <Col N="695" /> greatest items of additional expenditure to be met.  Such unexpectedly large mid-year additions to current liabilities can frustrate the Government's attempts to budget rationally.  The Government propose, therefore, to consider what action can be taken to safeguard budgetary plans against disruptions of this nature.  Any proposals to change the present system will, of course, be discussed with the staff associations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conciliation and arbitration</i>
    </P>
    <P>To allay any staff misapprehensions, I wish to make it clear that the Government fully accept the principle of conciliation and arbitration.  Some changes in the present conciliation and arbitration machinery may, however, be desirable.  There are four major arbitration boards covering the civil service, the local authority service, teachers and gardaí, as well as other boards for smaller groups.  They have emerged at different times in the past 20 years and it has been a matter of some concern that there has been no co-ordinated approach between the public service arbitration boards themselves or between them and the major body in this field, the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>This led the Government to propose in 1966 that all arbitration claims be dealt with by the Labour Court.  Regrettably, the proposal was not acceptable to the staff.  It was then suggested that a tribunal be set up under the aegis of the Labour Court to deal with all public service arbitration claims.  This proposal, too, was not acceptable.  Ultimately, the 1969 Industrial Relations Act provided for the addition of two Labour Court members to public service arbitration boards.  While this improvement, when it becomes effective, will no doubt be of help, the problems are such that they can be solved, or at least minimised, only by a fully coordinated approach to claims at arbitration level.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group</i>
    </P>
    <P>Action on the recommendations of the Public Services Organisation Review Group is continuing and I have introduced legislation for the setting <Col N="696" /> up of a Department of the Public Service. While I do not wish to anticipate the debate on the broader aspects of the group's report to which the passage of this legislation will give rise, I would like to stress two points here.  First, the functions of organisation and personnel will be given enhanced status, both in the new Public Service Department and in Departments generally, to reflect the importance attached by the Government to the management of the public service.  Second, the Government are determined to press ahead with all steps necessary to increase the efficiency and minimise the cost of the public service.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Outturn of current budget 1970-71</i>
    </P>
    <P>The budget of April, 1970, aimed at a balance between current expenditure and revenue at the level of £475 million. However, during the course of the year heavy additional liabilities totalling about £20 million were incurred principally on public service pay, additional assistance to CIE, social welfare and health costs and defence.  It was therefore necessary to introduce a supplementary budget which aimed at reducing the likely deficit to £8.6 million by a combination of reductions in expenditure and increased taxation.</P>
    <P>The outturn, as shown in the budget tables, does not significantly differ from the position as projected in October.  The deficit of £8.9 million, which had to be financed by additions to our residual borrowing in 1970-71, has of course affected the outturn on the capital budget for that year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital budget 1970-71</i>
    </P>
    <P>The booklet <i>Capital Budget 1971</i> which was published some days ago shows that expenditure on the capital budget in 1970-71 was very close to the April 1970 estimate.  It included the current budget deficit of £8.9 million. The projected pattern of financing the budget, and in particular the residual borrowing, was substantially altered mainly as a consequence of the effects of the bank dispute.  This is set out in detail in the booklet.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have given careful thought to the question of the budgetary measures <Col N="697" /> best suited to our present economic situation which, as I have already mentioned, presents three interlinked problems of rising prices, excessive external deficits and a slow rate of growth.  The forces of inflation would be given a further impetus if the upward trend of Government spending, both capital and current, were allowed to continue unchecked. This total rose by 18 per cent in 1968-69, 16 per cent in 1969-70 and 18 per cent last year, necessitating undue recourse to domestic and foreign borrowing and increased taxation which contributed to sharply rising prices.  A marked increase in public spending would adversely affect our balance of payments deficit, and while it might give us some short-term prosperity, the price would be too high and the benefits transitory.</P>
    <P>We decided that the rise in Government spending would have to be moderated and the original current and capital expenditure programme of £797 million for 1971-72 has been reduced to the total of £721 million&mdash;an increase of 9½ per cent on last year's outturn.  This very substantial reduction, which was not achieved without difficulty, represents the main effort of my budgetary policy for 1971-72 and is of much greater significance for our economic well-being than the changes I shall announce to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital budget 1971-72</i>
    </P>
    <P>The capital budget for 1971-72 totals £217 million.  The public capital programme which makes up the bulk of the outlay represents an increase of about 6½ per cent over the outturn for 1970-71.  In these comparisons the expenditures of the air companies and Irish Shipping are excluded: most of them are incurred abroad and financed from foreign borrowings and have little direct effect on domestic resources and demand.  It is planned to keep total residual borrowing at a level of £73 million.</P>
    <P>Provided that movements in wages and costs generally are contained within moderate limits, the programme proposed should ensure steady economic and social advance.  Two items deserve special mention.  First, the allocation for industrial grants is up from <Col N="698" /> £18.5 million to £23 million&mdash;the highest level ever.  Second, the allocation for housing and ancillary services, at £43.5 million, is £4 million greater than the outturn in 1970-71.  These two increases, totalling £8.5 million, should add significantly to the job opportunities available this year.</P>
    <P>The problem of financing the capital budget is not limited to finding the money, from whatever source, to cover the total outlays.  Nor is it a matter solely of finding the cheapest sources of capital, although the cost to the Exchequer cannot be ignored.  We must also have regard to the impact on the monetary system and on the economy generally of the different sources of finance used.  It is here that budgetary policy and monetary policy have a meeting place and where one policy can complement the other.</P>
    <P>An appropriate monetary policy could not, on the basis of present information, be maintained during 1971-72 if bank and foreign borrowing by the Exchequer were to rise significantly above the £73 million proposed.  It is hoped to raise £48 million of this requirement from the banking sector and £25 million from abroad.  In the past, borrowing from the domestic banks was confined almost exclusively to the associated banks, but in view of the growth of deposits with the other financial institutions, an approach is now being made to the non-associated banks for part of the £48 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Borrowing from the Irish public</i>
    </P>
    <P>The normal sources of capital finance, chiefly small savings and national loans, are generally regarded as the safest and most desirable way to raise capital for the Exchequer.  Too much reliance on bank credit can run the risk of swelling the money supply to inflationary levels, while foreign borrowing can have similar effects.  All aspects of Government stocks and other means of raising money on the domestic market are being reviewed. Irish Government stocks are at present giving generous yields by comparison with British securities, but other aspects are being looked at with a view to providing attractive investment opportunities for the public and <Col N="699" /> the various investing institutions. Underwriting discounts and brokerage commissions have been increased on new issues and conversions, and stocks are being issued with maturities which best suit the needs of the Irish investor.</P>
    <P>Last February £41 million of national loans came due for redemption. Of this, £25 million was converted into new stock.  At the same time three new stocks were issued for public subscription and these attracted funds of over £21 million.  The Government therefore borrowed £46 million in a single operation.  It was the largest of its kind ever attempted and betokens a gratifying degree of confidence in the continued progress of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>Small savings continue to be a valuable source of finance for the public capital programme, and while I do not expect a repetition of the record level reached last year, because of the bank closure, I hope that the public will continue to recognise the advantages which the various Government media provide for the saver.  The National Instalment Savings Scheme introduced last September has obviously proved attractive.  So far, some 30,000 agreements have been entered into providing for total saving under the scheme in its first year of nearly £5 million.  The new Prize Bond scheme introduced in March has got off to a good start, and up to £1.8 million has been subscribed since then.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, however, that the present issue of Savings Certificates, which were put on sale in March, 1966, are now outdated, and I accordingly propose to withdraw them from sale and to introduce a new decimal certificate. This will have a shorter life of five years, and will be issued in £1 units which will accumulate to £1.35 at the end of the five year period, giving an effective net interest rate of 6 per cent per annum free of tax.  This is equivalent to a gross return of 9¼ per cent to the saver who is liable to tax at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>I also propose to improve the services of the Post Office Savings Bank by providing for speedier withdrawal <Col N="700" /> facilities.  I hope that these will encourage more people to make use of the Bank.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current budget 1971-72</i>
    </P>
    <P>The deficit of almost £9 million incurred in the current budget for last year would disclose an even more serious underlying imbalance between revenue at existing tax rates and expenditure, were it not for the fact that the taxation imposed last October&mdash;which yielded only £5.3 million in 1970-71&mdash; will produce a further £6 million in 1971-72.  The pre-budgetary publications show that total current expenditure for 1971-72 is about 10½ per cent up on last year's outturn.  This represents a virtual halving of last year's increase of over 19 per cent and it leaves me with a nominal opening surplus of £119,000.</P>
    <P>Given the need for additional State assistance for those sections of the community who have been worst hit by rising prices, additional taxation will obviously be necessary if even the most pressing requirements are to be met. But any increase in taxation must be minimised for both long-term and more immediate reasons.  During the sixties the percentage of GNP taken in total taxation rose from about 21 per cent to 31 per cent and, if present trends were not checked, that percentage might well rise by a further ten points in the seventies.  In the context of 1971, it is of the utmost importance to safeguard the National Pay Agreement from the price effects of any avoidable increase in taxation.  Although its terms are far from ideal, the agreement holds out the prospect of a more balanced approach to income settlements in 1971 and in the next few years.  The Government consider that it must be given every chance to succeed this year and to lead the way to greater moderation after its first phase is completed.  This means that I must reduce to the absolute minimum any budgetary impact on prices.  I propose therefore to add only £9.37 million in the form of budget concessions to the estimate of expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government consider that, although extra taxation is necessary to <Col N="701" /> meet the cost, priority must be given to increasing the social welfare payments in view of the rise in the cost of living in the past year.  The increases apply to both the personal and adult dependant rates, as distinct from last year when they applied to personal rates only.</P>
    <P>For example, the personal rate of the old age contributory pension will be increased by 50p to £5.50 a week while the rate for a person with an adult dependant will be increased from £8.50 to £9.35.  The old age non-contributory pension will be increased by 40p to £4.65.  Widow's contributory pension will be increased by 50p to £5.00 while the widow's non-contributory pension and the deserted wives' allowance will be increased by 40p to £4.65.</P>
    <P>The personal and adult dependant rates of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pensions and retirement pensions, maternity allowances, orphan's allowances and unemployment assistance are also being increased.  Full particulars will be circulated to Deputies at the conclusion of this statement.</P>
    <P>The special needs of widows and deserted wives with dependent children have been the focus of a growing measure of social concern in recent years.  The Government have decided this year to improve their position exceptionally. At present the first two dependent children of a contributory widow pensioner qualify for 90p each and the remaining children for 65p each.  These rates will be increased to a uniform £1 per week for each dependent child.  Likewise the corresponding sums of 75p and 50p which non-contributory widow pensioners and deserted wives receive for their children will be increased to a uniform 90p per week for each dependent child.</P>
    <P>In addition, to improve still further the position of working non-contributory widows and deserted wives, the present concession whereby £39 per annum of earnings is disregarded in respect of each child in the assessment of means will be doubled to £78. Special provision is also being made for the widows of military service pensioners; I shall announce the details in a few minutes.  I shall also announce <Col N="702" /> substantial additional reliefs for widows and dependent children in the field of estate duty.</P>
    <P>The disabled persons maintenance allowance and the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, administered by the Department of Health, will be increased in line with the improvements in the social assistance rates.</P>
    <P>The increases in the assistance rates and in the health allowances will take effect from the beginning of August, while the increases in insurance benefits will, as last year, be paid from the beginning of October.</P>
    <P>Recent improvements include the raising of the remuneration limit from £1,200 to £1,600 per annum and the making of regulations which will greatly reduce the number of cases in which loss of benefit can arise due to an employer's failure to stamp insurance cards.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer arising from these various increases, improvements and extensions of services will be £3.1 million in this financial year. A further sum of £0.55 million is being provided to cover payment of unemployment assistance to men without dependants in urban areas and further exemptions from the recent Employment Period Order under an amending order which the Minister for Social Welfare is making today.  This order will enable unemployment assistance to be paid with immediate effect to men, without dependants, resident on coastal islands and to men without dependants, aged 50 years or more in rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been announced already, an additional sum of £0.5 million is being made available for local improvements schemes which will <Col N="703" /> create additional opportunities for employment in rural areas, especially in the West.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Agriculture</i>
      </P>
      <P>As regards agriculture, the Government are sympathetic to the situation that farmers have found themselves in over the past couple of years whereby as a result of inflation incomes in certain other sectors have increased at a faster rate than those of farmers. Inflation has increased farmers' costs and reduced the purchasing power of their income.  Other groups besides farmers were of course similarly affected.</P>
      <P>However, in the year gone by, the Government gave increases in direct Exchequer supports to agriculture at budget time, and again later in the year, the full-year cost of which is some £10 million.  This support and the indirect effects it had on market prices of particular commodities, together with the increased prices authorised for liquid milk and the increase given in the contract acreage for beet, are estimated to have supported farm income by some £16 million a year. Expenditure in relation to agriculture is now running at £101 million approximately as against £91 million this time last year.</P>
      <P>These additional supports should clearly demonstrate the Government's wish to do what they can for agriculture within the limits set by available resources and the needs of other sectors such as education, health, and so on&mdash; which also benefit farmers.</P>
      <P>While the Government will do all they can, farmers, who, after all, are self-employed, have to rely on their own efforts to make up some of the widening differential between their incomes and those of other sectors of the community.  It is accepted that there are limitations to what they can do in this respect but there are indications of a welcome upward movement in output in many sectors of agriculture this year.</P>
      <P>The Government have now decided to introduce the following measures to improve farmers' incomes still further in this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> As announced last month, the price levels on which the export support payments for carcase beef and lamb are calculated are being increased. While the overall cost of the increases in the carcase beef price level had first been estimated at nearly £2 million, it is now expected that the firmer trend in beef market prices will continue and that the actual extra cost to the Exchequer of export support payments in the present financial year will not exceed £1.4 million, which sum I am now providing in this budget.  No extra cost to the Exchequer is expected in the present financial year as a result of the increase in the export price support level for carcase lamb.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to provide an additional £2.2 million in the present financial year to improve the position of creamery milk suppliers. This will be distributed as follows: the milk price allowance on the first 7,000 gallons will be increased from 11 old pence to 5 new pence per gallon as from 1st May.  This new rate of allowance will be extended from the first 7,000 gallons to the first 10,000 gallons in two stages&mdash;a rate of 4 new pence will be paid as from 1st May and 5 new pence as from 1st September next.  The aim is to eliminate the differential between the 7,000 gallon supplier and the 10,000 gallon supplier completely as from 1st September.  The rates of allowance for gallonage levels above 10,000 gallons will also be marginally increased.  The present milk quality allowance of two old pence per gallon will also be increased to 1 new penny.</P>
    <P>Because of further increases in pig production costs, £0.5 million is being provided to enable the guaranteed minimum prices of the top grades of pigs to be increased by an average of 50 pence per cwt dead-weight with consequential adjustment of the level of bacon export price support.  The suitability of existing grading standards will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The prospects for sheep production are good and there is scope for expanding flocks and improving sheep husbandry generally.  To stimulate further progress, the Government have decided to increase the subsidy payable this year on hogget ewes under the <Col N="705" /> Sheep Subsidy Scheme from £1.50 to £2.00 per head.  The cost will be £0.25 million.</P>
    <P>The Small Farm (Incentive Bonus) Scheme has been in operation since 1968 and has about 8,000 participants. Appraisal of the scheme has shown that the participants are achieving excellent results and there is general agreement that the scheme is a valuable one.  To encourage greater participation, the Government have decided to increase the payment at the end of the first year for new participants from £50 to £75 thus bringing the total amount of bonus grants which may be earned by the farmer to £325.</P>
    <P>Other improvements in aids and incentives to farmers, details of which will be announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, are (1) extension of the Forage Harvester Grant Scheme to provide a higher rate of grant for a new and more efficient type of harvester; (2) an improvement in the grant rate for farm silos; and (3) new grants for additional equipment for pig farrowing and dry-sow stalling accommodation.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these improvements is about £4.35 million in the current year and about £6 million in a full year.  It is estimated that they will support farm incomes by about £12 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>To complete the picture in regard to agriculture I should add that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will be announcing an increase as from the 1st May in the minimum prices to producers of milk in the Dublin and Cork liquid milk areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Manpower and training</i>
    </P>
    <P>In making provision for the Department of Labour for 1971-72 the Government decided to increase significantly the allocation for manpower services and, in particular, the amount for training which is over 20 per cent greater than in 1970-71.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle Oiliúna provide courses, which have already been completed by 700 trainees, in skills in which there are potential shortages and over 200 apprentices have been trained to meet the needs of the building industry.  A survey of vacancies for <Col N="706" /> skilled workers has been carried out by the National Manpower Service.  A register has been prepared and circulated to industry of qualified personnel seeking jobs in Ireland.  In addition, the placement officer service is being strengthened and will soon be in operation over the greater part of the State.</P>
    <P>These measures and others which are being developed under the Government's manpower policy can make an important contribution to the solution of our employment problems.  Increased training is particularly important. By correcting imbalances in the labour market it can help to reduce inflation.  By ensuring that skills are available when required it helps in the promotion of new and developing industries. The additional employment created is not confined to those who have benefited from training since the number of other workers required is often much greater than that of skilled workers.  In the circumstances an additional £200,000 is being allocated this year for the accelerated development of training services under two main headings.</P>
    <P>I propose that a capital allocation of £100,000 will be made to enable AnCO to establish and equip a new training centre where workers will be trained up to fully skilled level.  This project is conditional on the successful outcome of negotiations aimed at ensuring acceptance into the skilled work-force of persons trained in the centre. On the assumption that these negotiations will be successful and that the centre will be set up in a few months time, I am providing £50,000 for operating costs.  The intention is to locate this project in Cork where the shortages of skilled workers threaten to become more serious than elsewhere in the country.  Industrial development plans coming to fruition in the next few years will call for a substantial increase in the numbers of certain categories of skilled workers and special steps must be taken now to ensure that these skills are available in time.</P>
    <P>Another gap in our developing manpower services has been the lack of immediate re-training facilities for workers disemployed, especially in <Col N="707" /> areas heavily dependent on particular industries, where the industry may have to curtail production or close down.  It would improve the prospects of early re-employment of the displaced workers and it could also be a significant attraction to the promoter of a new industry if re-training facilities were provided locally on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis immediately the range of skills required by the new project were known.  To put AnCO in a position to make re-training arrangements available in such circumstances, I propose to set aside for this purpose the remaining £50,000 of the additional sum of £200,000 now being provided.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that young Gaeltacht workers should be trained in the skills required for modern industry of the kind suitable for the Gaeltacht areas. AnCO and Gaeltarra Éireann are in consultation with the aim of establishing a specially-designed training centre in the Gaeltacht.  Training in this centre, provisionally planned for the Donegal Gaeltacht, will be carried out in the Irish language and the contents of courses and other details will be settled by AnCO and Gaeltarra Éireann by reference to the skills needed for projects approved for the Gaeltacht.  I am hopeful of having the centre established before the end of the year.  Expenditure during the current year will not, however, be substantial and I expect that it can be met from moneys already allocated for manpower services and Gaeltacht development.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour will give detailed information on these new training projects when moving the necessary Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Over the years the Government have demonstrated their concern for the position of public service pensioners by a succession of pensions increases which were designed to combat, as far as resources permitted, the effects of inflation on these pensions.  In 1969, the principle of raising public service pensions to parity with those based on current pay levels was accepted but, as indicated at that time, this desirable <Col N="708" /> objective can only be achieved over a number of years because of the substantial cost involved.  Thus, in 1969, pensions were revised by reference to February, 1964 pay levels while last year they were brought forward to June, 1968, pay rates.  The annual cost of these two increases was about £2.8 million.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficult financial circumstances obtaining this year, I have decided to continue the progress of recent years by bringing pensions up to the levels appropriate to pay rates generally in force on 1st June, 1969. This increase will benefit the various groups of public service pensioners including retired civil servants, gardaí, teachers, members of the Defence Forces, local authority staffs and their widows.  Corresponding increases will be paid to recipients of military service pensions and other Army pensions, including special allowances.</P>
    <P>The increases will apply as from 1st October next and will cost about £0.6 million in the current year and almost £1.35 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Military service pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recent years the Government have endeavoured to improve the lot of members of the Old IRA by granting pensions increases and the facility of free travel.  This year, in addition to the increase in pensions which I have just announced, I have given special consideration to the position of the widows of military service pensioners who played such an important role in securing our independence.  I have decided, therefore, that the widow of such a pensioner will be eligible to receive a pension equal to half her husband's pensions subject to a minimum of £1 a week.  This minimum will also be extended to the military service pensioners themselves.  It will take some time to establish the machinery for payment of the new pensions to widows and I propose therefore that both these proposals shall come into effect on 1st October next.  The cost will be £110,000 in the current year and about £280,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free travel</i>
    </P>
    <P>Representations have been made on several occasions to extend the free <Col N="709" /> travel schemes to one group or another but they have had to be refused on the grounds that the ultimate cost would be too great.  There is, however, one deserving group in whose case I would like to make an exception, and where I feel that the social considerations far outweigh the modest cost involved. Parents who have a child for any considerable time in an institution, such as a hospital, a school for the mentally handicapped, or a reformatory or industrial school, should not be prevented from visiting the child because they cannot pay the travelling costs. Apart from the humanitarian aspects involved, parental visits of this kind can have a beneficial psychological effect on the children.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to allow free travel facilities to cover a limited number of visits by the parents of such children in cases where the travelling costs would impose a hardship on the family.</P>
    <P>The details of the scheme have yet to be settled and will be announced as soon as possible.  It is not expected that the cost will exceed £100,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health expenditure and local authority rates</i>
    </P>
    <P>Despite difficult budgetary circumstances, the Government have made a significant contribution to easing the scale of the health demands on local authority rates by providing this year an additional £3.68 million for this purpose over and above the statutory requirement of 50 per cent.  A further £4.8 million was provided in a supplementary estimate last month to make an extra contribution from the Exchequer to health costs which would otherwise have to be met this year from the rates.</P>
    <P>The fast-growing cost of the health services has been imposing an increasingly heavy financial burden on the Exchequer which obviously could not continue to meet this rising demand without seriously adding to the general level of taxation.</P>
    <P>A scheme of compulsory health contributions for the middle income group to ease the burden of health <Col N="710" /> costs on the Exchequer has been under consideration for some time.  The Government have been examining the feasibility of such a scheme and they have now decided to introduce legislation for a scheme of health contributions to be payable by insured persons, farmers and other self-employed persons in the middle income group who are entitled to hospital services under the Health Acts.  Hospital charges for those paying contributions&mdash;at present up to 50p per person per day&mdash;will be abolished and all hospital services will be available free of charge to contributors from the commencement of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Subject to the necessary legislation being passed, the scheme will be brought into operation later in the present financial year.  When it is fully in operation, contributions will be related to the insured person's income.  Initially, however, so as to enable the scheme to be brought into operation in 1971-72, contributions will be at a flat rate.  The contribution income from the scheme is expected to amount to £2 million in the present financial year and this has been taken into account in the estimates. Full details will be given by the Minister for Health in introducing the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>I must now turn from the pleasant task of making budgetary concessions to the more difficult one of finding money to pay for them.  The reliefs I have announced will cost £9.37 million, and when account is taken of the small opening surplus, they leave me with the problem of raising a total of £9.25 million.  While, for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  I am reluctant to increase the rates of indirect taxation, circumstances outside my immediate control leave me with no alternative to increasing the rates of duty on beer and spirits.</P>
    <P>The brewers and the distillers have made application to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for permission to raise the prices of their products because of increases in their costs.  The brewers are seeking an increase of half a new penny on the pint of beer; some of them have asked for more than that. <Col N="711" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce, after a thorough examination of their operating costs, is prepared to allow them to raise their prices by the equivalent of just under half a new penny on the pint of beer.  This would, of course, give rise to difficulty in fixing the retail price of the half pint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce would not agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed, therefore, to let the price of beer rise by the equivalent of one new penny on the pint and to take 0.55 new pence of this in the form of an increase in the rate of duty including turnover tax.  This will yield £1 million to the Exchequer this year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Spirits</i>
      </P>
      <P>The distillers have applied for an increase representing less than half a new penny on the glass of spirits and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is prepared to accede to this request which he considers justifiable by increased costs including pay increases. Here again, prices would, of necessity, advance by more than the amount sought for the same reasons as I mentioned in relation to beer.</P>
      <P>I propose, therefore, that the price of a glass of all spirits will rise by the equivalent of 2 new pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a rounding up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of home-produced spirits the duty content (including turnover tax) will take 1.6 new pence and the distillers will take 0.26 new pence.  The duty (including turnover tax) on United Kingdom spirits will also be increased by 1.6 new pence and the duty (including turnover tax) on other imported spirits will be increased by 1.86 new pence. These increases in duty will yield £1 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of the increase of 2 new pence in each case will go to the trade.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that the increases for the trade are necessary to meet increased <Col N="712" /> costs.  He will not be prepared to tolerate increases at retail level of more than 2 new pence on the glass of spirits, I new penny on the half-glass, I new penny on the pint of beer and half a new penny on the half-pint.</P>
    <P>The increases in duty on beer and spirits will take effect from 12 o'clock to-night.  I estimate that the duty changes I have mentioned will increase the cost-of-living index by less than 0.4 of a point.  Apart from these increases in the duty on beer and spirits, which are part and parcel of adjustments arising from price applications, I do not propose any further changes in indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the circumstances which I have outlined I find it essential to have recourse to income taxation to provide a considerable part of the additional revenue needed.  I decided that an increase in the standard rate of income tax, which would of course apply to companies' profits as well as to personal incomes, should be avoided since these profits were singled out for additional taxation in the autumn budget of last year.  As an alternative, I propose to repeal with effect from the current year the provisions under which the first £100 of taxable income is charged at two-thirds of the standard rate.  The maximum additional burden which this will impose on any taxpayer will be less than £1 a month.  At the same time the minimum allowance for purposes of earned income relief will be raised from £125 to £150 for single and widowed persons and from £225 to £250 for married persons.  This means that approximately 20,000 taxpayers will be removed from the income tax net altogether and that single and widowed persons with incomes below £449 and £474, respectively, and married persons with incomes below £724 will pay less tax than for last year.  Appropriate adjustments will be made in respect of age relief and small income relief.</P>
    <P>The effect of these measures, taken together, will be to improve the position of taxpayers in the lowest income brackets and to spread the burden of the increased taxation evenly <Col N="713" /> amongst the remainder.  The net gain to the Exchequer is estimated at £5.0 million in the current year and £5.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New reliefs</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have received a number of representations urging that relief from income tax be given in various special circumstances.  Although this year is not an opportune one for major concessions, I propose to grant relief in two cases of hardship which merit immediate recognition.</P>
    <P>An unmarried mother who undertakes the care of her child does not qualify under existing law for the housekeeper allowance.  I intend to provide that that allowance will be granted where the mother is engaged full-time in employment or business and requires the services of a housekeeper to care for the child.  I have also been greatly impressed by the case for exceptional treatment for blind persons.  The Finance Bill will therefore contain a provision according, for income tax purposes, a special allowance of £100 to a blind person and of £200 where husband and wife are both blind.  The qualifying degree of blindness will be determined in consultation with the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax avoidance</i>
    </P>
    <P>I also propose to deal with certain avoidance devices which have come to notice in the income tax field.</P>
    <P>Some persons whose foreign income is chargeable to Irish tax on the basis of the amounts remitted here have been avoiding tax by applying the foreign income abroad in repayment of loans enjoyed in this country.  This loophole will be closed.</P>
    <P>I also propose to introduce a provision to mitigate the loss of revenue due to the exploitation of the income tax provisions governing the cessation of a trade, profession or vocation.  The provision will bring under review not only the assessment for the penultimate year but also that for the year before that.</P>
    <P>An anomaly relating to covenants made by parents in favour of their children in the year of birth will also be removed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" />
      <i>Interest on unpaid tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under existing law, tax which remains unpaid for more than three months attracts interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum.  Having regard to the prevailing level of interest rates, the 6 per cent is no longer adequate. I propose therefore to raise it to 9 per cent and to reduce the period of grace from three months to two months.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, interest is not chargeable on tax which is in arrear if the assessment is under appeal. In such cases, interest does not ordinarily become chargeable until the amount of tax in dispute has been finally determined.  There is evidence of some abuse of this deferment of the interest liability and so I propose that tax in an assessment under appeal will become due on the same date as it would have applied if there had been no appeal.  This will be modified where a satisfactory payment on account is made within two months from the due date and any balance is paid within two months from the settlement of the appeal.  Any overpayment of tax which emerges on settlement of an appeal will, of course, be repaid with interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that these proposals will improve collection this year to the extent of £2 million.</P>
    <P>I propose that where tax is undercharged because of fraud or neglect, interest will run from the dates on which the tax would have been payable if there had been no fraud or neglect.  This will not affect tax for any year earlier than 1971-72.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Company taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed in many quarters at the present burden of taxation on company profits.  But when our present combined income tax and corporation profits tax rates of 58 per cent are compared with the rates prevailing in other countries, it is often overlooked that under our system the shareholder is not taxed again to income tax on the dividends he receives out of the company profits.  The result is that, effectively, company tax is paid, in many cases, at a rate much lower than 58 per cent.  In the United Kingdom, <Col N="715" /> for example, in addition to the tax paid by the company on its profits, the individual shareholder must pay tax on his dividends out of those profits.  But in this country, if the company distributes 40 per cent of its pre-tax profits to its shareholders the rate effectively borne by the Irish company on its profits is not 58 per cent but 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>In making any judgment on our rate of company taxation account must be taken of the complete relief from tax accorded to profits from new or increased exports and of the very valuable allowances for capital investment. These concessions substantially mitigate the tax charge on the profits of most industries.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the continuing need to encourage investment in our industries, and I believe that the tax relief for such investment is the most effective means to this end.  The initial allowance of 60 per cent for machioery or plant is given for investment of this type up to 31st March, 1971.  As a special measure to encourage a concentration of capital investment in 1971-72 and 1972-73, I propose to apply free depreciation to the whole country for a limited period.  This will apply to expenditure incurred between 1st April, 1971, and 31st March, 1973, on new machinery and plant, other than road vehicles.  It will enable an industrialist to write off 100 per cent of his expenditure in the first year if he so desires.  It is my hope that this may act as a major stimulus to greater investment in manufacturing industry and thus stimulate economic activity and make a decisive contribution towards improving our competitive position and reducing unemployment. I must make it clear that this exceptional arrangement will not be continued beyond 31st March, 1973. Industrialists who wish to share its benefits must therefore act quickly. Free depreciation will not involve any cost to the Exchequer until 1972-73. The extra cost is estimated at £2.75 million for that year and at £5.66 million for 1973-74.</P>
    <P>Free depreciation is available at present in the designated areas.  In <Col N="716" /> order to preserve their comparative advantage I propose to introduce, also for a period of two years only, a system of investment allowances for new machinery and plant&mdash;other than road vehicles&mdash;used in those areas. The rate of allowance will be 20 per cent.  It will be given in addition to free depreciation.  The essential feature of the investment allowance is that it is not treated as diminishing the cost of the machinery or plant for purposes of free depreciation or annual allowance, nor is it taken into account in computing a balancing allowance or balancing charge.</P>
    <P>The first year in which the new investment allowance will be felt as a cost to the Exchequer will be 1972-73. The cost for that year is estimated at £0.22 million and £0.44 million for 1973-74.  I also propose to continue for a further two years up to 31st March, 1973, the period of operation of the existing initial allowance of 20 per cent in respect of expenditure on industrial buildings.  I propose to introduce an inexpensive relief relating to the taxation of profits whereby allowance will be given, as a business expense, for the cost of registration or renewal of trade marks.</P>
    <P>I have considered the question of continuing the exemption from corporation profits tax granted to certain public utility companies and other concerns. As this extends to building societies whose operations are at present the subject of investigation by an interdepartmental working group, I have decided to continue the exemption for only one year pending receipt of the group's report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Death duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>The present scale of rates of estate duty has remained unchanged since 1961.  This year I am proposing to increase the rates for estates over £55,000 in value.  Above that point, the rate of 30 per cent will be raised to 33 per cent and the rates applicable to estates of greater value will be scaled upwards to a maximum of 55 per cent, instead of 40 per cent, on estates of over £200,000.  The rate of interest on duty in arrear, which has remained unchanged at 4 per cent since 1919, will <Col N="717" /> be brought up to a more realistic 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is unfair that estate duty on personal property should bear interest from the date of death of the deceased and accordingly I propose that duty on such property should be free of interest for four months after the death.  Interest on duty on real estate does not, of course, commence to accrue until after 12 months from the date of death.  I have decided that further relief from estate duty should be granted in cases where an estate passes to a widow.  At present, where duty is payable by a widow, it is abated by a sum of £1,000 together with a sum of £500 for each dependent child.  I propose that these abatements be increased to £1,500 and £750 respectively.  This will mean that where an estate passes to a widow and there are no dependent children, no duty will be payable unless the estate is over £15,300.  If there are two dependent children, the effective exemption limit will be £21,400; if there are four dependent children, the exemption limit will be £28,000 and if there are six dependent children, the exemption limit will be £33,000.</P>
    <P>Complaints are often made that wealthy people can escape their due share of the burden of death duties by various avoidance measures.  I am satisfied that many of these complaints are well-founded and I propose to remove some of them by strengthening the death duty code when the Finance Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>The better known avoidance devices include the use of private family companies where the statutory definitions of &ldquo;companies controlled by the deceased&rdquo; and of &ldquo;relatives&rdquo; are unduly narrow; the purchase of land outside the State; the &ldquo;grant and lease-back&rdquo; of land; and the concessionary provisions in relation to gifts and artistic objects.  In addition to dealing with these devices, I propose to revise the provisions for the artificial valuation of agricultural land to ensure that duty will be payable on the market value if the land is sold within six years after the death.</P>
    <P>The provisions for collection from trustees and beneficiaries will be <Col N="718" /> widened in certain cases and the penalty provisions for failure to comply with the Estate Duty Acts will be brought up to date.</P>
    <P>These charges are estimated to yield an additional net sum of £250,000 in the current year and £1 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax reform</i>
    </P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the general question of company taxation in this country has been under active examination for some time.  I expect to publish the results of some aspects of the examination, and my views as to the conclusions to be drawn from those results, before the end of this financial year.  This subject is currently engaging attention in the European Economic Community with particular reference to the harmonisation of the structures of corporation taxes and of the taxation system applied to dividends. Developments in these and other areas will have to be taken into account in determining the path to be followed here.  Having regard to the close connection between company taxation and personal taxation, we must be quite satisfied about the most suitable system of company taxation for our particular circumstances before embarking on any radical restructuring of the personal taxation system.  The question whether the effective burden of tax on companies can be reduced will, of course, receive attention in the course of this examination.</P>
    <P>The last decade has seen a profound change in the structure of our taxation system.  From being a simple machine for the collection of revenue on a relatively narrow economic base, it has evolved into a more flexible instrument for economic and social reform.  The introduction of the turnover tax and wholesale tax in the mid-sixties helped to broaden its base and reduce the heavy dependence on a few major revenue-earners.  The transformation of the sales taxes into a value-added tax early next year will mark another major step in the evolution of an efficient and flexible system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Value-added tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government recently issued a White Paper on the proposed value-added <Col N="719" /> tax.  Copies have been sent to all persons registered for the turnover and wholesale taxes and I would urge them to familiarise themselves as early as possible with the broad principles of the new system.  Copies have also been sent to the trade associations who have been asked to convey their views to the Revenue Commissioners before 1st June, 1971.  When the suggestions have been examined, a draft Bill will be prepared and circulated.  I hope that this will be done before the Summer Recess.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the value-added tax are designed to effect a conversion from the existing system of sales taxation in such a way that the incidence of tax will remain as nearly as possible unchanged.  Representations for various reliefs and exemptions under the new system have been made to me, but I consider that it would be preferable to avoid any major alterations in the scope or impact of the tax at the time of the changeover.  I shall, however, look at the position most carefully when the new tax is fully in operation and shall consider what modifications might be desirable.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of admission to the EEC will be that our general tax policy will be affected by the fiscal and budgetary aspects of the Community's plan for economic and monetary integration.  Recent agreements within the EEC, based on the &ldquo;Werner&rdquo; proposals, provide for the creation of an institutional framework for co-ordinating monetary and fiscal policies among member countries.  The plan includes proposals for the harmonisation of the structures of the principal excise taxes, the adoption of a common system of value-added tax and the standardisation of the form of company taxation.  These steps will be followed by the gradual harmonisation of the rates of the excise taxes and the value-added tax.  Depending on the level at which the harmonisation of rates takes place&mdash;and this is, as yet, not known&mdash;substantial changes in the incidence of our existing indirect taxes could be required, which would have repercussions throughout the whole tax system.  It would be unwise, therefore, to undertake further major reforms at <Col N="720" /> this juncture when our needs and commitments <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EEC are as yet unclear.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary balance</i>
    </P>
    <P>The concessions and the tax increases which I have announced bring revenue and current expenditure into balance at £551 million which is £61 million or 12½ per cent greater than the outturn in 1970-71.</P>
    <P>My main concern has been to arrest the strong upward trend of current expenditure in recent years and to minimise additional taxation in the interest of safeguarding the National Pay Agreement.</P>
    <P>This year's policy on additional taxation precludes the possibility of budgeting for a surplus which could be used to finance capital investment, but I shall endeavour to keep the option open for future years.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the main thrust of budgetary policy will be found not so much in the changes announced to-day as in the severe pruning of the Government expenditure programme as set out in the volume of estimates and the Capital Budget booklet which were published last week.  Substantial reductions have been made right across the board and it will be the Government's responsibility, as it is our firm resolution, to ensure that these reductions are achieved throughout the year even though we know that this may entail some hardship and the disappointing of reasonable expectations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have now completed the budgetary presentation for 1971.  Its main purpose is to retard the rate of inflation which has depressed the economy in recent years.  I do not think that the general public, the worker, the man in the street, even the business man, fully appreciates the horror of unchecked inflation.  Both employers and trade unions have a common interest here, even though they may disagree about cause and effect.  I would like them to consider using their influence jointly with the Government to alert the community to the hazards of inflation. The Government are determined to use this Budget, with the co-operation <Col N="721" /> of the community, to ensure that we hold inflationary trends in check.  There is no joy in being a millionaire if you must pay £1 for a box of matches.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the importance of maintaining the terms of the National Pay Agreement because I believe that it contains the greatest promise, not only for 1971 but for the following years, if the spirit of co-operation and voluntary restraint underlying it can be prolonged and extended.  It could form the foundation of a better structure of industrial relations, help us on the road to full employment and reduce the inflation which continues to hamper the economy and inflict hardship on many sections of our people. The substantial economies in Government spending and the restraint in adding to the tax burden are designed to create a climate favourable to the implementation and development of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Our target of 3 per cent for economic growth is modest compared with our underlying potential, but if it is realised in 1971 it will greatly facilitate further growth in 1972.</P>
    <P>My budgetary strategy necessarily limits the amount available for concessions but I believe that I have distributed it to maximum advantage. While some expectations may have been disappointed, I think there should be little reason for serious complaint. I believe that our people in general will welcome the Budget as a rational attempt to restore order and balance in the economy and I shall be satisfied if it is so received.</P>
    <P>Our people have in the past decade <Col N="722" /> achieved a great deal.  Our economy has been transformed.  We have made a rapid transition from a predominantly agricultural economy to a modern industrial State.  Today, the products of our new factories, the products of Irish skill and craftsmanship are on the markets of the world.  The fruits of the economic advance of the past decade are evident in higher living standards and a continuing improvement in our social services, in health services and in educational opportunities.  This Budget is designed to protect the gains we have made and to ensure that all we have achieved does not vanish in an inflationary whirlpool.  It aims to get us back on course towards a soundly based prosperity. We want to see real economic growth creating the new wealth which alone will enable us to build a better. more humane and more enlightened society for all our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget marks time because neither the Minister nor the Government have the inclination or the political courage or the unity to take the action they know to be necessary.  The Minister concluded by referring to an inflationary whirlpool. The word &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; runs through this Budget Statement as it ran through the Budget Statements of October, 1970, of April, 1970, and of May, 1969. Inflation is an economic disease which corrodes and destroys the earning power of the people; it forces up living costs, endangers employment and results inevitably in the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer.</P>
      <P>The competence and the dedication of any government ought well be judged by the manner in which they face up to and deal with this danger. It is interesting to record that in the 1969 Budget, Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Finance, having made the usual references to inflation concluded by saying:</P>
      <P>I dare to hope that this Budget will be regarded as enlightened and that it will take its place in the financial calender as one which made a real contribution to improving the present, and safeguarding the future, for the ordinary people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Enlightenment was singularly lacking because inflation continued and the Budget of this time 12 months ago which was read by the Taoiseach in the regretted absence of Deputy Haughey was concluded with a statement which again referred to inflation. The Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget seeks, by a judicious redistribution of incomes, to protect those worst hit by inflation from its severest impact.  If its purpose is recognised and its message of social concern accepted, then the one tax change it contains will be looked upon simply as a tempering, in the interests of justice, of increases already received and not as a stimulus to further demand.  I believe that it will, and that the balance of equity having now to some extent been restored, all sections will combine in restraint to give the nation and <Col N="740" /> the economy the respite it urgently needs.</P>
    <P>Great beliefs and great expectations but inflation continued.  Then on 28th October last the Minister at the conclusion of the autumn Budget Statement said:</P>
    <P>It is our firm belief that the measures we are now taking will give it a breathing space in which to recover from the effects of the inflationary developments of the past year or two.  This short pause will give the economy time to renew its strength and resume the advance towards the realisation of its full potential for economic and social expansion.</P>
    <P>Fine words and pious expectations but today we have an inflationary whirlpool if we are to accept the concluding words of the Minister's statement. Confidence in a government is generally desirable but competence from a government is absolutely essential.  The management of the country's economy during recent years by a stale and a tired Fianna Fáil administration has been a sorry story of mistake heaped upon mistake.  Our inflation, instead of being controlled by the Government, has been compounded by the Government's own incompetence.  Here we are in 1971 with no incomes policy and no prices policy.  We have excessive Government expenditure and we have inflated and highly dangerous foreign borrowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion has already collapsed in disorder and disarray. Our Third Programme, if we are to accept the Government's own review, is now tottering towards the same destination.  Look at what transpires: the planned population increase is 34,000 instead of the 74,000 that was to be expected; employment at this stage is 1,000 less than the increase of 7,000 envisaged in the Third Programme; unemployment is up this year by 7,000 instead of being reduced by 13,000 as envisaged in the Third Programme; output, instead of 4½ per cent; as envisaged, is merely 2¾ per cent; agricultural output is down by 3 per cent instead of being up by 4¼ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> Exports are one-third off target. Housing investment is down by 9 per cent.  Investment in education about which we hear so much is 40 per cent below target.  This is what is to be reported at this stage when this Budget is introduced but public expenditure and taxation is 40 per cent higher than was envisaged in the Third Programme drawn up only two years ago.  Therefore from this incompetence, from this failure even to observe the rules which this Government laid down for themselves we have had in the last two to three years a period of steeply rising Government expenditure, an inevitable but gradual slowing of the growth of national output; we have had steeply rising prices and rising costs, building up to a real threat to our competitive position in international trading, while looming over the entire economic situation there is now almost a chronic balance of payments deficit of £60 million to £63 million or £64 million.</P>
    <P>This is in all respects a blueprint for disaster and it stems directly from the fact that a divided and feuding Fianna Fáil Party have not been able to give to the affairs of the people the prudent, careful and competent management which they require.  The quarterly bulletin and report of the Central Bank, published last Saturday, gives this verdict, this judgement on the events of the last year, and coming from an objective source it surely is the most complete indictment that any Government would have to meet.  On page 5 of the report there is this paragraph:</P>
    <P>To look back on developments in 1970 is disagreeable.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with that.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the health of the economy would be gravely threatened by a continuance of a deterioration which has left Ireland with one of the highest inflation rates in the western world, with a growth of national production cut to less than half its potential by excessive costs increases and prolonged industrial disputes, with unemployment raised and a balance of payments deficit running in a third year at far too high a level.</P>
    <P>That certainly is an indictment which <Col N="742" /> questions the confidence and the dedication to their task not merely of the Minister or of the Taoiseach but of every member of the Government.  The last three years have been wasted years &mdash;inefficiency, concern about other things, looking over their shoulders instead of having their minds on their jobs.  But who suffers?  Who are the people who have to pay the price for the mistakes and the inefficiency of Fianna Fáil?  I will tell you.  It is the women, the wage earners, the poor, the social welfare recipients, the pensioners, those living on fixed incomes, the people who have been hit by soaring prices, particularly in the last 12 months, hit to such an extent that at this time there can be reported a 10 per cent rise in living costs over the last 12 month period, the highest rise known.  It is this, in chief, that has been felt by the poorest in the land.</P>
    <P>People in employment, those who 12 months ago looked forward with confidence to being able to continue in decent employment have had to pay the price in the last 12 months.  Irish firms and companies fighting merely for a place in our own home market have gone into bankruptcy and liquidation, hit by inflation and hit by excessive taxation, with the result that unemployment has now reached 70,000, a figure which last week was quickly and notionally reduced by a dole order and even this operation could not be carried out efficiently by the Government.  The people generally have suffered.  Our growth rate, on the eve of a possible entry into Europe, in this last 12 months has been less than 2 per cent with, as I said, a balance of payments deficit of £62 million.</P>
    <P>What does this Budget do?  What does it propose to do in relation to this situation?  In the first place this Budget is phony.  This Budget does not face up to what is needed.  The Minister in this Budget has taken a buoyancy figure of £54 million, making an allowance for £6½ million overflow of taxation from last year.  Whether he gets that buoyancy figure or not, he is making no allowance whatever for £15 million to £17 million which experience shows will have to be provided for unprovided increases in expenditure. Even in relation to the full <Col N="743" /> year there is, under his own figures, a gap between revenue and expenditure of at least £3 million so that this Budget is budgeting for a deficit because the Minister has neither the will, nor the united will behind him, to be able to do what is required and face up to the problems.  This is a two-way bet in so far as budgeting is concerned, making sure that if the divisions lead to an election they will have something to go on.</P>
    <P>Also in this Budget the reliefs in relation to companies will have no effect until next year so that they will have no remedial effect in mitigating the disastrous increases in company taxation imposed last October.  There is at the moment a situation as a result of the recent British Budget in which British companies competing for the Irish home market now carry the benediction of the Irish Government because they have a tax position of 40 per cent while Irish companies, endeavouring to retain their position in the home market, must pay taxation at the rate of 58 per cent.  Of course every week there are companies going into liquidation, companies going bankrupt and decent workers are being thrown out of work.  The Minister knows that that was an error made last year and it is a big man and a principled man who would accept that he made an error and take steps to remedy it.  The Minister has not done it and the allowance made in relation to depreciation does not go one-quarter of the way and has no effect in my view in relation to this year.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister let one cat out of the bag in this Budget.  He has to provide in this Budget, he says, £550,000 for the payment of unemployment assistance to men without dependants in urban areas.  Did every Deputy note that?  If you look at the Book of Estimates you will see that a saving of £1.6 million in unemployment assistance was provided for. There was no error in the dole order; it is now perfectly clear that the dole order was the decision of a Government which panicked when the events were known.  It is about time this Government began to come clean with the people.  Once again some poor, civil <Col N="744" /> servant had to be blamed; once again some unnamed individual was asked to face the fire because the Government boobed and they knew it.  Thank God there was a vigilant Opposition to find out what they were doing and ensure that the poorest of the poor would get what they were entitled to get.</P>
    <P>In the Budget the Minister provides some relief for widows and deserted wives.  I am glad he took notice of the Fine Gael motion advocating this which was discussed in the Dáil some three weeks ago.  I am glad he has done something in relation to pension parity as advocated so often from these benches.  May I, in a personal way, refer to health insurance?  How many times and to what purpose was the idea of a health insurance scheme advocated from these benches?  Not only was it advocated but a detailed scheme, costed and worked out, was handed over to a previous Minister for Health but the demands in that regard were consistently rejected but now we have health insurance, compulsory health insurance to provide for the hospital costs of the middle income group.  The mountain was in labour and produced a right scrawny mouse&mdash;hospital bills. It is a pity that the Government in the end, having realised the futility of their stand on health insurance, did not take a reasonable step forward and begin to think of what is going to come here as sure as day follows night, a comprehensive medical scheme based on the principle of insurance and available to all the population.  That is what we stand for and this, at least, is a beginning and to that extent we welcome it.</P>
    <P>I note also a hasty last-minute provision made in the Budget for industrial training.  Again, that is something that has been pointed out from these benches to no avail.  It took the comment in the OECD Economy Survey to galvanise the Government into action and so some partial step is being taken to improve industrial training.</P>
    <P>Having said that, let me turn to taxation. The Minister was warned in the Central Bank report of the danger involved in increasing taxation this year. <Col N="745" /> He was advised not only by the Central Bank but by other institutions and people as to the need to restrict Government expenditure.  We now have an increase in taxation.  I suggest that it is wrong, that it is dangerous.  I am quite certain that a considerable amount of Government expenditure could be cut without harming the economy, without endangering employment.  One has just to look at the Book of Estimates. You will see that Government expenditure on entertainment is being increased by £30,000 this year.  What is the meaning of that kind of increase?  It has gone up to £75,000 in a year in which moderation is required but the Minister stands over that while at the same time every single man, unemployed and unable to work in rural Ireland, is knocked off the few shillings unemployment assistance that he is entitled to expect but sumptuous dining can go on.  Every person associated with the establishment may continue to spend money on entertainment&mdash;double it, if you please&mdash;at a time when moderation is urgently required.</P>
    <P>There is to be an increase in taxation. I want to remind the House in regard to income tax that the Minister now provides that the first £100 that every taxpayer earns will be liable to full tax.  Shades of Deputy MacEntee. When he was a Member of this House he used refer to a poll tax and rightly said it was regressive taxation, that it was wrong, unfair and regrettable. Under this proposal every married man, even the lowest paid worker, will pay the same increase as the richest man in Ireland.  He will pay £11 and this is supposed to be taxation which is paraded here as being socially just.  The only people excluded are single people earning up to £9 per week and married people earning up to £14 per week. Would the Minister indicate what class of worker is in that category today in Ireland?  They are the only people excluded from this poll tax of £11 per year.</P>
    <P>I think this increase in taxation is highly dangerous.  We have a delicate balance of forces potentially dangerous to the future of the country.  The Minister, instead of facing up to his obligation to match Government expenditure <Col N="746" /> to the needs of the time, has erred in imposing this burden and I fear the consequences.</P>
    <P>This is the 14th year of the present Fianna Fáil administration and the 14th time that a spring Budget has been introduced and I think the 25th or 26th time that budgetary proposals have been brought forward by Fianna Fáil Ministers.  The 14 years in which this Administration have been in office have been marked by cloudy thinking, by leadership which at times has been indecisive.  Great expansion has taken place throughout western Europe and during these 14 years the living standards of the ordinary people in western Europe have been enhanced and advanced.  Here, despite all the programming which has been announced and despite all the planning which has been trumpeted abroad, we have achieved a growth figure which has averaged only 4 per cent.  The tragedy is that we have been proud of this, not realising that the growth rate is significantly lower than that of any other country in western Europe.  The result is that during these 14 years the gap between this country and the rest of Europe has widened significantly and dramatically.</P>
    <P>The Second Economic Programme has collapsed and the Third Programme is well on its way to collapse.  The people are losing confidence in their country, I regret to say, and this is reflected in the steep decline in real terms of national savings.  This has forced the Government to go outside the country to borrow dearly.  In the last two years over £1 million has been borrowed from abroad and further borrowing is envisaged this year.  By reason of the Government's incompetence they have, unfortunately, been mortgaging the future of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>This Government has been so dishonest during the last two years that it is not easy for us to accept that this is the only Budget for the year 1971-72.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech can only be described as a patch up or temporary job.  As far as this Budget is concerned, it appears to me that the Government are merely taking out insurance against the possibility of a general election this year.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister realises the reflection he has made on recent former Ministers for Finance when, by inference, he accused them of over-expenditure and by inference suggested that the inflationary situation we have at the present time is due to increased indirect taxation?  If anybody expects the Minister's proposals are going to correct the serious ills that the country is suffering from at the present time they have another think coming.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said nothing new in his Budget speech.  He has not made any concrete suggestions for curing the five main difficulties we have at present. We cannot accept the word of the Taoiseach&mdash;although this has been a device used in the past by various Ministers for Finance&mdash;who, prior to the Budget, told people in Cork that it was going to be a &ldquo;tough Budget&rdquo;. I have my reservations about the Budget proposals, both those which give things and those which take away things, but I do not think this Budget can be said to be as tough a Budget as the 1963 Budget which introduced the turnover tax, a subsequent Budget which introduced the wholesale tax and another Budget which increased turnover tax.  For this reason we are entitled to be suspicious and are entitled not to accept the word of the Minister for Finance that this is the final bill to the nation for this particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his advisers should <Col N="748" /> have been in a position to prepare proposals to ensure that there would be no further imposts on the taxpayers. I do not know what the Taoiseach meant by a &ldquo;tough Budget&rdquo;, I do not know whether or not he wanted to frighten his followers, and I do not know whether or not this is the only sort of Budget which will keep the Fianna Fáil Party together.</P>
    <P>As far as budgetary policy is concerned, the Minister subscribes to the view that there should be five main objectives.  In a television interview recently he said that the Budget was an instrument which should attempt to aim at full employment, growth in the economy, ensure favourable balance of payments, ensure price stability and&mdash; most important of all&mdash;ensure an equitable distribution of the country's wealth.  Despite what the Minister has done in his social welfare proposals and despite the changes he proposes in the income tax code, he has not gone any appreciable way towards coming to the assistance of those who at the present time are forced to live on such miserable incomes.  I do not believe either that he has made any attempt to ask the people who &ldquo;have&rdquo; to bear the biggest share of the burden in order that those who &ldquo;have not&rdquo; could get a little more of the national cake.</P>
    <P>This is one of the few Budget documents which in its index does not include a paragraph on &ldquo;employment or unemployment&rdquo;.  The Minister paid little if any attention at all to the problems of unemployment and redundancy. This document does not deal in any detail with the problems of economic growth, balance of payments or price stability&mdash;perhaps I should say instability&mdash;for which the Government are entirely responsible.</P>
    <P>I recently read a speech made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;a speech which was sent to every Deputy&mdash;to the Confederation of Irish Industries at which one of the EEC Commissioners in Brussels, Signor Spinelli, was present.  In that speech the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave the impression&mdash; although I am sure his Irish audience were not impressed&mdash;to the Commissioner that Ireland, with just a few reservations, was now ready to become <Col N="749" /> a member of the EEC.  Again, he did not mention employment.  He was not over anxious to talk about our adverse balance of payments and he was not over anxious to talk about the lack of growth in the economy over the last ten years.  We in the Labour Party are practical people and our concern is to see that men and women are employed in this country at good wages and salaries.  I do not think our unemployment record does us any credit when we come down to facts and figures.  The rate averaged 7.2 per cent in 1970.  It is twice as high as the British rate.  More than that, it is the highest rate of unemployment, with one or two exceptions perhaps, of any country in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>We have to judge this Government under the headings of full employment, economic growth, balance of payments, price stability and an equitable distribution of the country's wealth.  We cannot hide the fact that in 1970 there was a drop of 7,000 in the numbers employed compared to an increase of 6,000 in the numbers employed in 1969. This may be explained away by various excuses made by the Minister for Finance and members of the Government front bench.  We know, of course, that they have been for quite a long time now preoccupied with their own internal difficulties and they have not much concern or, should I say, being charitable towards them, not much time for thinking about the unemployment figures, or much time for reading those newspapers which report thousands of redundancies, particularly over the last three months, and the closure of factories all over the country.</P>
    <P>Last year, 1970, was the worst in many respects for the last ten years. The increase in non-agricultural jobs was only 5,000.  In 1970 there was a drop of 12,000 in rural employment. Mark you, the significant thing is that, when we talk about economic growth, that increase of 5,000 was represented by an increase in employment as far as the services were concerned, a very poor performance indeed, due mainly to the last Budget, the Budget that was delivered here by the Taoiseach and arising mainly because of mismanagement of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> Last year's Budget had, of course, the effect of increasing prices&mdash;the Minister will admit this&mdash;by 3 per cent to 4 per cent.  The Government cannot be held blameless because of their neglect in the bank strike and the cement strike, both of which were responsible to a very large extent for the drop in the numbers of those who were employed.  The building industry dropped 5,000 in employment last year. The Government cannot claim that they were not entirely responsible remembering that this is a semi-State concern.  In that situation and in the situation of the bank strike we saw the Minister for Labour shelving responsibility and in blasé fashion announcing he had no function.  We would like to know what function has the Minister for Labour. He has something to do in Social Welfare but, as far as Labour is concerned, it is one of the Ministries which, if it is not going to be properly occupied, should be scrapped.</P>
    <P>Both these strikes depressed manufacturing in 1970.  I do not think we can boast of our record particularly when we remember the First, the Second and the Third Programmes for Economic Expansion and remember that, in the ten years from 1960 to 1970, the total increase in the numbers at work was only 11,000.  I think it was the First Programme for Economic Expansion which said that, in order to achieve full employment by 1975&mdash;I think that was the year&mdash;we needed an increase at the rate of 7,000 to 8,000 workers a year.  The NIEC estimate for full employment was 100,000 jobs during the period 1960 to 1970.</P>
    <P>The Government failed miserably in achieving that target because, for every ten jobs that were needed, only one was provided.  That is a shameful record for a party alleged to have promised away back in the fifties 100,000 new jobs.  It is a shameful record for the party that boasts about the number of industries that have been established.  It is a shameful thing for a party which now wants to lead us into Europe, as a full member, to take the full blast of the competition not alone from those in the Six but from the other applicant countries as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> This is the story, not alone in respect of 1970 but in respect of every year for the past ten years.  It is an indication of the failure of the Government party not just for one year but for the last ten years.  Last year, apart altogether from the political situation, was the worst year for ten years as far as economic growth is concerned.  Gross national product increased by only 1½ per cent in 1970 compared with 4 per cent in 1969 and 7.9 per cent in 1968. I do not think we have had a full explanation from the Minister as to the reason for this.  The only reason we can give is the ineptitude of the Government and their blasé attitude towards the electorate and, particularly, towards the working people. Gross national product is not expected to increase very much in 1971.  Last year was bad.  This year, if we heed what we have been told, will be no better.</P>
    <P>We wonder why there was no mention in the Minister's speech today or in any public utterances anywhere of the Third Programme for Economic Expansion.  What has happened to it? Was it just another try-on?  Was it another pie-in-the-sky effort offered to unfortunate people who have no jobs or whose jobs are unsafe for various reasons?</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the building industry and talked about the poor performance in 1970.  In 1970 in the building industry there was a drop of 3 per cent in output.  In the agricultural industry there was a rise of only ½ per cent.  I have not had time to examine the details, but I do not believe the £4 million or £5 million the Minister now proposes to devote to agriculture will improve output to any degree in that particular industry this year.  The Minister must realise, as must his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, that this silly exercise of throwing £100,000 there, £500,000 here and £2 million somewhere else will not make the agricultural industry the viable and profitable industry it should be.  The Minister has got to realise that there must be more thinking as to how agriculture should be developed, not only financially but structurally as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> In 1970 there was a rise of only 3 per cent in industrial output compared with 7 per cent in 1969.  I know there were various factors at work last year, apart from the political crisis we had. We had the bank strike and the cement strike.  There was also&mdash;we recognise this and I am sure members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who are honest enough to admit it, must recognise it as well&mdash;an absolute lack of confidence by the public in the Government because of the antics of various members of the Fianna Fáil Party in matters which had nothing to do with the welfare of the country.  There was no leadership.  There was no guidance. There were contradictory statements. There were allegations and counter-allegations. How could one expect that in industry, even in the Civil Service or in agriculture, there could be any confidence, there could be any trust in a Government that engaged in such scandalous brawls during 1970?  They were preoccupied with their internal party affairs and neglected&mdash;they must have neglected&mdash;their public duties during all that awful period.</P>
    <P>A Government must be judged on the balance of payments situation and in this again they have a very sorry record.  In this as well they have failed. What has happened since 1967?  In 1967, as far as the balance of payments was concerned, we had a surplus of £15 million.  In a short three years this surplus of £15 million has been turned into a deficit in 1970 of £62 million? We are told by the forecasters, if we can believe them, that the deficit for 1971 will be in the region of £80 million. Is there anything at all in this Budget Statement that tries to do anything in order that at least the forecast figure of £80 million will be substantially reduced?  One of the main objectives of a Budget is to correct the balance of payments.  There does not seem to me to be anything exciting or outstanding in the Minister's proposals that would correct it.  The last three Budgets have failed in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not remember hearing the Minister mention five words that were very much on the lips of members of the Fianna Fáil Party six years ago&mdash;the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> Perhaps the Minister could tell us something about this.  We contend that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement is, in the main, responsible for the big deficit we have at present in our balance of payments.  In 1967 we had £15 million of a surplus and in 1970 that was converted into a deficit of £62 million.  Also significant is that in 1967 we had a trade surplus with Britain to the tune of £9 million and in 1970 that surplus was converted to a deficit of £65 million.  I am afraid I shall have to repeat myself for the Minister, now that the caucus is over.</P>

      <P>In 1967 we had a surplus in the balance of payments of £15 million.  That was converted in a short three years to a deficit of £62 million.  As far as trade with Britain is concerned it is also significant that in 1967 we had a surplus with Britain of £9 million and that was converted in 1970 into a deficit of £65 million. I do not think one would need a terrific imagination to suggest that the responsibility for that is, in the main, in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement which was boasted of so much by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party when it was negotiated six or seven years ago.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that our deficit in the balance of payments is practically the same as our trade deficit with Britain.  I suggest, therefore, and it is very difficult to know what is happening in Brussels apart from the vague statements that are sent out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement should be scrapped as soon as possible and if it is a Fianna Fáil Government that is to negotiate it they ought not to go over in the same frame of mind as they did the last time and they should negotiate in a tougher manner than they appear to have done five or six years ago for a trade agreement that would not be so over-balanced in favour of Britain.</P>

      <P>The Government have <Col N="754" /> failed as far as a prices policy is concerned. In the last seven years the consumer price index has increased by 45 per cent and last year, the year of the political and economic crisis, there was an increase of 8.2 per cent.  Again, the Government must take responsibility for this and not try to put the blame on the workers or on the trade union movement.  Of this 8.2 per cent, 4.1 per cent of it occurred in the second quarter of 1970.  That was, of course, the period during which the turnover tax was raised substantially in the&mdash; we do not know what to call it&mdash; Haughey/Lynch Budget.  There have been no attempts to control prices.  In relation to prices we have the unenviable record of being practically at the top of the league as far as European countries are concerned.  I know the Minister may have a one-track mind as his colleagues may have in regard to prices and say: &ldquo;If it is prices it must be incomes as well.&rdquo;  His colleague, Deputy Childers, the Tánaiste, often quotes Europe to us.  There are countries in Europe which have no wage freeze but which have price control.  A price freeze has been introduced in Sweden, in Denmark, in Holland and in Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was right for the Minister to refer today to the national wage agreement and to compliment those who negotiated it and to hope, as we all do, that it will obtain for the time for which it is supposed to obtain. Mind you, the Minister was no help in that himself.  I do not want to go over the discussions we had here in Dáil Éireann about the Prices and Incomes Bill but the Minister was certainly not a great help as far as that was concerned.  May I also remind the Minister that there is an Act for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible, the Prices Act, which can, in my view, be effectively worked but this has never been attempted in any serious way by Deputy Lalor or any other Minister for Industry and Commerce and the present Minister for Finance acted in that capacity at one time.  We just cannot blame the trade unions if there is an increase in prices.  The Government must take responsibility for the positive actions they took in introducing turnover <Col N="755" /> tax, in increasing turnover tax and in introducing the wholesale tax.  The countries I mentioned did not introduce a wage freeze but appear to be having some effective control over prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke today about the value added tax, details of which we have not got at present.  I should like to warn the Minister that the introduction of this sort of tax could be the subject of exploitation by unscrupulous people as, indeed, there was exploitation by unscrupulous people when decimal currency was introduced and as there is exploitation when there are new prices by way of increased taxation on various commodities at Budget time.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to ensure that if the value added tax is to be introduced there will not be the same exploitation that consumers in this country have been subjected to and that those in other countries where the value added tax was introduced were subjected to as well.</P>
    <P>I pose the question: &ldquo;What will this Budget do?&rdquo; It will not correct the employment situation; it will do very little, if anything at all, for economic growth; it does not appear, nor does the Minister say he is optimistic, that it will bring about a reduction in the balance of payments and it seems, as well, as if this Government have no intention of seeking price stability.</P>
    <P>This Budget, as I said at the beginning, might hold the party together for a short term.  I do not know whether, if their crisis blows over, there is a possibility that there will be another Budget.  They may postpone their internal difficulties, but by doing this they are not doing anything positive for the country.  In view of what has been happening in the political, economic and social fields, the honourable thing the Government could do is, as has been suggested to their cumainn, prepare for a general election in June of this year.</P>

      <P>The present Minister for Finance last year handled the Budget debate, though he did not introduce the Budget.  If he remembers, the Taoiseach read the Financial Statement because of Deputy Haughey's regrettable accident.  He made a great song and dance about the big number who would benefit and about the wonderful thing it was.  Will the Minister now say why it was decided this should be taken away this year?  There are an awful lot of people who are on very low incomes.  Those people are being taxed and this was some little concession to them.  At least so we were told last year.  I am disappointed with the fact that the lower income groups are not dealt with fairly, income taxwise in this Budget.  An effort should have been made to do something in respect of low incomes.  The personal allowance has been increased very little <Col N="758" /> since the mid-sixties.  This was a concession granted last year which is being taken away this year.  The Minister has admitted there will be a net gain of £5 million.  Does not this mean in effect that he is reimposing the £6 million which was given away last year?  Can the Minister say why this particular item was selected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that the gross yield from this item is £6 million.  As I have explained in my statement, the reliefs, which are designed to assist the lowest bracket of taxpayers, will take 20,000 out of the tax net and will afford relief to some taxpayers to the extent I have indicated in my statement.  As to why this was chosen, I think I have indicated the reason in the Financial Statement. Very briefly I shall repeat it. We would not have had to impose new taxes this year if we did not make any concessions.  We would just have balanced.  Certain concessions had to be made and they had to be paid for.</P>
      <P>I have explained the difficulties, the lack of wisdom involved in any extensive indirect taxation.  Therefore, if the concessions were to be paid for at all I was driven back to income tax. I was then in the position of looking at alternative ways of doing it within the tax code.  Increasing the standard rate would be regrettable from several points of view, as I indicated in my statement.  If one wants to get at the top bracket of taxpayers one gets very little money out of them.  This particular relief was one which involved all taxpayers and the cost to them of withdrawing it would not be more than £1 per month.</P>

They decide to do a thing today and change their minds tomorrow.  At least this time the Government waited for 12 months.  It is a very objectionable way to behave.  The Minister claims he will take 20,000 people out of the income tax net.  What percentage of the taxpayers does that represent?  Twenty years ago it would be 12 or 15 per cent.  What percentage is it today?  Is it 5 per cent?  It is not. I think it is 3 per cent.  The Minister made big play of this.  It is all nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The net result of the proposal is to increase taxation on the lower income group.  That, in effect, is what will happen.  There is no worthwhile increase in the personal allowance beyond some paltry adjustment in the earned income relief.  This is really an undue hardship on the lower income group.  It is in keeping with the policy of the Government as expressed recently in the abolition of the unemployment assistance in respect of the most defenceless section of our community. Admittedly, the Government rocked a bit there.  It could be truly said that Deputy J. Lenehan did not get himself expelled in vain.  He reaped some benefit for the people for whom he sacrificed himself.  This trend seems to be creeping into the income tax code so far as this Government are concerned.</P>
      <P>A few years ago I objected to the action of the Government in giving a very substantial concession to sur-tax payers.  That was done on the pretence that it would result in encouraging managerial people to come here and to take over employment.  In effect, it gave an earned income relief of £1,250 to the sur-tax payers.  If a concession could be given to sur-tax payers a few years ago increasing exemption from £2,500 to £3,750&mdash;and I think it is now £4,500&mdash;it is very difficult to see how this recent increase can be justified. This shows a continuation of Government thinking that the rich should get richer and the poor poorer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot pass the Financial Resolutions without getting some additional information which the Deputies and the general public require. In his speech the Minister stated that the tax concessions will remove 20,000 taxpayers from the income tax net.  I should like to know how this number is made up.  What kind of incomes have these people at the present time?  What income have the 20,000 people who are to be removed from the income tax net?  Everyone knows of the growing dissatisfaction in this country on the part of the workers, particularly single men and women who have incomes in excess of £7 per week and are taxable. This Budget does not change that position. In spite of the fact that the value of money has depreciated steadily this figure has been more or less standard for the past ten years.  At the time it was fixed £7 was equivalent to £14 today.  Money has depreciated in value. I am not sure of the date when this figure of £7 was fixed.  Little or no variation has taken place since then.  There has been little or no variation in the Financial Statement of the Minister today.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that a single person earning more than £9 per week will not benefit from this Budget.  That is a clear-cut statement.  Who in Ireland is earning less than £9 per week?  Are we to assume there are several thousand such people?  Are we to assume that the &ldquo;several thousand&rdquo; are included in the figure of 20,000 taxpayers mentioned as escaping the income tax net? It is further stated that a married worker here earning more than £14 weekly will not benefit.  The standard wages for local authority rural workers is about £17 per week.  The rate is higher in urban areas.  Unless the Minister has some further evidence to give us, my present assumption is that instead of any relief being given to such people they will be taxed to the extent of an additional £12.  They will lose the remission on the first £100 of income. The reduction on this £100 of income is to be abolished and the standard rate applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to protest in this House as I did in the past.  I am aware that, in order to provide money for the public <Col N="762" /> services, money has to come from the pockets of the people.  At the present time this Government are engaged in a system which was used some years ago by a Mr. Singer who was carrying out certain operations in the borrowing of money.  Not only are the Government trying to get money in Ireland from the Irish people but they are going abroad to see where they can find money.  They are searching Western Europe and have also moved towards the American field.</P>
    <P>When we are considering Financial Resolution No. 2, I wish to refer to the position of the man or woman who is single, who is trying to build up some income with a view to getting married, providing a house and providing the essentials that go with it and who finds himself or herself taxed for sums earned in excess of £7.  That is, to my mind, unfair and unjust.  While I appreciate what Deputy Haughey, when he was Minister for Finance, told me in reply to a question that those remissions would cost a great deal of money.  Whilst I appreciate the difficulty of the Government in getting money&mdash;they go abroad to try to borrow money&mdash;at the same time it is entirely unfair that the tax free allowance is only the £7 it was ten years ago.  It now requires £14 to buy the same amount of goods which £7 did ten years ago.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I protest against the continuance of this position.  I expected in this Budget Statement, particularly having regard to the long debate we had on this question down through the years, that there would be some reasonable concession so far as the tax-free allowance was concerned.  Married men are allowed only £12 to £13 weekly free of tax.  I suggested on previous occasions that it was surely within the competence of the Department of Finance to devise a system whereby lowly paid workers should get greater exemption from income tax.  A married worker without children who works with any local authority in Ireland cannot be compared with the person who earns as much in one day as he earns in a week.  Despite this those <Col N="763" /> lowly paid workers have to pay the same money for their drink, their food and their clothing, although the man on a small income cannot frequent the establishments which the Minister for Finance frequents for his wearing apparel.</P>
    <P>People with salaries of less than £20 a week have grounds for complaint. There are some people who are semi-invalid or semi-incapacitated and who are lucky enough to find jobs at rates well below ordinary standards, but the present Minister for Finance now comes along and has the earnings of those people, which are usually around £10 or £11 a week, taxed as much as £1.  Despite the financial difficulty of the Government there is undoubtedly an unanswerable case for increasing the tax free allowance of workers in the lower income group. I am disappointed to see that instead of any help being given to such people the opposite is the case.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to say a word on behalf of the group Deputy Cosgrave has mentioned, the pensioners, because I believe they have a grievance.  I know local government pensioners expected relief in this Budget from income tax but instead of that those people, who are retired for some time and are living on grossly inadequate pensions, lagging behind for years, are now called on to pay £12 a year more.  Surely the Minister cannot stand over that.  I know they are getting some paltry increase, but surely the Minister is giving a little bit with one hand and taking more away with the other hand.  Surely he does not stand over taxing those people.  Surely it would be possible to put a section into the Finance Bill that would relieve pensioners whose incomes or pensions did not exceed a certain sum.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, but the Minister is taking £12 from them here.  I should like to have the Minister's view on that.  I have been asked by a number of local government pensioners who have a grievance in this regard to direct the Minister's attention to their case.  These people were looking forward to some substantial relief in this Budget in the payment of income tax on their inadequate pensions.  I can see how they will react when they find that instead of getting a net relief they are being asked to pay a net increase.  Even at this stage I would ask the Minister to think about this when he is framing the Finance Act and to make some provision for these people.</P>

The law as it stands <Col N="769" /> provides that such a payment is caught if on 6th April the child is an infant and unmarried.  In the first year, where the child is born after 6th April and is not therefore an infant and unmarried on 6th April, there is a loophole.

      <P>(3)  That in lieu of the duty of customs imposed by section 34 (2) of the Act of 1969, there shall, as on and from the 29th day of April, 1971, be charged, levied and paid on all beer of any description imported into the State, a duty of customs at the rate of £29.192 for every 36 gallons of beer of which the worts were before fermentation of a specific gravity of 1,055 degrees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Pre-Budget the revenue from a pint of beer, average gravity, is 6.865p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When you are dealing with the number of pints consumed in the country even the difference between 6.865p and 7p could make quite a difference in the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With this addition the revenue from beer will be almost 7½p. It has been usual in budgetary proposals in recent years to lean on beer drinkers and on spirit drinkers as well. It is assumed that people who drink need not do so and that drink is a luxury.  I do not share that view.  It is not unusual in rural Ireland for men, after their day's work, to retire to their local public house to discuss matters and to have a few drinks.  This is essential.  It is the only social outing for many of our rural people, be they self-employed or be they workers.  That tradition is there and the State is taking advantage of it and imposing taxation <Col N="773" /> of 7½p on their pint as from tomorrow. I believe such people are carrying an undue share of taxation.  What would happen if consumption declined?  What would happen if Father Mathew's campaign was reactivated and became successful?  As far as smoking is concerned, the Minister shied away from imposing extra taxation on cigarettes.  I understand that revenue from this source declined last year by some £4 million.  My reason for rising to speak is that I believe that we are leaning too heavily on the section of our community which mainly drink beer&mdash;the working population.  When I say the working population I mean, in particular, the manual workers and, indeed, to a more limited extent, professional people.  As a publican I have first-hand knowledge as to the people who frequent public houses.  It is a good thing for people to have their drinks and I see nothing wrong with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At rating authority meetings throughout the country during the past six or seven weeks, protests have been voiced in relation to rate increases.  A person may say, with some justification, that the rate burden is becoming too great. In some cases the increases may mean an extra £10 to £14 per year.  However, the kind of taxation we are talking about here is not collected by any State agency; it is collected without any cost to the State by the publicans throughout the country who must take this revenue from the pockets of their patrons.  It is collected in the easiest possible way.  From tomorrow morning each time we serve a pint an extra 7½p will go to the Exchequer. Let us pause here for a moment and make a calculation: when a publican has sold 13 or 14 pints, £1 will have been channelled to the Exchequer.  That is a sizeable amount of money for that quantity of drink.  Let us take the case of a man who drinks say two pints each day: such a man would contribute to the Exchequer the sum of £52 in a year.  There may be some people who will say that because a fellow is not paying rates he should have no say in the country.  In fact, some might even say that he should have no vote at a local election but let us remember that if that man consumes the moderate <Col N="774" /> quantity of two pints each day, his contribution to the Exchequer is £52 in the year or, if he drinks an average of four pints each day, his contribution will be £104.</P>
    <P>I am against this increase.  The men and the limited number of women throughout the country who drink beer are paying enough already towards the central Exchequer.  Let it not be assumed that I am endeavouring to promote drinking but it is my opinion that anybody who wishes to have a few drinks is entitled to have them if he has the money to pay for them but the State should not push him too far in so far as taxation is concerned. Some people might say that if people stayed out of the publichouses, they would not have to pay this extra 7½p but we all know that if there were a serious decline in drinking habits, it would be necessary to revolutionise our tax system to make up for the loss in revenue.</P>
    <P>I am expressing a personal viewpoint but I am sure it is a view that is shared by the members of my party because we all know that the tax on beer rests most heavily on the workingman. We are told that only .55p of this extra 1p finds its way into the Exchequer and that the remainder will go to the brewers.  Be that as it may, we must remember when talking about pence that there are now only 100 of them to the £ as compared with 240 when we discussed the Resolutions last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy is to be commended for drawing the attention of the House to the situation in which a workingman who consumes two pints of beer a day will find himself because of this increase in taxation. A man who consumes this amount on his way home from work and who, in this way, replaces some of the fluid he has lost in perspiration during the day, pays the State the sum of 15p. This is unbelievable.  I would not have thought it was possible.  As Deputy Murphy inferred, it is necessary to spell out exactly what is meant in this Financial Resolution so that the people will understand what is involved.  Also, another very important aspect to be considered in this regard is that the <Col N="775" /> price of beer in this country is much higher than in England or Northern Ireland and this will have its effect eventually on tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will come here for the beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the cost of beer alone.  That is only one item; food is another and when one considers the cost of all other items it will be realised that there will be no incentive to anyone to come here on holidays.  Therefore, we should not forget that this extra imposition will have its effect on tourism.</P>

I did indicate generally that we are dealing with them but in this particular case it is necessary to deal with it now.  The reason for taking it now is that having given notice of the change, duty could be avoided by a person giving a gift now. If we were to await until the enactment of the Finance Bill there could be large scale avoidance and that is why I am asking the House to take it now.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that it is anti-social.  It is the only piece of legislation which I know which reduces marriage consideration from its category of being a valuable consideration. In effect, it disregards marriage as being a valuable consideration and it is equating it with a completely voluntary gift.  It is anti-social to that extent. If a father, <i>bona fide</i>, settles property of £10,000 on a daughter, and I presume that the five year exemption applies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, the resolution, in effect, says the exemption of gifts shall be limited in relation to the parent to £5,000.  This seems to be a resolution restricting or cutting down an exemption already recognised, the exemption already recognised being that gifts made in consideration of marriage shall be exempt from death duty.  Now this resolution says that the exemption of these gifts, when made by a parent or remoter ancestor, shall be restricted to £5,000 in the case of a parent and £1,000 in the case of, say, the uncle or the aunt, or somebody else, or a putative father or somebody <i>in loco parentis.</i></P>

      <P>I think Deputy Cooney is quite right.  This seems to be a major change in taxation.  As I understand it, it has always been taxation policy&mdash;I suppose that is the wrong phrase&mdash;that a gift in consideration of marriage, to encourage young people to marry, particularly in relation to rural Ireland, has always been regarded as socially right and proper, and subject to the usual liability that follows any gift in relation to death within a particular period, five years, it was exempt.  Now we are being asked to pass this resolution and may I say to pass it without it being mentioned at all in the Budget statement which is certainly unusual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that the principle involved does not worry me at all although it seems to worry Deputy Cooney.  I would be more concerned with the practical application of it.  Perhaps if I mentioned to the House a case which did occur it would illustrate what we are trying to get at. The case was where a man was dying and within a week of his death he transferred what appeared to have been his entire assets, valued at at least £100,000, to his daughter in consideration of her forthcoming marriage.  He had a wife and four children but this is the provision he made and of course the property was thereby exempt from estate duty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear what is going to happen, that this man did not decide that he was going to leave his widow and other children completely unprovided for.  On the face of it that is what he is doing but that is not what he is really doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is falling into one of the oldest fallacies, arguing from the particular to the general.  It is fallacious to bring in this rule because of one instance.  An anomaly that occurs to me is that the State can come along and collect death duties on the excess of £5,000 from a person who, during his lifetime, was entitled to draw the old age pension if he qualified by reason of age, having divested himself of his property.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If a settlor settles property&mdash;indeed if it is a voluntary gift but more so if it is in consideration of marriage&mdash;and so divests himself of assets and is over 70 years of age, he becomes entitled to old age pension, non-contributory.  Yet, if that person does not live for five years after making the gift, any part of the gift in excess of £5,000 can become liable for estate duty.  In other words, a person that the State will recognise as an old age pensioner on a non-contributory basis can be liable for estate duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  Is the Deputy quarrelling with that?  I would not.  It seems that what is involved here is a form of evasion of duty and the suggestion that, as the Deputy says, we are arguing from one case to the general is not, I think, true.  In all of these cases&mdash;I have mentioned only one example; there are others&mdash;we can take it as axiomatic from what we know of the situation that, if there are some cases, there are others.  The word gets around very quickly among members of certain professions as to how duties may be avoided.  I may be going a little off course in saying this but I shall not go too far.  The point is frequently raised that we appear in these matters to be following the British.  There is good reason for this.  When the British bring legislation to close loopholes people here discover these loopholes and begin using them.  In this particular case, that is what happened, that the British did close this loophole some years ago and now it is being operated here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is a radical departure.  We changed the law some years ago.  We extended the period to which Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Cooney are referring from three to five years but that did not apply to gifts in contemplation of marriage.  Is Deputy Cooney not right that this is anti-social? The Minister may have quoted an extreme case but in the average case <Col N="784" /> whatever the value is that a parent will make provision for if he has more than one child&mdash;in fact under the Wills Act he is now liable to make provision one way or another for his widow&mdash;in those cases where he made a gift on the marriage of a son or daughter it was exempt from duty.  Under this, there is a new proposal by which a gift in anticipation of marriage or on the marriage of a son or daughter will be liable.  Surely that is a radical change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will take the point&mdash;Deputy Cooney puts it on a social ground perfectly validly&mdash;that purely from the point of view of existing administrative law, I have never before seen it suggested in a tax proposal that a gift in consideration of marriage would be regarded as an ordinary gift <i>inter vivos.</i> Marriage is always regarded as valuable consideration, removing the gift from the designation of a voluntary gift.  This is quite a serious departure it seems to me.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I am not disputing that.  However, the problem here as far as I am concerned is, as I have indicated, that when a loophole is closed in Britain people begin to avail of it here and we have to close it.  This has happened here.  I think we must close this loophole.  I gathered Deputy O'Higgins was concerned with the practical application of this and the amount involved.  I confess that I have not examined very closely the particular limits we are proposing here, what their practical application is but if the House wishes and it is open to me I will have a look at this between now and the Finance Bill.  May I just check in case there may be a technical problem here?  Of course we could relax the limits but we may have to have regard to the terms of the Resolution.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputies realise that this whole thing is a continuing battle between the Revenue Commissioners and the duty avoidance specialists and, as I have indicated, very often if there is a loophole discovered and closed in Britain, it is used here.  In regard to tax avoidance, we have a duty where we can, without chasing into every mousehole, to prevent this kind of thing happening. <Col N="786" /> There is no point in imposing higher death duties, as I have done, if at the same time we are lax about avoidance measures.

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I had been discussing the three or four facets of amendment No. 48.  I said that paragraph 6D, in the fourth part of the amendment, could have wide implications and I could not accept it.  I expressed doubts as to what the words, &ldquo; `take-over' of an employee by an employer&rdquo; referred to.  I said this had already been debated on an earlier amendment.  I said that section 20 (6) of the 1967 Act provides safeguards for employees who become involved in the change of ownership of the business in which they are employed.  I cannot accept the amendment, not because I am opposed to it, but because it is not necessary as it is already fully covered in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 11, at the reference to <Col N="788" /> Schedule 3, after the proposed amendment of paragraph 6 to insert the following:</P>
    <P>The insertion of the following new paragraph after paragraph 6:</P>
    <P>6B.  If an employee was laid-off (or if his employment was interrupted) for reasons of redundancy, or in a period of redundancy, between 17th May, 1967 (being the date on which the Bill for the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, was published) and 1st January, 1968, and</P>
    <P>(a)  that employee had 208 weeks continuous employment when the lay-off or interruption occurred, or</P>
    <P>(b)  would have had 208 weeks continuous employment on 1st January, 1968, if the lay-off or interruption had not occurred,</P>
    <P>that lay-off or interruption shall be deemed to have occurred on 1st January, 1968, provided (1) that this paragraph does not apply to an employee who was given a special redundancy payment from the Exchequer and (2) that the redundancy payment (if any) shall be included among the payments which may be made from the Redundancy Fund.</P>
    <P>This is a last effort to get protection for persons dismissed after the rules were published on the 17th May, 1967. Section 7 should apply to these claimants. If the 1967 Bill had been enacted before the Summer Recess of 1967, it could very well have been that the 26 week period in paragraph 5 (1) (b) of Schedule III would have bridged the gap between the publication of the Bill and the commencement of the Act. This was the Minister's intention when it was introduced but unfortunately, for one reason or another, it was not dealt with, the Summer Recess intervened and, by the time the Bill was passed, the 26 weeks did not bridge the period from the publication.  As I stated here last night unscrupulous employers took advantage of this and dismissed persons who should have been covered by the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the proposals contained in this amendment.</P>

      <P>As this is the last amendment it is appropriate at this stage to thank the House for the expedition with which they have dealt with this Bill.  Some people might not be familiar with the amendments in relation to the Bill itself and the Principal Act.  They are rather technical, many of them are consequential, some are just redrafting amendments but most have an element of retrospection in them.  Indeed, all have some merit and are an effort further to improve the Bill and close any loopholes which may exist.  Amendment No. 50 deals with retrospection as did amendment No. 1 and the House can hardly expect me, having said that I am against retrospection at the outset, to agree with the provisions of this amendment.  I cannot accept amendments which contain a retrospective element.</P>
      <P>When the Principal Act was before the House my predecessor also had to face proposals to have the provisions of the Act made retrospective in order to cover alleged cases where persons were jumping the gun in order to beat the dateline with regard to the coming into effect of the Act, but I do not think any evidence has ever been produced of any designed efforts on a large scale to do that.  If there were any such cases they must have been exceptional ones.  Employers who are bad enough to try to do that will always find some way of doing the wrong thing.  It is only fair to say, and I think the Opposition would be the first to admit it, that the vast majority of employers have given every co-operation in implementing the provisions of the Act and I believe the same co-operation will be given in implementing the provisions of this Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not arguing that every possible <Col N="790" /> loophole has been plugged but we have certainly gone as far as we reasonably can go to ensure that as few loopholes as possible will be left.  Officials of my Department sat down with representatives of both employers and workers and discussed every line of the Bill. As a result of that I am satisfied that going any further in regard to details would result in the creation of anomalies or unnecessary difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to effect considerable improvement.  I am satisfied it is a very good piece of legislation, a step in the right direction and very much in advance of any legislation of its type that has come before this House.  Deputies on the Opposition benches are quick to point out that we are dealing with the people's money. This is legislation of an advanced kind. It is superior to any social legislation we have had so far.  It brings us into line with legislation of the same type in other countries and, because of that, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with those Deputies who went through the Bill, literally speaking, with a fine comb to seek out ways of improving the Bill. I opposed many of the amendments but I did not oppose them just for the sake of opposition; I opposed them because what they sought to do was already adequately covered in the Bill. The bad employer who would seek to circumvent the provisions of the Bill to the detriment of the workers would be doing something to his own ultimate disadvantage.</P>

      <P>Before the amendment is put, lest there be any doubt about it, I should like to say that we, on this side of the House, realise just as well as the Minister does that most employers have co-operated in the scheme. We are at one with the Minister on that.  I am not as happy as the Minister is about plugging the loopholes.  We were anxious, and still are anxious, to ensure that the employer who tries to take advantage of his employee does not get away with it.  From evidence we have had we are satisfied that this did happen when the original Bill was before the House and, because of that, we do not want to see the same thing happening again.  The shortening of the period will mean that certain people will be anxious to avoid paying out even a relatively small sum of money. While the Minister opposed a number of amendments, he agreed to reconsider a number of them and we will anxiously await his final decision on these.</P>

      <P>Yes, and the Minister agreed to reconsider others and possibly introduce substitute amendments. We will anxiously await these.  We have a few amendments which we shall introduce on the Report Stage, amendments to improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that has struck me very forcibly during this debate has been the fact that the Minister has been battling alone.  Is it not rather a pity that one or two Fianna Fáil TDs, who talk so glibly about what they think of the worker, did not find it possible to spend even five minutes on the Government benches and to offer a contribution as to what they think would help.  The onus is on them just as much as it is on us.  Unfortunately they did not think it worth their while. I am sorry that that should be the case and I am afraid the Bill will suffer because it has not had the collective wisdom of the House.  I am sure the Minister consulted with his colleagues.  He has made most of the arguments very fairly.  We have agreed to differ on a number of things.  The Minister is one Minister who can get <Col N="792" /> business done here simply because he has a reasonable approach.  One of his predecessors got into serious trouble because he thought he could shout everybody down and prevent any discussion; there were only two ways of doing things, his way and the wrong way.  The Minister has not adopted that attitude and we are grateful for that because it is easier and pleasanter to do business in those circumstances. When the Bill comes to the Report Stage we hope it will be improved by the adoption of some of the amendments we suggested.  We are anxious to know when the Report Stage will be reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Tully and I must thank the Minister for his approach.  The officials of the Minister's Department are most courteous and most co-operative.</P>
      <P>This may be somewhat irrelevant at this stage, but I should like to ask the Minister to consider the point.  Where an employer gives long notice and the employee can get a job within two weeks, say, the employer should not be kept to the 55 per cent.  I ask the Minister to think about that.  I know it is difficult, but there are employers who would be willing to give an employee a chance and plenty of notice to get another job.  When that happens and a different job suddenly comes up, surely at that stage, the stage of cutting him off after four weeks, he would be completely redundant and the employer would get the 70 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Stage had been reached on Tuesday, 20th April the amendment we were discussing was an amendment in the name of Deputy FitzGerald:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (3), page 4, line 10, <Col N="794" /> to delete &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;for causes stated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald seemed to express surprise that I should be unable to be in sympathy with this.  He seemed to suggest that I was, in some way, falling down on my trade union responsibilities in not feeling that causes should be stated.  I profess, quite frankly, that at that point my degree of exasperation at the protraction of this debate and with arguments of this kind did rather boil over in me but may I recapitulate on the three arguments I was making at that time?</P>
    <P>First, I do not think it is in any way useful to introduce the phrase: &ldquo;for causes stated&rdquo;.  It could be highly invidious that this should be so.  There is a matter which may come up on the Adjournment tonight and which we have been discussing in this House fairly extensively&mdash;the dismissal from employment of an employee of the National College of Art.  The Minister refused to state precisely on what grounds the person in question had been dismissed.  In my opinion he refused, quite correctly, because it could be highly invidious to have the terms of disemployment of a person stated in this House.  That is one reason why I see Deputy FitzGerald's amendment as having no particular value.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am quite unable to understand the neurosis about the role of the Minister and the Department which seems to inform an awful lot of Deputy FitzGerald's thinking here.  I belong to a party which is consistently urging greater Parliamentary control of the State-sponsored bodies through committees and responsibility to the Dáil and that kind of thing.  I do not see how I, as a member of such a party, can argue that the Higher Educacation Authority should possess such a degree of autonomy as to hire and fire its servants for causes stated without reference to the person who is, in the eye of the community, its paymaster. Personally, if I were in the position of being an employee of the Higher Education Authority I would much rather feel that I could fall back on the interest of the Minister than that I was simply bound by the authority's capacity <Col N="795" /> to state for what causes I was being dismissed.  As a university employee, I would much rather be in a position in which I had recourse to the Minister than in the position of quasi-autonomy which I am supposed to enjoy at the moment.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I agree with Deputy Tunney's remarks in that discussion. We are all treating this debate as if we were debating whether Ireland should declare nuclear war on Russia in the morning or something like that.  Let us keep firmly in our minds that public money is being spent here on the work of this education authority and ultimately, no matter how much I may from time to time criticise the Minister and his Department, the fact remains that the final and ultimate buck stops on that Minister's desk and that is as it should be, in my view, whether it is Deputy Faulkner, Deputy FitzGerald in years to come, myself or Deputies who will be born after we are all dead. It remains true that the Minister ultimately has the sanction of the endorsement of, let us say, in effect, half a million people.  He is perfectly entitled to maintain an ultimately controlling interest in issues of this kind.  At the moment we are reaching a point of the exclusion of the Minister from this authority which I think is quite ridiculous.  I think Deputy FitzGerald is becoming totally neurotic about the Higher Education Authority here.  He is trying to have it both ways.  I agree with the Minister.  At one point he wants to increase the autonomy and power of the authority if he thinks that will diminish the power of the Minister; at another point he wants to diminish the autonomy and power of the authority if he thinks that will enhance the powers of the university.  This is totally ridiculous.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, and myself have agreed to go our separate ways on this.  This is fair enough.  This is not a Bill involving matters of major principle which should be necessarily Whip-bound.  Let me say here that I think remarks referring to the members of this authority as &ldquo;Quislings,&rdquo; are quite wrong.  I regard them, on the whole, <Col N="796" /> not in every case, as a well-chosen body of men doing an excellent job of work.  There are a couple of major exceptions in this Bill with which I disagree, as, for example, the issues on which we have divided this House and matters like student representation. Apart from that, I regard this as a relatively minor Bill simply to give statutory existence to a body which has already been in existence for some considerable time and has been doing a good job of work during that time. Anyone who argues that the Minister should have come to this House first to appeal for statutory recognition of the authority and then establish it knows little of the academic mind because if he had done so he would still be in this House and we would still not even have a named authority.  It is the hen and the egg situation and I think the Minister went the right way about it.  I wish the members of this authority good luck in their work.</P>
    <P>I should like to say one thing that is not intended to be personal to my colleagues&mdash;colleagues both in the sense of being fellow Dáil Deputies and colleagues also in the sense of being university academics, Deputies O'Donovan and FitzGerald.  I think we should at all times remember that we are not here as spokesmen for our universities and I think a discussion which shows an over-familiarity with the needs of any particular university is not one which should be paraded on the floor of this House.  Certain points of this debate reached a level at which I could practically make a speech about my own salary in Trinity College and why it should or should not be increased. I have no intention of sinking so low as to do that.  I cannot support this amendment because at this point Deputy FitzGerald has reached a level of nit-picking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few brief remarks on this.  I have spoken on the various subsections and the amendments to them.  On the last day, Deputy FitzGerald treated us to a rather lengthy lecture and I felt he was making a mountain out of a molehill.  I want again to say that An tÚdarás are an autonomous body and to suggest that the phrase &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo; takes away the autonomy of this body is simply ridiculous.</P>
      <P>I want to stress again that it is An tÚdarás who will appoint the individuals to the posts and not the Minister. As I see it, An tÚdarás will send proposals to the Minister as to the categories and the numbers they deem necessary.  When these have been agreed to, the remuneration can be settled and the appointments made.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald asserted that provisions similar to those in section 14 did not appear in any other legislation except that introduced by a previous Minister for Education.  I would ask him to look up the Act setting up the Arts Council in 1951, introduced by a Fine Gael Taoiseach.  As far as I can remember, Deputy FitzGerald made reference during his speech to the Act setting up the Pigs and Bacon Commission and pointed out that it was not similar to anything we had in any Bill introduced by Ministers for Education. It appears to me that he quite obviously did not read the Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Department of Education have no connection with the Arts Council.  They are still subject to the Taoiseach's Department.  I could mention others, but I think that is sufficient.  Deputy FitzGerald followed the same line in relation to the appendix and he said he knew of one case in which there was a breakdown of the figures in relation to a grant-in-aid, but when I brought the British Book of Estimates to his notice he qualified it by saying that he meant this country.</P>

      <P>I do not think anybody in the House can accuse me of being unduly favourably disposed towards Deputy FitzGerald but he has all my sympathy in this matter.  Unfortunately, Deputy Tunney is not here. He made a most absurd and ferocious attack on Deputy FitzGerald's approach which suggested that Fine Gael had a different approach to officers and servants to what the party of reality have.  It drew a rather long statement from Deputy FitzGerald, which is very natural.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Tunney said would set anybody off. Of course, if Fianna Fáil do something outrageous it is forgotten but if there is a little mistake made by anybody here it is something ridiculous. Deputy FitzGerald did not make any mountain on that occasion.  I propose on the next section to develop the point about officers and servants.  Subsection (4)  of this section uses the term &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  Again, we have this long <Col N="799" /> train.  There is an awful lot of rubbish put into Bills by the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance have control of the Estimates Volume and while they have, they have, in essence the overall control of expenditure. Of course, in recent years there is evidence that they had no control at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thornley and I have agreed to disagree on this matter.  It is easy to say that the claims of institutes should not be considered but we get very little chance of discussing Estimates in recent years in relation either to finance or education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to detain the House at this stage.  I will only briefly re-state the position. Deputy Thornley described me as a neurotic nit-picking, mountain-making academic introvert.  That was Deputy Thornley's phraseology.  Deputy Thornley and I are occasionally guilty of hyperbole, sometimes at each other's expense, and I do not think either of us takes it too seriously.  I am, however, disappointed that on this issue he has allowed a certain irritation with the exponents of academic autonomy to mislead him.</P>
      <P>I want to re-state that there is nothing illogical or facing both ways about seeking to preserve the autonomy, first, of the universities as far as possible from State authority, and the Higher Education Authority from the Government.  Maybe Deputy Thornley thinks it is a very non-socialist philosophy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he may not approve of it, but it is a consistent philosophy. In educational matters, the further away you keep the Government the better.  There are other areas where greater Government intervention might be desirable&mdash;on this, Deputy Thornley and myself might agree&mdash;but I think in this area it is consistent to try to ensure that while you have adequate co-ordination and control, this is done by the buffer established by this Bill, but that the buffer does not intervene unnecessarily in university affairs.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of the Bill is to establish a body which will keep the Department at arm's length from the university.  To reintroduce the Department into the affairs of public bodies in a detailed way, requiring approval for virtually all matters relating to the personnel of the authority, is, I think, unnecessary and objectionable.  It is important that protection should be given to officers and servants, and I regret the Minister's attitude in this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney's remarks were, of course, totally without foundation.  The senior people may perhaps be able to look after themselves but those who are described rather oddly as servants will not be in a position to do so.  I cannot understand why the Labour Party did not support me on that.  I regret the Minister did not accept what I regard as reasonable amendments.  I regret that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;with the Minister's approval&rdquo; in all these subsections shows a continuing desire by the Department of Education to maintain their control over a body which should be autonomous if they are to fulfil their functions properly.</P>

      <P>I promised that I would read out section 19 of the Institute for Advanced Studies Act, 1940.  I will read it slowly so that comparison can be made between section 19 of that Act and section 15 of the Bill.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  It shall be the duty of the <Col N="802" /> Council, as soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, to prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme for the granting of pensions, gratuities, or other allowances on retirement to such Senior Professors and permanent whole-time members of the Academic staff of the several Constituent Schools, and to such permanent whole-time officers of the Institute as the Council, with the approval of the Minister and the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may determine.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any Scheme submitted to the Minister under this section shall, if approved of by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, be carried out by the Council in accordance with the terms thereof.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Council may at any time, with the approval of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, amend any scheme under this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  The scheme submitted and approved of under this section shall fix the time and conditions of retirement for all persons to whom pensions, gratuities, or allowances on retirement are payable under the scheme, and different such times and conditions may be so fixed in respect of different classes of such persons.</P>
    <P>(5)  If any dispute shall arise as to the claim of any person to, or the amount of, any pension, gratuity or allowance payable in pursuance of a scheme under this section, such dispute shall be submitted to the Minister who shall refer it to the Minister for Finance, whose decision thereon shall be final.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every scheme submitted and approved of under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is so approved of and if either House shall, within the next 21 days on which such House has sat after such scheme is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such scheme, such scheme shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> That is a piece of gobbledegook.  I am glad that Deputy Tunney is in the House.  He was talking the other night about the way we look on officers and servants.  Section 15 (2) of this Bill reads:</P>
    <P>(2)  Every such scheme shall fix the time and conditions of retirement for all persons to or in respect of whom pensions, gratuities or allowances on retirement are payable under the scheme, and different times and conditions may be fixed in respect of different classes of persons.</P>
    <P>Would Deputy Tunney define for me what is meant in that section by a class of person?  I know, and I suspect that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald knows. Deputy Tunney went to great lengths on this question in speaking about the difference between officers and servants and the attitude on this side of the House as compared with the generous attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In this Bill it says &ldquo;with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  The scheme is to be referred to the Minister for Finance if there is any disagreement about it.  The Bill says that his decision &ldquo;shall be final&rdquo;.  On my copy I have marked in the word &ldquo;why&rdquo;? Why refer to the Minister for Finance whose decision shall be final, and why have different terms and conditions in respect of different classes of persons?</P>

      <P>And Deputy Dr. O'Donovan.  I spoke about this on the Second Reading of the Bill so I do not think there is any point in delaying the House in going into this again. I want to make it quite clear that this amendment in no way reflects on the present chairman nor does it reflect on what is in my opinion the absolute necessity of the Minister to start somewhere. He was perfectly entitled to appoint the existing chairman in the way he did and to proceed from that basis to appoint the remaining members of the authority.  I have no objection at all to the procedure that has been used up to this time.  If this body is to assume statutory powers it is very little to ask that future chairmen should be appointed by the ordinary members by a process of election.  It would be unfortunate to perpetuate the system by which the Minister chooses the chairman and then in consultation they choose the members of the body. <Col N="807" /> It was necessary as a once for all exercise at the outset of this but it is undesirable for the future and the bulk of academics feel the same way.  I think for once they are right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with Deputy Thornley.  The two amendments in my name, Nos. 34 and 35, are designed to achieve the same result.  It is quite possible that Deputy Thornley's amendment is a neater way of doing it and I am quite happy to accept this in lieu of my own because the purpose is exactly the same in both cases.  The Minister's concept of the chairman being appointed and then being consulted by the Minister before he selects the other members does not seem to us to be the appropriate way to deal with this particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a related amendment on the question of the appointment of members, that is amendment No. 37, which I shall not discuss now but I just draw attention to it as an integral part of a scheme of approach to this whole matter. The concept we would have would be that the Minister would appoint the members, that in the case of academic members he would, to ensure their representativeness, appoint them from a fairly wide-ranging panel suggested by the various academic institutions, giving him a wide range of choice, but that method would ensure that they were acceptable to, and broadly representative of, the academic viewpoint. Then the body so constituted would choose its own chairman.  I accept, of course, that in the case of the great majority of State bodies, the method of appointment of chairman is that he is appointed by the Minister with the other members.  The Minister will have no difficulty in citing precedents in other spheres.  This body is somewhat different and in a case of a body of this kind it is important that it should have the power to select its own chairman. It is not a State enterprise run for commercial profit.  It is a body concerned with academic functions and it seems to us that the chairman should ideally be chosen by the body itself when it is being constituted by the Minister along the lines suggested by <Col N="808" /> us in amendment No. 37 taken in conjunction with the rest of the Bill.  I would therefore ask the Minister to consider this suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have no difficulty in quoting us innumerable instances of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said I would have no trouble in quoting innumerable instances.  There are a considerable number of precedents of appointing a chairman in the manner proposed in this amendment but I will not base any argument on that.  The most important thing is that we should appoint a person with knowledge, experience and standing appropriate to the position.  It will not be an easy thing to get a chairman who is suitable for this particular position. If we were to have a situation where we would involve the members of An tÚdarás in the selection of chairman, it could very well prove to be a cause of dissension among the members.  I am convinced that the Government should be free to appoint the best possible person available.  As I said it will not be easy to get a person who will fit into this particular position. Therefore, I do not feel, particularly as I have mentioned that it could for one thing be a cause of dissension, that we should have the chairman elected by the members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept that the process of electing a chairman, or leader of a group, necessarily causes dissension is perhaps something one can understand coming from the Minister and his party.  However, it is not universal in bodies of a nonpolitical character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to <Col N="809" /> take a history lesson from anyone on that but I never heard that suggestion before.  In a body of this kind there might be some difference of opinion in choosing a chairman and then there might be a vote.  I cannot see a situation of war breaking out between members of the body over the choice of chairman.  It seems to me that the Minister's approach is instinctively somewhat more authoritarian. The Minister appoints the chairman and he advises the Minister whom he should appoint as members.  The suggestion we have made is more democratic, in which the academics and the institutions whose staff are to be represented have some voice in the choice of chairman.  While leaving it to the Minister to make the final selection, they will guide him on who would be broadly acceptable to them and then they choose their chairman. This appears to be the democratic way and I cannot see why the Minister is so afraid of adopting this more democratic procedure.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept that, while many institutions have been run in this country along authoritarian lines, as time goes on and as we become more mature the pressures on our institutions are growing.  In establishing an institution of this kind, which we hope will be able to continue broadly without change or amendment for many decades, the Minister should not take as his example the past procedures adopted in this country, perhaps under another Government 50 years ago.  He should be prepared to take account of the way opinion is moving and the way people are seeking a greater voice in the decisions that affect them.  From now onwards, all our legislation should be as democratic as we can make it, while safeguarding efficiency and the carrying out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to believe that by giving members of the body&mdash;who have been selected by the Minister&mdash;the right to choose who would be the most effective chairman this is likely to cause dissension or create inefficiency. As between the Minister choosing who would be the best chairman and the body itself, having sounded out each <Col N="810" /> other in the choice of chairman, and then selecting the most suitable.  I have no hesitation in believing that the latter is likely to lead to the best results and, in principle, it is the more democratic procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that the manner suggested by Deputies FitzGerald, O'Donovan and Thornley is the best way to get the ideal man. It is all right to talk about having a chairman elected in a democratic fashion.  I can see that is possible doing it this way but, on the other hand, the manner of his election may prevent him from acting in what might be described as a democratic fashion. As Deputy FitzGerald has said, we will have members of different institutions on the board and unless there is a miraculous change we will find those members retaining certain feelings towards their own institutions.  I would have fears for these people that might not be shared by other Deputies: that we might get what might be described as political lobbying entering into it: that we might get a chairman so elected whose objectivity might be influenced at a later date.  If I am attributing to academics faults which they do not have, I shall be very happy to withdraw my remark but I do not think that is the position.  I should prefer a situation whereby the ideal man would be selected and would not have to look over his shoulder to any group within An tÚdarás that had so honoured him. Rather he would be there to carry out the functions of the chair, without having any regard for the people on the board who had elected him.  I think the situation in which the Minister would appoint the person best qualified is the one that would yield the best results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney's classic statement in the case against democracy is interesting.  However, it is not convincing as the people who would be doing the electing would consist only of a minority of academics.  Therefore, there is no way in which some group working for the various institutions would control the election because there would be an equal, if not a greater, number of non-academic persions who, presumably, would not be manipulated in that way.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tunney has a point but it is one that undermines the entire democratic process.  Nobody would be allowed to elect any person on that argument.  When people come to choose a leader they may have divergent views and group themselves together in order to choose the man they consider best.  If that is the argument Deputy Tunney is making, it is an argument against democracy and I do not think that is what the Deputy means.  He would need to explain why, although democracy is good in itself, it is not to be used in this instance. He has not said why this body must be undemocratic.  If he does not do so he is liable to the counter-argument that he does not believe in democracy. I am sure that is not the case.</P>

      <P>In his opening statement Deputy FitzGerald referred to amendment No. 37.  I will not deal with that except to say that so far as I am concerned the whole basis of the constitution of An tÚdarás is that it be established on a non-representative basis.  It is in keeping with that concept that the Government should appoint a chairman on the basis of merit and suitability and that the other members likewise be appointed.  It is true that in any organisation there can be members who are excellent as members but <Col N="812" /> they need not necessarily be so good in the role of chairman.  This is a very important appointment and I consider it is one that should be made by the Government of the country.  If I did not believe this was the best way to appoint a chairman I would not press it.  As I said before, it will be very difficult to get a person of the calibre necessary for this position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's reference to the present chairman is a bit unfair.  We have all made it quite clear here that we have no objection to the manner in which the present chairman was appointed.  It was a hen and egg situation.  The Minister started the right way about it.  Deputy Tunney's and, indeed, the Minister's suggestion that the process of the chairman being chosen by the members of the authority is more likely to be subject in the future to political pressures than the process of his being chosen by the Minister, who is himself, of necessity, a politician is, I think, absurd.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 3 (3), page 5, line 48, to add &ldquo;provided that he shall hold office for an initial term of not more than seven years, and that his appointment may be renewed for a further term of not more than seven years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to limit the term of office of the chairman to seven years renewable for a further seven years.  The present wording is such that the chairman could be appointed for life.  That does not seem <Col N="814" /> to us to be a desirable method of proceeding in the case of this appointment or, indeed, most appointments of this kind.  We feel that a period of seven years, renewable for a further period of seven years, is reasonably generous. That is probably as long as is given in any other case.  I do not know any reason why this appointment should be made for life.  It seems a bad principle.</P>
    <P>As a general principle we ought to move away from life appointments for posts of this kind.  It is desirable that we should have a turnover of people in such jobs, that people should not go stale on the job and that a fresh mind should be brought to bear on it from time to time.  This principle is well established in political life.  There is a lot to be said for establishing it in this sphere also.  It could be extended very widely.  Unfortunately, the only bodies in this country which have this process of renewal of their leadership at intervals with people returning to the ranks are certain religious orders.  I hope the time will come when this good practice, which does not extend to the parish clergy, will be extended more widely both within the Church and within the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  We are in the difficulty that the present chairman was so well suited to the job and, if I may put it crudely, came on the market at the appropriate time.  It would be very unfortunate if the chairmanship of the Higher Education Authority should become a sort of career post.  I do not imagine for a moment that the Minister envisages something of this kind, but there should be statutory provision to prevent this happening.  Here for once I think the academics are in advance of the Minister's thinking.  The presidencies of the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland all, so far as I know, carry some element of time limit, do they not?  They do not.  Well, usually the accident of age produces this in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trinity College will probably move towards a situation where the head of the college will be appointed for a specific number of years with the <Col N="815" /> opportunity of renewal.  This is something towards which most educational institutions are moving.  It would be very unfortunate if a future HEA were saddled for say 20 years with the same chairman.  We have got to accept that we grow old and, as Deputy FitzGerald said, stale.  One appointment of seven years might not allow a man the full time to settle down to the intricacies of the job.  I would not want to curtail it that much.  A total of 14 years, to put it slightly harshly, just gives you time for the man to get attuned to the job, do his best for a certain length of time, and become, perhaps, a little work weary at the time when he disappears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must oppose this amendment for very much the same reason as the one I put forward in relation to the other amendments. I believe that there should be the maximum flexibility in regard to this position.  I have already pointed out that it is a position which it will be difficult to fill.  When the chairman is appointed by the Government, under this Bill they can lay down the terms of the appointment.  To tie the Government to a particular number of years could quite possibly mean that a person of exceptional calibre might not be willing to accept the position.  We can take it that, in the normal course of events, a person who would be likely to be appointed&mdash;and requiring to have considerable experience and knowledge&mdash;would be in his 50s at least.  In accordance with the regulations laid down in the Bill he would have to retire at 70 years.  To ensure that the widest possible choice will be available to the Government I feel we should not tie their hands in this way. As I said, the Government can lay down the terms of the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the need for the widest possible choice, <Col N="816" /> I do not think we should widen it to the point where we would take a man who would only take the position it he got it for life, which I think the Minister implied.  In the case of a man of 56 years or less, the only way in which our amendment would preclude his appointment is if he said he would not take it unless he got it for life. Otherwise, 14 years would be sufficient. I do not think the type of man who thinks like that is the type of man we want.  That is precisely why there is a good case for the amendment. I found the Minister particularly unconvincing on this.  Sometimes I find his arguments at least partly persuasive but on this issue I do not think he made a case at all.  This is a very reasonable limitation.  I should like him to think again about this amendment. By the way, I trust that the presence of Deputy Lalor in the back benches has no significance.</P>

      <P>It is very revealing that the Minister should think of a job like this only going to a man in his fifties.  If this is the kind of job I think it is, you might very well get a highly qualified person of a younger age, a man in his forties or even in his thirties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do accept that the Bill does not say a man cannot be appointed until he is in his fifties.  I am just saying that the Minister's repeated suggestion that this job would in general go to a man in his fifties is rather revealing as, indeed, has been the approach he has adopted on a number of points.  It seems to me that each of these revelations as it comes <Col N="818" /> and the approach the Minister is adopting are not helping me to form a picture of a dynamic, autonomous body doing the kind of job that needs to be done, and it worries me a little.  In so far as appointing a younger man is concerned, as might well be desirable, he might happen to be the best man.  I am not saying he must be a young man. It could be that the best man appointed the next time would be, as in the case of Dr. Rafferty, a man who is later in life and who is appointed primarily because of his experience.  However, if a younger man is appointed, which might be desirable despite the Minister's views as to the suitability of such a person, then it is important that the job should be seen to be one for a period of years and not for life.  I believe this amendment would clarify that.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by &ldquo;revealing&rdquo; when he refers to my point in relation to the possible age that the chairman of this body would be when appointed. It does remind me of a comment of the President of this country when he was returned to power as Taoiseach and when some of the Opposition commented adversely on the age of his Cabinet; he said they were not training for the 100 yards.</P>

      <P>The point I have been making is that the chairman would need to be a person of fairly considerable experience.  This does not preclude younger people being appointed and the fact that we do not specify certain ages in the legislation leaves the Government free in the matter of the terms of appointment.  This is also included in the Bill.  Therefore I still feel this matter should be left as flexible as possible so as to give the Government the opportunity of having as wide a range of selection as it is possible to have.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph 4 (1), page 6, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>()  The academic members of An tÚdarás shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister, from a list of not more than three nominees to be submitted by the governing authority of each university, or, where a university has more than one college, each college of a university, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and of any other institution of higher education which may have been so designated under the procedure set out in section 1 (1) (c) and in the case of the first appointments, of such other institutions of higher education as the Minister may designate for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The student members of An tÚdarás shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister from a list of not more than one nominee from the Students' Representative Council of each institution from which nominations of academic members are received under the procedure set out above, and not more than two nominees from any national students organisation</P>
      <P>The other ordinary members shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the first paragraph a few minutes ago but I want to develop my thinking on this now.  The method of appointment which the Minister visualises for the authority is one under which he makes the appointment having consulted the chairman but not, of course, being bound by his views. The Minister has, in a number of interventions, stated cogently his case for the more authoritarian approach. He has even gone so far as to say that the whole idea of this body is that it should be non-representative.  I think <Col N="820" /> I heard him right, that he said &ldquo;non-representative&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;unrepresentative&rdquo; and I hope there was a distinction between the two words.  I do not see any particular virtue in making it non-representative, or as I would feel, unrepresentative, for its own sake.  We do not want people appointed who are going to be delegates for their institution.  We want people appointed some of whom will be academic members in academic institutions bringing their experience to bear but not regarding themselves as being there to negotiate for their institution. Therefore, we do not want people to be, in that sense, representative of their institutions.  On the other hand, there is a danger, of which we have some little evidence in the appointments made already, of the particular way in which they are made, that the Minister would select academic members of this body because they agree with his view on something rather than because they respect the views of or are in a broader sense representative of academic thought.  The Minister cannot say in this case that there is no such danger, because his predecessor did precisely this.  He selected the members of the present authority as people who, on the information available to him, supported his view on a single issue, one of a number with which the authority was going to deal.  This seemed to me a bad practice and was a mistake at the time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I understand that.  These are people who, in one way or another, were identified with the Minister's view on the merger and, it has to be said, were identified with a minority view on this issue which Deputy Thornley and I shared.  The mere fact that Deputy Thornley and I shared this view does not mean that to chose only those people who agree <Col N="821" /> with us, as happened in the case of the former Minister, is a good way to select an authority of this kind.  There we have a concrete example, in relation to the non-statutory predecessor of the body we are here contemplating, of a Minister deliberately choosing people to be unrepresentative of the academic institution and their members because they agreed with his viewpoint.  This seems to me to be a mistake and a singularly stupid thing to do, elevating one particular issue as if it were the only issue at stake.  It was a mistaken thing to do, and as we know that Ministers are capable of doing it there ought to be some safeguard against it. However, the safeguard must be such that the people concerned are not elected or selected by their institution directly to be on this body because they would then regard themselves very much to be representatives of it, and could act as if they were negotiating on behalf of these institutions.  I have sought, therefore, to devise some constitutional formula that would lie between these two extremes which, on the one hand, would ensure that the final choice would be the Minister's, which I think is the right approach to choosing a body of this kind but, on the other hand, would give us an assurance that the Minister made his choice from among people who, broadly, had the confidence of the academic institutions that they represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that academic institutions would show sufficient regard for opinion to select for their panel people who represent different views within the institutions.  Probably that would be the case although I could not offer an absolute guarantee on that but normally it would be the case.  At any rate, whether they would represent the spectrum of opinion or the predominant opinion within the institution, we would at least be safeguarded from the unhappy position of having people chosen who represented specifically the minority view only within the institution on some issue or issues.  To eliminate the majority view, however one might disagree with it, would seem to me to be a very unsatisfactory way of proceeding if one wants harmony. <Col N="822" /> The only consequence of this would be to undermine confidence in the body. Confidence in this body was undermined and it has taken several years for them to re-establish confidence in the minds of the academic community. I am sorry to say that I know members of it who still have not much confidence in this body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know more than one.  There is no suggestion of a minority of one.  The body, by declaring its independence on the first day after a long and difficult meeting with the Minister when they insisted on issuing a statement to establish that what he had said about them was not true, did re-establish in that way some confidence in themselves and have since shown a reasonable independence of view in the carrying out of their duties.  At least, they have not shown any particular subservience to Ministerial views and on the issue of whether it will cost £15 million or £24 million to build in our universities within the next few years, they have shown considerable independence of view and have been in conflict with the Minister.  I do not suggest that they should have a conflict merely to show their independence but nonetheless they have re-established some confidence in themselves.  However, it is unfortunate to have set up a situation in which the academic representatives are so unrepresentative of the prevailing view in their colleges that they do not start with the confidence of their colleagues and can still be referred to, quite wrongly if I might say so, with respect to Deputy O'Donovan, as &ldquo;Quislings&rdquo; even at this stage.</P>

      <P>Of course, but my point is that while recognising that Deputy O'Donovan is entitled to his opinion.  I would prefer to have a situation in which he did not consider it necessary to express or to hold this view.  It does not help that Deputy O'Donovan should consider it necessary to refer to them in this way.  While <Col N="823" /> I do not agree with the view I can understand that the method of appointment has created a situation whereby people with strong views, such as Deputy O'Donovan, consider it appropriate to use this expression.  I would prefer not to have this kind of cloud cast over a body that was carrying out an important function.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the solution lies in some loose arrangement of the kind I propose.  Of course, I am not wedded to the particular details of the solution.  I put it forward for discussion as a method by which the institutions in question would select a number of people&mdash;I suggest three for each one which, if we take the four university colleges plus, I suppose, the Royal College at Maynooth, the Institution in Limerick and the Royal College of Surgeons, seven in all, would give 21 people from whom to choose.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister would have to choose one from each institution because that would be the wrong approach but he could choose one-third and reject two-thirds.  That would leave him reasonable latitude and he would know as we would know and as the country would know that when he had made the appointments, the people concerned would command the support of the bulk of our colleagues and would be broadly representative of the academic institutions.  If the Minister is willing to consider some such solution or some safeguard of this kind, I would be more than happy to withdraw my amendment and let him introduce one in different terms but which would achieve the same effect.  I hope the Minister will consider himself able to accept some such arrangement whereby the damage done because of the mistake made by his predecessor&mdash;a mistake that was made in good faith and in a difficult situation when he was worried about getting his merger through&mdash;cannot be repeated and the people will know that any future institution will have academic members who are representative of academics as a whole.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy FitzGerald is making a very sincere attempt to achieve the impossible.  He accepts, as much as I accept, that the authority, of its nature, should be literally representative in the sense of containing delegates from the different institutions over which it would exercise its authority. On the other hand, the Deputy is trying to introduce a device whereby some modicum of representation would enter into it.  I am afraid I do not believe that this is possible in the first instance.</P>
      <P>This is a case where one must accept that the academic constituency is not necessarily the appropriate one to choose people for this body.  If the academic constituency has a representative function, I think that function belongs more properly to the rejected conference of Irish universities, whether that ever comes into existence I do not know and I am not particularly enthusiastic about it.  I gather from a remark of the Minister's that he is not particularly committed to it either. There are times when the representative principle simply breaks down.  Deputy FitzGerald will know that the production of even three names from an individual institution will lead to considerable political in-fighting.  I apologise to Deputy Tunney for misunderstanding a remark he made some ten minutes ago when I thought he was referring to constitutional politics but then realised he was referring to academic politics.  Here, I agree with him. It is all of the process that Deputy FitzGerald is suggesting.  The first place that comes to my mind of where it is utilised is, in so far as I know, in the appointment of bishops.</P>

I dislike these references to the Minister choosing people who are representative of the minority point of view.  A minority point of view is very often right, as Deputy FitzGerald admitted, but if I could take Deputy FitzGerald's mind back to a meeting of the Irish Federation of University Teachers which took place in Cork about three years ago for the purpose of discussing the merger issue, the Deputy was one of those who, with myself, was adamant against putting it to a vote of the members of the Federation.

I do not like to hear Deputy FitzGerald using expressions such as &ldquo;the mistake made in appointing people who agreed with the Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;the damage then done&rdquo;.

      <P>An ordinary member of An tÚdarás shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister and, before making a recommendation, the Minister shall consult thereon with the chairman of An tÚdarás.</P>
      <P>It may be to give the chairman a veto or it may be to prevent two people who cannot tolerate each other from being put into one room.  Mind you, if you did put two such people into the one room it is extraordinary how quickly they would form a battalion against everybody else.

    <P>Deputy FitzGerald spoke about the statement that was issued.  The Deputy's memory is excellent but so is mine because I well remember what I said to myself when I saw that statement. I said that that statement proves the exact opposite of what they said; <Col N="828" /> it proves that they are not independent. Anybody who is independent does not have to tell anybody else that he is independent.  I came to the very exact opposite conclusion to Deputy FitzGerald's.  Now, I know nothing about the operations of this body, I am glad to say, but this is a proof that they have been moving along in a nice Mickey Mouse way, quietly and so on, but of course they are not in existence legally, therefore it is up to them to behave in a Mickey Mouse fashion.  When they get this document behind them, with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Oireachtas behind it, they might behave in a completely different fashion.</P>

      <P>I had some sympathy with some of the amendments which I did not find possible to accept, but I am afraid I cannot have any sympathy with this amendment.  The whole virtue of my approach in the Bill in this matter as I see it is the fact that members will not be representative. It would be illogical to expect a body constituted on a representative basis to be able to make recommendations on an objective and impartial basis, free from local pressures and interests.  I agree with Deputy Thornley that Deputy FitzGerald is sincerely trying to achieve the impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important function of An tÚdarás would be to make recommendations for consideration by the Minister and by the Government on broad questions concerning State policy towards higher education.  If An tÚdarás were a representative body these questions could very well become the subject of public controversy before An tÚdarás could make any recommendations to the Minister.  In many instances the members would feel it incumbent on them, if they were representative of a particular institution, to report back to find out the views of that particular institution and in those circumstances, if it became a <Col N="829" /> matter of public controversy, we would reach the stage where public attitudes to the matters at issue could be formed to a great extent before the recommendation reached the Minister at all and then the recommendation would be of very little value.</P>
    <P>For that reason rather than appoint a representative body&mdash;and I think no matter what approach you make to it on the lines mentioned by Deputy FitzGerald, that the body would be elective in some form&mdash;members should be selected and appointed having regard to their knowledge and experience and the contribution they are likely to be in a position to make in the conduct of the authority's business.  For those reasons I fear I could not accept the amendment.  I am glad to know that the Deputy accepted that An tÚdarás, the present <i>ad hoc</i> body, is an autonomous body.  I do not know why it would be necessary for me to disagree with them to prove they were an autonomous body but I remember that Deputy FitzGerald also disagreed with them in regard to something which we discussed here one night previously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the undesirability of the body being representative and if the amendment led to a situation where the people concerned felt themselves to be, appeared to be or acted as representatives, that would defeat the purpose of this exercise.  I accept that but I do not believe that would be the effect or consequence of the amendment.  The fact that the Minister would be doing the appointing from panels of people would, I think, make it clear that they were not representatives and should not and would not act as such.  In view of past history in this case something of this kind seems to me to be necessary to avoid a repetition or fear of a repetition of the kind of situation that arose at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Thornley for his tribute to my Socratic wisdom <Col N="830" /> as, I think, he described it on an earlier occasion.  With my customary insouciance I had forgotten that I had said anything of the kind.  It is one thing to feel as I felt then and would feel about the people on this body, that they should act in the interests of their constituents rather than in accordance with their wishes on any particular issue but that does not mean that you would get an ideal result by appointing people who are known to be at variance on a major issue or issues with the people there, the people from whom they are drawn and I do not see any particular merit in that. They are two quite different issues.  I share both the Minister's and Deputy Thornley's concern that the people on this body, although representative of academic opinion in their colleges in a broad sense, should not act as such, and should do as we as Deputies should do, adhere to Burke's dictum, that we should make up our own minds rather than act as delegates bound by our constituents' wishes on particular issues.</P>

      <P>It seems to me from my knowledge of the background of the Higher Education Authority that the original intention appeared to be that the HEA would be a body nominated by the Minister and that the Conference would be a representative body from the universities.  I think many academics went along with the nominated status of the HEA on the basis that the other body, the Conference, would come into existence on a rather representative basis.  This is not a view which I personally hold strongly but there are many academics who do.  At this stage when the Minister is insisting, correctly in my view, that the authority should be appointed by him, would it be fair to ask him to clarify his thinking on the appointment or institution of the Conference or is that wholly out of order?</P>

      <P>Unlike some other Deputies, I am content with the situation where the Minister nominates the members of the authority but I think a situation where the Minister may remove just like that any member of An tÚdarás is going a little bit far.  I have no reason to suspect the present Minister would exercise this power in an improper fashion but the fact does remain that there are those who might feel that a public speech by a member of the authority which differed markedly from departmental thinking would warrant his removal.</P>
      <P>I do not want to raise again a rather sore point but we must remember that the Leader of the Government party in the Seanad questioned the right of a particular lecturer in UCD to retain the post he then held on the grounds of a political opinion he had expressed on a television programme. The fact that that kind of thinking can exist at all in the Minister's party &mdash;and I am not denying that in different circumstances the same kind of thinking might be found on this side of the House&mdash;demonstrates quite clearly that where the Minister&mdash;I know the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; is used but &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;Government&rdquo; are tantamount to the same thing&mdash;where the Government may at a moment's notice remove an ordinary member of An tÚdarás from office, it does invade their autonomy.</P>
      <P>A member of An tÚdarás might be fully conversant with and in agreement with Government policy on things like education but he might be a member of the National Trust or the Georgian Society and make a speech viciously condemnatory of Government policy in respect of something which would come under the auspices of either body.  Would this mean that his tenure of office as an experienced man picked to perform an educational role could be placed in jeopardy under this or any future Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment does not differ substantially from Deputy FitzGerald's amendment.  It does not demand that the Minister publish the reason for the dismissal of such a member.  All it asks is that he and the chairman should consult with each other and <Col N="834" /> decide that good cause exists for the dismissal of such a person.  Since the Minister will in the first instance have appointed the chairman before he appoints the authority it does not seem to me to be placing a very great inhibition on his freedom of action here.  I do not think anyone could suggest that the safeguard we are suggesting here is an arrogant or academic one.  Political circumstances during the last 50 years have established precedent for the interference by parties on all sides into appointments and dismissals which are unfortunate.  I do not think a rate collector would be appointed on the arbitrary lines suggested here or dismissed on those lines even though the application of appointment boards to local government posts is surely more democratic than what is stated here.  Paragraph 6 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Government may remove an ordinary member of An tÚdarás from office.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is good enough and I would ask the Minister to think that this is one of those amendments with which he could feel he was in sympathy.</P>

      <P>I had been looking forward to hearing Deputy Thornley on this amendment.  I knew I would have occasion to admire his ingenuity in attempting to reconcile two positions which are not reconcilable.  His suggestion that the phrase &ldquo;for cause stated&rdquo; means that one must put an advertisement in the papers about them is without foundation.  I understand that is a phrase which has a hallowed legal significance, that the person must be told the reason why he is being dismissed.  It is a simple precaution against wrongful dismissal because it means that if the cause is in fact incorrect and the person believes he can show in the court that it is incorrect he can take an action for wrongful dismissal and if no cause has to be stated he is put at a severe disadvantage in that respect.  I am sorry that Deputy Thornley is unaware of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can relate my remarks to the present one.  Having established that that particular point made by Deputy Thornley is without foundation we leave him a little exposed to criticism in that he would not support the suggestion that servants of the authority, as they are called, should have the reason given to them, but in the case of members of the authority not only must a reason be given but it must be a good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy suggested that; he simply suggested &ldquo;good cause&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true the wording does not require that, but I think, although I am open to correction on this, that the meaning of &ldquo;for good cause&rdquo; also from a legal point of view is that the person concerned would have a right to know what the cause was.  Otherwise, it would be a completely meaningless phrase and I do not think that is the case.  At least the onus of proof would be shifted to the authority and I think they would and could be required by an action taken in the courts to state the cause.  I shall not go into the nature of that action because I am not legally qualified to do so but in both cases they would either have to tell the person at the time or could be required by him to give the reason.  I believe this principle should apply to all employment.  I do not believe it should be confined to members of the authority.  I think Deputy Thornley probably agrees with me but has got himself into a tangle on this issue.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether the wording of my amendment is necessary?  He will see that in addition to requiring that the dismissal should be &ldquo;for good cause&rdquo; the amendment goes on to suggest that the vacancies should be filled in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>If it is legally covered by section 4 I will not press that.  I will simply join with Deputy Thornley in pressing the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; part.

      <P>If I might deal with the &ldquo;for good cause&rdquo; first, I have no doubt this was inserted to give some protection but, in fact, it does not provide any protection against wrongful dismissal.  Deputy Thornley cited the case in which a member might make speeches which the Minister or the Government might not like and, because of that, they would remove him. But I cannot see how putting in &ldquo;for good cause&rdquo; would provide any protection. I could not accept this but I will tell you what I will do: I will split the difference.  I will accept part of the amendment:</P>
      <P>The Government may after consultation with An tÚdarás remove an ordinary member from office.</P>

      <P>I had an example of this a few years ago when I was <Col N="837" /> an official in the Department of Finance.  The Department of Agriculture wrote to consult us about something or other.  It was about a company matter actually, a matter in which we had a great deal of experience and in which the Department of Agriculture had no experience; but they dug their heels in and eventually we wrote back and said: &ldquo;You have consulted us. You can have your own way.&rdquo;  It would really need to be with the approval of the chairman to be worth anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the person is then in a position to ask the cause and, if it is not given, he can take a mandamus action requiring the authority or the Minister to state the cause and, it having been stated, he can then take it to the court for the court to decide if his appearance, for instance, on a television programme was a good cause or not and I have a fair amount of confidence in our courts in matters of that kind and, therefore, it seems to me it does give protection and I should like the Minister to explain to me why it does not.

      <P>Then he either answers, which is good, or he does not and, if he refuses, the man can go to the court and seek an order requiring the Minister to state the cause because it is required that there shall be good cause; and that mandamus order, in my experience of how the courts proceed in matters of this kind, would be <Col N="839" /> given.

      <P>To delete paragraph 7, page 6, lines 20 to 22.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the provision whereby Members of the Oireachtas cannot be members of this body.  I put down this amendment in pursuance of a general view I hold that the exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas from other walks of life is something that is carried altogether too far and there is no reason why Members of the Oireachtas should not serve on bodies of this kind.  The life of this Oireachtas would be enriched if the experience of its Members were not narrowed down as it has been by totally inappropriate legislation of this kind. We have gradually narrowed down the activities of legislators by excluding them from all kinds of activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This goes back to the British practice of excluding Members of Parliament from holding offices of profit under the Crown, an antiquated concept concerned with the existence of corrupt practices in the 18th century as, I think, Deputy Thornley will agree. I hope he will give us the benefit of <Col N="841" /> his professional knowledge on the subject, not of corruption, of course, but of the history of the 18th century.</P>

      <P>This curious practice originated in that century.  There was a case in Northern Ireland too.  But that is no reason for continuing here now and I am opposed in principle to this kind of attempt to keep Members of the Oireachtas out of involvements in vocational activities in which they may have useful roles to play.  It is not simply in this particular matter.  I have come across this again and again in legislation.  While there are some posts it would be inappropriate for Members of the Oireachtas to hold, they do not include posts on bodies of this kind.  It is important we should call a halt to this whole process, which is not helping the work of this House.  In other countries Members of Parliament can have wider experiences of this kind and this, I think, is a good thing.  I would therefore press that this section be deleted as being the continuance of a policy which is, I think, misguided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  I have already spoken on this at some length in my reply to the Second Stage of the Bill.  The fact that a candidate for a Seanad election was a member of An tÚdarás could help to influence his election.  This is something which would be unfair to other candidates.  It is all very well to talk in theory here in relation to this matter but in practice I have no doubt that candidates, say, from the universities for the Seanad election might feel that people who are members of An tÚdarás might have an advantage over them because of their membership. I do not see any particular reason why the paragraph should be deleted.  Of course as Deputies are also aware this is established practise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, these two amendments are being taken <Col N="842" /> together.  I should like to address a few remarks in relation to my own.  I cannot go the whole way in support of Deputy FitzGerald.  To hold at one and the same time membership of a body like An tÚdarás and Dáil Éireann would probably be undesirable.  I think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. However, the point the Minister made is surely met in the Labour Party amendment.  The Minister may well say that membership of a body like this might assist somebody as a candidate in a Seanad or Dáil election but surely if it were made clear that in the event of their being successful in this election they would cease to be members of the authorities this point would be covered.  In my own case in 1965 I stood, with somewhat ignominious results, for the Seanad in the constituency of Trinity College, Dublin.  At that time I was a member of the Medical and Social Research Board.  Nobody suggested to me that I would have to resign from that board before standing for the Seanad.  I have not much doubt that if I had been elected to the Seanad which, of course, I was not, with the inestimably more valuable result that I am now here, I would probably then have been asked to give up my membership of the Medical and Social Research Board. I think this is fair.</P>
      <P>I do not want to seem over wordy here, I have accused others of being over wordy so often to-night, but I consider the wording adopted by the Minister as being excessively tight and precise.</P>
      <P>Where a member of An tÚdarás is nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas or as a member of Seanad Éireann . . .</P>
      <P>I do not understand the distinction there.  I suppose the distinction between &ldquo;nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo; and: &ldquo;as a member of Seanad Éireann&rdquo; means nominated by the Taoiseach.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is terribly restrictive. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but the rules adopted by, for example, Radio Telefís Éireann in this respect seem to me to be reasonably <Col N="843" /> fair if a person goes on suspension, in effect, from the point of commitment to a political party, though that only covers one aspect of the thing. Unless I am wrong a member of the Minister's own party was a member of the RTE Authority and his employment as such was not terminated until the point of his election to the Seanad. Of course, it could be that he was nominated and that is covered by the Minister's remarks.  This is excessively restrictive.  I can appreciate from my own bitter experience that once one declares affiliation to a political party one is naturally more suspect in an allegedly objective channel of communication like RTE or the Higher Education Authority than one was before and I can see the point that on election to the Dáil one should cease to be a member of the authority.  I would even be prepared to accept an amendment to my amendment which differed to the extent that:</P>
      <P>Where a member of An tÚdarás was nominated to the Dáil he should cease to be a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;because in almost every case he would be nominated as a member of a political party which would declare his interest but I think it should be:</P>
      <P>... or elected to the Seanad or nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>As it is, this would debar a university academic from standing for his own university constituency and this would be a very unfortunate thing.  If the Minister argues that his so standing as a member of the authority would enhance his chances of getting elected all I can say is, so what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tribute to the intelligence of his constituents that they feel that his experience on this body is relevant.  On the other hand, once he is elected&mdash;I am not sure whether this is true in the case of university Senators&mdash; to the position where he has to take objective, stated, public, political stances it might be impossible for him to retain membership of a non-partisan board like this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> Specifically, I am worried about nomination to the Dáil but I am not nearly as worried about that as I am about nomination for election to the Seanad.  It could be here that the Minister would be depriving the Seanad constituencies of the two universities of precisely the kind of highly qualified person who upon election would bring to Seanad Éireann the sort of qualification which would make him a good Senator.  I would accept that at the point of election he might be compelled to give up his membership of the authority but as put at the moment the restriction is excessively tight.  I agree completely with Deputy FitzGerald that in the past we have been too restrictive and tended not to attract enough people experienced in this sort of field into the Dáil.  I know that when we do this we are open to the cheap jibe about intellectuals, Trinity queers, Maoists and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>I would make the point that in so far as this has been a constructive debate, and I think it has been on the whole, the contributions that have been successively made have been made in four cases by professional teachers or former professional teachers.  To close the door upon this kind of person in this way is very unfortunate.  It is separating the Dáil and more importantly the Seanad from a whole stream of experienced people in educational life.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot accept the amendment which provides that people can be nominated for election to the Dáil and remain until their point of election as members of An tÚdarás, could he not accept an amendment that they be nominated for election to the Seanad and still retain their membership of An tÚdarás until the point of election?  That compromise would not wholly satisfy me but at least it would be some step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>There is a basic misconception here.  We have, for example, the Seanad which is meant to be vocational so what do we do?  As soon as we get a man who, because he is in his own vocation representative and able to make a contribution, is <Col N="845" /> thought worthy of appointment to this body, we preclude his being a member of the Seanad.  What is the point of having a vocational Seanad if you set about then, as we have done repeatedly in legislation, excluding anybody who has vocational experience in a particular sphere, having gained a particular kind of vocational experience, from being members of it?</P>
      <P>I understand though do not accept the argument in respect of the Dáil; I cannot even understand the argument in respect of the Seanad.  It makes nonsense of the whole concept of the Seanad.  It seems to me that we are ensuring that Parliament is increasingly unrepresentative of the life of this country by the continuance of these kind of provisions in various Acts. It is difficult enough to get a representative Parliament because of the fact that so many people are precluded from being members by nature of their occupation because in practice the vocational groups from which Parliament draws are very narrow.  There are virtually no employees in the Dáil except trade union officials.  There are one or two others&mdash;I think one local authority officially and a couple of others.</P>

      <P>We ourselves are, indeed, in jeopardy.  It is interesting that when the university membership of the Dáil was recently revised in circumstances we all feel are happy this return to an earlier tradition was greeted with considerable unhappiness in various quarters of the House even though this meant that another group of employees at last made their appearance in the Dáil virtually all the members of which are self-employed or employers or managers of some kind whether in agriculture or elsewhere. To be in a country where two-thirds of the people are employees but in practice this excludes them from membership and where then anybody who is self-employed and becomes a representative in his vocation to such a degree as to be made a director of a state company or be given an opportunity to play any particular part in public life is thereby excluded from <Col N="846" /> Parliament is to ensure, bit by bit, that you narrow Parliament to persons less qualified to act in it.</P>

      <P>We managed.  I have felt this all my life.  It is not a view I have acquired since I became a Senator or a Dáil Deputy.  Before entering politics I was increasingly disturbed by the traditional exclusion of persons from Parliament.  From the time they are appointed to a post they are ruled out of Parliament and where the Parliamentary talent is limited as it is here because our population is so small, you start with a great disadvantage.  In Britain, in France, in Germany and elsewhere there is a wider range of talent because of the bigger population. Here you effectively rule out all employees, except trade union officials and now, of course, university staffs. The remarkable thing is that we have been legislating so well, considering all the exclusions.  This cannot be done without ill-effects.  I have been always opposed to this practice which is particularly ludicrous in regard to the Seanad and above all in regard to university Senators.</P>
      <P>The ideal university Senator would know more about the whole university field and the concept of a conflict of interest in cases like that is antiquated and absurd and we ought to try to get away from it.  There is no pecuniary interest.  A man who is fulfilling a function in the arena is qualified for Parliamentary representation yet is debarred from it.  Perhaps it is thought that he might disclose confidential information in relation to his institution but there is no reason in the world to believe that a man appointed to this body would do so.  It seems to be a pointless maintenance of a bad tradition which we have maintained in this country.  It was instituted in quite a different country for quite a different reason in quite a different century.</P>

      <P>There was at one time in the Minister's party a Deputy who was an official of the ESB, though one was supposed not to be in Dáil Éireann if one was an ESB official.  He was away down the country.  It is a huge body.  I remember the man's name but I will not mention it.  This was 15 or 20 years ago and he was a Deputy for a midland constituency.  I agree with Deputy Thornley's amendment though I do not think it is right as it appears on paper.  We have this rigid stonewalling here.  We had it on the Redundancy Payments Bill. Although there were 50 amendments only about three were accepted.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that commission of some minor offence would not make it inevitable that a member of the authority would lose his job.  The amendment was suggested by student representatives who felt that if one of them became a member of this body and was involved in some demonstration or other as a result of which he received some minor sentence he would then be automatically dismissed from the authority.  This would not be, perhaps, the intention of the authors of the Bill.  Therefore, some alteration is required.  Clearly, we do not want criminals serving on this board.  It is possible for people to commit some minor offence which does not carry any great stigma with it.</P>
