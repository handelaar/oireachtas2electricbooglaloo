      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is the first major step in the process by which the people of this country will be asked to decide on the question of Ireland's membership of the European Communities and on the amendment of the Constitution which membership of the Communities will require.  I do not think that there will be any disagreement in this House or in the country in so far as putting the issue to the people in concerned.  Indeed, there cannot really be any disagreement on this since the Constitution requires <Col N="1070" /> a favourable vote of the people for any Constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>What we shall be dealing with in debating this Bill is the nature of the Constitutional amendment which will be necessary in order to enable the State to undertake the obligations of membership of the Communities and, arising from this, the form of the question to be put to the people in the proposed referendum.  The Constitutional amendment which the Government are proposing in the Bill is related and related solely to the question of membership of the three European Communities, that is, the European Coal and Steel Community established by the Treaty of Paris, the European Economic Community established by the Treaty of Rome and the European Atomic Energy Community established by the second Treaty of Rome.  The purpose of the proposed Constitutional amendment is to enable us to assume all of the obligations which membership of these three Communities, specifically, will entail.  These obligations arise from our acceptance of the Treaties of Rome and Paris and the legislation enacted by the Communities in implementation of the Treaties.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Communities it will be necessary for us to implement the provisions of the Treaties and the legislation enacted by the Communities in implementation of the Treaties.  In the case of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community this implementing legislation takes three forms, namely:</P>
    <P>Regulations &mdash; which are of general application and are directly applicable in each member State.</P>
    <P>Directives &mdash; which must be implemented by each member State.  It is up to the Government of each member State to enact whatever legislation is necessary in order to achieve the result prescribed in any directive.</P>
    <P>Decisions &mdash; must be carried out by those to whom they are addressed. Again, it is up to the Government of the member State to which a decision may be addressed to enact whatever legislation may be necessary <Col N="1071" /> in order to give effect to such a decision.</P>
    <P>In the case of the European Coal and Steel Community, decisions must be implemented while recommendations are binding as to objectives but not as to the means to attain them.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions of the Treaties are directly applicable in national law.  Furthermore, as I have mentioned, Regulations of the European Economic Community and of the European Atomic Energy Community and Decisions of the European Coal and Steel Community are also directly applicable in each member State.  It is quite clear, therefore, that membership of the European Communities involves the exercise by institutions of the Communities of certain legislative powers in limited spheres in respect of each member State.  The proposed Constitutional amendment will provide for this, Article 6.2 and Article 15.2 of the Constitution notwithstanding.</P>
    <P>I might mention that Article 6.2 reads:</P>
    <P>These powers of government are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.</P>
    <P>Article 15.2 reads:</P>
    <P>The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State. </P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice ensures uniformity in the interpretation and implementation of the Treaties of Rome and Paris and anyone may have recourse to the court in respect of Regulations and Decisions of the Communities which affect him.  Furthermore, under Article 177 of the Treaty of Rome establishing the EEC, a court of a member State must refer certain cases, for example, the question of interpretation of provisions of the Treaties, to the Court of Justice of the Communities.  The proposed Constitutional amendment would ensure that the authority and functions of the European Court of Justice could be discharged in the case of Ireland, any <Col N="1072" /> provisions of Article 34 of the Constitution notwithstanding, Article 34 being the Article setting up our Courts of Justice.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of international relations, the EEC Treaty provides for Council decisions to be taken to conclude international agreements between the Communities and other countries, these agreements to be binding on member States.  These provisions could be held to be incompatible with Article 29 of the Constitution which prescribes, <i>inter alia</i>, that we shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by the Dáil and that no international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.  The proposed Constitutional amendment would cover any such incompatibility.</P>
    <P>Having given the fullest consideration to the matter, the Government have decided that the form of Constitutional amendment as set out in the Schedule to the Bill would be the most desirable and most effective form of amendment.  In the first place, it is sufficiently comprehensive in that it covers whatever obligations we shall be assuming as a member of the three Communities which might be considered incompatible with provisions of the Constitution.  Secondly, the proposed amendment is clearly specifically limited, and is thus formulated, to obligations arising from membership of the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.  It is not intended, nor can it be interpreted as going beyond, the obligations which membership of these three Communities, as provided for in the respective Treaties, and in legislation enacted in their implementation will entail.</P>
    <P>There is a third and very important advantage in having the Constitutional amendment in the form proposed.  The Bill envisages putting a question to the people which they can answer by a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  This will enable the Irish people to pronounce in a clear-cut way and on the specific <Col N="1073" /> issue of membership for Ireland of the European Communities.  This, the Government feel, is fully in accordance with the wishes of the people on this issue of major importance to the country.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may ask why the Government did not propose an amendment which would deal, by reference to specific articles, with the incompatibilities which exist between the provisions of the Constitution and obligations of membership of the Communities.  The answer is that the Government consider that it would not be practicable to do so because the extent to which the Constitution would need to be amended is in the final analysis a matter for decision by the appropriate courts.  The Government, accordingly, decided that the most appropriate approach would be to achieve the desired result by means of an amendment which would remove the incompatibilities in a general way while ensuring at the same time that the amendment was confined to the specific obligations arising from membership of the Communities.</P>
    <P>There is a vital point on which it is most important that there should be the clearest understanding in the debate in this House on the Bill before us.  The three Treaties, with which we are concerned in the proposed Constitutional amendment, and the legislation enacted by the three Communities in implementation of the Treaties deal only with matters covered by the Treaties, that is, with economic and commercial and related social matters. The scope of the Treaties, i.e. the areas within which the Communities can operate, are contained in the purposes and aims of the Communities as set out clearly in the Treaties.</P>
    <P>I think it important also to mention a further point on which it is essential that we be quite clear.  The proposed Constitutional amendment is concerned, as I have said, only with the three European Communities at present in existence and with the obligations which we shall assume as members of these Communities.  The text of the proposed amendment has been so drafted.  It is not the Government's intention, nor is the proposed Constitutional amendment designed to cover, <Col N="1074" /> any possible incompatibility with the present Constitution which might arise as a result of obligations which it might be necessary to assume if we wished to become a member of any political community in Europe which may eventually be created and evolving from the present Communities.  Such a political community would certainly have to be based on an original and separate treaty as between the countries concerned. The question of Ireland's adherence to such a treaty would, of course, be subject to the approval of the Dáil and, depending on the form and nature of the political community proposed, might well require a separate Constitutional amendment.  This, of course, would also have to be put to the people for approval.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Go scríosfar na focail go léir i ndiaidh &ldquo;Go&rdquo; agus go gcuirfear ina n-ionad:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;ndiúltaíonn Dáil Éireann an Dara Léamh a thabhairt don Bhille ar an bhforas go bhféachann sé le leasú a dhéanamh ar an mBunreacht gan trácht ar na hAirteagail lena mbaineann agus ar shlí atá contrártha dó sin atá ceaptha in Airteagal 46.1 den Bhunreacht.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that it seeks to amend the Constitution without enumerating the Articles so affected and in a manner contrary to that intended in Article 46.1 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the one matter on which we could all agree here is the importance of the Bill now before the House. Because of the statement of April, 1970, contained in the Government's paper on membership of the European Communities and since we know that an inter-departmental committee under the chairmanship of the Attorney General were already sitting then and had at that time considered what would <Col N="1075" /> be necessary in the way of Constitutional amendments, we must assume, therefore, that the form of words presented to us in this Bill is not the result of hasty decision and that serious thought and care have been given to the actual phrasing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I might say at this stage that the Bill is even more horrifying in view of the certain knowledge that it was not something that was cooked up late at night or in a rush.  From these benches, through our Leader, Deputy Corish, we offered a mechanism to the Taoiseach and to the Government whereby, recognising that this would be a complex and possibly difficult issue, a simple question could be asked of the people in a simple, direct and straightforward way.  This was the mechanism that is contained in Article 27 of the Constitution whereby not a Constitutional amendment but simply a question could be put to the people in the form of a referendum.  Deputy Corish gave an undertaking then that if a clear and unequivocal answer was contained in that referendum we, for our part, would facilitate, in so far as lay in our power, the passage of Constitutional amendments and the legislation that would be conditional on that decision.  We argued then that the Constitutional amendments were necessarily complex and that they ought not be mixed up with the basic decision as to whether it was the national will to join the three Communities. However, that course, which seemed to us to be a reasonable, fair, just and possible one, was not even considered and, instead, we have been presented with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course there is some necessary preamble to the Bill but we have the extraordinary situation whereby something that is absolutely fundamental not only to our Constitution but to the whole direction of our nation is being decided by the essential kernel of the Bill which consists of 11 lines and two sentences.  The first of these sentences is entirely unexceptional and one that no one could disagree with. We are being asked to scrap our Constitution. We are changing the whole direction of national evolution in one sentence the implications of which are <Col N="1076" /> unclear.  I find that profoundly shocking and I am bound to say that also I find it dishonest for the reason that, indeed, a nation is entitled to change direction and is entitled to abandon a Constitution but it is not entitled to do so by stealth.  It is obligatory that the real issues be put forward for discussion.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this Bill that we are now seeking to amend.  The essential part of it, Part II, consists of 11 lines and of those, the first seven say that the State may become a member of the three Communities.  We are anxious that the people should be consulted on this.  It should be in the form of a matter for decision.  In fact, that is the kernel of it and that question could have been asked alone under the mechanism of Article 27 of the Constitution. Then, from line seven to line 11, in one sentence, we have this incredible and extraordinarily comprehensive sweeping aside of very large parts of our Constitution on the one hand while on the other hand there is an extraordinary and comprehensive acceptance of laws, of rules and of actions taken by Communities which were not responsible to any democratic organisation.  We are rubber-stamping undemocratic and bureaucratic decisions.  I find the fact that this major change, the most fundamental change in national policy and direction since the foundation of the State, should be wrapped up in four vague lines profoundly scandalous and shocking, but it is entirely in line with the determination to settle things by preventing the real issues coming before the people.  This is a bundling up of a whole number of Articles into four lines which look completely innocuous, which in my view were designed to be completely innocuous.  The tactics of the Government on this have been quite simple&mdash;to have no discussion for as long as possible and once the British decision was taken on 28th October to pretend then that there is no alternative. First no discussion, which would have teased out alternatives, and then the pretence that we have no choice.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what this one scandalous sentence means.  It is divided into two parts.  It is so concise that it requires many words to tease out these <Col N="1077" /> seemingly brief and innocuous phrases. The first part says:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities....</P>
    <P>Let us look at it in different ways. What does &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; mean? What does it mean in law?  What does it mean in ordinary common sense?  To my mind it means that any act done or any measure adopted or any law enacted which can be argued to be taken in good faith, consequent on membership of the Communities, can stand up in the face of any protection which is enshrined in our Constitution and that no appeal to the Supreme Court or to Constitutional protection will be good against any law or act or measure if it is simply shown that that law or act or measure was consequent upon our joining the Communities or consequent upon our membership of the Communities.</P>
    <P>We could spend hours looking at what has happened since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 and since it started to be implemented at the beginning of 1958.  All sorts of actions have been taken in the Community in regard, for example, to harmonisation of trade, harmonisation of investment, in regard to free movement of labour, free movement of capital, free movement of goods, in regard to quality controls, transport, social services, social welfare and all sorts of things. Decisions have been taken, events have evolved and positions have been taken up.  It is a basic principle of the Treaty of Rome that we must have harmonisation between the constituent members. Any action relevant to all of the evolutions in decision-making and in the physical development of the Community for 14 years, that can be related in good faith to this 14 years of evolution, will be legally valid and recourse to the defence of the Constitution will be swept away.</P>
    <P>We have two powers, which are quite different, enshrined in this, to me, offending and offensive sentence.  First, if we claim that actions are consequent on membership we can carry them <Col N="1078" /> out even if they are in violation of the Constitution as it currently exists and is currently interpreted.  Then in another seemingly innocuous 2¼ lines we find that anything that the Community have done in these 14 years by way of law or act or measure shall have the force of law in the State notwithstanding the fact that it is in violation of the Constitution.  First, we give ourselves permission to carry out a very wide range of actions which would at present be unconstitutional and, secondly, we give ourselves the right to implement a very wide range of actions taken over 14 years, most of them without any recourse to democratic validation.  We give ourselves the right to give them the force of law in this State even if they are contrary to the Constitution as it currently exists.</P>
    <P>To put this into one sentence and to present it in the innocuous way that the Taoiseach has now done seems to me profoundly insulting and to indicate a profound wish to make real problems go away by pretending they are not there.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech is rather brief and I do not think it takes up any of the real issues.  The Taoiseach says in the opening paragraph:</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any disagreement in this House or in the country in so far as putting the issue to the people is concerned.</P>
    <P>There will be no disagreement that the issue ought to be put to the people but there will be and is now profound disagreement as to whether or not this is the appropriate mechanism.  This is a nice example of the use of words to conceal thoughts, of the bundling up of incompatible things together.  Of course the question should be put to the people but the abandoning of our Constitution and the changing of our national direction should not be smuggled into four lines.  This is not something that anybody outside the ranks of the loyal rubber stamp Fianna Fáil Party will agree to.</P>
    <P>One has to read the Taoiseach's words very carefully always.  He has at least one talent that I am prepared to admit is a great talent.  That is a talent for seeming to say one thing <Col N="1079" /> when he means another thing.  At the time you think he means such-and-such, and so does everybody else, but when you read the small print afterwards, possessing perhaps the knowledge that he possessed at the time he made the statement which his audience did not possess, you find he did not mean that at all, that he meant something else.  Of this one peculiar talent the Taoiseach is a great practitioner. This makes us extremely cautious about everything he says.  He also said:</P>
    <P>Having given the fullest consideration to the matter, the Government have decided that the form of Constitutional amendment as set out in the Schedule to the Bill would be the most desirable and most effective form of amendment.</P>
    <P>Certainly the most effective for scrambling something through without anybody knowing that it is happening, certainly the most desirable for abandoning the Constitution while pretending to uphold it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first place, it is sufficiently comprehensive.&rdquo;  I like the use of the word &ldquo;sufficiently&rdquo; there because it is so vastly comprehensive, as I will argue presently when I look at the text of the Constitution, that it means, in fact, burying the Constitution in all its significant aspects, and that is sufficiently comprehensive for most people, but the term &ldquo;sufficiently comprehensive&rdquo; there, of course, is another piece of the bland, innocuous use of the English language that conceals a very savage reality.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Certainly, the proposed amendment is clearly and specifically limited.&rdquo; That seems to me not using words to conceal thought but using words to convey something which is the exact opposite of the intention because I will argue presently, and not only I, but also people with legal qualifications, that it is neither clearly nor specifically limited, that, in fact, the exact opposite is true, that it is not clear and not specific and not clearly limited and not specifically limited but deliberately extremely wide and extremely vague.</P>
    <P>At least, on page 4, in the third paragraph, <Col N="1080" /> we get some sort of indication of the extent.  The Taoiseach says:</P>
    <P>It would not be practicable to have reference to specific Articles because the extent to which the Constitution would need to be amended is in the final analysis a matter for decision by the appropriate courts.</P>
    <P>One of the great objections to this Bill is that, if it is passed, then a whole series of matters will not, in fact, be capable of being referred to our courts at all.  It may be that when the Taoiseach says &ldquo;the appropriate courts&rdquo; he means the European Court of Justice but what this Bill does, as I will indicate presently, is to take extremely large areas of legal decision out of the power of the Supreme Court and though the Supreme Court has had many defects I think it has by and large functioned as an upholder of people's liberties.  Its power would be vastly undermined by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have the argument about a political community.  That is in the last paragraph.  The suggestion here is that we would have a choice in regard to this political community if we adhere to the existing three Communities, the Euratom and the Coal and Steel and the Economic Communities but if, in fact, we participate in them in an open-ended way, and if we merge our economies with no possibility of getting out, the reality of choice in regard to adhering to a political community will not exist in a few years, as the Taoiseach well knows, and, therefore, on the day when a political community comes, we will not have discussed the fundamental national implications now because the thing has been treated in this way and when it comes to a political community, if it does, we will have no choice because we will already be participating in the other three Communities and what will be the choice is whether we go on participating in them without any political influence or whether we go along and have political influence but by separating the political from the economic at this moment the Taoiseach is trying to bundle us along, again without discussion, to a moment where the possibility of alternative choices will have ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> I do not propose to treat further with what the Taoiseach has said because, in fact, in a way that we have come to expect, he has said very little, indeed, of either his real intention or the fundamental reasons why he is doing what he is doing.</P>
    <P>Let us think for a moment about this Constitution that we are asked to abandon.  The Constitution has been criticised by all parties.  It has some very serious defects.  It is in some ways a barrier to national unity.  Of course, it needs to be amended and, indeed, there is a good deal of common opinion among all three parties and other interests in the State about the ways in which it needs to be amended.  This is all true.  But, when that is said, I think one can read it in some sections with a good deal of pride.  Are we not all profoundly glad, for example, that it is a Republican Constitution and that we are not brainwashed and degraded by the remnants of monarchical traditions such as other countries possess?  Is this not an admirable thing?  Are not we pleased that in many ways it is a democratic Constitution?  Are not we pleased that it gives certain specific guarantees to women?  I think we can be pleased about all these things.  Its defects, if one looks at them, are fairly minor and could readily be removed had we the political will to do so.  I mean the will as distinct from the words expressing a will to do so.  We have the words expressing that will but we do not have the action.  By and large, considering its time, the Constitution was an admirable document in its day and, looking at some of the Constitutions that exist around the world, in fact, it is a good Constitution.  It has enshrined a good deal of liberties and, as interpreted by the Supreme Court from time to time, and, indeed, as defended by the people in referenda, it has continued to enshrine a good deal of liberty.  In fact, its defects are as meaningful as its strengths because it summed up a good deal of the thinking and the atmosphere, even to its bits of vocationalism and the rest of it, of the thirties, when it was produced.  Of course, the world has gone on from there.  But the essential thing to do with our Constitution is to modernise it and to remove the offending bits and not to scrap it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> What are the general objections? There are general and specific objections that have moved us to put down the amendment that I am now introducing. There are two general objections. The first is that a formulation as wide as &ldquo;consequent upon&rdquo; is, in fact, bad law.  I am not a lawyer.  There was a time when lawyers were much more available to other parties than to our party but with the evolution of time we have as good legal advice as any other party at present, I am pleased to say, and it is seriously argued by people of profound expertise that when something is as vague, as indefinite, as imprecise in its application and interpretation as this Bill is, in fact, it is an invitation to litigation and it is, as the lawyers have put it to me, simply bad law.</P>
    <P>I understand, for example, that in the United States the Supreme Court has struck down legislation on the basis of what they term &ldquo;legal vagueness&rdquo;. I understand also that at a certain level lawyers in all countries try to converge in their methods, in their standards and in their attitudes and that what is a good argument in an evolved and in some ways democratic nation like the United States, while not automatically applicable here, would at least have some force with lawyers in this country.  It is proper that that should be so.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that because you cannot with any precision look to just what bits of the basic Constitution of the State would be invalidated, that is so vague as to constitute bad law.  The second general objection is that, in fact, in the Constitution itself a mechanism is envisaged for the changing of the Constitution.  I refer to that section of the Constitution headed &ldquo;Amendment of the Constitution&rdquo;.  It is Article 46.  The first clause states:</P>
    <P>Any provision of this Constitution may be amended, whether by way of variation, addition, or repeal, in the manner provided by this Article.</P>
    <P>I take these words to have been carefully thought out and to mean what they say.  Again, I am not a lawyer, but when one listens to and sees constitutional lawyers analysing sentences, the <Col N="1083" /> analysis turns on meaning and on the intention of the people who put the words on paper and, having put them on paper, looked at them, scratched out, added bits and tried to express exactly what they meant.  Article 46 says &ldquo;Any provision of this Constitution&rdquo;; it does not say a whole lot of specified blanket provisions of the Constitution may be so changed.  It says that any one may be amended and the mechanism of amendment is the variation of the Article, or an addition to the Article, or a repeal of the Article.  That is what it says.  I take Clause 1 of Article 46 to mean clearly and absolutely that you may not change the Constitution in what I might describe as a buckshot way; you fire off some destructive legislation in the general direction of the Constitution and you destroy whatever particular Articles of it that you happen to hit.</P>
    <P>That is what this Bill says.  It does not say what Articles it happens to hit.  It does not say what Articles, or bits of Articles, it happens to knock out.  It just says that anything consequent on membership of these three Communities will be followed notwithstanding what is in the Constitution. In other words, anything the Communities have done will have the force of law here notwithstanding the Constitution. Now, I am urging this not as a lawyer, but I have talked to lawyers about it, and this does seem to me absolutely at variance with the intention of Clause 1 of Article 46.  It is not just bad law on the basis of legal vagueness, on the basis of the imprecision, on the basis of lack of clarity; it is bad law on the basis that it violates, in my view, Clause 1 of Article 46.  It is, in fact, much too general.  I think that this to some extent may have been in the Taoiseach's mind when he uttered some of the words he did because at page 3 of the supplied script when he says the proposed amendment is clearly and specifically limited, he is saying the exact opposite of what is true.  He is trying to isolate precisely what the core of the technical objection to the Bill is and to make that objection to go away by <Col N="1084" /> denying it is there.  There is no stretch of thought, or manipulation of words and no reversal of the meaning of words, by which the proposed amendment can be seen to be clearly and specifically limited.  The opposite is the case.  It would be an extraordinarily messy situation if we were to go through this whole rigmarole of debating this Bill here and then finding. that someone promptly took it to the Supreme Court.  There is, as the Taoiseach must know, being himself a member of the legal profession, good legal opinion in good professional standing which considers this so vague, so imprecise and such bad law, and such a formulating of legislation with a political motive and not with a clearcut legal one, that it is not possible to guarantee the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court.  The Taoiseach can get himself certainly a legal opinion which will tell him that such an appeal to the Supreme Court will be well-merited and a well worth while undertaking.</P>
    <P>I was rather hoping, clearly without a valid foundation, that, even at the last minute, the Government might think: &ldquo;Let us have some other mechanism by which we can get a nice clearcut question asked of the people.&rdquo; Then the Government could remind us of the promise we made, when they got a clearcut answer under the mechanism we suggested, Article 27, that this was clearly the will of the people and the consequential changes in the Constitution would be facilitated.  I thought there would be an abandonment of large lumps of this section because of the objections, not of people like myself, who have fundamental objections to our full membership of the Community certainly on the present terms, but because of the objections of legal people who have indicated that this is a careless, foolish, confused, politically motivated and generally extremely unsatisfactory piece of legislation, if it ever gets through this House.  I would have thought that in the light of these arguments we might see a last-minute change of mind because the Taoiseach must know, with his own feed back in the legal profession, that these are cogent arguments <Col N="1085" /> widely held by lawyers whose professional expertise is not in doubt.</P>
    <P>We have now envisaged a mechanism, if one goes on about the general objections to it, that could alter the fundamental rights of citizens, that could alter the position of Parliament, that could alter the rights, the functions and even the mechanism of appointing judges, that could tamper with <i>habeas corpus,</i> that could alter the system of election, that could alter control of ownership of natural resources, and all sorts of things like that, without recourse to this Oireachtas.  We propose a mechanism that could alter so many things so fundamentally without recourse to this Oireachtas or to any direct democratic institution that one might well postulate all sorts of Acts being introduced here and, if they were consequent upon EEC membership, and, notwithstanding anything in the Constitution, they would have to have the force of law if it were argued they were done <i>bona fide</i> consequent on EEC membership.</P>
    <P>This, of course, may be the way the Taoiseach is thinking, or his advisers, to get around a whole number of Articles in the Constitution they do not particularly like but in regard to which they do not want to face the battle in doing away with them.  They do not want to face the crunch so they consign them to oblivion in this block sort of way without ever having to argue anything out or introduce legislation to repeal them.</P>
    <P>Before going on to look at the particular objections in the Articles the Government themselves spelled out in the White Paper in April, 1970, I want to say a word about the concept of sovereignty and about the concept of a nation.  This is not simply for the purpose of discussing these concepts but because they are central in any discussion of the Constitution.  They are essential because in Article 1 of the Constitution, the whole of the first section is called &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo;.  The third word in the Constitution is &ldquo;nation&rdquo;.  It says, &ldquo;The Irish nation hereby affirms&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; occurs in the second line.  The concept of sovereignty is fundamental to the whole of the thinking and the <Col N="1086" /> whole of the struggle that culminated in the promulgation of this Constitution in 1937.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that sovereignty in any agreement is to some extent abated, abrogated or diminished and we are therefore doing nothing different here when, as the Taoiseach rightly said, we take the first step in adhering to the three Communities.  When we seek to adhere to these Communities we are doing nothing essentially different from what we do if we have a trade agreement with somebody.  It must be clear, and again one is using words not to confuse or obscure the truth but to try to clarify things, that when you have two events so vastly different in magnitude and kind, that you can only honestly talk about them as being different in kind.  It could be argued that the thing which comes literally in a matchbox, called a matchbox and shaped like a motor car is the same sort of thing as the car parked out in the parking lot.  It could be argued that the rockets which children light at Hallowe'en are the same sort of rockets that take people to the moon but the scale, the intent, the investment, the significance and the power of these two things which are described by the same word, is so different that in fact it is specious and dishonest to say they are the same thing.</P>
    <P>Any relationship between nations as between persons involves some diminution of freedom and in that abstract, total sense it involves a diminution of sovereignty if we are referring to nations.  To argue that a trade agreement or any sort of pact between sovereign nations, which is capable of being reversed, is really no different from the joining of the-Communities, which is open-ended, which once we have done it for a few years even if we wanted legally to reverse it, would not be economically reversible in real terms, is the same thing and that since sovereignty is diminished by having any sort of relations with any other sovereign nation we are used to the idea of diminishing sovereignty and we may therefore go into the EEC without any worries because it is the same sort of diminution of sovereignty, seems to me as bogus an argument as <Col N="1087" /> to equate children's rockets with moon rockets because they are so different in scale and significance.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are apt to make our politics into theology.  We are inclined to elevate sovereignty to a principle which has some abstract value for us. I am not arguing for the defence of Irish sovereignty in abstract terms.  The reason people want sovereignty and want to defend it is because it enables them to do things for themselves which they consider to be good for themselves. It is dressed up in extremely flowery and, often indeed, in our circumstances, in mystical language but at the core of this verbal wrapping there is the reality of the power to make decisions concerning oneself and that is the sovereignty one is concerned about.</P>
    <P>The fact that the opening section of the Constitution is called &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; indicates the significance of the idea of nation to Irish people.  This again is something that has often been wrapped up in vague and mystical terms.  People have fought and died for it without being too sure what it was. This again, for us, is a clearcut conception, it is a conception not abstract, not mystical, not having any validity for theoretical reasons, only having validity if it enables people to live together and evolve a community and a culture together and evolve all the things which are collectively known as a way of life together.</P>
    <P>The reason it is important to define this is because hundreds of years ago people envisaged the existence of a nation as a goal long before there was one and they moved towards it with great persistence, great courage and great dedication.  It can be argued that the full attainment of this, which is put in its significance in national life correctly by being put as the first section of the Constitution, has not been completed.  We have, however, to say that it is important as a goal to the Irish people, that it is something we have moved a long way towards, that it is something we have not finally attained and it is something we care about profoundly.  If those things are <Col N="1088" /> true, and I believe they are true and I believe on that we might have consensus here, then we have to talk about the idea of a nation in the context of this first effort to get us into these three Communities.</P>
    <P>Let us look at which parts of the Constitution would have to go if we were to pass this Bill, let us try to tease out the thing which it is reckoned to be too complex to be done in public and too complex to be embodied in referenda and so complex that the Taoiseach suggests, &ldquo;the extent to which the Constitution would need to be amended is, in the final analysis, a matter for decision by the appropriate courts&rdquo;.  When working properly the courts are the guardians of many things, but that does not mean Parliament should give up the task of trying to tease these things out and look at them.</P>
    <P>In April, 1970, the White Paper &ldquo;Membership of the European Communities, Implications for Ireland&rdquo; was published.  April, 1970, seems like a different world now.  The sky had not fallen at that time and the exigencies of the political situation were not such that the Government had to try and scramble something as complex and as delicate as this through this Parliament and past the gaze of the Irish people without really explaining to them what was involved.  At that time, after the deliberations of the inter-departmental committee under the chairmanship of the Attorney General, we were told a certain amount, although in my view nothing like enough even then about the Constitutional implications. If we are asked now to sweep away the various sections, we might look at what from the Government's side we were told then.  I am referring to page 2 of the 1970 White Paper and again this was considered sufficiently significant to be put as chapter 1 of that White Paper, which is entitled, &ldquo;Constitutional and Legal Implications&rdquo;. I am quoting from page 2, 1.5, which states:</P>
    <P>Among the provisions of the Constitution which have to be considered in this regard are:</P>
    <P>(i) Article 5, which states that <Col N="1089" /> Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State;  </P>
    <P>By the Government's own admission, Article 5 is at least in doubt in the context of its being retained in the Constitution if we adhere to the Communities. My reason for talking about sovereignty a minute ago was that I was coming on to refer to Article 5. This Article, which is a very central one and one which I must say I am very proud of, clearly could not be retained. I am proud that it says that Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State, but it could not retain sovereignty in the way I have defined it.  One might have an argument about the amount of sovereignty and it could be argued on the other side that we would participate in a larger sovereignty, but that participation would be proportional to the power of each of the participating nations in the ten.  There are veto mechanisms and other mechanisms which are of doubtful duration; one might visualise a time in which this kind of unanimity protection will diminish and perhaps the great nations, the Germans, the French and the British will retain sovereignty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking, I think, if we are to be realistic, about a situation in which the separate entities of decision-making will disappear and you will tend to merge into a general decision-making mechanism and then power will depend on relative economic size.  I recognise that there are voting strengths at this moment and veto mechanisms, but I am talking about the direction of evolution.  I do not see any way, particularly as the smallest, poorest, weakest, slowest-growing and most under-developed <Col N="1090" /> nation of the ten with one two-hundredth of the GNP of the ten, that we can talk about sovereignty or equally of independence, because they are the two sides of the same medal.</P>
      <P>I accept that there are arguments that may be so valid that perhaps they sweep away other arguments, which would say in the 1970s for three million people with the economic weakness I have described to talk about sovereignty and independence is cloud-cuckoo land; be realistic about it: merge yourself in a greater entity. That is an argument that conceivably might convince the majority of the Irish people.  What I object to in this context is the pretence that sovereignty or independence is not diminished. Even more, I object to the sweeping aside of that Article which is absolutely central to the whole direction of evolution and aspiration of this nation without mentioning it or naming it.  It is just delicately and quietly swept away.</P>
      <P>The Constitution says we are democratic, but those who have looked at the decision-making mechanisms of the Community at present do not see democratic decision-making mechanisms. I think the word democratic is an umbrella&mdash;or put it this way&mdash;a bucket into which you put whatever you want to put.  I think democracy means vastly more than elected national parliaments or elected supranational bodies or elected local authorities.  I think it means vastly more than that.  It is seen to mean more than that in this decade.  But we are moving away from the democracy that is enshrined in the Constitution of which I am very proud by adhering to a Community which has promises about democracy and has indeed a bit of genuflection in the direction of democracy in terms of a European Parliament.  But it is window-dressing. To call this thing in Strasbourg a parliament is less than honest, because it does not have the powers of a parliament. It would be honest to call it a consultative assembly, but there is a diminution of democracy in adhering to these Communities as at present constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that Article 6 (2), even <Col N="1091" /> according to the Government's own pre-crisis statement, would have to go. One could spend time on this, but there is no point in doing so: there is general acceptance on all sides that it could not be retained.  It is quite central because it relates to the derivation of powers of government from the people. Article 15 (2) vests in the Oireachtas the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State <i>et cetera.</i>  It is clear and we have it from all sides that this would have to go.  In sweeping aside Article 15 (2), we would be emasculating ourselves in this institution. Defective as it is in many ways, at least it has certain decision-making powers.</P>
    <P>Again, according to the Government's document of April, 1970 the question arises of the powers of the Supreme Court under Article 34 (4) 6º of the Constitution, which provides that the decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive. In fact, just as we would be downgrading ourselves as a parliament, the Supreme Court would find itself subservient to the European Court and whatever decision it handed down would be capable of being taken to the European Court.  There is the question of the power of this Parliament to establish agreements with other nations and those agreements, when entered into, having validity in relation to the decisions of this Oireachtas.  We know that even at its present level of evolution, the Community enters into international relationships which are binding on the participant States and therefore, again on the Government's own analysis, Article 29 (5) 2º and Article 29 (6) would both have to go.</P>
    <P>Those are very large holes in the Constitution even on the Government's analysis of it, when you look at the Constitution as a whole.  It has articles to the number of 50 but many of them, if you examine the table of contents, are concerned with the detailed mechanisms of doing precise and special things.  When you take out of that Constitution the sovereignty and independence of the country which it affirmed, the power of this Oireachtas, the power of the Supreme Court and <Col N="1092" /> the power to enter into international agreements, you are left with many other sections but they are sections consisting of small-printed, technical details.  When those sections are gone, the guts of the Constitution are gone. This is not in fact amending or modifying the Constitution.  In a real sense if you look at it&mdash;I am not doing it by counting sentences or commas or pages &mdash;the real decisions, the real rights and powers enshrined in that Constitution, if you look at them, all of them are gone in this neat, anodyne, innocuous, bland 11 lines that the Taoiseach has so gently and quietly and shyly introduced. It is very neat, but I ask myself is it very honest and when I look at it, I answer myself that it is not.  This is the effort to evade discussion, to evade national decision.</P>
    <P>The document was written by the Government in April, 1970&mdash;in precrisis times when there was not the acute problem of the party managers and of the Government&mdash;but even they would have been concerned to dress the thing up as blandly as possible. That being so, I looked at the Constitution to see if other parts of it would have to go in addition to what the Government have set out themselves.</P>
    <P>Oddly enough, the first Article that will have to go is Article No. 1&mdash;which, one would have thought, would be where the central thought would be enshrined.  Article 1 states that the Irish nation affirms its inalienable right to determine its relations with other nations.  There are other inalienable rights enshrined in this section, but that right, according to the Constitution, cannot be taken away.  It was considered important enough to be described as &ldquo;inalienable, indefeasible and sovereign&rdquo;.  Article 1 states that the Irish nation affirms its right to determine its relations with other nations and states that this right cannot be taken away.</P>
    <P>If the reality is that the institutions of the Community may form relationships with other groupings, which are binding on us, if those decisions are taken by the Council of Ministers, how can we say we are retaining the right to determine our relations with other nations?  There is no way out of this. <Col N="1093" /> It is not just a quibble, it is an inescapable fact.  In the last few years I have grown accustomed to the fact that although we put up serious arguments, they are not answered.  I have noticed the way trivia are picked out for the sake of conducting a debate which goes on for half an hour and sounds like a serious debate but, in fact, is nothing of the kind.  I have no doubt that any important points raised will be ignored as usual.  There will not be any effort made to have a serious meeting of minds.  The matter we are discussing is serious.  We are being asked to alienate a right which the Constitution says is inalienable.</P>
    <P>Article 3 is interesting because it starts by saying: &ldquo;Pending the reintegration of the national territory....&rdquo; Our Constitution makes a claim to enact laws which have jurisdiction in Saorstát Éireann, but it says that the doing of this is without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory. The territory has been defined in Article 2.</P>
    <P>We can argue whether this is right or wrong.  If we decide collectively that it is wrong, we can change it.  There are many good arguments to suggest that we should change it, but it is a pity to change it by default.  What about the mechanism where the United Kingdom takes our claim to the European Court of Justice?  What if the European Court of Justice says that we have not exercised that right in the life of the State, that we cannot go on claiming it forever and that it has no validity, that if we want to go on asserting its validity we will be in breach of a decision of the European Court of Justice?  The British must surely be thinking of ending this anomalous situation by that legal device if their legal advisers are using their heads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that it is possible, but if it is possible we will be sweeping away Article 3&mdash;without discussion.</P>
      <P>We have referred to Article 5 already.  We have been thinking in terms of the EEC but we are asked to adhere to three Communities at present, one of which is the Coal and Steel Community.  That Community take supra-national decisions about the coal and steel industries.  We do not have coal or steel at the moment, but we have a large continental shelf and we know about the developments that have taken place throughout the world in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Article 10, claims are made in regard to all natural resources and section 2 of that Article refers to all land, moneys, minerals and waters belonging to Saorstát Éireann.  Those claims could not be upheld if we adhere to the second of the three treaties we are being asked to approve &mdash;the treaty that set up the Coal and Steel Community.  On the face of it, this is not important at the moment because we have no significant coal or steel industries but we have an enormous continental shelf.  The technology of obtaining resources from the continental shelf is advancing almost monthly and the question of our sovereignty over all our natural resources is important.  It has been made more important by the way in which our mines and other resources are being developed at this moment.  The claims in Article 10 with regard to our natural <Col N="1095" /> resources could not be sustained, part of them would have to go, if we adhere to the treaty setting up the Coal and Steel Community.  Article 15, section 6 is rather ludicrous in the light of present events.  Section 6.1º states that the right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas.  Would that it were so at present.</P>

One is aware that the Americans are entering an isolationist phase and are withdrawing their forces and important American periodicals are talking about further withdrawals from Europe.  One also takes note of the Heath/Pompidou joint arms discussions.  It is inconceivable that there will not be a European Army and that we will not be required to contribute to that Army, whether money, personnel or both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Article says that the right to raise and maintain military armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas.  Everybody agrees that we have to look on the Communities as being evolving.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has approved the Treaty of Rome without reservation. I met nobody in Europe, including the Commissioners, who approved of the Treaty of Rome without reservation. Apparently we are the only people who do, on the Government side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The direction of evolution is such that we have to discuss the question of whether we will be required to contribute <Col N="1096" /> both personnel and money to an army over which this Oireachtas will not have control.  Article 28 is about making war and about our traditional neutrality.  I do not think we would have the right as a member of the Community to decide on neutrality.  I do not know who said it, but I certainly heard it said that a Europe worth joining is a Europe worth defending.  An argument can be made for saying: &ldquo;Let us accept a responsibility towards a European army and towards the defence of Europe.&rdquo;  If the majority of people accept that argument well and good, that is fine.</P>
    <P>What I object to is the effort to settle all these things together and to bundle another central piece of Irish policy, which I admire and applaud and approve of very much, the policy of neutrality, out of the way without talking about it.  This solves a lot of problems. You are encumbered with myths that you live with and win elections with.  You take them out and parade them solemnly at crossroads during elections.  You are really secretly rather ashamed of them but you do not know how to get rid of them.  You have not got the political courage to face them and argue them through.  You use this mechanism to sweep out of the way a whole lot of things, some of which are myths that ought to be argued through and disposed of, and some of which are extremely precious to the people and, in my view, rightly so.</P>
    <P>I could go on through the Constitution but I do not propose to spend more time doing so.  I have taken this much time to indicate how misleading and how inaccurate is the claim which the Taoiseach made, that the proposed amendment is clearly and specifically limited, and also to indicate that what we are doing&mdash;and we might as well be plain and blunt about it&mdash;is abandoning every significant provision in the Constitution of 1937.  If the argument were put that times change and that situations evolve that would be different.  I think the Constitution has defects, although it also contains some good provisions.  I do not think it is as good as our first Constitution.  The 1937 Constitution was a retrograde step but, <Col N="1097" /> if you compare it with the Constitutions in Europe at that time, you will find that it was very good, indeed, and we could be proud of the vast majority of its provisions.  The argument that it should be made a little better is valid. There is a consensus of agreement about it but not that it should be ditched in this absolutely fundamental way, and not by abandoning pretty well every significant provision by stealth.</P>
    <P>I said before that I found it a little depressing here that trivia are picked on for reply from the Government side and that there is a studied policy of evading the essence of criticism. Therefore, we go through the motions of debate without ever having a meeting of minds and without ever trying to talk to each other and listen to each other.  This is depressing in a national Parliament.  It is particularly depressing when the task before the national Parliament is a debate on a request that it should abolish its own power and position, that it should abolish the power and position of the Supreme Court, and that it should abolish the sovereignty of the nation which sends us here.</P>
    <P>We have this seemingly innocuous Bill which, in fact, proposes a fundamental change in the direction of our national life and in the thinking about every aspect of our national life, and which involves abandonment of our Constitution.  We had a brief and anodyne introduction to it which studiously avoided raising any of the real issues.  Therefore I have the feeling that there is not much use in talking to the Government.  I do not think they are listening.  I do not think they are arguing with the Opposition.  I do not think they are explaining what they are doing.  Their tactic is the opposite &mdash;to avoid argument, to avoid discussion, to go their merry way and to use the majority they have at this moment to get their decisions carried into law.  I do not think there is much point in talking to them.</P>
    <P>There are some other sections of the community and one might use the national Parliament to talk to them. In urging this amendment on the House, perhaps the first section one <Col N="1098" /> might talk to is the other part of the Opposition, the Fine Gael Party.  If one were to ask: &ldquo;Is not the abolition of the competition between nation States in Europe and the abolition of old animosities a good thing?&rdquo;&mdash;who in any party would disagree?  Of course it is a good thing.  If one were to say: &ldquo;We ought to look beyond our national boundaries and think and plan and act as Europeans&rdquo; there would be agreement.  Where there is disagreement&mdash;and I suspect it is a disagreement which would be found in all three parties if the debate were to be held openly&mdash;is about the actual terms under which we are currently urged to join the three Communities which, though they call themselves European, are not indeed the whole of Europe. At that level there is disagreement.</P>
    <P>I believe that at a higher level there is agreement in all three parties in regard to the idea of a drawing together of separate European nation States provided there are certain safeguards. There would be a very great measure of agreement in the House on that.  What we are disagreeing about is the mechanism, the safeguards, the terms and, indeed, the current structure and the likely direction of evolution of the three Communities who slightly misappropriate the word &ldquo;European&rdquo; in their titles.  If they were to call themselves the Mid-European Economic Community, the Mid-European Coal and Steel Community and the Mid-European Atomic Energy Community, that might be more accurate.</P>
    <P>There will be a good deal of disagreement on long-term objectives, inevitably, in all three parties.  This is not confined to Ireland.  We have seen political parties in every country in Europe, inside their own boundaries and inside their own ranks, divided on this issue.  Some of them expressed their disagreements more clearly than others and, in some, the disagreements are more profound than in others.  Relationship to Europe, if I may use that word in inverted commas and with a capital letter, is a matter of disagreement among people of goodwill in all parties in Europe and in all countries.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Bill which is totally unacceptable in my view and which <Col N="1099" /> ignores the mechanism of asking a simple question which we in this party offered, the Article 27 mechanism, a Bill which seeks to make the most profound and fundamental changes by stealth, by the denial of democracy, the denial of debate, the denial of the presentation of the real issues, the denial of argument on those issues. Surely we can agree that this is completely unacceptable and that the Bill does not deserve to be given a Second Reading in this House.</P>
    <P>At present the Taoiseach and his Government, regardless of whether they like the phraseology, are maintained in power by a coalition of votes. That coalition is not one that consists of the Taoiseach's own monolithic, homogeneous party and some others but a coalition that consists of some of his party who are of one point of view, some who are of another point of view and of some people outside who would agree with the minority inside.  None the less, it is a coalition. I would like to say to the people who are known by the imprecise term of &ldquo;dissidents&rdquo; that so far as I can see, apart from personalities, intrigues and so on, the kernel of the divisions relates to the question of independence, of sovereignty and of nationhood. Differences of points of view on those subjects would express themselves as differences in attitudes towards the North and what decision should be taken in that regard.  These people have presented themselves and, I think, at times with accuracy, as being more determined to uphold what one might call the traditional Fianna Fáil conception of sovereignty, of independence and of nationhood such as are enshrined in the Constitution.  By and large, they have been more inclined to oppose those traditions than have the vast majority who are led currently by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It may be said that there is no division and that it is a question of personalities that is involved, but I do not think that is true.  Some of these people have suffered a number of credibility shocks in recent times, but if they want an opportunity to assert <Col N="1100" /> their difference and to assert that the Constitution of 1937, with its imperfections, ought to be perfected and improved but not abolished, they have an issue on this amendment.  They have an issue that is as near to being a clear-cut one as they are ever likely to get, because the issue is really related to defence of the Constitution, which is another phrase for defence of the nation.  If these people want to indicate that their difference is a valid one and if they want to uphold by a vote in Parliament all those things they say outside with such vehemence, this is their opportunity.</P>
    <P>Finally, one might address, with respect, a thought and a request to the person who is accepted generally as being the author of the Constitution or who, if not the author, was to a great extent the inspirer of it.  I refer to the person who is now our President. We know that Article 13, 7, 1º provides that:</P>
    <P>The President may, after consultation with the Council of State, communicate with the Houses of the Oireachtas by message or address on any matter of national or public importance.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of national and public importance.  Never has there been one that was more so but we know, too, that this right of the President is hedged around by 3º of that Article, which says:</P>
    <P>Every such message or address must, however, have received the approval of the Government. </P>
    <P>That is interesting.  What does it mean?  Must it have received the approval of the Government regarding its content, or must it have received their approval in regard to the right of the President to express his opinions here?  Do the Government have to rubber stamp its content, or could they ask him to express his opinions?  I believe they could ask him to express his opinion and they could give him this right to address the Oireachtas, without asking to write the text of what he says.  More than any other he is the person who, by reason of his office, symbolises this nation.  That is beyond argument but this is not only by reason <Col N="1101" /> of his office, but because of the role he has played in Irish history since before 1916 and because of the various decisions he took, the correctness of which one might either agree or disagree with&mdash;very often I would disagree with the correctness of some of those decisions.  However, nobody reading Irish history since before 1916 can question the central role played by the President at every step of the way.  More than any other man, he has put his stamp on this State in regard both to the defects as well as the good things.  Nobody more than he has put his stamp on the Constitution.  While this document is not formally the authorship of any one individual, it is understood that it was significantly, with the exception, possibly, of some legal advice and minor amendments, the work of his mind and his hand.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is a document that was drawn up carefully.  It contains a great deal of thought in all its sections. One can make a mistake by elevating an eminent person to the point where he is completely without the right to express his opinion.  Nobody more than the President has the right to express his opinion on the abandonment of the Constitution and, indeed, on the larger question of the abandonment of our sovereignty and our entry into the Community.  All the evidence at our disposal indicates that he respects the laws of the State and the Constitution. Therefore, we have no reason to think that he would take an initiative that could be construed as being contrary to Article 13, section (7), 3º of the Constitution, but if the Government wanted genuinely to have his opinion, they could request him to communicate by message or address with the Houses of the Oireachtas and they could indicate to him that what they wanted was not a reflection of their own policy, which is known already but, rather, his personal thought on the matter.  The subject we are discussing is the most central issue to be discussed since the foundation of the State and the reason for raising these matters on the Bill is that in his opening sentence, the Taoiseach described the Bill as the first major step in the process by which the people of this <Col N="1102" /> country would be asked to decide on Irish membership of the EEC.  This is the first step in what is the most important process in the history of the State and, in terms of the direction in which the nation is going, it is more important than the foundation of the State itself because the foundation of the State marked an important milestone in the evolution towards a fully developed, sovereign and independent nation.</P>
    <P>It did not mark a change of direction in the general impetus and evolution of Irish national consciousness and thinking which had been going on for well over 100 years before that. What we are being asked to do now, does mark a major change of direction. I am not, for a moment, denying the right of people to change direction if they believe, in their wisdom, they ought to change direction but they must be clear as to what they are doing. This is profoundly important, quite genuinely, and not in terms of chitchat. We have so debased in this House, certainly in my time here, argument with each other, into scoring trivial political points, that when there is an effort to say something serious the inclination is to say: &ldquo;That is just playing politics.&rdquo;  This is fundamentally serious.  I hope that on that, at least, we can agree.  It is a change of direction which the people of the nation are entitled to make but only in the full knowledge of what they are doing.  I believe the Government ought to ask the President for his opinion of this Bill and make that meaningful by saying that what they want to hear is the contents of his mind and not relay to this Parliament a statement which they themselves produce.</P>
    <P>In commending this amendment to the House, and in urging both the Opposition and the dissidents to support it, I want to say that there may not be too many opportunities on clear-cut issues like this to vote the Government out of office in the near future. This is such an opportunity if they want to take it.  It is a situation of principle, of fundamental importance, a situation in which the most significant decision facing the Irish nation <Col N="1103" /> in this country, even more than the foundation of the State, is being taken by stealth, by deceit, by fraud, by an effort to conceal the true nature and the true content of what we are deliberating on.  It is also a piece of legislation that is incompetent and that good professional people believe to be bad law, to be itself a source of litigation, confusion and appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I urge on those who are serious about really wanting to consult the nation on this&mdash;and we have given the undertaking that we will accept the nation's decision when given, on condition that there is real consultation&mdash; those who want to put an end to this Government by deceit, Government by pretending that there is no problem, no crisis and no real issue at stake when fundamental questions are at stake, those who want to put an end to that both in the Opposition and among the dissidents, that they have an opportunity now to produce a major improvement in the national situation, to produce the general election we wish for by voting in support of this amendment and by refusing to give this totally inadequate and ill-conceived Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I should prefer, with your permission, to speak at this moment.  I have relatively little to add to what Deputy Keating has said.  It is a measure of the seriousness with which the Labour Party view this extraordinary Bill that they have utilised the provision of Standing Order No. 90, section 2, to oppose the Bill in this manner on Second Reading. This is a device which has not been adopted for very many years in this House and it demonstrates our total opposition to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the time or place to discuss the issue of membership of the EEC as such, or the terms upon which the Government recommend entry.  I hold strong views on these subjects. <Col N="1104" /> but it would be inappropriate to voice them in the context of this Bill.  What the Labour Party specifically object to, more than anything else, is the provision made in the final sentence of this Bill.  Nobody challenges the right of any Government to seek constitutional amendment although I would respectfully suggest to the Taoiseach that the record of lack of success by the Fianna Fáil Party in endeavouring to amend the Constitution is scarcely encouraging in this case.  What we object to most specifically is the looseness of language in the last sentence. It reads:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof from having the force of law in this State.</P>
    <P>I find this sentence absolutely shocking and outrageous.  Sitting there with the text of the Bill before me and then the text of the Taoiseach's speech, I do not know which I found more extraordinary&mdash;the Bill or the almost frivolous manner in which the Taoiseach introduced it.  To say in his first sentence:</P>
    <P>Indeed, there cannot really be any disagreement on this since the Constitution requires a favourable vote of the people for any constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and then to go on to propose a Bill which effectively abrogates many sections of the Constitution without the necessity of recourse to the people, is a classic example of the manner in which the liberties of the citizens of this nation have been progressively eroded over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The process of referendum to change a written, strict Constitution is one which is common to almost every democratic country of the western world.  England is almost unique in the absence of a written Constitution.  Some would argue that the long parliamentary tradition of that country renders such a Constitution unnecessary but it has been widely remarked by many people in England, in the context of <Col N="1105" /> this specific issue of membership of the EEC, that it is a very unhappy situation in that country where the passage of an Act of Parliament and subsequent consequent enabling Acts is sufficient, without a general election, to take so major a decision affecting the future of that country.  How much more so in our case is it regrettable that this Bill should propose not merely a simple constitutional amendment, as could have been done under Article 46 of the Constitution, but rather the sort of covert, enabling measure which, in effect, gives a blank cheque to the Government of the day to ratify acts taken in the past by the States of the Community and implicitly acts taken very possibly in the future?  I am open to correction on that point but I want reassurance on it.  I do not think I will get it.  As Deputy Keating said, you rarely get straight answers to straight questions in this House.  I should like it made clear to me whether future amendments, for example, of the Treaty of Rome will be automatically applicable to this country irrespective of whether or not they clash with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word in praise of our Constitution.  It has its defects. Some of them have been brought home forcibly to the Taoiseach by the Rev. Mr. Paisley and Mr. Desmond Boal in recent days and received to my mind the rather evasive and, if I may use an unpleasant expression, hypocritical rejoinder from the Taoiseach on &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; the other night that amendments of that kind can be viewed in the context of unity.  In other words, if the North joined us we would then consider whether we would amend our Constitution to render it a truly pluralist one and acceptable to the North.  This is the sort of amendment which in some ways would be better occupying the attention of the Taoiseach and the Government than the kind of amendment he is placing before us here.  I am not suggesting that such amendment should be taken in conjunction with this particular amendment.  I, too, am grateful that at least the relatively straight question in the first Part of the Bill is being put to the people, that we are not this time having the lunatic attempts <Col N="1106" /> made in previous Constitutional amendments to tie this proposal in with a local election, a Presidential election, and, let us hope, we are not going to be asked to tie it in with a general election but, of course, the Taoiseach reserves that right and is quite capable of exercising it if the condition of his party is anything to go by.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have serious doubts whether this Bill as it stands will, in fact, be deemed to be constitutional and I would hope that the Supreme Court in one of its last exercises in power before this thing goes through, if it does go through, will, in fact, challenge its constitutionality.  I concur with Deputy Keating in the opinion that the President should be invited in here and I would remind the House that a late President, Dr. Douglas Hyde, on at least one occasion referred an Act of this Dáil to the courts for their considered judgment and I should hope the same would be done in this case.</P>
    <P>The Constitution has been the guardian of our liberties for many years.  In a celebrated case, in 1961, initiated by my colleague, Deputy John O'Donovan, an attempt by the Government, effectively speaking, to gerrymander the constituency boundaries even more than they normally do, and they do it enough, was foiled.  The Government were defeated on that issue.  That was an historic decision and an important one and is an example, given the standards in Government these tragic days, of how vital the Constitution is as a residual protection to our people.</P>
    <P>To me, this Bill is part and parcel of the cynicism that has crept into political judgment and political values since May, 1970.  Throughout that time it has been to me as a relatively young and new Member of the Dáil a progressively more depressing experience to witness the manner in which this House is bulldozed cynically by the use of a Parliamentary majority of an unstable, shaky and even, in some respects, dishonest kind.  In an interview with <i>The Sunday Press</i> recently I used the phrase about this Dáil that it was the most debauched Dáil in the <Col N="1107" /> history of the State and I maintain that opinion without reservation.  The things done in this Dáil since May, 1970, the shifts, equivocations and votes in this House have brought the whole practice of politics and the whole image of this entire Assembly into the greatest degree of disrepute. Unfortunately, although the architects of this calamitous change in the standard of the Dáil sit on those benches, to the public the entire image of politics and politicians is debased and degraded and this is a terrible guilt and responsibility on the Government and on the Taoiseach.  This process of debasement is carried still further by this Bill.  It is carried further in what is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to be brought before the House if not in some respects the most important.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the influence that we would have in respect of the changes which might be consequent upon our membership of the European Economic Community in the future. Deputy FitzGerald has referred to our potential voting strength.  Deputy FitzGerald is a Deputy I greatly admire and I am proud to acknowledge as a friend but I must say that in his starry-eyed attitude to the European Economic Community he demonstrates one of the least intelligent facets of his character in my view.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Rome is far from being a definitive document.  It is subject to wide criticisms and it may, in fact, be amended.  It may be amended to introduce direct elections, for example.  This is certainly something which the Germans, in particular, are pressing for very greatly.  It may be amended to introduce declarations in respect of social policy, something which I personally would welcome because the guarantees of social policy in our own Constitution, being the only part of the Constitution which are not enforcible under law, are really not worth the paper they are written on.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the privilege of attending a conference of 100 Parliamentarians in Bonn with colleagues from both the other parties.  I was <Col N="1108" /> struck very much by the emphasis which was laid on the potential of social policy but I was struck even more by the overpowering determination of the Germans in particular and to a less extent the French delegates, to press on regardless of the entry of four further States to major restructuring of the Community to provide for a much greater degree of political as opposed to economic unity.  That is something that we have to recognise. This is to some extent a political community and potentially it is to a great extent a political community.  As Dr. Halstein said some years ago, &ldquo;We are not in business, we are in politics&rdquo;. What strength, what influence and what power to resist changes foreign to our country, to our standards, will we have in this situation if this Bill is passed?  I respectfully suggest that we will have almost none at all.  I was struck in Bonn and I am struck reading, for example, the present negotiations on fisheries by how exclusively the battles vital to this country are, in fact, being fought for us by the British. Dr. Johnson once wrote of fleas having other fleas upon them.  It is a fact of political life that we are a flea on the back of Great Britain as far as influence in the Community is concerned.</P>
    <P>Our existence was almost unacknowledged at that conference.  The determination and the sophistication, particularly, as I say, of the Germans, was remarkable and impressive, their fluency, their command of a subject. We met the German Foreign Minister, Herr Scheel.  It was noticeable that when questions in either French or English were asked he discarded the instantaneous translation service and replied fluently in either of these tongues.  How many diplomats have we, how many Ministers, who would be competent to argue on the same intellectual terms with a person of that character?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, one of the greatest stresses laid, by the German delegation, in particular, was on the principle of mobility of establishment and the principle of mobility of labour, mobility of establishment meaning, of course, the right of foreign industry to establish itself in a position of ownership on <Col N="1109" /> the terrain of another country; mobility of labour meaning ability of labour to emigrate in pursuit of capital rather than <i>vice versa.</i>  I could not help remarking in my one contribution to this conference that in the hotel where we were staying there was an Italian barman with fluent German and I asked the question of Herr Scheel, does mobility of labour mean that in future the Irish will contribute to the supply of your barmen?  In fact, the situation would be substantially worse than this since our education structure is so appalling they would not have the fluency to speak German and they would just provide the builders' labourers.</P>
    <P>In this sort of fluid context, where the whole position of this country may be changed, to give to the Government the kind of blank cheque set out in the last section of this Bill is, in my view, an act of lunatic folly and I would appeal to the Fine Gael Party to support us on the principle of this unusual and almost unique amendment which we are putting here.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Keating to the President.  To him is due the credit for the Constitution that we have, a fine Constitution in many respects and one which resisted the pressures of the time, pressures which could have made it even more specifically Catholic than it is.  But it resisted these pressures and resisted them honourably. If Éamon de Valera were now sitting in the seat at present occupied by the Taoiseach, I do not believe such a blanket and sweeping change in our sovereignty would be suggested to this House for its approval.  The blanket nature of this specific sentence reflects to me more than ever before the patent change that has taken place in the complexion, outlook, standard and values of the once great party that was Fianna Fáil.  It was not, perhaps, the socialist party I would have wished it to be, but it was always the republican party and a populous party, in the best sense of that term, to the extent that it rooted its will and its force upon the ordinary people, the small farmers and the workers.  It was a party which was proud not to call itself a party, but to insist that it was a movement embodying <Col N="1110" /> national aspirations rather than a purely political party.</P>
    <P>This party has changed progressively. The shift in emphasis towards the eastern seaboard, the shift in emphasis towards big business rather than towards the small farmer, the small man, the man of no property, has occurred openly and patently and the abject manner in which the Government now embrace EEC membership and sign this blank cheque to impose upon us any measures which have been or will be adopted by the Communities is a classic instance of how the Fianna Fáil Party is now the party of big business, which seeks to profit from entry to the Community, at the expense of our traditional ways of life and of the job location, employment, and social traditions of so many of our people.</P>
    <P>Many years ago President de Valera made a speech in which he embodied his view of the future of Ireland, a speech which has been laughed at by a great many people; he spoke, in that speech, of people living in moderate comfort on small farms around the country, indulging in simple pastimes and enjoying the fruits of rural tradition. As I say, that speech was laughed at by some people, but it was an extremely moving evocation of President de Valera's view of the integrity, the independence and the uniqueness of this country.  I wonder what he and those who stood around him when he made that speech must think of the abject way in which the people are being asked to underwrite in advance measures which abrogate the Constitution, the symbol of their independence, the crowning achievement of the set of constitutional rules produced by the Government of the then Deputy de Valera in the years between 1932 and 1937.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be personally offen-sive to the people who constitute this present much altered Government, but I must say that not merely would I object to a piece of legislation of this kind, enabling changes to be made, in effect, without recourse to the people, not merely would I object to this power being awarded to any government, but <Col N="1111" /> I have to confess I would specifically object to its being placed in the hands of the men who constitute this ram-shackle and derided Cabinet, which dictates our destinies for the moment.</P>
    <P>I have very little more to say.  The force of the argument put forward by Deputy Keating and by the Labour Party is so outstandingly plain to me that, on this vital issue, I really do not see how anyone, other than the most abject political cynic, could fail to agree with us and, agreeing with us, fail to support this proposed amendment.  I consider the last sentence of this section a disgrace upon Parliament.  If it is passed and subsequently endorsed by the people, the people who are at the moment being battered and brain-washed with pro-EEC propaganda produced at the expense of the taxpayer and circulated at the expense of the taxpayer&mdash;some of it arrived at my own door this morning&mdash;saying every-thing will be lovely in the EEC, if, by any chance, the people endorse the decision to go into the EEC, which they have a perfect right to do, if they endorse this extraordinarly ill-con-ceived and dangerous final sentence, then I believe historians may yet look back on the year, 1972, the year in which the referendum will be taken, as the year in which the process that Fianna Fáil progressively has adopted towards standards of public life, towards integrity and towards the prin-ciples of democracy, towards the rule of law and the rule of the Constitution, reached its apotheosis.  Historians may yet see this year, 1972, as the year in which this process was finally completed and the words of Pearse, Connolly and other heroes embossed around these walls were successfully undone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want it to be clearly understood that we favour a referendum.  We have consistently expressed the view that the people must decide the issue.  Consequently, we approve the task of putting clearly before the electorate in simple language a single question as to whether or not this country adheres to the European Economic Community. In general, we are in favour of the <Col N="1112" /> aims and objectives of the European Economic Community.  We have, of course, a number of reservations and we reserve the right to decide, in the light of the ultimate treaty of accession which is negotiated, whether or not we are satisfied with the terms of that treaty.  Having made it clear that we are in favour of the right of the people to decide this issue, and in favour of the general objectives of the European Economic Community, I want to make it quite clear that the form of the proposed amendment before the Dáil is, in our view, far too wide and, as at present drafted, unacceptable to us.</P>
      <P>We do not propose to oppose the Second Stage.  We propose to move amendments on Committee Stage to limit the amendment in such fashion that it will specifically deal with the changes necessitated by the obligations of membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>As the Bill is drafted the operative part is the Schedule, which states:</P>
      <P>3º The State may become a member of the European Coal and Steel Community (established by Treaty signed at Paris on the 18th day of April, 1951), the European Economic Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957) and the European Atomic Energy Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957).  No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership ...</P>
      <P>We regard the words, &ldquo;consequent on membership&rdquo; as unnecessarily wide and in fact dangerous.  It is conceivable as can be shown by reference to a number of articles that the adoption of this amendment in its present form goes far beyond anything that is necessary and would in fact enable the European Commission and the European Community as a whole to make effective changes in our law here and our laws not necessitated by membership and of a consequential character that at present we are unaware of and for a number of reasons might not wish to adopt or implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Committee Stage we propose to table an amendment designed to <Col N="1113" /> limit the changes in the measures adopted by the State by rephrasing the schedule which would then read, &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership&rdquo; and in line 11 to add the words &ldquo;in pursuance of the above Treaties&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;or institutions thereof&rdquo;.  In addition there are a number of other risks inherent in the proposed amendment because of the effect on articles in the Constitution that must be regarded as of importance to the nation.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear at this stage that this proposed amendment cannot be carried in the country without our support.  Fianna Fáil have had the experience of two referenda recently in which they were defeated.  So far as this amendment, or the amendment ultimately approved by the House in the subsequent stages of this Bill is concerned when the question is finally put to the people it can only succeed if this Party is behind it.  That is a fact of political life which cannot be denied by anyone.  It is recognised as important in this matter. This amendment and the decision to adhere to the EEC depends of course on the will of the people but in order to make the will of the people effective in this instance it depends on the attitude of this party.  For that reason more than any other, it is important to have our co-operation, our good will and our assent to the proposed constitutional amendments.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk recently about the Constitution.  I am not one of those who imagine it is the heaven-sent document that some Fianna Fáil people in the past used to think it was.  I remember a time when Fianna Fáil advocates of the Constitution were so enthusiastic that they thought it superseded the Ten Commandments. There is no doubt that situation has changed.  The late Seán Lemass said there was far too much ballyhoo and nonsense about the Constitution.  He set up a committee to investigate it but when the committee reported he and his colleagues dealt with only one thing and left the others.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things in the Constitution which are good and as Deputy Keating rightly said most of <Col N="1114" /> them were taken from the 1922 Constitution which was drafted by constitutional experts under the chairmanship of Michael Collins.  There are other things in the Constitution that are so imprecise that the Supreme Court has said they cannot be implemented. There are certain things in it which in the context of a united Ireland would prove difficult and everyone recognises they would have to be amended.  Leaving all that aside there are certain fundamental things referred to in the Constitution which the people are anxious to maintain and which are not in dispute.  As this amendment is at present drafted there is even a certain initial risk in the fact that it may not be constitutional. This is a possible interpretation of the wording of Article 46 which states:</P>
    <P>Any provision of this Constitution may be amended, whether by way of variation, addition, or repeal, in the manner provided by this Article.</P>
    <P>It appears that this proposed amendment purports to be partially a variation and partially an addition.  It is a variation to the extent that the terms of the European Economic Community, the terms of the European Atomic Energy Community, which were established on the same day, and the terms of the European Coal and Steel Community which was established on 18th April, 1951, and signed in Paris become, if this amendment is passed, operative here.</P>
    <P>There are inherent in this proposed amendment very grave dangers because of the fact that so wide a number of sections or articles of the Constitution would be set aside.  It is right at this stage that we should be quite clear what the obligations are.  It is a fact that there are at present no defence commitments involved in the Treaty of Rome.  It is a fact that there are no military obligations involved in membership of the EEC but it is equally a fact that at different stages during discussions and meetings on the enlargement of the Community the question of possible defence matters arose.  A reference was made to this in the White Paper entitled, &ldquo;Membership of the European Communities, Implications for Ireland&rdquo; laid before the <Col N="1115" /> Oireachtas in April, 1970.  At page 7 it states:</P>
    <P>Consequently, in order to avoid the Community's achievements being threatened by the effects of enlargement, the Commission urged the strengthening of the Community Institutions and also stressed &ldquo;that the cohesion and the dynamism which are indispensable for the Community depend in part on the convergence of the national policies of the member States, in particular, but not exclusively, of their foreign and defence policies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At an earlier stage in the discussions the Fouchet plan did involve the question of defence but that plan was not adopted.  We would be less than frank if we did not recognise and admit that defence and foreign policy have at different times loomed on the horizon of further possible expansion and possible commitments involved in it.  I mention that now for the reason that Article 28.3.1º states:</P>
    <P>War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>An absolute assurance should be given to the House and the country that no military or defence commitments of any character are involved.  It is not in the Rome Treaty&mdash;the fact that it was referred to is undoubtedly true&mdash;and it is not involved in either of the other treaties it is proposed to adopt if this amendment is passed.  But because of the talk and propaganda and a good deal of ill-informed discussion, there is need to reassure the country that involved in this there is no commitment of any kind. I mention that because the second part of the proposals which we shall include in suggested amendments is to specifically mention particular Articles of the Constitution that in no way should be abridged or amended by the adoption of the Rome Treaty, the European Coal and Steel Community or the European Atomic Energy Community.  The importance of naming and specifically excluding these Articles is to ensure that no changes subsequently will commit this country in any respect by reason of <Col N="1116" /> the fact that an amendment has been accepted or passed with such wide phraseology as this amendment.  But there is probably an even more important section involved in Article 28.3º where it says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion or to nullify any act done or purporting to be done in time of war or armed rebellion in pursuance of any such law. In this sub-section &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; includes a time when there is taking place an armed conflict in which the State is not a participant but in respect of which each of the Houses of the Oireachtas shall have resolved that, arising out of such armed conflict, a national emergency exists affecting the vital interests of the State and &ldquo;time of war or armed rebellion&rdquo; includes such time after the termination of any war, or of any such armed conflict as aforesaid, or of an armed rebellion as may elapse until each of the Houses of the Oireachtas shall have resolved that the national emergency occasioned by such war, armed conflict, or armed rebellion has ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>In addition to that on the question of defence there are the provisions in Article 15.6.1º and Article 15.6.2º which state:</P>
    <P>The right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>No military or armed force, other than a military or armed force raised and maintained by the Oireachtas, shall be raised or maintained for any purpose whatsoever.</P>
    <P>These articles can in no sense and should in no sense be abridged or put at risk by an amendment as wide as is proposed here.</P>
    <P>There are also other articles dealing with fundamental rights and freedoms. I think it is correct to say that under Article 29&mdash;and I think this was referred to in some way by the Taoiseach <Col N="1117" /> in his introductory speech&mdash;it would be possible for this country without a referendum, without a constitutional amendment to adhere to the Coal and Steel Community, the Rome Treaty and the European Atomic Energy Community.  This is the Article under which we have become members of numerous international bodies including the United Nations.  The procedure laid down there could apply in these cases but a difficulty arises&mdash; and this among others is one of the reasons for the proposed referendum and amendment, leaving aside the crucial question of the people having the right to decide whether we go in or not.  The fact is that because of the terms of the Rome Treaty, a number of its laws and directives and decisions in order to be implemented here would require either subsequent amendments of the Constitution or would require to be implemented in our own legislation which would involve consequential constitutional amendments.  It is for that reason that this amendment seeks to be and must be adopted to give the terms of the Treaty the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>In so far as many international agreements to which we have become parties are concerned, they were signed and ratified in some cases and laid before the Dáil in most cases and in certain instances have to be the subject of a formal resolution because of a charge on public funds, but in all these cases the obligation to make constitutional amendments in order to adapt or modify our law to conform with and coincide with the precise terminology of the treaties or bodies in question does not arise.  It does arise specifically because of the terms of the Rome Treaty.</P>
    <P>In addition to the very serious questions involved in Article 28 and also Article 15 there are the Articles dealing with human rights.  It is our view that there should be no abridgement of and no doubt about the position of the constitutional guarantees of fundamental rights or rights to personal freedom and so on that are included in a number of articles principally those beginning with Article 40 and going on to Article 44.  It is not necessary to read <Col N="1118" /> all these now but they deal with a number of matters relating to personal rights and freedoms and in our view should in no sense be abridged or modified by the terms of this amendment if it is passed in its present wide form to allow the adoption and implementing of the Rome Treaty here.</P>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to Article 43 and the question of private property because this is one of the matters that has given rise to some concern. There is no conflict either present or past in a political sense on the struggle that was made and implemented in our own time by a number of Lands Acts to secure determination and right of the people to have possession and maintain possession of their own land and property.  A leaflet has been prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs which I think is an example of some of the characteristics of an inept approach by the Government in getting this whole matter considered by the people.  This leaflet says: &ldquo;Has the article in the Treaty for full right of establishment in agricultural land been implemented?&rdquo;  and the answer is: &ldquo;No, a draft directive only giving full rights to non-nationals to buy land was submitted to the Council in January, 1969 and it is not possible at this stage to predict when this draft might be adopted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say what our law is, what progress was made and, finally it finishes up with a quotation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he stated that the Government attached the utmost importance to this question of land purchase.  He stated that he raised the matter at the outset of the negotiations and in the statement which he made at his first meeting with the Community in September of last year. The Minister said that he drew attention to Ireland's present controls on the purchase of land by non-nationals and explained that these controls were necessary.  Finally, the Minister stated that in order to enable us to pursue policies to deal with such structural problems that exist it was proposed to pursue the matter at an appropriate stage of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> There is no question that if the directive, as drafted, were implemented &mdash;and we must accept it as likely that it may be implemented&mdash;it would interfere with the right to private property guaranteed in Article 43.  We should face these difficulties frankly. The worst thing for this country would be to adopt the terms of the European Community and their directives and accept them willy-nilly because the Community have adopted them.  This is a matter which is causing concern here and it would be a mistake for us to adopt the directive without question.</P>
    <P>We regard the proposed form of this amendment as being too wide.  So many things could be implemented and become operative here because of the adoption of a wide amendment&mdash; things that are unnecessary and, because of the phraseology, are regarded as consequent on membership but, in fact, are not necessitated by the obligations of membership.  These specific arguments with regard to fundamental rights and private property are matters that should be named in a subsequent extension of this amendment to make it clear that the proposed changes do not infringe on fundamental rights or the rights of this House and the country to deal with the security of the State, the raising of an Army or questions of defence or nutrality because of the terms of Article 28.3.1º.</P>
    <P>The changes necessary in legislation with regard to taxation have been referred to several times and the Dáil at present is considering the introduction of VAT.  It shows a lack of political skill to try to proceed with the introduction of this tax at a time when we expect the country to decide on the simple issue of whether we should join the EEC.  The complications with regard to this tax, the difficulties for trade, and the time factor involved in trying to get this taxation in operation, are enormous.  The turnover and wholesale tax systems are difficult enough but to sweep them aside and introduce VAT in the early months of next year is putting at risk and complicating the whole approach to entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> We regard the concept of a united Europe as desirable.  We have had numerous debates on this and when the White Paper is introduced I pre-sume there will be a further debate on the matter.  We need not go into it at length now except to state that a united Europe is a desirable aim.  Membership of the EEC will give small countries the right to participate in decision-making, to share in a community of States.  It will enable us to make our voice and influence heard and felt among the member States. Similarly, other small countries will be able to promote the welfare of the small nations.  It will enable Ireland to get away from the almost total dependence on Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that things will change overnight, that the going will be very easy.  It will not be any easier than it has been on the British market. The position of Britain is crucial to our situation.  If for any reason they did not become a member we would find great difficulty in getting into Europe because of our traditional trading links with Britain.  However, we are going into the EEC with the other applicant countries in the belief and conviction that it affords us a chance to develop and play our part as members of a European Community as a European country with all that this involves and the prospects it offers for the future.</P>
    <P>Some people have genuine fears about entry.  Some of the fears have been drummed up by people who have a vested interest in opposing entry. Some of the opposition comes from people who are opposed to the concept of a united Europe, an opposition that originally developed because of the belief that it was one way to combat the spread of communism.  It was believed it was one way of preventing Europe being overwhelmed by the domination of a Soviet communist system.  Countries that were anxious to develop their economic and social wellbeing came together; they were inspired by the ideal by getting the people of Europe, with their ancient Christian civilisation, united to expand, develop and protect the things they regarded as of value.</P>
    <P>This concept has developed and progressed <Col N="1121" /> since then.  It would be wrong for anyone in this country to imagine that we will go into a Utopia overnight if we join the EEC.  One of the most damaging aspects in a discussion of this matter is the over-enthusiastic European on the one hand and the people who cry out that it is an interference with sovereignty and that there is a risk of our being swept from our moorings because we are associated with the European movement.  The people will make this decision.  Our obligation, our duty, is to see that the facts are presented fairly, fully and frankly so that the people will recognise the advantages and be aware of the obligations.  If there are limitations and difficulties we must not seek to minimise them.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is true to say that it will not be the end of the world if, for any reason, we do not become a member of the European Economic Community. The important question of fisheries and epizootic diseases, and other matters of that sort, has yet to be resolved. There is also the very important question of ensuring that, in the transitional period, employment will be maintained, that there will be no diminution of employment and that the savings that will result from the changes in the agricultural price arrangements will be devoted to improving social welfare benefits.  We must ensure that the weaker sections of the community will be compensated for the rise that will occur in the cost of living, and that the savings which will accrue in respect of agricultural subsidies will be devoted, and known to be devoted, to alleviating the problems of the weaker sections of the community, particularly pensioners.</P>
    <P>Subject to these fundamental matters being properly decided and effectively dealt with, we believe it is right for us to go into the European Economic Community.  We are absolutely convinced that the terms of this Bill are far too wide, that they are unnecessary and go beyond what is necessitated by the obligations of membership.  In addition certain fundamental matters which have already been referred to should be clearly spelled out in the Constitutional amendment that will be <Col N="1122" /> put to the people, such as Article 28 and fundamental rights in respect of the commitment or possible commitment of this country in any arms conflict, or defence arrangement.  These matters must be put beyond question. They must be specifically reserved and seen to be reserved in the proposed changes to be made in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Subject to these safeguards we believe it is in the national interest, and in the interest of the part this country has to play in Europe, to join this Community.  On Committee Stage we propose to move amendments designed to resist the terms of this Bill to the phraseology to which I have referred.  We propose to insert in line 9 after the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; the words &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership&rdquo;.  I am giving the phraseology in broad terms because the precise wording may need to be revised after further examination.  In line 11 after the word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; we propose to insert the word &ldquo;in pursuance of the above Treaty&rdquo;, so that there will be no consequential changes as there would be under the Bill as at present phrased and that we will make only the changes that are necessitated by the obligations of membership.  We want to reserve the provisions that exist in Article 28, Article 15, and the articles dealing with fundamental rights in order to safeguard the provisions in the Constitution dealing with fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>We believe it is desirable that an amendment should be made to the Constitution and we recommend to the people that they should accept it.  I believe there will be a difficult task in getting it accepted by the country. Towards the end of his speech Deputy Keating said that, if the Labour Party amendment to refuse the Bill a Second Reading was supported by Fine Gael, those he described as dissidents and the Labour Party, it could result in a defeat for the Government.  I yield to no man in this House or in the country in my desire to have a general election. If I had the choice I would have an election before anything else to get this Government out of office.</P>

      <P>It has ever been the traditional approach of this Party that, on an issue of this type, we are concerned first with the nation, with the people's interest.  Irrespective of what happens at an election, this issue must be decided by the people.  We have consistently argued that whether or not Ireland should join the EEC was a matter for decision by the people.  We want to put all the facts before them. We want the amendment to the Constitution limited to the necessary changes. We want safeguarded the fundamental rights of the nation and the fundamental rights of the individual.</P>
      <P>We do not care whether the general election comes before or after the Referendum.  The sooner the better, but there is no advantage in trying to confuse the issue by saying that a general election would prevent this question being put, or change it in some way or another.  At some stage before or after the general election it must be put before the people.  We accept that.  We have consistently advocated the view that it should be complicated by nothing else such as, for example, the inept manner in which the Value Added Tax has been thrown into this and the inept manner in which this has been brought forward.  The lack of effective, purposeful, meaningful consultation with the Opposition is another example of the political defects and political infirmities that now characterise the approach of the Government to many questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of its nature this constitutional amendment transcends political party differences or conflicts.  The people will decide whether this country will or will not join.  The whole matter has been handled ineptly taking into consideration the excessively wide terms of the Bill.  It has been handled ineptly by the introduction at this stage of the Value Added Tax.  We had another example yesterday.  We advocated an all-party committee over two years ago to deal with the North and it was rejected until a week or two ago. Because the Leader of the British Opposition suggested in the British House of Commons that this should be done, and because it was accepted over there, the Government changed their <Col N="1124" /> front and said that circumstances had changed.  That is the wrong way to do it.  If there is a wrong way to approach this matter the Government appear to have taken that wrong way.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to co-operate.  This constitutional amendment cannot be made without our goodwill and support. It depends on the will of the people, upon their decision.  Without the active support, goodwill and co-operation of this party and our organisation in the country, it has not got a snowball's chance in Hell.  We will offer reasonable, constructive, valuable amendments.  We will put them down on Committee Stage.  We regard them as absolutely essential.  In the conviction that they are in the national interest we recommend them to the House.  We will recommend the Bill, as amended, to the people for their endorsement.  We believe that because of our long traditions with Europe the Irish people want to play a constructive part in preserving Christian values and Christian belief, and also in preserving the cultural heritage that has characterised Europe, and Ireland as a part of Europe, for centuries.</P>

      <P>I believe there is general agreement among all parties that Constitutional amendments should <Col N="1125" /> be clear and unambiguous but I accept that such is our Constitution that this would be a difficult exercise.  I do not know how many versions of proposed amendments the Government have had. Obviously, there have been a number for consideration at Cabinet level but finally, they have agreed on the particular form of amendment circulated now.  Our Constitution is an extensive one which contains more than 50 Articles.  It is a Constitution which in many respects is so detailed that only specialists in Constitutional law can claim to have first-hand knowledge of it.  Most Members of this House would not be so presumptuous as to assert any such knowledge.  However, it is our contention that the people should know what exactly they are doing when they are asked to amend that Constitution. On that fundamental principle I submit it is unlikely that if the Constitutional amendment is put to the people in its present form, it would be understood precisely by them and I say that with great respect to the electorate.</P>
      <P>In 1968 when the Government attempted to incorporate two questions into one Constitutional amendment, there was considerable opposition.  The House will recall the attempt to combine the issues of electoral areas and PR.  So great was the opposition that the Government were obliged to drop their proposal.  It is a matter of serious disappointment to the Labour Party and, as we know now from Deputy Cosgrave's speech, to Fine Gael also, that the Taoiseach's statement should have been so inadequate and so lacking in depth in spelling out the precise implications of this issue particularly in relation to the four sections of the Constitution to which he referred.  Because of the manner in which the implications of the Bill have been glossed over, nobody could say that the matter has been given more than scant treatment by the Taoiseach this morning. His treatment of the Bill is not to be accepted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment were to be adopted, it could have the effect of altering several distinct Articles of the Constitution while the people would not be aware of what these Articles are.  This is the issue in the Bill.  In <Col N="1126" /> effect the electorate are being asked to sign what can be described only as a Constitutional blank cheque.  The character of the proposed amendment is open to question in that it is contrary to the expressed intentions of the Constitutional provisions governing amendments and the Constitutional means by which we go about this process.  The Taoiseach owes us an explanation in relation to Article 46 which says that:</P>
    <P>Any provision of this Constitution may be amended, whether by way of variation, addition or repeal, in the manner provided by this Article.</P>
    <P>The question we are asking is whether Constitutional amendments will be in the form of amendments to specific Articles or whether they will be, as the Government propose, in the form of a global insertion, in the form of an unlimited provision and in the form of a sweeping second clause which amends several different Articles of the Constitution simultaneously even though these are not stated specifically within the Bill.  The Government must be asked, too, to what extent they are happy with the way in which this Bill is being introduced.  No doubt we will have the classical Fianna Fáil reaction to these questions&mdash;no contribution and no explanation and the Taoiseach will wind up and complain that he has not enough time to deal with them or that he did not understand something or other, with the result that we shall be as wise as we were before in terms of the Government's intention in this matter.  We are aware that there has been a great amount of Cabinet discussion on the proposals but we know, also, that there has not been unanimity within the Cabinet on the Bill, a Bill that one might say has been the source of heartbreaking interpretions by the Parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General's office. Admittedly, many of the courses open to the Government have had their specific advantages and disadvantages discussed but in a matter with such profound long term effects on the whole future of this country, the issues must be put clearly before the people. I do not think the Government have anything to lose by such exercise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Neither do I think that the Opposition, in particular the Labour Party, are so perverse, so negative or so obscurantist in our thinking that we would not be prepared to consider the whole problem as faced by the Government in adapting an Irish Constitution to the requirements of the Treaties.</P>
    <P>I hope that the choice will be between the Constitution and Senator Mary Robinson and not between Christ and Mary Robinson as was suggested rather offensively in one of last Sunday's papers, the Senator who has pointed out that the proposed amendment is extremely specific in its first part and unacceptably broad in its second part and that the permissive section is related specifically to the Communities established by the Treaties of Paris and Rome.  This implies that a further Constitutional change would be required if, in the future, the Community were to adopt a new Treaty basis for the furtherance of their political aims or of economic union.</P>
    <P>In the final part of his short statement the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>It is not the Government's intention nor is the proposed Constitutional amendment designed to cover any possible incompatibility with the present Constitution which might arise as a result of obligations which it might be necessary to assume if we wished to become a member of any political community in Europe which may eventually be created and evolving from the present Communities.</P>
    <P>Fair enough.  It is desirable that there should be provision for a clear basis for a political platform upon which a future Irish Government could make a stand if any negotiations for political development of the community were to evolve.  Thus acceptance of the new situation, for example, the extending of the powers of the European Parliament or the transference of some powers in respect of monetary policy, would depend on the approval of the Irish people in a referendum.  This would be entirely proper.</P>
    <P>However, it is important that there should be clarification of the position <Col N="1128" /> in regard to future amendents, or, indeed, the complete re-writing of the Irish Constitution.  Many sections of our Constitution do need urgent amendment&mdash;votes at 18, the special position of the Catholic Church, realignment in relation to political unity in the country as a whole.  We are in need of a new Constitution.  Is it the case that the Constitution may, after accession to the Communities, only be amended in accordance with the Treaties themselves?  Would it be necessary to have amendments of our own Constitution approved by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg or even by the executive institutions in Brussels?  This has not been answered to my satisfaction. It is of particular importance to the Labour Party since there will probably be Labour amendments to the Constitution in respect of civil and socio-economic matters and these could involve a degree of conflict with the apparent spirit or tone of the Treaties.  Any alteration, for example, of the constitutional position in relation to private property, in relation to land tenure, in relation to national and economic policy, could be a source of considerable conflict with the Treaty of Rome.  The question, therefore, arises of defining to the satisfaction of the Irish people the future procedures for constitutional reform in this country. That question should now be faced in this debate.  As far as we are concerned, it cannot be accepted that a major alteration on a constitutional basis should go through without such implications being thoroughly and honestly explored by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted, does the Constitution remain the full property of the Irish people and, if not, to what extent is their right to retain the Constitution diminished?  That question has not been answered in the mealy-mouthed contribution by the Taoiseach this morning.  I do not know what got into him, whether it was sheer lethargy, but the implications are not spelled out and obviously the Government do not intend to throw any other speakers into this debate in the hope of having a comfortable passing through of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>There is another point which has not been referred to by the Taoiseach.  It is <Col N="1129" /> that accession may involve some element of change in respect of the Northern Ireland position.  This question must be faced by our people. While I personally do not believe that the Treaties contain any definition of the territorial boundaries of member States as such, it is still desirable that the Government should make the position in this respect absolutely clear. As things stand, I am not aware that membership of the Communities imposes any restrictions, in law, on the member States on territorial claims that may be made.  Federal Germany has recently made concessions in respect of these claims.  This issue involves non-member States such as Poland.  This is an area where we would need to be very careful.  We should not walk into constitutional changes without putting before the people the clear implications of this Bill in regard to our relations with Northern Ireland.  The assurance that Irish people seek should have been contained in the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
    <P>Another important issue which arises from the text of the Bill is that related to the words &ldquo;consequent on membership of the Communities&rdquo;.  I share the misgivings of Deputies Keating and Cosgrave in this regard.  Unfortunately, and to my personal shame, I cannot presume to interpret, as I would wish to, the Irish language text of the Bill but, with my limited competence, I would interpret it as: &ldquo;arising from membership of the Communities&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach might comment on the compatibility of the Irish and English texts.</P>
    <P>Who is to decide that a law, an act or a measure is being enacted, done or adopted consequent on membership of the Communities?  Is it the Oireachtas? Is it the Government?  That is absolutely unacceptable and fraught with serious danger?  Is it the Supreme Court?  This is what we should require. This should not be allowed to slip away by default in this debate.  Is it the Brussels authorities who will decide? This may tend to be the case due to the fact that so many regulations, directives, decisions and opinions on a multitude of issues emanate directly from Brussels and will provide a major framework, usually legitimate, I think, in the future for Government action <Col N="1130" /> here.  Yet, I do not think we can allow this occasion to pass without voicing our serious misgivings about the lack of democratic control within the EEC system.  This is entirely germane to the Bill itself.  It is all very well saying that we will accept the terms consequent on membership of the Communities and accept the decisions arising therefrom but there is considerable evidence of a lack of democratic control within the EEC legislative system itself.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that many of the complexities in the Brussels decision-making process are not fully grasped as yet by the Government or by the public service and they are almost totally unknown to the Members of this House.  To a considerable extent Members of the House do not give a damn and even if they did many of them would not use their imagination to try to understand the problems.  That is a legitimate criticism bearing in mind that the Taoiseach this morning had three or four Deputies sitting next to him.  That showed the concern of that party about a Bill about a Constitution which has divided this country, divided families, caused political uproar, which was the major subject in election campaigns, a Constitution which has been held as sacrosanct by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Here we are this morning in such a casual manner debating the matter on such a casual introduction by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I would ask, are the Government satisfied that there are enough civil servants who have first-hand contact with the processes in Brussels and with the thinking of the Eurocrats to the degree that they would accept the full implications of the section of the Bill which says that no provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State in consequence of membership of the Communities?  Perhaps the Attorney General is happy enough; he knows what the implications are; but I do not think our Government are fully conscious of the import of that section.</P>
    <P>The Bill inevitably raises problems associated with the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  We in the Labour Party <Col N="1131" /> are entitled to demand that the Government make a clear and specific statement about the role of this body in relation to the Irish judicial and legal system.  We might even ask at what point in various types of situation is the focus directly on Luxembourg. What are the powers of that court in Luxembourg?  What sanctions does it possess?  Most important, what has been done, what has been its record in practice to date?  I get the impression that there is total and absymal ignorance in the Cabinet as to even what the court in Luxembourg is about.  This is the reason why the Labour Party legitimately express concern. We say: let us have a referendum but let us have it on the basis that the Irish people will be fully and completely aware of all the implications.</P>
    <P>Another point that requires to be made is that the effect of removing the constitutional sanction from a whole broad area of possible future Irish legislation is rather dangerous and must give rise to genuine misgivings. By this development the whole environment of legislative thought will be changed and the values and priorities and safeguards which we now regard as important in the Irish legislative and judicial system may be removed. We are entitled as a political party to demand more explicit statements and assurances from the Government in order that those legitimate fears may be allayed.</P>
    <P>While it is desirable at an early stage to exhibit flexibility and open-mindedness towards an entirely new situation, I do not think we can accept so fundamental a change being brought about without the fullest explanation being offered.  I would, therefore, suggest that there is need for elaboration. There is need for a paper of White Paper status to explain in depth the issues of constitutional importance in connection with this Bill.  If this were done honestly and openly and issued to every household, it would not be too bad an idea.  As least it would assume that the electorate had the right to know and to be given information. I do not have in mind the dreadful documents on which we have spent <Col N="1132" /> £2,500 so far or those issued on Ireland, agriculture, the land, on industry, on employment, the Common Market. I have enough respect for the Department of Foreign Affairs to think that it is capable of something better than these.  If we want to spend £34,000, let us get value for money.  This Bill will be the key to the referendum and there should be a special document of White Paper status to explain the problems.</P>
    <P>If in the future Irish Governments draw up laws ignoring the spirit and letter of our own Constitution simply because they can find some tenuous basis in the Community regulations which permit of a &ldquo;consequent on membership&rdquo; interpretation, apart from a Government being defeated in the ballot box, where will sanctions lie?</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan has raised matters of this consequence.  He raised them over 18 months ago.  On 16th June, 1970, the Minister was asked by Deputy Ryan whether any Member States of the Communities had made amendments to their Constitutions to make them conform with the Treaties and in the autumn of that year I asked a similar question.  The Minister replied to Deputy Ryan as follows&mdash;Volume 247, column 1082 of the Official Report&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is a complex subject which cannot be readily answered within the context of a Parliamentary question. Our information is that Luxembourg and the Netherlands amended their Constitutions for the purpose of EEC membership.  The Belgian State approved a proposal for an Article amending the Constitution for this purpose as recently as last month&mdash;May, 1970.  In the case of France and the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy an amendment does not appear to have been considered necessary.</P>
    <P>In reply to the question I asked in the autumn, the Minister pointed out that the Belgian amendment had been promulgated but that the position of the other States remained the same as at 16th June.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the question: to what extent are the Government railroading <Col N="1133" /> themselves, to what extent are they bending over backwards, to what extent are they indulging in indecent haste in their anxiety to have such a sweeping amendment adopted by this House?</P>
    <P>The White Paper issued in 1970 on the implications of EEC membership clearly envisaged that at least four distinct Articles of the Constitution would require amendment if the State were to assume the obligations of EEC membership.  The Government may well think that such procedure, which is the only correct constitutional procedure, would cause political difficulties. The people might very well baulk at amending several different Articles of the Constitution for the purpose of undertaking the obligations of the European Economic Community.  The people might also find the situation very confusing.  The simplistic approach of the Taoiseach just will not do.  This approach actually tends to make confusion worse confounded. The Fine Gael amendments will, no doubt, seek to remedy all the defects there are in this.  The Government are seeking to avoid proper procedure here and I think they recognise themselves that it is a blanket amendment that is now proposed.  Opposition Parties have the right to oppose this course and I hope to see a situation evolve, if the Government refuse to accept legitimate and proper amendments to this Bill, in which the Opposition Parties will combine and say: &ldquo;No, we will not have it put to the people in this dishonest fashion.  We want a proper referendum.  The people have the right finally to decide.&rdquo;  The political parties here have pledged themselves to accept the decision of the people.  There is no other option in a democracy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not acceptable in its present form.  If it were to be accepted as it stands, it would effectively bring Ireland under the rule of a new constitution, namely, under the laws enacted by the Communities at any time in the future.  We would finish up with a new constitution.  This should be clearly stated by the Taoiseach because it is the overriding impact of the Taoiseach's statement this morning. We have been told that, if contradictions were to occur, the provisions <Col N="1134" /> of the Third Amendment would have precedence.  This is the exact contradiction with which we are faced. Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that, under Article 15, the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas and no other legislature has power to make laws for the State.  Yet, this Third Amendment says that laws enacted and measures adopted shall have the force of law within the State itself. That is the kind of blank cheque to which we legitimately object and to which we are opposed.  We will oppose it if for no other reason than that the Government have been peculiarly vague about the whole thing.</P>
    <P>The question of sovereignty has been raised.  Under this Third Amendment we would effectively abandon our sovereignty directly to the Communities and to their institutions.  This should have been stated by the Taoiseach. The Government should have faced the issue honestly.  None of the Community institutions which would have these powers is at present elected. This should be emphasised.  Neither will they be collectively responsible as our Government is collectively responsible to the Dáil and to the Irish people who elect them.  Sovereignty in a number of areas, areas the Taoiseach has not stated, will be surrendered to the Commission and to the institutions of the Community.  Sovereignty envisages our own Legislature as the only body with the right and authority to make laws binding on our citizens. That is clearly stated in Article 15. The implications of the annulment of that Article should have been as clearly stated by the Taoiseach this morning.</P>
    <P>Again, any international treaty involving a charge on public funds must be approved by the Oireachtas.  That is clearly laid down in Article 29.  It has been quite falsely argued that we limit the sovereignty of the country whenever we sign treaties with other countries or with the UN.  Fianna Fáil spokesmen have said that joining the Community is no different.  The fact is we can leave the United Nations at any time.  In regard to other treaties, such as the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, we agree voluntarily to limit our freedom of action, but we <Col N="1135" /> do not surrender it, and we can always resume it by abrogating the treaty in question.  The surrender of sovereignty here is uniquely different from that voluntary limitation of independence entailed in signing treaties with other countries.  This should have been clearly pointed out by the Taoiseach.  In a normal treaty, freedom of action is renounced to a limited extent and that is clearly set out and recognised. The Taoiseach should have stated that there is no provision in the Treaty of Rome whereby member States may leave and that the Treaty is concluded, as indicated in the documents, for an indefinite period.  I notice that many countries have understandably and rightly hedged on that particular point.</P>
    <P>If the Third Amendment is adopted the Oireachtas which up till now has been the supreme law-making body in the country and is directly responsible to the electorate will be handing over to the EEC and its institutions the power to legislate in future in ways which will not even be known at the time of adoption.  Such a surrender of sovereignty has to be guarded against and has to be legitimately circumscribed within such a Bill.  One may point out to those who speak so passionately and so frequently about the Proclamation&mdash;the statements come more frequently from the Fianna Fáil benches than from anywhere else&mdash; that the indefeasible rights of that Proclamation cannot be forfeited or given away without full debate on the implications of the Bill.  This has not been faced up to by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Government should examine how other countries have approached the problem in relation to their constitutions. We are joining a community of Six and the way they have changed their constitutions is of major concern to us.  The Treaties establishing the Communities were not mere arrangements for international collaboration, they involve provisions for the integration of economic, social and political life of the member States and as such they involve some surrender of sovereignty. It should be pointed out that the Treaties have caused a blurring of the normally definable lines between <Col N="1136" /> a nation's internal and external affairs. This has become apparent during the course of the negotiations.  Many of the EEC regulations have been circumvented or deliberately avoided in order to avoid a confrontation between the constitutions of the nations and the Treaties themselves.</P>
    <P>A well-known authority called Wall recently commented in relation to Belgium that the possibility of disapproval may be deemed an important safeguard of basic freedom in Belgium, though from the Community point of view it would seem to be potentially a drag on the harmonious application in all member States of Community law.  He went on to say that though the Community Treaties indicate, either directly or by implication, an intention that Community law should be treated as paramount over the ordinary law in each member State, they contain no express provision to that effect.</P>
    <P>A number of important points arise out of the statements contained in the Treaty.  It must be determined whether Community law takes precedence not only over internal law as it stands at the moment but whether it does so in such a way that no subsequent internal law can have any effect contrary to the Community law itself. There appear to have been considerable misgivings in Belgium in relation to the application of the Treaties, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the longstanding written Constitution of that country.</P>
    <P>The same could be said to exist generally in France, Article 3 of the 1958 Constitution states:</P>
    <P>National sovereignty belongs to the people ... no section of the people, nor any individual, may attribute to themselves or himself the exercise thereof ....</P>
    <P>Article 55 states:</P>
    <P>Treaties or agreements duly ratified or approved shall, upon their publication, have an authority superior to that of ordinary legislation subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by the other party.</P>
    <P>In France subsequent Community legislation is adopted and accepted into the <Col N="1137" /> domestic system through the use of special provisions vested directly in the President or the Prime Minister. From an examination of Wall's work it can be said that the French have not let the reins go too much.  Our basic objection to the Third Amendment is that it proposes to let the reins go under our Constitution to an excessive degree.  There are sufficient instances in Italy and Germany, which have been well documented, to show that these Governments have jealously and carefully questioned the degree to which Community laws, regulations and directives have in practice a total impact on their own states.  Substantial amendments to this Bill would leave us in a more normal and a more conventional European position.</P>
    <P>There emerges a picture of a very uncertain attempt at building up a single constitutional and legal system within the Community such as seems to be presupposed by the Taoiseach this morning.  It has not proved possible to arrive at a single approach to the nationalisation, one might say, of Community laws because six separate historic constitutions exist and each is regarded by the State as a vital element of their nationality.  We should not try and run helter skelter into that structure. The Third Amendment is unacceptable to the Labour Party because of its lack of definition and so on and a very vigorous attempt will be made by the Labour Party and I suppose by the Fine Gael Party also to amend it.</P>
    <P>It will be very interesting to see the reaction when the true implications of this Bill begin to dawn on the Fianna Fáil Party.  After all, this was what was hawked around the country by a former leader of the party and by every true blue Republican.  It will be very interesting to hear the views of Deputy Haughey and of Deputy Sherwin and to see whether they will vote to accept or reject this Bill.  It would also be interesting to hear Deputy Blaney's views.  He has given frank and blunt expression to views on a whole range of matters and particularly in regard to the Constitution. These are the men who have made the Constitution their private property in recent years and put their own <Col N="1138" /> interpretations on it in regard to Northern Ireland.  Therefore, they should come here and give us their opinion on the joining of this country to EEC.  I should honestly hope that on the Committee Stage, if the Taoiseach has the nerve to stand up to it&mdash; I seriously doubt that now; I think he has become punch drunk in regard to legislation going through the House&mdash; we could have a hard, grafting session on the proposals in this Bill and a frank and open exchange of views.</P>
    <P>Even the <i>Irish Press</i> is very unhappy about the situation.  The Labour Party have been very critical of that paper in recent months in regard to some of its editorial policies and somersaults in relation to Northern Ireland but I think it is to the credit of the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;and I strongly commend it&mdash; that on the 25th or 26th November its editorial was hypercritical of the muddle which appeared to be emerging on this Bill.  It was open in its hostility to the Bill.  When that happens there is serious cause for second thoughts by the Government on the Bill.  For example, it was suggested that there might be sideways consultation with the Supreme Court on a judicial basis.  I think the views of the Chief Justice, Mr. Ó Dálaigh, and other eminent members of the profession on the appropriateness of the drafting of this Bill would be welcome.  We are supposed to live in an open political democracy and the views of the Supreme Court, in view of the fact that we cannot refer it to them directly, would certainly be welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill as circulated is inadequate and an example, as Deputy Corish rightly said last night, of questionable draftsmanship, sweeping draftsmanship. The suspicions we had of it and the reservations we publicly expressed this morning have been reinforced by the non-case put up by the Taoiseach in advocating its acceptance by the House.  As Deputy Cosgrave rightly pointed out, it is desirable that there should be some entrenched provision regarding fundamental human rights and their protection and retention within the Constitution.  The dilemma is apparent in member States, such as <Col N="1139" /> Germany, in authorising the transfer of sovereign power to international institutions and it is uncertain, I think, whether her citizens' constitutional rights are directly affected.  While our submission as a member, to the court of the Community and its regulations, would extend over the economic sector, it is conceded by the majority of eminent modern political theorists, such as Hallstein, that economic matters may all too readily merge into the direct sphere of politics.  I think therefore that as of now while defence, foreign policy, education, internal security and culture are left intact from Treaty obligations, many areas which could directly involve the rights of citizens could become seriously infringed.</P>
    <P>Since the entire area covered by this global phrase &ldquo;consequent on membership&rdquo; would be entirely removed from the constitutional system of checks and balances that we now have and since EEC organs could make decisions which would add to or take from or amend constitutional rights without parliamentary ratification, it is essential there should be a formal amendment devised which would protect fundamental rights bearing in mind our relatively low international standing in this regard and also the ultimate lack of sanctions of such international bodies as the Convention and Court of Human Rights and that we would, therefore, be obliged as a nation to have full recourse to our own Constitution to provide effective protection of individual citizen's rights.</P>
    <P>The Government have opted for the piecemeal approach and a general suspension of the Constitution.  I do not think this is good enough.  We have rightly indicated our opposition to this approach and we have welcomed the indication from Fine Gael that they intend to table amendments.  We shall make up our minds on these when we see them.  They have not yet been circulated.  Meanwhile, the Labour Party could not in conscience or political honesty accept that the Bill as introduced is adequate and meets the aspirations of the Irish people and provides essential safeguards within our Constitution which the House has a duty to provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is proceeding in a spirit of reality which conflicts with the unreality of the situation that occurred in 1937 when the original Constitution Bill was being discussed.</P>
      <P>Article 25.4.6º provides as follows:</P>
      <P>In case of conflict between the texts of a law enrolled under this section in both the official languages, the text in the national language shall prevail.</P>
      <P>The national language is defined in the Constitution as the Irish language.  We have had discussions this morning, and there have been discussions in the mass media in the last few days, about the significance of the words in the English text &ldquo;in consequence of&rdquo;.  It is thought by many people that they are too wide.  I believe that the words are careless and sloppy and do not provide the degree of certainty which is a fundamental requisite of a fundamental law such as the Constitution. If we go to the Irish text&mdash;which is the one that takes precedence under our Constitution&mdash;we find that the words used are:</P>
      <P>... gníomhartha do rinne nó bearta le n-ar ghlac an Stát de dhroim do bheith ina chomhalta de na Comhphobail ...</P>
      <P>The meaning of &ldquo;de dhroim&rdquo; is not &ldquo;in consequence of&rdquo; but &ldquo;because of&rdquo;, which one can say is tighter than the phraseology &ldquo;in consequence of&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;because of&rdquo; involve that element of necessity, of unavoidable consequence, of obligation arising out of membership, which does not arise in the English text.  I do not think that there are people in Brussels who have sufficient expertise in the Irish language to know that the Irish text is one which is nearer what Fine Gael will be proposing for the English text of this Constitution Amendment Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, like practically everything else the present Government have done, is a case of the wrong way being used to do the right thing.  If there are two ways of doing anything, the Government invariably choose the wrong one.  Fine Gael support the application of Ireland for membership of the EEC, believing it is in Ireland's best <Col N="1141" /> interest.  We believe it is the best way to achieve a worthwhile nation in cultural values, in intellectual and moral disciplines and in material benefits.  We are very annoyed that the Government have introduced such a sloppy, vague and confusing measure to achieve what we regard as a desirable objective, namely membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Constitution of 1937 is being attacked from all quarters now.  It is interesting to note that it is not often defended by the party which imposed it on the Irish people in 1937 for partisan purposes.  It is worthwhile reflecting that as we are involved now in a passionate debate to preserve certain sections of the Constitution, only 26 per cent of the Irish people voted in 1937 for the Constitution; 20 per cent voted against it; 32 per cent of the people of Ireland were unable to vote for it because they were outside the jurisdiction of the State; and the balance of the people did not think it worth while voting on it.  This fundamental law of our nation, which should be respected by all as being valuable and unchangeable and the instrument to govern our mode of behaviour received the support of only 26 per cent of the electorate.  It has achieved a certain degree of respectability and acceptance during the years which it did not have in 1937 but in some respects it is a miserable and mischievous Constitution.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution has been described by Mr. Patrick McGilligan, a former Minister and Attorney General, a Professor of Law and one of our most distinguished statesmen since we achieved freedom, as an instrument which was full of wind and sail and no anchor.  That was an accurate description because when we come to the sections of the Constitution that are presumed to guarantee fundamental rights, the moment the guarantee is offered it is snatched back by reservations that the fundamental rights may be qualified by law.  It is full of what a distinguished member of the High Court described as &ldquo;lilies of speech, the meaning and application of which can vary from generation to generation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With all these inadequacies and <Col N="1142" /> limitations, to some extent it has served a useful purpose in limiting the power of the Executive in interfering with the fundamental rights of people.  It is worthwhile observing that where the courts have rapped the knuckles of Governments for offending against the Constitution, it was the knuckles of Fianna Fáil Governments that were rapped.  These Governments told the Dáil and Seanad that the proposals they were making were legitimate and acceptable and were being offered on the advice of their Attorneys General.  I suspect we will be asked to accept this Bill without modification because the Government have received what is presumed to be the best legal advice&mdash; the advice of the Attorney General&mdash; and we will be told that it is the only form which will be acceptable to the European institutions and that it achieves the objectives of the institutions without interfering with the fundamental rights of our people.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in this Bill is to repeal the Constitution in all respects in the entire 45 Articles in respect of anything which may be done &ldquo;in consequence of membership of the Community&rdquo;. That is a repeal of the Constitution in relation to all matters which come within the ambit of the Treaty of Rome and the treaties governing the other Communities and their ultimate development towards political union as well as economic union.  If the political developments come, they will be in consequence of those treaties, in consequence of membership and, therefore, in effect we are asking the people to repeal the Constitution and do away with whatever safeguards there may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy L'Estrange at Question Time in the House yesterday said, and I quote from the Official Report of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> Mr. B. Lenihan: It is not possible to cast aspersions on Deputy L'Estrange's character.</P>
    <P>Mr. L'Estrange: Do not talk about people's character.  The Minister paid his own father-in-law £700 that he should not have paid him when he was Minister for Justice and I will produce the file on that if the Minister wants information about it.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: Let the Deputy produce the file.</P>
    <P>Mr. L'Estrange: The Minister's father-in-law when he was superintendent and was transferred to the west&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan.  I would ask the Deputy to produce the file.</P>
    <P>Mr. L'Estrange: The Minister paid him £700.  Do not talk to me about character.  I will place it above yours and the Lenihans any time.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: Let the Deputy produce the file.</P>
    <P>Mr. L'Estrange: The Minister is a disgrace.  He has reduced the name of this country to that of a banana republic.  I will produce the file and give a copy of the allegations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: The Deputy should not run away from them again as he did when he made other allegations.</P>
    <P>The facts are that my father-in-law, Joseph Devine, was appointed Superintendent in January, 1925.  He served as Superintendent in Cavan, the Depot, Fermoy, Kanturk, Swinford, Loughrea, the Depot, Ballymote, Athlone and Killaloe.  In September, 1962, he was promoted Chief Superintendent and assigned to Castlebar, County Mayo, where he continued to serve as Chief Superintendent until he retired on reaching the age limit of 63 years in September, 1965.  He received the gratuity and superannuation entitlements appropriate to his rank on his retirement.</P>
    <P>Over two years after his appointment as Chief Superintendent in September, 1962, I was appointed Minister for Justice in November, 1964.  As I have stated, Joseph Devine was Chief Superintendent <Col N="1144" /> in Castlebar at that time, and remained as such in that town until his normal retirement ten months later in September, 1965.</P>
    <P>I did not pay Joseph Devine £700 as alleged by the Deputy or, indeed, any moneys of any kind either as Minister for Justice or in any other capacity, public or private, at any time. He did, of course, receive from the Department of Justice the salary and emoluments appropriate to his rank.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I would ask Deputy L'Estrange here and now to withdraw the allegations he has made. In the event of his not doing so I challenge him to repeat his allegations outside the House where appropriate action can and will be taken against him in the courts.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be unaware of the change brought about consequent on the passing of the Health Act, 1970, in regard to the victims of road accidents, who are entitled to compensation arising out of their injuries. Under the Health Services Regulations, 1971, health boards are absolved from liability for the cost of hospital inpatient and out-patient treatment for road accident cases.  These regulations include a provision that, where a person who would be eligible for such services in the ordinary way is admitted to hospital, he must establish that he is not entitled to compensation before he can be regarded as eligible for the services.</P>

      <P>I am pressing for the protection of the interests of the fishermen as these interests exist and for the conservation of the fishery stocks. Our industry unlike that of the other applicants is at a very undeveloped stage and for that reason, perhaps, the European countries thought it needed less consideration than those countries whose fisheries are developed.  I am pressing for the continuation of access control to our waters so that it will be possible for us to build up our fishing industry.  I am pressing, too, for a clause to ensure that the continued period after the first negotiations will relate to the circumstances in the development of the fishing industry and to the economic circumstances of the country rather than to have any sharp and sterile decision taken at this time.</P>

      <P>There is very little difference between the two countries. <Col N="1152" /> Both countries would like to see a situation whereby at the end of ten years there would be a review clause which would allow a decision to be made relating to the circumstances of the time and making it possible to have continued the protection we require now.  In so far as the interests of our fishermen and the conservation of fish are concerned, there is very little difference in the attitude of both countries. We need areas of water.  Because of the special interest of Ireland in shellfish, including prawns, and in salmon, I have already secured a 12-mile limit all around the coast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As a nation, we should set some target for ourselves in regard to the fishing industry and, therefore, we should not leave it indefinite.  In any case, we would not get it indefinite. A lot can be done in ten years but I have serious doubts that at the end of that period we could accept a free access situation.  For that reason, I would like the Community to have regard to the fact that a decision should be taken in ten years time.</P>

The four applicants are at one in wanting a situation at the end of the first interim period which will mean the consideration of the situation in relation to the needs of fisheries, the interests of the fishermen and the development of the industry generally, rather than saying that this is a transition to an acceptance of the original Community situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore  Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Moore</b> asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the present position regarding the scheme of dental benefit administered by his Department, whether the scheme is being suspended as from 1st December, 1971; what <Col N="1157" /> negotiations have taken place with the dentists operating the scheme; whether any new offer has been made to them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position regarding the dental benefit scheme administered by my Department is that 382 dentists have withdrawn from the dental panel with effect from 1st December, 1971.  The scheme has not, however, been suspended as there are still 143 dentists remaining on the panel who continue to provide services for qualified insured persons.</P>
      <P>The Irish Dental Association's dispute with my Department is concerned mainly with the claim for increase in fees based on the report of a practice cost survey submitted by the association in May, 1971, but the issue is somewhat confused by two other claims which overlapped in time with the main claim.</P>
      <P>The first of these claims is concerned with the agreement to which each dentist on the dental panel subscribes. A new agreement was drafted at the request of the association and as far back as October, 1970, representatives of the association assured me personally that they were satisfied with the draft and would recommend its acceptance. Despite this assurance the association again raised the matter of the agreement in April, 1971, and further concessions in the wording of certain clauses were granted to them at a meeting in May, 1971.  The association are still not prepared to accept the new form of agreement principally because I have refused to concede to them the absolute right to accept or reject a patient under the scheme.  They may, of course, refuse to accept a patient if they furnish a reasonable explanation to me.</P>
      <P>The other claim was in respect of the fees payable for items of treatment of a sophisticated nature such as crowns and inlays which at the request of the association I agreed should be dealt with on a grant-in-aid basis.  Three separate offers by the Department were rejected by the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it became apparent that the association were not prepared to recommend to their members any form of <Col N="1158" /> agreement which did not exactly conform to their terms or to agree to fees for grant-in-aid items of any lesser amount than those demanded by them I decided in September  to circulate the new agreement to all panel dentists and to invite them to subscribe to it if they wished, or alternatively to continue to operate under their existing agreements, and at the same time I fixed fees which I consider not only reasonable but generous for the grant-in-aid items so that dentists performing the type of work for which these fees are payable should benefit immediately from these. I made it clear at the time that these fees could be further discussed in connection with the claim for a revision of the general scale of fees.</P>
    <P>In regard to the main claim which is a claim for an increase in the general scale of fees the position is that the then president of the Irish Dental Association submitted in April of this year a suggested revised scale of fees which he stated would be acceptable to his association.  The fees suggested, it was stated, were based on the result of a practice cost survey the report of which was not received in the Department until 17th May, 1971.  The report was considered by an inter-departmental committee consisting of officials of my Department, a professional accounttant from the Department of Industry and Commerce and a representative from the Department of Health.  Arising out of the examination the Irish Dental Association were asked to elucidate certain points and a supplementary report was received from the association on 20th July, 1971.  Following very careful and detailed consideration of the whole matter officials of my Department met representatives of the association again on 4th November, 1971. Before this meeting, however, notices of intention to withdraw from the dental panel as from 1st December were received through the Irish Dental Association from some 350 dentists.  A day-long meeting was held with representatives of the Irish Dental Association on 4th November and it was agreed that a new scale of fees should be formulated based on an agreed hourly rate of remuneration which would give a net profit of £4,500 a year to a dentist <Col N="1159" /> engaged solely on work under my Department's scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to formulate this new scale further meetings with representatives of the Irish Dental Association were held on 17th and 23rd November for the purpose of determining mutually acceptable times for the performance of the various items of work under the dental benefit scheme.  It has not as yet been found possible to reach agreement on these timings, but a new scale of fees based on timings which my Department's technical advisers consider more than adequate, indeed generous, has been formulated and was due to be discussed with representatives of the Dental Association at a meeting to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dentists who wish to give treatment to insured persons under my Department's dental benefit scheme enter into an agreement with me and their names are inscribed on <Col N="1161" /> the dental panel.  Normally there are about 500 dentists, the great majority of those in private practice, on the panel.  As panel dentists are paid on a fee basis their remuneration under the scheme is dependent on the amount of work done, and the amount received by individual dentists under the scheme varies from less than £100 to more than £20,000 a year.  The total amount available to all panel dentists from the scheme is at present of the order of £1,100,000.</P>
      <P>There has never been any difficulty in securing the full complement of dentists necessary as almost all dentists in general practice participate in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Heretofore it has been the practice to admit all applicant dentists to the dental panel but I am considering the advisability of admitting dentists to this panel in future on a more selective basis.  For example, I feel that the prescription for admission to the panel of some minimum experience in the field of practical dentistry after qualification may be desirable.  Again, I feel that the number of dentists on the panel in a given area should bear some relation to insured population in that area so that, while ensuring adequate choice of dentist, a reasonable level of participation in the scheme will be available to each individual panel dentist.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last April the Irish Dental Association submitted a claim for a general increase in the scale of fees payable to panel dentists under my Department's dental benefit scheme. <Col N="1162" /> Broadly speaking, this represented an overall increase of 60 per cent on the fees then payable which already included a 17 per cent increase conceded with effect from August, 1970.  This claim was supported by a practice cost survey conducted for the association by a professional accountant and submitted to my Department in May, 1971. Following examination of this survey by an inter-departmental group which included a professional accountant, agreement was reached on an hourly rate of payment in respect of work done by dentists under the dental benefit scheme and we are now trying to reach agreement on times taken to perform the various items of treatment listed on the scale of fees, but so far without success.  The timings proposed by the dental association would, if accepted, result in an increase in expenditure on fees of well over 100 per cent.  It is not possible at this stage to state exactly the full effect of the increase in fees being sought by the association but I may say that if their claim was to be conceded in full the additional cost to the Exchequer in respect of the basic items on the scale of fees, that is, examination, extractions, fillings and scaling, would be of the order of £1,000,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question that I am asking.  Does the Minister realise that widows of civil servants who died subsequent to the introduction of the scheme and who had not opted in at that time, have since been allowed to buy themselves in?  Why the distinction?  They have been allowed to buy themselves in retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the scheme was agreed and was to operate as from 23rd July, 1968.  After that date documents had to be prepared explaining the scheme and had to be circulated to the civil servants concerned and they had to be given an opportunity to assimilate it and decide whether they wanted to opt in or out and documents could not be prepared until after that date because agreement was not reached until then.  Therefore, a certain amount of time had to elapse and it was decided that the necessary time that <Col N="1166" /> had to elapse was to the end of that year, December, 1968.  Therefore, any officer serving at that date had the option up to the end of that year to opt in or out.  Some officers died during that period and in such cases the option to opt in was passed on to the widow or the legal personal representatives of the man who died.  That was a reasonable approach in the circumstances. We could not have done anything else.  Considering that the man who died had the option, it should have been available to his widow or legal representative.  But this option arises solely out of the administrative difficulties I have mentioned, under which it was agreed at the time that there would be an option operating between 23rd July and the end of 1968.</P>

In 1967 investigations on the scheme were resumed and the hydrometric <Col N="1171" /> survey is still being carried out.  I admit the amount being spent in surveying the Shannon in relation to the total cost of the scheme is very small but, as I say, the whole matter is under review at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 to 45 together.</P>
      <P>When the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Reformatory and Industrial Schools Systems was published in November, 1970, an immediate examination of it was undertaken to see what could be done to implement the major recommendations in the report which directly concerned my Department.  In the 12 months that have since elapsed the following progress has been made in this area:</P>
      <P>(i) The new training school at Finglas has been completed and it is hoped to have it opened shortly.</P>
      <P>(ii) it is anticipated that a contract may be placed shortly for the erection of a new training school on a 60 acre site at Obserstown in north County Dublin to replace St. Conleth's Reformatory, Daingean. Building would commence immediately afterwards;</P>
      <P>(iii) an intensive course in child care for senior members of the staffs of reformatory and industrial schools was held last July and the first of a series of 12-month courses in child care commenced in Kilkenny in September last.  This course will provide 20 trained personnel each year in addition to the many trained personnel already in the system.  The course includes theory and practical work some of which will be done in schools abroad;</P>
      <P>(iv) plans have been prepared for modern group home units, each to cater for approximately 15 children, which will be erected at selected industrial schools;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(v) a grant towards the cost of a <Col N="1186" /> hostel erected for girls from an industrial school in the Cork area has been made by my Department.</P>
    <P>The reformatory and industrial schools have been designated as special schools in my Department and as such now have available to them the expertise of the inspectorial and psychological staff skilled in the preparation of educational programmes suitable for the deprived child and are also allowed special pupil/teacher staffing ratios.  In the future, managers of remand or training centres will need to have suitable academic qualifications and experience before appointment to such posts.  Concurrently with these developments officers of my Department have had meetings with the heads of religious orders engaged in the work with regard to the rationalisation of the present system, particularly the boys' schools, and proposals for a reorganisation of the general system envisage the separation of the deprived child from the delinquent in the matter of custodial arrangements and training.</P>
    <P>Both the new institutions at Finglas and Oberstown will be conducted generally on open lines with some closed accommodation reserved for boys who may be temporarily difficult, but no decision has yet been taken on the extent of the accommodation needed for the seriously disturbed delinquent.  This matter will be the subject of a detailed study which has already commenced.</P>
    <P>The matter raised in Question No. 41 is amongst those still under consideration. I am not satisfied it is an appropriate one to be dealt with by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish/Swiss Institute of Horology was set up in June, 1964 following the signing of an agreement between my Department and the Swiss Federation of Watch Manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement the specialist teaching equipment for the institute was supplied by the federation, at a cost of over £10,000, and the federation also paid the full salaries of the technical teachers for the first six years of operation of the institute, as well as the cost of the individual tool kits supplied to the students and certain other costs.  The remaining costs were paid by the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>The agreement was revised as from June, 1970, and now provides that the running expenses of the institute hitherto borne by the Swiss Federation are now shared&mdash;one-third is borne by the Irish educational authorities and two-thirds by the Swiss watch industry. The County Dublin Vocational Education Committee bear the cost of additional teaching and secretarial services and accommodation.</P>

      <P>Including posts as principal and vice-principal 6,528 posts of responsibility have been established in primary schools, 3,395 such posts are available in secondary schools and 1,495 have been established in vocational schools.  The estimated respective costs are £1,340,000, £965,200 and £364,000.  The position in future years will be governed by the number of pupils in the schools.  The normal criteria followed in making these appointments are general suitability and qualifications and length of teaching service.</P>

      <P>I assume the Minister is telling the truth in these figures because it was not the impression I would have gained from my contacts with the teaching profession.  On the question of criteria, is it really sufficient in the Minister's view to say &ldquo;general suitability and experience&rdquo;?  What are these posts created for?  Are they awarded for seniority, length of service, the performing of some specific function, like running the local debating society, or locking the door after the pupils have gone home?  I do not think the Minister has answered that part of my question which asks what criteria are used.</P>

A compensatory amount system to offset national price differences will apply <Col N="1206" /> within the enlarged Community during the transitional period to the main products, namely, fat cattle and beef, dairy products, pigmeat, poultry and eggs, cereals and sugar and this will tend to neutralise our preferential position in the British market as the compensatory amounts will offset the declining differences in prices.</P>
      <P>The British deficiency payments system will be phased out gradually and over the phasing-out period Irish store cattle and sheep will continue to benefit from this system.  In the case of most other products, for example, horticultural products, there will continue to be preferences in our favour until the duties on these products are finally eliminated.  I should add that in connection with the arrangements I have outlined it has been agreed in the negotiations that the implementation of the transitional measures should not result in any diminution in the degree of freedom of trade already existing between the United Kingdom and Ireland as a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>As already announced, payment of compensation will be financed by adjustment, as appropriate, of the Pigs and Bacon Commission's levy on pig slaughterings. This levy is payable by bacon curers on slaughterings of bacon pigs and there is no statutory provision for deduction of the levy from prices paid to producers who must be paid the guaranteed minimum pig prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be worked in two directions.  I think that the curer will seek to compensate himself in so far as possible but, on the other hand, the elimination of the uneconomic elements in the processing industry will benefit both the producer and the curer. The object of the whole exercise is to have a more efficient bacon industry and, thereby, to procure for the producer, better prices for his pigs but I think that in the long run the producer will be the gainer.  In any event, the curer cannot go below the guaranteed minimum price.</P>

I cannot accept that there has been any lack of co-operation by my Department.

In relation to all of the increases that have taken place in recent years, I can say that the compensatory increases allowed to manufactures accounted only for about two-thirds of the cost increases and the balance has had to be met by improved management and output.

However, whether it is a foreign-controlled or an Irish-controlled distribution unit, it does not make any difference from the point of view of the squeezing out of the small man.</P>

    <P>In regard to the steps the Government are taking to remedy the situation, as I informed Deputy Creed in answer to a similar question on the 4th November, 1971, the Government provide generous incentives to attract new industries and to strengthen existing industries.  The up-to-date position as indicated by the Industrial Development Authority is that there <Col N="1218" /> are nine new industrial projects in the pipeline for the Cork area, i.e., within a 20-mile radius of the city, with an employment potential at full employment of 1,450.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>Only those persons specified in rule 119 of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, or those authorised by statute, such as members of a visiting committee, or by an order from the Minister for Justice may visit a prison. These restrictions are in the interests of protecting the privacy of prisoners and of good prison administration.</P>
      <P>Each application to visit a prison is considered on its merits but in normal circumstances any Deputy who is interested in penal reform and who would like to see the operation of a prison would receive permission.  In fact, I welcome such visits and the only qualification I would like to suggest is that they might be arranged in groups with a view to minimising the effect on normal prison routine.  Similarly, visits by social science or law students which are sponsored by the faculty are normally allowed where the numbers are not excessive.</P>
      <P>The application by the Phoenix Society related to visits to prisoners. As to this, I should say that visits to prisoners are confined by the prison rules to relatives and friends of the prisoners concerned and to authorised persons concerned with their welfare who are acting under the supervision of the welfare officer.  Authorisation to such persons is only given on an individual basis after an assessment of the particular person's suitability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC Convention to which the Deputy refers was signed by the existing member States of the Community on 27th September, 1968.  It has so far been ratified by Belgium, France and Italy.</P>
      <P>Discussions are in progress between the Commission in Brussels and the four applicant States with a view to determining what technical adaptations of the Convention will be needed to take account of the legal systems of those States.  These discussions will be followed by negotiations on matters of substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot, at this stage, say when the Convention is likely to come into force, so as to enable maintenance orders of Irish courts to be enforced, under its provisions, in Britain and in the other member States of an enlarged Community. Meanwhile, the discussions in relation to reciprocal enforcement between Britain and ourselves are now being continued having regard to the <Col N="1227" /> altered situation arising from the prospective entry of both countries into the European Community.

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>1.  The figures of Garda strength for Drogheda, which is the Divisional Headquarters for Louth/Meath, include members whose duties are not confined to the sub-district, e.g. administrative and clerical staff and gardaí for the district patrol cars.</P>
    <P>2.  Santry had been in the Whitehall District of the Dublin Metropolitan Area since 1964 and the policing of the sub-district is augmented by members and transport attached to the district headquarters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 29th October, 1971, one of the six Vampire jet air-craft held by the Air Corps was undergoing a major overhaul; the other five were being checked and serviced. I might add that one of these aircraft is at present operational and a further three are expected to become operational during the next few months.  The remaining two are unlikely to become serviceable again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree, in view of what he has just said, that there was good reason for the Taoiseach's laugh yesterday when he was asked whether or not the plane referred to by Deputy Byrne did, in fact, fly over Gormanston for the purpose of taking pictures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 104, 105, 106 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>An accident occurred on the 19th October, 1971, during mortar firing practice from an armoured car.  Practice firing of mortar weapons has, as a normal safety precaution, been suspended pending full investigation.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigations failed to establish what caused the explosion and an order convening a court of inquiry to investigate the matter in detail was made on the 23rd November, 1971. Pending consideration of the findings of the court of inquiry, I do not propose to make any further statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be fair to ask the Minister if, in fact, the mortar concerned was an ex-Dunkirk one and the ammunition being fired was also ex-Dunkirk?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it they have not been changed?  I used them for a <Col N="1234" /> number of years and they were liable to explode in 1944, not to talk of 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain why, in view of the question I asked here on 27th November, 1969, whether it was true that one out of three mortar shells was misfiring three mortar s hells was misfiring, motor squadron was standing behind the armoured car when the shell was fired?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if his attention has been drawn to an article in a Dublin newspaper (details supplied) dealing with Army equipment and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article referred to in the question.  It would not be in the interests of security to publish details of the quantities or types of certain equipment held or being purchased for the Defence Forces and, for that reason, it is not the practice to comment on articles which speculate about these matters.</P>
      <P>I may, however, say that substantial quantities of equipment, additional to those for which provision was made in the current year's Estimate for Defence, either have been ordered or are in the process of being ordered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When final figures and costings are available, I propose to introduce a Supplementary Estimate which will include provision for such portion of <Col N="1235" /> the additional expenditure involved as will fall to be met in the current financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if the figure is, in fact, £2 million, or is it £3 million and £1 million announced £3 million and £1 million seems to have got lost on the way? He says now it is £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be making a statement on the matter when I introduce my Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should know now.  The only person I have no patience with is the person who does not read his brief properly and the Minister obviously did not do that because he said it was £3 million.  Now he says it is £2 million.  Somebody must have told him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will call the Deputy's bluff.  The Minister at no time stated that £3 million would be available.  If the Deputy can prove that I did make that statement, that is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That will have to be done when the Minister has not got it on his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression was given that there was £3 million for new equipment and that that equipment would be in addition to what was on order last year.  The whole operation was described in the article as a confidence trick and it looks very like one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this £2 million or £3 million going to be used to pay for equipment ordered last year or will it be provided to buy new equipment when it is voted here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the question do not allow valid comparisons to be made on the basis of housing and roads programmes which differ in respect of content, methods of financing and needs to be met.  As regards housing, our total output of new houses in 1970-71 was somewhat in excess of that reached in the Six Counties.  In the Six Counties a higher proportion of the total output is provided by public authorities.  Our assistance by way of grants and loans to persons providing their own houses are more generous than in the Six Counties and this is reflected in the higher proportion of private houses being built here.  This difference would make comparisons even more difficult.</P>
      <P>As regards roads, the latest available figures are for 1969-70 in which year gross expenditure in the Twentysix Counties was £19.3 million as compared with £20.4 million in the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government (a) the number of local authority tenants at present withholding rents and money, (b) the total amount of money due and (c) and if he is prepared to meet the tenants organisations to settle the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the 30th November, 1971, 3,839 of the 105,113 local authority tenants in the country were withholding rents.  The total amount of money withheld to that date is estimated at £297,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the last part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No.  155 of 24th June, 1971, in regard to meetings which I <Col N="1244" /> had with representatives of the National Association of Tenants' Organisations. In that reply I pointed out that, amongst other things, the proposals of the association would favour the betteroff tenants at the expense of the less well-off tenants and would thereby undermine the fundamental basis of differential renting which is to relate the rent liability of each tenant as closely as possible to his financial ability to pay.  The proposals would throw an extra burden of £2 million on the rates in the first year, rising annually in future years.  This £2 million would be additional to the subsidies of nearly £11 million which are being paid by the general body of ratepayers and taxpayers this year to keep the rents of local authority houses at their present level&mdash;the average weekly rent being £1.27 per dwelling.</P>
    <P>In view of the attitude of the association in the discussions I have had with them and their efforts to disrupt the normal workings of local administration by encouraging tenants to withhold rents due to local authorities, I have no intention at present of meeting them again.  I would, however, point out&mdash;as I have informed the association on more than one occasion&mdash;that the management and control of houses in their estates is, subject to the Housing Acts and regulations, vested in the local authorities.  It is with these authorities, therefore, that the tenants must reach agreement within the framework of the existing law on any issue relating to the rents of the houses since it is the local authorities who would have to raise the money through increased rates or adjustment of other rents for any concessions they grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that no matter what dispute occurs, whether between countries or employer and employee or, as in this case, the local authorities and the tenants, it must eventually be settled by discussion around the table or alternatively somebody is crushed?  Would the Minister not agree that discussions should be initiated and that he should use his good offices to try to have that done?  Or does he consider the tenants should be completely crushed and he <Col N="1245" /> will hold out until that actually happens?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My functions in relation to the sale to tenants of houses rented to them by local authorities are to approve of general sale schemes which I am satisfied comply with the provisions of the Housing Act, 1966 and the regulations made thereunder. The provisions in question stipulate, amongst other items, that the sale prices under a scheme must be equivalent to the current market or replacement value of the houses.  The application of an approved scheme to individual tenants is a matter for the local authority and tenant concerned and is not one in which I have functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the change in the price of the house which is referred to here was brought about by the direct action of the Dáil on the proposal of one of the Minister's predecessors who is no longer with us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the increased cost of the house was due to a revised system of valuation introduced by Deputy Boland when he was Minister for Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>How did the price increase by 57 per cent in 10 months if that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the first sale scheme made by Dublin Corporation under the 1966 Act.  No rented corporation house had previously been sold and there was no basis for valuation. Having settled on a price, it transpired that subsequently these <Col N="1247" /> houses were resold by the purchasers in some cases for twice the figure and certainly at figures well in excess of the price the corporation had put on them.  In law, they were obliged to see that the sale prices would relate to the replacement value or the market value but from evidence available to them it was clear they had not complied fully with the law and when a new scheme was drawn up subsequently the houses were re-valued so as to be more in line with their market value.  This is the explanation for the differences in the prices in these two schemes which were both drawn up after the 1966 Act had been passed.  Tenants who were offered these houses under the original scheme had the benefit of the very low price, an unrealistic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the 1966 scheme is the one under which the present price was fixed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>No doubt the Minister is aware that completion of this scheme will take a long time.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to tell us when it will be completed?  In the meantime, there is the possibility that a similar type of flooding could occur, not only in this part of the town where the unfortunate man lost his life, but in other parts of the town, in the vicinity of King Street.  Does the Minister not think that there should be an investigation, as I suggested in my question, by officials of his Department and officials of the Wexford Corporation to ensure that the necessary precautions will be taken so that there will be at least a minimum amount of damage to property and that precautions will be taken to ensure that there will not be any further loss of life?  I think the Minister and his Department must be aware that the flooding rose to such a height that anyone could have been drowned in the circumstances that prevailed on Monday, 29th November.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to accept that this matter has been considered fully and a decision made. We have agreed in the Department on the necessity for a scheme to relieve flooding in this area and everything possible has been done by the Department in santioning all stage of the scheme.  Now we are at a stage where work is about to commence.  The Deputy can be assured that local authority officials in Wexford are conscious of the points he has made and will take any steps they can take to alleviate or reduce the extent of flooding should there be similar occurences in the period between now and when the scheme is completed.  It would be unreasonable to expect that some major solution could be found other than the implementation of this scheme, which all agree is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that officials of the corporation and voluntary workers did everything possible in the circumstances but, in view of the fact that this could recur at any time, there should be some further effort made by <Col N="1253" /> the Department and the officials of the Wexford Corporation.  The Minister may have been asked the following question by the Wexford Corporation but, in view of the heavy burden on the ratepayers in Wexford so far as this very unusual problem is concerned, would the Minister not consider taking some steps to relieve the ratepayers of what would be a very heavy impost on them?  I am saying this, conscious of the fact that flooding occurs in other towns in Ireland.  So far as the frequency and extent of flooding are concerned, they are unusual in Wexford. While I do not expect the Minister or any official to commit himself, can he tell me whether those people who drew up the scheme are optimistic that it will do something to relieve the flooding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only are they optimistic but they are satisfied that the scheme as proposed will deal with major flooding problems in this area. However, I must point out that conditions could obtain at a future date where, due to unusual circumstances, there could be flooding of a magnitude where even this scheme could not cope with it.  In that case the scheme might be found to be deficient but I do not expect that such a situation would arise. In designing schemes of this nature one must be practical.  The scheme as designed is drawn up in such a way as to alleviate the flooding that has been occurring at this point for some years.</P>

    <P>Replacement of the small glass panes by large sheets of plastic material has reduced the incidence of structural damage to kiosks.  About 250 of the Dublin kiosks have already been modified in this way.  Various measures have been taken to protect coin-boxes including bolting them to steel plates fitted to the back of the kiosk structure and reinforcing the coin-box itself.  Manufacture of a stronger coin-box is being explored.</P>
    <P>I have stated previously in the House that the incidence of vandalism <Col N="1257" /> to telephone kiosks is a problem in most countries and no satisfactory solution has been found.

    <P>150.  Mr. L. Burke asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of a report (details supplied) that to date 10,000 people have signed petitions in support of a campaign to bring multi-channel television to the south; and what steps he intends to take to ensure that these people, as taxpayers and ratepayers, are given the same facilities as those enjoyed by Dublin people.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report mentioned by the Deputy.  External <Col N="1258" /> signals are receivable &ldquo;off the air&rdquo; in certain areas of the State as a result of the fortuitous overspill of signals from externally situated transmitters. I do not consider that the fortuitous advantage thus avaliable to people living in those areas creates any obligation to have the same advantage made available elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In replying to the debate on the Estimate for my Department on 25th November last, Vol. 257, No. 3, cols. 433 and 434, I described the question of making these signals available throughout the State as a major matter of policy and said that I was reluctant to express views on such matters which might well be under review by the Broadcasting Review Committee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Murphy's remarks arise in consequence of the personal explanation like the amendment to the Constitution which we are being asked to consider.  I want to dwell upon the real meanings of the words in this Bill.  Already this morning Deputy <Col N="1286" /> Cosgrave on behalf of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;and I wish to support him now &mdash;protested against the losseness of the language in the Bill and the risks involved in adopting the Bill in the form in which it has been submitted to us. The word &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; which is contained in the Bill, according to the 1933 edition of the Oxford English Dictionary means &ldquo;anything which follows something else in order&rdquo;.  Oxford also says that &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; contrasted with &ldquo;antecedent&rdquo; means &ldquo;a phenomenon or event which follows another without implication of causal connection&rdquo;. In other words, &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; means something which is in sequence, something which follows in historical sequence, not necessarily something which is caused by something else.  This shows the real risk involved in accepting the Bill as proposed.</P>
      <P>Any development of the Community into a political institution or, perhaps, into some military institution is something which will follow in sequence and, therefore, will be consequent on our becoming a member of the European Economic Community.  The Bill goes much further than is required by any obligations which exist under the Rome Treaty or any other treaties in relation to the other Communities.  It is totally wrong that the fundamental law of the State should go further than is necessary for the purpose of meeting international obligations and it is particularly undesirable to go further than necessary when, in fact, we are repealing the Constitution in relation to any event which is consequent on membership of the Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, to refer to Oxford&mdash;it defines it as something which is in the consequence, as being in the result.  &ldquo;Consequent&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;following as an effect, as a result&rdquo; and, a much looser and more dangerous explanation, &ldquo;following in time of order&rdquo;&ldquo;succeeding&rdquo;&ldquo;subsequent&rdquo;.  Because &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; can be interpreted merely as a matter of historical sequence, clearly it is not the language which should be used in the Bill.  That is why we prefer to delete the words &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;necessitated by membership of&rdquo;.  This clearly meets all the obligations which now exist and all the <Col N="1287" /> obligations which may arise by reason of directives and decisions and regulations but would not mean that we could go beyond the existing Treaties. It would certainly mean that it could not be extended to any further development, political or military.</P>
    <P>If those developments take place it will be a matter for our people at that time to make their own decisions, having regard to the state of the world and the state of Irish affairs, as to what they want to do.  We have no right now to say that we will abandon for all time in the future the restrictions, the safeguards in our Constitution, in such a way as would prevent future generations from relying upon the safeguards and protections which we now enjoy.</P>
    <P>I go now to the 1902 edition of the Webster Dictionary.  It defines &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; as &ldquo;following as a result&rdquo;&ldquo;an inference or natural event&rdquo;&ldquo;that which follows&rdquo;.  Again, there is this element of mere sequence in time, that which follows, which comes after. Webster also says it means &ldquo;results from a cause&rdquo;&ldquo;a result or natural effect&rdquo;.  The risk is still involved that it is open to interpretations which do not relate to the necessary obligations of membership.  We must be terribly careful in amending the Constitution at any time not to go any further than the requirements of the time or the demands of our people.</P>
    <P>The second edition of Fowler's Modern English Usage draws a very clear distinction between &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; and &ldquo;consequential&rdquo;.  Fowler says that: &ldquo;where doubt can arise between &ldquo;consequential&rdquo; and &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; the latter should always be used when the sense is the simple and common one of resulting, and &ldquo;consequential&rdquo; should be reserved for the sense of being required for consistency with something else.  In the Bill proposed to us, we do not use the word &ldquo;consequential&rdquo;.  Clearly that would be a better word because, according to Fowler, &ldquo;consequential&rdquo; should be reserved for the requirement for consistency with something else.  In other words, if we want to stick to the idea <Col N="1288" /> of consequence rather than necessity, the safer word to use would be &ldquo;consequential&rdquo; because the effect then would be that any Acts or measures or laws which were required in order to maintain consistency with the Rome Treaty would be valid under our laws. There is no need to extend it to the dangerous limits proposed in the Bill. It goes much too far.  &ldquo;Consequential&rdquo; means something which is necessitated. &ldquo;Consequent&rdquo; means something which simply follows in the matter of time. Because of the recklessness displayed by the Government in drafting this Bill, we find ourselves in this great difficulty, this serious political difficulty, in that while we want Ireland to accede to membership and believe that Ireland can gain considerable advantage from accepting the responsibilities as well as the privileges of membership, we cannot give our whole-hearted support to the Government amendment.  It is an amendment that is sloppy, careless and one which we hope the Government will see their way to tidying up in the course of the committee or later stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been expressed a considerable amount of fear in regard to the possible loss of sovereignty that would result from our accession to the European institutions.  It is extraordinary that there should be displayed such passionate anxiety to maintain artificial and foreign concepts of sovereignty. Sovereignty is a relatively modern political doctrine.  It was not conceived until the 16th century and as mankind has developed a more mature international order there becomes less need for reliance on the artificial concepts of sovereignty which were introduced in the 16th century to succeed the old monarchial claims that were made and which were being replaced by more sophisticated societies as they advanced from the States which were ruled by monarchs to States ruled by parliaments and by the people themselves.</P>
    <P>As we move into the more developed world of sensible and sane relationships between States, the concept of sovereignty becomes less important.  It is fair to argue that sovereignty is an evil doctrine because what is often assumed <Col N="1289" /> in relation to it is that a State may do exactly as it wishes without regard to the duty owed to other States and people.  It is an immoral concept because the notion associated with it is that no other State, no other institution, has any right to rule, to order or to pass comments on the actions of any sovereign State.  We have moved away from any concept of strict sovereignty by our membership of such bodies as the League of Nations, of the Council of Europe and of the United Nations.  When people express a dislike for submitting to the sovereignty of the European Court in Luxembourg, I wonder if they have considered the great value it is to this country to have outside it some institution to which the individual may appeal&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the State misbehaves or to which this State may appeal when another State misbehaves. It is strange to hear these words of regret about submitting to the rulings of a European Court in the same week as our Government, belatedly, but with the support of the nation, have declared their intention to make a complaint to the European Commission on Human Rights because of the manner in which another State is in contravention of the rights covenant.  A small nation like ours gains strength from membership of international communities.  It can gain great power and opportunity to exercise power by reason of its membership of international institutions, power that would not be available to us if we were to depend on the kind of sterile sovereignty that was so much in vogue 800 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to quote from <i>The Law of Nations</i> by Brierly who, writing in 1928, said in relation to sovereignty that where sovereignty is enjoyed by the majority of citizens of a territory, there is democracy.  That is the sovereignty that was contemplated in our Constitution and not a sterile withdrawal from the rest of the world.  At least, I should certainly hope that it was not the desire of the majority of our people when they voted on the Constitution in 1937 that we should <Col N="1290" /> withdraw from the rest of the world and regard ourselves as being above any international obligations or any obligation to maintain world peace. The sovereignty of our people is the power of the majority of our people and that means that we are sovereign and democratic and that ought to be the concept that we have of sovereignty and not the type of sterile sovereignty which imperialist races may perhaps value because of the particular pride they may have in maintaining the ancient trappings of their great power and influence.</P>
    <P>In relation to sovereignty, Brierly said also and I quote:</P>
    <P>The implications of such a theory in a world in which different States have to live in relations with one another were full of portent, for it led logically to the assertion of the complete separateness and irresponsibility of every State.  It gave the death-blow to the lingering notion that Christendom, in spite of all its quarrels, was in some sense still a unity, and left the relations between States not only uncontrolled in fact, as they had often been before, but uninspired by any unifying ideal. </P>
    <P>If we try to govern our future conduct by sterile concepts of sovereignty we will be passed by the rest of the world and as time goes on we will find that we have even less respect for ourselves.  Brierly instanced as some of the causes which have led sensible people to move away from concepts of sovereignty as:</P>
    <P>(1) The impetus to commerce and adventure caused by the discovery of America and the new route to the Indies; (2) the common intellectual background created by the Renaissance; (3) the sympathy which coreligionists in different states felt for one another, creating a loyalty which transcended the boundaries of States; and (4) the common feeling of revulsion against war, caused by the savagery with which the wars of religion were waged.  All these causes co-operated to make it certain that the state, such as the theory of sovereignty conceived it, could never in reality become the final and perfect form of human <Col N="1291" /> association, and that in the modern as in the medieval world it would be necessary to recognise the existence of a wider unity. </P>
    <P>That is the basis of the European Economic Community and of the other communities.  It is that there is something much greater than the sterile concept of sovereignty of another day and age.  Therefore, let us consider our responsibilities in this world and be glad to accept those responsibilities because in accepting them we are giving ourselves greater opportunities for a better life ahead.  It is unfortunate that the Government are not playing their part in leading our people to a proper appreciation of what membership of the European Communities really means.  During last year most of the compaign for membership had to be conducted by Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>Week after week, members of the Government have remained silent on issues affecting the Common Market except to the extent that they were forced to reply to questions in this House.  The Minister for Agriculture has shied off giving to the agricultural community proper leadership and adequate information in relation to the Common Market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the result that you now have fears growing among whole sections of the rural community, who have most to gain out of the Common Market.  Their fears have been stimulated by the campaign of the anti-marketeers.  Because of the Government's silence in the matter many people, particularly small farmers, feel that the critics are right and that the Government have no answer to them. In the industrial field, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows, in urban areas there is a growing fear as to what membership will mean in the industrial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leadership is being given again by the Fine Gael Party in an effort to convince people that not only will <Col N="1292" /> membership of the Common Market preserve their jobs, but that it will provide increased jobs in industry and that to stay outside would have the reverse effect.  But do we hear much from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this matter?  Little or nothing, except when he is pressed into answering Questions in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Government, if they want to govern, will have to give leadership to our people in this, the most significant decision which they have had to take since we achieved our independence.  If they are not prepared to give that leadership, if they are not prepared to govern, will they, for God's sake, get out of office?  As Deputy Cosgrave said this morning perhaps one of the most useful things they could do would be to get out of office before a referendum takes place so that there could be in power a government who could inspire the people into the opportunities which are ahead of them.</P>
    <P>As long as the Government continue to drag their heels in this matter there is every possibility that our people may make a decision which could have disastrous consequences for themselves, not only for this generation but for generations to come.</P>
    <P>It has been announced in the last few days that the Government are to spend money in improving Ireland's international image by engaging a firm of Swiss public relations experts.  It might be no bad thing were they to engage the same people to mount a campaign at home to create for our people a proper image of the opportunities which will be open to them in the Common Market.  Certainly, if the Government's efforts are to be confined to three miserable pamphlets issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs, then the campaign in favour of membership of the Common Market is doomed.  It reminds me of the kind of advice a solicitor gives to a client, for two reasons&mdash;(1) because he is under an obligation to warn a client of possible pitfalls (2) in order to keep himself right so that if things go wrong he will be able to say that he advised the client as to what the position was. It is not the kind of leadership one expects in the political field to be <Col N="1293" /> issuing pamphlets of a kind which might be appropriate enough as a memorandum from a junior civil servant to his senior or from a civil servant to his Minister.  If our people are to be given the kind of leadership necessary to carry them through to a successful outcome in the referendum they must be inspired and there is no inspiration forthcoming from the Government or from the publications issued from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>As far as draftsmanship in constitutional law is concerned the proposed amendment is deplorable.  A Constitution should be a statement of the fundamental law of the State, a declaration of the principles which a people believe should guide it and which should not be departed from.  It is totally foreign to constitutions to write into them specific treaties with the dates upon which they were signed. The Amendment which we have before us requires the insertion of the words:</P>
    <P>The State may become a Member of the European Coal and Steel Community (established by Treaty signed at Paris on the 18th day of April, 1951), the European Economic Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957) and the European Atomic Energy Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957). </P>
    <P>It is more like a hire purchase contract drawn up by the legal advisers of the hire purchase company than the kind of document which people can look to as an instrument expressing their noblest intellectual and moral discipline.  The Taoiseach explained this this morning as a way of limiting the effect of the proposed Amendment, that the Government wanted to make it clear that they were not asking the country to accept any responsibilities other than those that were specified in those particular treaties.  If that is the Government's intention I would regard as a necessity the attaching of an annexe to the Constitution which would contain these treaties, but to be writing in as fundamental law three treaties which are not going to be available <Col N="1294" /> in the Constitution or in any annexe to it is extremely bad draftsmanship.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Government to try to find some other formula.  Such a formula is not very difficult to find.  It is important to remember that there is no need to amend the Constitution in order for this State to become a member of these three Communities.  There is power in the Constitution for this State to sign international treaties and to be bound by them.  The necessity which arises in the amendment of the Constitution is to avoid embarrassment to ourselves which could arise if there was a conflict between interpretations of the law as given by our own courts and as given by the European institutions, and in order also to give effect in our law to laws, acts and measures of the institutions themselves.</P>
    <P>Instead of putting this amendment in the form of a resolution, because that is what it has become, asking the people to approve of something by the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, I suggest that the amendment ought to read that if the State becomes a member of an international economic community that then the provisions of that community could become part of our domestic law.  That would meet the requirement of the European institutions without specifying them in this particular way.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that these treaties are the final word or that these communities will always be exactly as they are today.  Is it going to require a referendum on every occasion that a change takes place in these treaties and in these communities?  I think it will. That is the effect of the proposed amendment.  I put that forward as an inevitable consequence of the first part of the Schedule.  If I am wrong there, and I possibly am wrong, I am only wrong because the second sentence goes too far.  The second sentence says, in effect, that, notwithstanding anything that has gone before, anything which happens subsequent in time to those treaties, because of our membership of them or related to our membership of them, becomes part of the law of this State.  This seems to amount to a repeal of the Constitution so far as anything which may be done by these <Col N="1295" /> Communities affecting this State in the future is concerned.</P>
    <P>It has taken a long time for some people to accept that membership of the European Community does not involve a qualification of our right to remain neutral even if other European countries or other member nations of the Community go to war.  Much of the trouble in relation to this issue was started by the original declaration of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, in 1961, who went to Brussels and said that Ireland was prepared to accept the defence obligations of the European Communities.  This gaffe was repeated by the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery.  It is repeated, indeed, in the Government White Paper laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in April last.  I refer to pages 7 and 8 of the paper in question, entitled Membership of the European Communities: Implications for Ireland.  It is stated on page 7:</P>
    <P>Consequently, in order to avoid the Community's achievements being threatened by the effects of enlargement, the Commission urged the strengthening of the Community institutions and also stressed &ldquo;that the cohesion and the dynamism which are indispensable for the Community depend in part on the convergence of the national policies of the member States, in particular, but not exclusively, of their foreign and defence policies.</P>
    <P>And again:</P>
    <P>The Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>meaning the Government of Ireland</P>
    <P>&mdash;have clearly indicated our acceptance of the aims of the Treaty of Rome and our readiness to join with the member States of the EEC in working towards the realisation of these aims.  It is recognised that, as the Communities evolve towards their political objectives, those participating in the new Europe thereby created must be prepared to assist, if necessary, in its defence.  As a member of the expanded Communities, Ireland would be playing her part in shaping their political <Col N="1296" /> development and, therefore, would have a voice in all the decisions to be taken in this field, as in other aspects of the Communities' activities.</P>
    <P>The amendment as drafted by the Government and submitted to us means that, as far as the Communities are concerned or the defence obligations which the Government foresee, Article 28 3.1º is repealed. That is the Article which says:</P>
    <P>War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann. </P>
    <P>In contrast with what the Government stupidly committed themselves to in last year's White Paper, we have had visits this year from the distinguished Foreign Secretary of Holland, Dr. Luns, and more recently from the distinguished Foreign Secretary of France, M. Schumann, both of whom have said quite categorically, very explicitly, without any ambiguity, that there are no commitments to defence in the European Economic Community, that, indeed, one of the reasons why Ireland would be welcomed into the European Community would be to show to the rest of Europe and the world how a neutral State could be a member of this institution. The reality of the political situation in Europe today is that the European Communities want to see a larger European Community not confined to six States or ten States but involving all the European democracies leading, one hopes, in this century, to a Europe which would involve those who are at present separated from us to the East.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more certain than that there will be no effort by the existing members of the European Community to qualify in any way Ireland's neutrality because they want to prove to Switzerland, to Sweden, to Finland, Austria, Russia and all the Warsaw Pact countries that the European Community is not a war-like instrument, that it is not designed for war, that it wants to remain at peace within itself and, being at peace within itself, at peace with the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>We have had this whole question of neutrality injected into the Irish debate <Col N="1297" /> on membership of the EEC by the Government's folly in Brussels, folly of ten years standing, which the Government have done nothing to correct, which, in fact, they only made worse by the publication of last year's paper and it is because of this folly that we consider it necessary to write in as an addendum to the proposed amendment that nothing which is done by the European Communities can in any way interfere with Article 28 3.1º of the Constitution and we will be tabling an amendment to that effect so that the matter will be beyond any doubt whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It may be that in the course of this debate, or at some other time, the Taoiseach may support our contention and accept and agree with and support what Dr. Luns and M. Schumann said, but the mischief has been created and is still being engendered and the only way of avoiding the creation or the continuance of doubts in the minds of people is to make it clear in the proposed Amendment to the Constitution that whatever about other clauses, nothing that can be done by the European institutions can take away from Dáil Éireann the sole right of determining whether or not this country goes to war and, as we are doing that, we believe it would also be wise to protect and reserve Article 15.6, so that the sole right of raising an army or of permitting an army in this country will be vested exclusively in the Oireachtas and that no military or armed force other than one raised and maintained by this Oireachtas will be permitted on our sovereign soil.</P>
    <P>This in no way conflicts with any of our obligations under the Rome Treaty. Brussels could not take exception to it even if it wanted to, because under their existing laws and regulations they could not exclude us.  That is the legal reality but the political fact is that they would not want to because they are anxious to show just how a neutral country can be a member of the EEC without having its right to remain neutral qualified in any way.</P>
    <P>Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution set out fundamental rights.  They have to some extent proved to be inadequate in protecting some of the fundamental <Col N="1298" /> rights of our people.  They are not in some respects as strong as, say, the European Convention on Human Rights, and in many respects they could be improved and I think there is now more or less common agreement, for instance, that Article 44, with its mischievous and tautological reference to the special position of the Catholic Church, could be amended without any harm to the religious beliefs of the majority of our people and with a great deal of benefit to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Articles 40 to 44, which spell out personal rights of individuals, which provide for the rights of the family, the right of education, the right to private property, and the rights given in relation to religion, could in some respects be qualified from time to time by laws, acts and measures of the European Community, if the Bill goes through in its present form.  Suppose, for instance, the European Communities were to become Communist-dominated it would be possible that in such a situation the right to private property could be abolished and unless we protect these fundamental rights in our Amendment of the Constitution, we could be in a situation in which we could be directed to abolish the right to private property.  Of course, I have no doubt that we should at that stage opt out of the Community.</P>
    <P>There are those who say that once you go in you cannot opt out but that is the kind of argument which has been advanced down through the centuries about many other agreements of an international and, indeed, national and private kind, but it has little reality in fact.  Of Course, opting out of any organisation may be very much the same as not going into it in the first instance.  You are not likely to be able to do either without consequences and if the consequences are unpleasant you may decide to go in or to stay in but to presume to suggest that everything we now do can never be qualified in the future is to advance an argument which has no reality and certainly is advancing something which is contrary to all experience in the history of mankind.</P>
    <P>While we, in Fine Gael, are certainly anxious to see worthwhile improvements <Col N="1299" /> made in fundamental rights under the Constitution, we consider that it is certainly better, until these improvements take place, to ensure in any amendment being made to the Constitution that these fundamental rights cannot in any way be affected by any rules, regulations, laws or actions of the Community.  Perhaps some lawyers will advance the argument that this would not be acceptable to the legal experts in Brussels.  I suggest that that argument is not sustainable. There is nothing in the fundamental rights clauses under our Constitution which conflicts in any way with the Rome Treaty or any of the other treaties in relation to the European institutions.</P>
    <P>In Europe, in which all the member nations of the EEC are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, most of the rights to which I refer are in the European Convention and it is highly desirable that we should make it clear that these are the fundamental rights of our society and that we will not permit them to be tampered with in any way.  It will not suffice for the Government, in their reply to this debate, to say that existing institutions do not propose to tamper with them.  If it is necessary for a national institution to have its own constitution to protect itself from possible, even if well-meaning, wrongdoing on the part of its own Government, then it becomes even more important to have similar protection in relation to foreign institutions.</P>
    <P>We would hope, therefore, that the Government would consider sympathetically the Fine Gael amendments which will be offered in the very best interests of the people, first, because we consider that these rights should be protected and reserved and not tampered with in any way and, secondly, because we believe that, unless it is made perfectly clear in the Constitution that they cannot be tampered with, many of our people will have doubts about voting for entry into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> I mentioned earlier the very bad draftsmanship.  I think it is worthy of note that no other European country which has had to amend its constitution to conform with the obligations of the European Communities found it necessary to mention the actual treaties or to specify the European Communities themselves.  This amendment includes specific treaties.  If European countries have not found it necessary to do this, why on earth have we to be the only country in Europe to indulge in this very sloppy and ill-advised draftsmanship, putting in these specific treaties when other countries have not found it necessary to do so?  I think this is simply because the Government were lazy and were not having regard to the real interests of this country or to the fact that inevitably the final word about European institutions has not yet been written and never will be written for the simple reason that the demands of mankind will continue to change from generation to generation. We consider the amendment as drafted bad law because of its vagueness and uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Fundamental law should never be vague and should never be uncertain. It should be crvstal clear so that it acts as a guideline.  To issue a blank cheque like this is to encourage legislators, even on the domestic plane, to be more careless in the future and more indifferent in the future than they have been in the past.  The Government will. I suppose, say that they have received advice from the Attorney General and other experts, that they cannot depart from that advice and that they consider it would be inadvisable to depart from it.  It is, I think, fair to say that Attorney Generals in Fianna Fáil Governments have not been renowned for their legal sagacity and it might be wise for the Government to listen to advice offered from other sources.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, have consulted several constitutional and legal experts, not only in the Party, but outside it, and we consider that the advice given to us is at least equal to, if not better than, the advice the Government have received.  It is perfectly clear that the suggestions we are making in no way conflict with our obligations under the European treaties and, at the same <Col N="1301" /> time, they protect what is worthwhile protecting in our Constitution.  On that account, I hope the Government on the next stage will see their way to accepting our amendments.</P>
    <P>It is very disappointing that we have not had any speaker from the Government side other than the Taoiseach. I see Deputy de Valera with some papers in front of him and I hope we will have the benefit of his erudition and comment because an amendment of the Constitution is one of the most important things any legislature can be called upon to do.  The Constitution is the fundamental law of the State.  It governs all our activities and determines the future pattern of our society.  If the Government have issued a directive to their members to keep quite in this debate, I think that is deplorable, and I hope there will be some on the Government side who will rebel and stand up and express their viewpoints on this very fundamental matter.  There is a majority for membership of the EEC in this House.  What is important here is to try to achieve a way of doing this acceptable to our people.  It will be acceptable only if on the face of whatever we propose the people's fundamental rights are protected and the right to remain neutral, which they cherish, will not be in any way infringed by any developments which may take place.</P>
    <P>It is an undesirable facet of modern parliaments, this parliament included, to tend to leave more and more of its legislation to other people.  In fact, you will find, if you examine some years, delegated legislation is ten times greater than the annual volume of legislation passed by this House.  What the Government are proposing in this amendment is to enlarge the amount of delegated legislation, legislation which will be exercised beyond our shores by people who are not as aware of the nuances of Irish life as are our own bureaucrats and as our own Ministers may be.  This is something that should make us pause, something that should make us be extra careful.  If we pause and consider the significance of this, then we ought to see to it that <Col N="1302" /> whatever protections we can build in are built in.  That is why we will be moving our amendments to this Bill on the Committee Stage.  We want to ensure that, as we are delegating to others our responsibilities as legislators, certain fundamental things will not be tampered with.</P>
    <P>There is need to define the limits within which this delegated legislation may operate.  We can do that only by referring to our own Constitution and we can do it in such a way as not to conflict with our obligations.  That is what we must do.  For the last few years we have been urging that there should be an all-party committee on foreign affairs.  If and when we accede to the European Communities we will be sending ten members of Oireachtas Éireann to the European parliament. I believe that even ten members will not be an adequate committee to keep this Parliament adequately advised of European developments.  As a people, we tend to be very insular.  We now find ourselves being thrown into the cold waters of Europe, many of us totally ignorant of the approach of Europeans to problems and, where we are not ignorant of that, we do not understand the problems.  Clearly, there is great need to establish, as a permanent committee of this House, a worthwhile foreign affairs committee.  If we cannot extend it to foreign affairs we can certainly extend it to a European Affairs Committee.</P>
    <P>Many members of this House, including myself, have had the privilege of being members of the Council of Europe.  Most terms of membership to the Council of Europe are for no more than two years.  In most cases members are only becoming familiar with the procedures of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe when they are replaced by new people who require two years to learn even the rudiments of procedure.  We shall have to know a great deal more about Europe in the future and we are not likely to get that knowledge unless we have a permanently sitting European Committee.  The pity is that such a committee were not set up two years ago or even earlier.  If such a committee had been sitting it would have been possible I believe to achieve a <Col N="1303" /> worthwhile amendment to the Constitution which would have provided us with the necessary limits to protect our people from abuses and at the same time one which would have carried our people gladly into the EEC.</P>
    <P>The mischievous and extensive measure which is proposed has raised so many suspicious and so many fears in the hearts of our people that a bad situation has been made worse.  The Government will certainly want to get ready to make substantial improvements in the draft if it is going to be carried in the country.  As Deputy Cosgrave said this morning, not by way of a threat but by way of a statement of fact, the referendum in relation to the amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of joining the EEC cannot be carried unless the Fine Gael Party urge their supporters to support it and the Government know that well.</P>
    <P>We want to go into Europe but we want to go in in a way that will protect our people's fundamental interests. That is not being done in this Bill, but as Deputy Cosgrave said we are not going to vote against this particular Stage because we want to make clear that we are in favour of going in, but we earnestly hope the Government will see to it that our reasoned amendments, which are carefully worded and will be tabled as soon as this Stage is complete, are carried.  We have already made inquiries and they will be acceptable to the European institutions, If they are acceptable to the European institutions and provide our people with the safeguards they want we shall see to it that they go in and we will make this whole procedure more careful and tidier.</P>
    <P>We have before us a sloppy and mischievous Bill.  It is amazing that it is so bad.  As we are ready now to give the Government assistance in drafting a worthwhile amendment to the Constitution we hope they will meet us in a generous way because only by doing so will our people's fears, which are considerable, be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan gives me the impression he is talking <Col N="1304" /> with two voices on this.  I do not think it would be very useful to follow that line.  I accept that he supports our application to join the EEC.  That being so it would be better if we considered in a more positive way the problems confronting us in this regard and how they are to be surmounted. Although the scope of this debate is wide enough to debate the whole question of the desirability of our going into Europe, if we were to broaden this debate in that way we would take away from the particular problem before us in this Bill and the referendum that will follow it.</P>
      <P>The case is overwhelmingly for joining the EEC.  We have to deal with two problems now: one is the legal problems and the other is the problem of whether this is a proper thing to put before the people at all.  I think it is right and proper that the people should be consulted on such a major move as this.  Even if there were no Constitutional legal difficulties it would be very proper to refer this type of issue to the people.  If that were the only matter it would be a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; question, but not only have we the desirability of having the people adjudicate on this very important step, we also have legal problems arising from the Constitution and these have to be provided for also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were in the same position as the British are it would not be mandatory to get the people's verdict on whether or not to go in.  There is no necessity to consult the people on whether or not we should go into the EEC because it is simply a treaty obligation and in the ordinary course of treaty negotiation as between sovereign States the Government would be perfectly competent to contract into the Treaty of Rome.  The anomaly arises from the fact that from the point of view of joining in the union there is no necessity to have a referendum, and in fact it would be equally open to us to do what the British are doing through their Parliament, but then paradoxically we are forced to have a referendum because of consequential legal complications with our written Constitution. It is very important that the fact be grasped that in order to contract to <Col N="1305" /> go in there is no legal or Constitutional necessity to have a referendum but in order to avoid legal embarrassment and difficulty and contradiction afterwards it is necessary to have a referendum to deal with details.  That appears to me to be the factual position.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the House will subscribe to the proposition that whether or not it is competent for us to go in it is desirable to consult the people and give them the choice of saying, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the project it being one of such importance and that is what is being done here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of contracting in, the referendum is not necessary although it is desirable, but on the question of the necessary amendments to the Constitution we must have a referendum.  It would be extremely difficult to foresee and to deal with every point that could arise in advance as between the interpretation of the Treaty of Rome and its consequences and the interpretation of our Constitution and its statutory consequences over the years.  This is the problem with which we are faced.  We wish to give the people an opportunity through a referendum to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; but we have to provide against foreseen and possibly unforeseen legal difficulties after the fact.  How is that to be done?  As I say, I detected a certain duality of thought in Deputy Ryan's approach to this matter.  It cannot be done by trying to anticipate all the conflicts between the Treaty of Rome, the other documents concerned, our Constitution and our domestic law.</P>
    <P>Every lawyer knows that any attempt of that nature will almost inevitably result in conflict.  Apart from this, what sort of jumble would you be presenting to the electorate?  You cannot ask them to adjudicate on fine points of law.  Therefore, it is ridiculous, and I use the word designedly, to suggest that you can enumerate or tabulate the various points where you perceive that amendment and adjustment are necessary and at the same time hope to stop all the holes and avoid conflict in the future.  That would be not only practically impossible but it would be most confusing to the voters.</P>
    <P>We must therefore approach the <Col N="1306" /> matter from the point of view of how you can have a covering clause sufficiently wide to meet the requirements and not so wide as to blot out the practical effects of our constitution.  To some extent, I share the fears of Deputy Ryan that a general amendment like this could be too wide. These are the two problems: the first is to put the matter in such a form that the people can honestly answer with certainty, yes or no; secondly, the form must be such that it is wide enough to do the job but not so wide as to obliterate our Constitution.</P>
    <P>That is the problem facing the draftsman in the first instance, facing the Government and facing us now. Obviously, from the point of view of simplicity and directness, to give the voters the opportunity to which they are entitled of replying yes or no, the questions must be short and must be, in effect, one question.  It is extremely difficult to frame one question without making it too wide but, as the Taoiseach pointed out, it is limited by the specification of the documents named here and the second part of it is wide enough to cover the requirements.</P>
    <P>I fear I was not quick enough to take a note of Deputy Ryan's various dictionary references but he can correct me if I go wrong.  He began with the Oxford Dictionary in which the word &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; was in his opinion so wide that anything done in point of time after the passing of this Bill, presumably, and the Treaty of Rome, would be ratified and enabled by this Amendment.  He then went on to Webster which, I think, trimmed his sails a little.  I did not quite get the reference to Fowler but I do not think I am doing the Deputy any injustice when I say that he was arguing that the word &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; was too wide and that it simply meant consequent in time.  I am not controverting that: my attitude is that the Deputy may, or may not, have a point but this is surely a matter for amendment in Committee. It is very easy to amend the draft by some such phrase as &ldquo;consequent and arising out of&rdquo;.  I do not suggest that as a formal amendment.  Surely Deputy Ryan's point is essentially a Committee Stage point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> Next, I find Deputy Ryan cavilling at the mentioning of the Treaties in the earlier part of the Bill.  As a lawyer or ex-lawyer I have a certain sympathy with his approach, but seriously I do not think it is necessary to schedule such a notorious&mdash;using the word in its best sense&mdash;document, such a public and formal document as the Treaty of Rome and the other Treaties referred to.  They are at least as publicly advertised and on record as firmly as our own Constitution.  The Treaty of Rome, in effect, is the constitution of the Common Market.  I do not think a cross reference to constitutions is objectionable and I disagree with Deputy Ryan in his suggestion that this is sloppy drafting.  It is not; but I think it is a very definite limitation as the Taoiseach pointed out.</P>
    <P>It must be an omnibus clause to make sense in a referendum and cover adequately all contingencies when dealing with such documents as the Treaty of Rome, on one hand, and our Constitution and domestic law on the other. The danger with all omnibus clauses is that they will be too wide, as the Deputy pointed out.  Therefore, they must be limited and there is a limitation here.  Reserving to myself the possibility of agreeing with Deputy Ryan that perhaps an amendment in regard to the word &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; or some addition to it might be desirable, leaving that open, a very definite limitation to the Treaty of Rome and to the Common Market as it is, is desirable.</P>
    <P>There are two schools of thought about that.  Both become confused in the people who are seriously interested in the future of Europe and European countries.  The first school consists of those who regard EEC as the Common Market, as an economic treaty or alliance, and who are content with that.  There are others who regard it and regard the Treaty of Rome&mdash;with good grounds&mdash;as merely a stage in the development of some kind of federation or confederation of the states of Europe.  But for our purposes it is important that we should keep our feet on the ground at this point and realise what we are&mdash;public representatives recommending this move to our <Col N="1308" /> people: it is the people themselves who choose; we only recommend.  It is important to realise that we are proposing joining the Common Market, the existing European Community which will automatically enlarge with the accession of other States but that the terms are still quite restricted and limited and, as Deputy Ryan rightly said, have nothing to do with such matters as Defence.  That is the situation we are dealing with, not with the long-term aspirations of those who have such aspirations, for the longterm development that some people may foresee.  That is all right but it is another step of the road, and I for one will not baulk at the proposition that that step might need another referendum, and I might even go so far as to say that that step should, indeed, need another referendum.  But it is highly important for us to realise that we are acceding to something definite, something specific, that it is not necessary at this stage to commit oneself further as some other people might wish to commit themselves, that we are dealing with a highly organised and limited existing Community which will remain organised and limited and restricted by its own Constitution, namely, the Constitution which is embodied in these documents, and expanded by the regulations and decisions, and so forth, of the bodies set up thereunder.  It is important to realise this because there is no question whatever of simply abandoning sovereignty and just going into a super-state.</P>
    <P>For those people who are rather fond of arguing that we will lose sovereignty and so forth, I would like to offer a few reflections.  If one thinks of France, Germany, Italy, Belgium&mdash;the states which first went in and formed the Six&mdash;if one looks at how jealous and how careful they were of their own sovereignty and rights, the great care and detail, the great mechanics necessary to enable them to come together, the detailed working out and the care that had to be taken to frame this Treaty of Rome and the other documents involved, one sees that the whole thing is characterised completely by what I might call the sovereignty and integrity of the individual contracting states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> This European Community so far, and at the stage we are considering it, is by no means emerging into a superstate. It is an economic alliance, with the hope of further co-operation, I grant you, and that hope is not to be limited, or rather, if anyone were to attempt to limit it now and give specific undertakings on that, it would perhaps be going too far, but the specific thing that can be said is that there is as definite a Constitution for this body with which it is proposed to contract, as there is in our own domestic law.</P>
    <P>Talking about it as an economic alliance, this State, if it does accede and go in, will have its voice and representation in it.  I do not want, when I say that it is merely an economic alliance, to suggest for a moment that there will not be a certain subordination to the central organs of their Community, but this is necessary for organisation.  This is in order to make the thing work at all, from a customs union upwards, but for those who fear a run too fast on the road towards total integrity, it is interesting to look at the progress, say, in monetary policy.  In reality, the serious student of this problem will sometimes feel more a sense of depression at the internal frictions that prevent the full development of the existing provisions and the Treaty of Rome as it is rather than that there should be fear that it is going to swallow all and sundry all too quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I have wandered in dealing with that because, strictly speaking, it is relevant to discuss whether we should or should not go into the Community.  For my own part &mdash;I happen to be chairman of the committee of our party who studied this solidly and carefully for a large number of months and my own personal conclusion, talking as a Deputy here, is that the best thing for the people of this country would be to enter Europe, to enter this Community. There are very good and firm reasons for that course, but if you look at the negative side, the consequences of staying out, in the environment which is about to form around us, with Britain and other countries joining the Six, it would be extremely difficult for this country to survive at all with any <Col N="1310" /> adequate standards of living, on the purely economic side&mdash;any standard of living&mdash;so that whether one takes it from the positive or the negative side &mdash;we will have ample opportunity of debating the pros and cons from this out&mdash;I for one have come to the conclusion that not only would it be the right thing for us to do but it would be the best thing for us to do, and that if we are prepared in this country to grasp our opportunities, real opportunities are there.</P>
    <P>To get more specifically to Deputy Ryan's criticism in so far as the wording of the latter part is concerned, as I said already, it is a Committee matter but he can hardly object to the limitation which is put into the first part.  I think it would be totally wrong not to limit it, and indeed, though I do not know what the professional lawyers will say about this, the word &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; as it stands, I do believe might possibly take a little amplification. Quite apart from the legal necessities for a referendum, it is only right that the people should have a chance of giving a straight yes or no and this gives them the opportunity of doing this.  It is a simple thing which says that the State may become a member, may go in or may not go in.  That is the issue in a sense for the electorate and that obviously should be contained in the fewest words possible in the interests of the voter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the necessity for the other part, I want to deal in a little more detail with the suggestion that one can deal with every possible contingency at this stage.  I have already said that, to my mind, that is not practical, but perhaps since I suppose we may hear a good deal of particular sections and things, it might be well to itemise, as to some extent the Taoiseach has done already, some of the constitutional or legal points that appear to have arisen here, but before doing that let me point out once again the problem is not that the Constitution in any way hinders or in any way restricts our contracting into this union of Europe, into the European Economic Community.  It does not restrict in any way except that because of certain prohibitions there will be ambiguity <Col N="1311" /> and conflict between the provisions of the constitution, as I call it, of the Community and the provisions of our own Constitution.  They are largely legal points, mainly referring to matters in which the courts are concerned. That should be clearly understood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned a few Articles of the Constitution.  We have heard some talk about Article 5 which states that Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State.  That situation is not in any way affected by our entering this Community.  If Britain goes in, will she become any less a sovereign independent State than she is?  Is France any less a sovereign independent State in this association than she has always been?  Is Germany? Is Belgium?  Is Luxembourg? Is Holland?  There is confusion here. Your sovereignty should not be confused with your power to contract, and your power to contract is part of your sovereignty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In my humble opinion that provision does not need any amendment whatsoever.  Ireland is a sovereign, independent and democratic State and in the proper interpretation of the term remains so.  What we are doing is contracting as such into an association.  Everyone who goes into an organisation binds himself to some extent.  We who go into political parties bind ourselves to some extent. We do not lose our personal sovereignty in doing that.  There is a confusion here and it is as well to remove it at the beginning.  In the proper interpretation we will be as we were at the beginning.  As I pointed out earlier, a later fusion or a growth of Europe at any other stage is a different matter which is not at issue at the moment.  That is my opinion about that Article.</P>
      <P>Having said that about that Article there is a problem to be dealt with. Article 6.2 provides:</P>
      <P>These powers of government are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> You could work within the terms of that if you were to work a legal fiction. I do not think there is any great advantage in doing that.  In the referendum any difficulty that could arise under that would be obviated.  Article 15.2, which vests the sole power of making laws in this body, could also be circumvented by a fiction.  It would always be possible to bring back any Common Market legislation and pass it here as our own.  That would comply in legal terms, perhaps.  I do not see that there is anything to commend such a course.  There is the fruit of possible conflict in actual legal cases in provisions of that nature.  Although Article 5, in my opinion, requires no amendment whatsoever, Article 6.2 and Article 15.2 in the opinion of any reasonable man would probably need adjustment.</P>
    <P>There is a greater difficulty than that and it arises out of the provisions of the Treaty establishing the Common Market.  Article 164 provides that the Court of Justice shall ensure observance of law and justice in the interpretation of the Treaty.  Article 173 gives power of appeal to the European Court of Justice which is solely concerned with matters arising out of the Treaty. Nevertheless, those powers of appeal are given there.  Article 177 gives that court the power to interpret.  Article 228 provides that certain agreements are binding on member States.  It is mainly in this area that the conflict arises.  It arises mainly out of such provisions which specify the powers of the Supreme Court and those which specify the powers of this House in regard to agreements involving public funds.  It is in regard to these matters that amendment is needed.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis as far as one can foresee, it is actually on some such questions of detail that the legal necessity for a referendum on an amendment to the Constitution arises.  Such questions as conflict about our Constitution saying that the Supreme Court here is the final court of appeal and having a court which, albeit restricted to the matters concerning the Community and not having a universal jurisdiction like the Supreme Court here, but restricted to what concerns the Treaty, <Col N="1313" /> nevertheless that court having final powers of interpretation and provisions for appeal to it, brings up a conflict between the two in contemplation of law.  In practice there might be a difficulty too.  So, obviously, if you are to have one Community and one judicial body which will interpret the Treaty and the matters affecting the Community as a whole without going into a matter of domestic law which is a question for the member States themselves, that court must be the final court.  It is because of that kind of conflict that there must be an amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that if you take, on the one hand, in summary, the Articles of the Treaty, Articles 164, 173, 177 and 228 and on the other hand the provisions of our Constitution, Articles 6.2, 15.2, 34 and 29, you have the seeds of conflict in interpretation and, more specifically, a national, or any person, or any body corporate, can appeal to the European Court.  When all is said and done these are really small matters of detail.  These are matters which will not actually go very deeply into the working of the Community in its broader sense.  They are matters which require a referendum. The corollary to that is this.  I have specifically mentioned those Articles but not lawyer will be brave enough to say that any enumeration like that will be exhaustive.  Let a case arise and the opportunities for conflict will present themselves in very many unforeseen ways.  Therefore, the impracticality of scheduling all the necessary amendments and the responsibility of foreseeing the type of case that might arise such as the one to which I referred precludes anybody from attempting to deal with this matter in the nature of a schedule, apart altogether from the fact that the people should be given a simple question to answer.</P>
    <P>This is not the time to go into further detail on the wording.  There will be an opportunity for that on Committee Stage and these other points, too, can be discussed further then.  In so far as it is necessary to restrict the amendment to the specific purposes for which it is required and, at the same time, to have it wide enough to capture consequential details of the nature I have <Col N="1314" /> indicated in a brief reference to these Articles, there must be an amendment of sufficient breadth.  This is a matter for the ingenuity of lawyers or, indeed, for the ingenuity of this House on Committee Stage but there is very little room for arguing as to the principle of how the matter should be approached.  I do not think anybody would cavil with the proposition that this is predominantly a subject on which the people should have the opportunity of deciding.</P>

      <P>I cannot help remarking that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was quoted recently as saying that there was available to the public too much information on the EEC and that this issue would be decided on political lines.  Obviously, this is the thinking behind the Bill.  Possibly, I am yet sufficiently new to the Dáil to believe that when an issue is to be decided by the direct vote of the people, democracy requires that they be given the fullest information possible and that this information should not be biased.  I believe that to ask them to enact a Bill which involves substantial changes in the Constitution but which does not disclose what these changes are is an insult to their intelligence and to the status conferred on them by the provisions of the Constitution in so far as changes can be made only by the people voting in a referendum.  As I see it, this means that we, who are the people's delegates on a temporary basis, are not trusted as being competent to make changes in the basic law of the State.  The people have reserved this very important function for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, presumably, speaks for the Government, does not seem to think that this particular provision is a wise one since he believes that the public should not have too much information on the matter.  I think the provision is a wise one.  Twice already the people have decided that a proposal to amend <Col N="1315" /> the Constitution which was put forward by the Government Party of which, at the time, I was a Member, was not acceptable to them.  Like all members of Fianna Fáil at the time, I regretted the decision that was made but it must be admitted that since the Constitution is the people's defence against possible errors of democracy, it is only right that such decisions should be made by the people.  Perhaps if, on the other two occasions, it had been possible to conceal by a stratagem the actual changes to be made in the Constitution, the result might have been different.  It is vital that the issues involved in a referendum be understood clearly by the people.  Consequently, the terms of the Bill should be simple.  The terms of this Bill are simple but it is my opinion that they are unduly simple.  Surely Members of the Dáil are entitled to have at least the promised White Paper before being asked to vote on this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is undemocratic to expect either the Dáil or the people to enact a Bill which does not set out what the Bill intends to do.  It is known that there are a number of Articles in the Constitution which render it illegal for this country to join the EEC.  Therefore, the only honest thing to do would be to identify these Articles in the Bill and set out the changes that are required for accession to the EEC.  What have the Government to hide?  It is because the people decided against the Government on two former occasions that they are now considered to be incompetent to decide in a responsible way, matters which the Constitution requires them to decide.  Maybe the Government will keep their promise and make available the White Paper before the date of the referendum and it may be that this White Paper will set out the amendments which the Bill will make surreptitiously to the Constitution but the people's role, in effect, is to have this Bill enacted.  Therefore, the Bill which they are expected to approve should indicate exactly what the Bill intends but this Bill does not do that.  It conceals it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was right in his statement that this matter should be decided on the basis of political allegiance in so <Col N="1316" /> far as this House is concerned but, of course, the people are not subject to a Party Whip or to a roll call vote or to the threat of a general election.  Such threat does not intimidate them.  The Constitution still provides for a secret ballot and the courts have decided recently that the safeguards for secrecy should be strengthened further.  I do not intend to decide finally what will be my attitude to our proposed accession to the EEC until after the White Paper becomes available.  My vote on this Bill will not commit me one way or another.  To me the Bill appears to be an insult and an attempted confidence trick on the public.  Before they vote, the people must know exactly which Articles of their Constitution they are being asked to amend.  They must know that each of these Articles not included in this referendum will continue to remain part of their bill of rights.  It will not be sufficient for the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers to mention in the House or elsewhere what changes are required.  The only way in which the people can know for certain for what they are being asked to vote is by putting the changes specifically into the Bill so that anything not mentioned is not intended to be done.</P>
    <P>If we join the European Communities we will have to accept the fact that some powers reserved previously to Government, Parliament and the courts, will be exercised by Community institutions. It took us so long to establish our sovereignty over part of our country and we have enjoyed it for such a short period that, instinctively, I do not think there are many of us who would like to surrender any part of it. At the same time, provided I am sure, and I think it is the responsibility of every person here to be sure, that the benefits to the country justify it and that the possible implications are not prejudicial to the long-term interests of the people, I would be prepared to agree that we should accept the same limitations on our absolute sovereignty that other nations have accepted.  If I know what these changes are, I am prepared to consider them.  Something that comes to my mind is that four years ago the all-party Committee on the Constitution recommended the deletion of <Col N="1317" /> Article 3 and its substitution by a new Article which would repeal the claim made by the people of the right to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of the country.</P>

      <P>No apology needed.  I want to know are these two Articles to be affected by this Bill.  There is no way I can be sure they are not affected unless the specific Articles requiring amendment are included in the Bill and Articles 2 and 3 are omitted.  For the record of the House I shall quote Articles 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>Article 2 is:</P>
      <P>The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.</P>
      <P>Article 3 is:</P>
      <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory, and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, the laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstat Éireann and the like extra-territorial effect. </P>
      <P>The Bill mentions that two of the Communities which it is proposed to join were established by the Treaty of Rome.  To the best of my knowledge the Treaty of Rome implicitly provides for the acceptance of existing boundaries by the member States.</P>
      <P>The proposed new subsection of section 4 of Article 29 does not say anything about accepting provisions of the Treaty of Rome.  It says that the State may become a member of these Communities, two of which were established by the Treaty of Rome.  To my untutored mind, this appears to mean that to join the Communities the Treaty must be accepted and that therefore the assertion of the fundamental right of the people to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of the national territory is automatically rendered inoperative by the enactment of this new subsection unless something definite is done to make it clear that this is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that an Act of the <Col N="1319" /> Oireachtas, ratifying the Boundary Agreement which was superseded when the people enacted these two Articles of the Constitution, is still on the Statute Book.  Therefore, if Article 3 is removed or underhandedly rendered ineffective we revert to the position of the partition of this country and the continued coercion of part of it into the United Kingdom being accepted by this State.  I should like to be assured that this is not being done by this Bill. At present I think it is.</P>
    <P>The second sentence of the proposed new subsection reads:</P>
    <P>No provisions of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State. </P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the possible hidden implications of the first sentence I am concerned with the wording of this second sentence.  Do we, consequent on membership of the Communities, perform the act of renouncing this historic national claim to the integrity of Ireland?  Do we adopt the measure of re-enacting the acceptance of partition and if so why are the Government afraid to ask the people to do this act and adopt this measure, undoing what a previous Fianna Fáil Government asked them to do in the less enlightened days of 1937?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power was quoted some time ago as saying that Fianna Fáil have now become &ldquo;mature and responsible Republicans&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Are the Government afraid that the people in general have <Col N="1320" /> not made the same progress towards maturity and responsibility as the Fianna Fáil Party and are they afraid that they might still be so immature and irresponsible as to believe in the fundamental unity of their country?  We have been given to understand that there is some great urgency about passing this Bill and that the Government could not even wait until the White Paper was available.  Do the Government really expect that the matter of the referendum Bill will be decided so quickly?  Do they not anticipate a long struggle in the law courts about whether or not this Bill complies with the provisions of the Constitution in regard to amendments.  It seems to me inevitable that this will be challenged.</P>
      <P>Article 46, section 1 reads:</P>
      <P>Any provision of this Constitution may be amended, whether by way of variation, addition, or repeal, in the manner provided by this Article. </P>
      <P>This Bill proposes an addition to Article 29 but in doing so it sets out in fact to amend an unknown number of Articles which are not specified. These are not being amended by variation, addition or repeal.  They are being left untouched.  The people are not asked to make any variation in them; they are not asked to add to them and they are not asked to repeal.  A fraudulent attempt is being made to get the people to amend Articles in their Constitution by means of an addition to another Article.  I suggest this is not legal.  I suggest that the Constitution provides for the amendment of any provision by variation, addition or repeal of that provision and that therefore Article 3, Article 5, Article 6, Article 15 or any of the Articles that will be affected by our entry can only be amended by being varied, added to or repealed.  If any or all of these Articles or other Articles need to be amended or repealed before we join the European Community, fair play and honesty require that the voters, who are the only authority who can do this, should know exactly what they are being asked to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Constitution also requires that they be asked to amend individually each Article involved and I would be surprised if an effort is not <Col N="1321" /> made to establish this in the courts, unless the Government change their mind and deal with the people in this important matter in a proper democratic manner.</P>
    <P>I would vote against this Bill in any case as a matter of principle because it is a mean and shabby trick and an insult to voters but my opposition is ensured by my near certainty that the purpose of the trick is to circumvent Articles of the Constitution in an underhand way.  I intend on Committee Stage to put down certain amendments designed to safeguard Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  If these are accepted I will make up my mind, as others will, on the EEC when the White Paper is published, and not until then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into this House in 1954, I wondered for the first few months and have continued to wonder, about two things.  One was the rapidity with which people would say rude, unkind things to each other, personal insults, and follow them up as if it was an every-day occurrence and not the least remarkable.  The second thing was the way in which people who should know better made statements which either they must know were wrong and could not substantiate or, alternatively, did not understand.</P>
      <P>Having listened to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil spokesmen here today I have come to the conclusion that the second alternative applies to them because some of the statements made by the Taoiseach on this Bill this morning and statements made afterwards by one or two Fine Gael spokesmen seemed to suggest that either they were so naive as to imagine certain things could not happen or, alternatively, that they just did not understand.  They are intelligent men, practising politicians for many years; therefore, we must take it that they did understand.  The assumption, therefore, is that they have some blind spot in their make-up which does not allow them to recognise certain danger signals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed to hear a Fine Gael spokesman talking about not opposing the Bill at this Stage and about introducing amendments later, not opposing <Col N="1322" /> it at this Stage in order to establish the fact that they were in favour of going into Europe, as if that were the issue on which we are voting here tonight. In fact, that is not the issue. As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, we are opposed to entry to the EEC and particularly opposed to it on the terms being negotiated and we do not think it is a good deal and we propose to deal with that in our own way.  But, whether we were opposed to it or not, we were obliged to take the action which was taken with regard to this Bill.  I am surprised at Fine Gael not taking the same line of action, not because we have taken it, but because of the fact that they must recognise, as we do, and as Deputy Sherwin has indicated he does, that this is a disgraceful document to put before the Members of the House who are supposed to be intelligent politicians.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back on one thing Deputy Sherwin said and to clear up a matter because there has been a repetition of something today by at least two people.  There were no recommendations, as such, made by the All-Party Constitution Committee. There were no recommendations and the agreement on which the Committee was set up was that, no matter what was discussed, when the report came out anything in that report would not be binding on any party not even on those who had been discussing the various items.  The report, therefore, merely stated factually how the Committee viewed matters and the fact that five members saw a matter one way and one person saw it another way meant that the two points of view were written into the report and no effort was made to influence the Dáil, The report was merely to show what the members of the committee considered to be the facts.</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, took advantage of that subsequently and introduced an amendment which was not even mentioned in the report except that the report said that we were against it.  I refer to the question of the single-seat controversy.</P>
    <P>I wanted to clarify that matter because I interrupted Deputy Sherwin <Col N="1323" /> when he was speaking, which I should not have done, but I did so because he was repeating something which he will find, if he looks back on it, was not a recommendation.  I want to be very definite about that because there were a number of views stated in the report with which I would not agree under any circumstances.  Because of the terms of reference, I had to agree that members were entitled to state them in the report.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, we have heard from numerous members of the Government and numerous speakers on behalf of Fianna Fáil all over the country and on at least three occasions from the Taoiseach himself about the necessity to have a clear-cut vote, that under no circumstances could anything be allowed to appear on the voting paper which would make the matter so complicated that people would not understand it.  The Taoiseach kept repeating that, for that reason, the referendum, when it would take place, should be on a clear-cut issue and that there should be no question of anybody being asked to vote on an issue they did not understand. It was suggested at one time that perhaps we should wait for the local elections or, perhaps, a general election &mdash;even a presidential election was mentioned. All these suggestions were thrown overboard and the Taoiseach finally stated here that so far as he and the Government were concerned it would be a clearcut vote and therefore it would be on a simple issue.</P>
    <P>So, we started off with this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971.  The first thing that we thought rather peculiar about it was that it was being introduced with what can only be described as indecent haste because it was introduced before the White Paper on the negotiations with the EEC will be printed or put before the country.  Straight off the reel, we can accuse the Government of attempting to make the Members of this House and the electorate buy a pig in a poke.  In fact, sections 1 and 2 and the Schedule are quite short, apparently in order to give the impression that the Bill is a simple one.  Does anybody in this House consider that the ordinary voter, who has not had a chance to <Col N="1324" /> follow the EEC negotiations, who, unlike the Members of this House, has not been able to know what was happening right along the way, would know what he was voting for when he would see on the ballot paper the following:</P>
    <P>3º The State may become a member of the European Coal and Steel Community (established by Treaty signed at Paris on the 18th day of April, 1951), the European Economic Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957) and the European Atomic Energy Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957).  No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State. </P>
    <P>Is it seriously suggested by the Government that that is a simple, straight-forward matter which everybody on reading it will understand and will have no difficulty in making up his mind as to how to vote on it?  Is it not true that many of the voters will have learned for the first time, when they read that provision, that there are three Communities involved, that they will not know what the whole thing is about and will feel, as they are entitled to feel, that the Government and this House are trying to cod them?</P>
    <P>In my opinion, this section, which is to amend Article 29 of the Constitution is in much the same line as that which was introduced under Article 28.  If my memory serves me correctly, Article 28 is the one under which the Offences Against the State Act was passed many years ago, with this difference: when the Offences Against the State Act was passed, it was passed within the five years laid down, the five years during which the Oireachtas was entitled to amend the Constitution. I believe that, had it been otherwise, it would not have been possible to get that sort of thing through without a referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> There is one rather peculiar thing which Deputy Cosgrave was, I think, going to mention but he either did not notice it or else he decided it would weaken his own argument and he did not proceed with it.  In Article 28 of the Constitution it is laid down that certain things can be done, but that they cannot be done if there is a state of war or a state of emergency.  I do not know whether or not many people are aware of the fact, but we are still in this country in a state of emergency. I would seriously suggest to the House that the Government or the Oireachtas has no right to suggest such an amendment to the Constitution while a state of emergency exists.  This is something which will have to be considered because the Article says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion, or to nullify any act done or purporting to be done in time of war or armed rebellion in pursuance of any such law. </P>
    <P>The fact is the national emergency is still in operation.  As far as I can see, the position seems to be that we cannot, being still in a state of emergency, enact a law which does what is suggested in this Constitution Amendment Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have the rather peculiar position about defence. On more than one occasion the Taoisigh&mdash;first of all, the late Deputy Seán Lemass and then Deputy Jack Lynch&mdash;have referred to the fact that we are prepared to take our part in the defence of Europe.  As a matter of fact.  I think it was Deputy Lynch, coming out from a meeting in Paris, who commented to a reporter that a Europe worth joining was a Europe worth defending.  This has since been repeated at least once in this House by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs.  For the Taoiseach then to come along and, in his speech this morning, try to make out that we were raising a bogey about defence and that, in fact, there is no reference whatever in the Common Market, either in the <Col N="1326" /> Treaty of Rome or the Treaty of Paris, which suggests that defence is to be part of the responsibility of any of the countries that join, or, in fact, that they have a political or a defence commitment of any kind, is just not accurate.  He was followed by Deputy Cosgrave who agreed with him and said that while, in fact, defence could be mentioned, at the same time we just would not take it; we would not take part in defence and, for that reason, nobody could make us.  The suggestion was that, if we were dissatisfied with what was being done and, having gone into Europe with the EEC, we found out they proposed the setting up of an army to take part in wars against some other organisation, possibly America, maybe China or Russia&mdash;we do not know&mdash;we could say: &ldquo;Oh, no. We are not playing any longer.  Let the children play in the backyard.  We are going home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are they really serious?  Was the Taoiseach or Deputy Cosgrave serious when they asked the House to accept that?  Is it not a fact that, if we go into Europe and if we set up the necessary machinery to take part in the EEC, then we are in it whether we like it or not and we just cannot walk out.  It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that we can at that stage decide we are no longer interested in the game because the rules are being changed and we are going to get out.  Maybe, as some people said, it would be ruin to stay out.  It would definitely be ruin if we went in and then had to come out.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of the situation which appears to have been arrived at with regard to the fisheries problem where the Minister for Foreign Affairs is alleged to have suggested that, if we could not reach agreement with the EEC on terms, then the best thing to do would be to sign the agreement, go in and, when we were inside, try to re-negotiate.  The only strength we have&mdash;I know this as a trade union official&mdash;and the only way in which we can negotiate is when we have something to offer.  We will have nothing to offer if we are inside.  We will be stuck with it and that is it.</P>
    <P>With regard to defence, I most certainly would not like to see any of <Col N="1327" /> my constituents' sons or daughters&mdash; it seems to be popular now to have female units in modern armies&mdash;being recruited for the purpose of defending the mainland of Europe.  I do not think it is right that we should be put in that position and I believe that, if we do require an army for that reason, in fact if we require an army for nearly any reason, it will mean conscription and we all know what the Irish people think of conscription.  It is no use trying to gloss over this in this House. It is no use saying this may not happen. Out of the mouths of Fianna Fáil speakers, the Government speakers, we have it that part and parcel of the plans for the future of the EEC is political union and the defence of Europe, and you cannot get away from it.</P>

      <P>We thought so too and we thought it might be a good way of <Col N="1328" /> testing people who wanted to change the Government but we found Fine Gael were not very anxious to do that. I would say the same to Fine Gael as I would say to the super-republicans of Fianna Fáil, this is something which proposes to take away from the Government their right of sovereignty.  I was rather amused at Deputy Ryan's reference to sovereignty.  I shall deal with that in a moment.  If they wanted to strike a blow for the right of this country to remain as a nation they were getting an opportunity to do so. Fine Gael have said they are not prepared to vote with us on this.  I shall be very interested to see on which side the super-republicans go when the division bells ring, but perhaps they will have urgent appointments as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan said that &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; was a modern word and it did not mean anything anyway.  He said it was first used in the 16th century. I do not know whether he remembers that far back but I do not.  He thought it was a rather dirty word and one of which we should not be very proud. He thumped the table as he finished up, saying that the Irish Army should not be involved in anything except defending our own sovereign State.</P>

      <P>An empty formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;empty formula&rdquo; are very sore words; we heard of one before which cost the nation a great deal.  Deputy Keating <Col N="1329" /> and Deputy Thornley queried whether it would stand up in law.  It was suggested that perhaps the President, who is the father of this Constitution, might have it tested.  I agree with this suggestion but I have been refreshing my memory on the Constitution since and I see that while the architects wrote into the Constitution that the President has the right to refer Bills to the High Court before he signs them to find out whether or not they conform with the Constitution, there are two which he cannot refer to the High Court, one is a Money Bill and the other is a Bill to amend the Constitution.  It seems that particular gap is blocked too.</P>
      <P>I should like to know, and whoever is replying for the Government might enlighten me, if this Bill is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President, have we then the right to appeal to the High Court for a ruling on it?  It appears that we cannot do so.  If we can do so, is it not a fact that we cannot take any of the things which the Government decide to do, on the plea that it is necessary for them to conform with the EEC, to the High Court because they are covered by this petty little bit of legislation which is before the House at present?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, has been using a theme which apparently he thinks is going down well in the country and possibly it would go down well if it was not commented on, which is that if we go into the EEC the Border will go.  This is one of the half-truths which the present regime are expert at putting across.  It is true that the customs border will go if we go into the EEC but it is not true that the Border between North and South will go as such.  Britain will still claim the Six Counties and continue to control them and according to the Treaty of Rome it will remain so forever because political boundaries will stay.  I should be grateful if Deputy Colley and his colleagues will add that piece of information next time they feel like trotting out the story that the Border will go if we enter the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of the amendment to the Constitution seems to be based on the idea that if a confusing line can be put in and the people are <Col N="1330" /> asked to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; on it although they do not understand it, they may be persuaded for the first time to vote in favour of what the Government want.  Deputy Cosgrave said today that the Government should remember that they could not win the referendum without Fine Gael's support. That struck me as a little bit odd because if the people who criticise the Government so loudly outside this House and the Fine Gael Party voted with the Labour Party on their amendment to the Second Reading of this Bill, it would not be necessary to take this particular matter to the country as it is because the Government would no longer be the Government of the country.</P>
    <P>If Fine Gael are really serious about this the obvious thing to do is to throw out this stupid mean little suggestion which the Government have put in and introduce instead a reasonable proposal to amend the Constitution setting out first, whether or not people are in favour of going into the EEC, and second which Articles of the Constitution will have to be amended in order to do it.  They should also show what the effect of such an amendment will be.  Do not let anybody tell me it would take up too much time; do not let anybody tell me it would not be possible to devise a way of doing it; it could be done and it should be done. If we are really serious about treating the voters as reasonable adults this must be done.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that those who are opposing these proposals are opposing them because they do not want the matter to go before the country has been made.  As far as we are concerned we would welcome the decision being taken by the voters but we will only do so when we know what the facts are and when the people who will be voting on it will know what the facts are.  It is significant that no effort has been made by the Government to produce the White Paper showing what the proposals are before we go into the EEC.  Listening to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the other day one would get the impression that as far as farming here is concerned this is a land flowing with milk and honey <Col N="1331" /> and yet we were very anxious to go into the EEC.  If we go a little bit further farmers will not need to get up at all when we go into the EEC, the money will be put through their windows and they can stay in bed.</P>
    <P>When asked about the position of unemployment the Minister for Finance's attitude was that we should count those who have additional jobs in industry but we should not count those who have lost their jobs in agriculture. So, as far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, agriculture is not really important; farmers are doing very well and he proposes to help them to do better.  Yet, they are negotiating to get into EEC although it is admitted that the only reason why the dairying industry is doing well in EEC now is that 12 months ago one million tons of butter was made to disappear by turning it into chemicals and other things, thereby creating an artificial demand for milk and milk products. Dr. Mansholt held out by putting a subsidy on the slaughter of cows. Fianna Fáil, in their day, only succeeded in slaughtering calves; I suppose they will grow up when we are in the EEC and arrange to have the cows slaughtered also.  If you cut down the means of production there will, of course, be an artificial scarcity.  For how long can this go on?</P>
    <P>We also had the report made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the improvements in income which will come to the beef farmer.  He repeats it again and again that it is the beef farmer, the man producing the beast, the big man, who will do well.  Many of us deal far more with the little men, who have very little except what they can earn by the sweat of their brow and we should like to know what they will get out of it.  It does not appear that they will get very much.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish asked yesterday: what will happen our protected industries? They have not much protection now but in view of the fact that when the chilly winds of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement were able to bring so many of them to the wall, what will happen when the full brunt of European competition hits them in the absence <Col N="1332" /> of any protection or help?  Are we to take it that the free movement of men, money and materials will solve everything and that the man who cannot get a job in Ireland can always go to Belgium, France, Germany or somewhere else and get work?</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that this whole thing seems to be misconceived there is something about it that reminds one, as somebody said the other day, of Moses leading the people into the Promised Land.  The only difference is that it took him a great deal longer than it is taking our people to get into EEC.  We do not appear to have a very clear idea about what we shall get when we do go in.  Those who went to the trouble of visiting Europe on a number of occasions have a fairly clear idea of what Europe offers the small farmers and workers here.  Others, apparently, are blinded by what they see where certain sections possibly become very rich when they enter the rich man's club but they seem to forget that there are so many who do badly.  When one thinks of farmers, particularly in France and Belgium, going on strike, overturning their loads of agricultural produce on the streets because they are dissatisfied with the prices they get even though they are in the centre of the market what can we hope to get from outside it?</P>
    <P>The other great joke we hear from people who either do not know, apparently, or do not bother to find out, is the regional policy.  I hear people talking here, whenever the EEC is mentioned, about all Ireland would gain from a regional policy.  We know that there is no such thing as a regional policy in the EEC; all that is there in that regard is what they will allow Governments of member countries to carry out in the way of regional policies of their own.  Those who imagine that when Ireland joins, millions of pounds will pour into the west of Ireland from central Europe to build up the economy there, are in for a rude shock.</P>
    <P>The idea of dumping before the House a short time before Christmas Recess, a Bill such as this with the evident object of trying to get across something that will not stand the light of day, is not good enough.  This has <Col N="1333" /> happened before; it seems to be one of the tricks of the Government when they come near the end of a session to produce legislation which would normally take a long time to process and then say: &ldquo;Unless you get it through before a certain time the House cannot go into Recess.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment of the Constitution, the Taoiseach says, is clear-cut and should be understood by everybody.  I could mention many people who will find it very difficult to understand.  If I go to Deputy Geoghegan's, the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency, even the Irish version will be difficult for them to make out.  I believe we are having this Bill rushed through now not because it will help our application in any way, except that by getting it through now the Government will do something for which they will be famous&mdash;perhaps infamous would be more appropriate&mdash;but because they want this referendum to change the Constitution to take place on the old register.  They have an idea, which may not be incorrect, that the young people are more intelligent than their elders and they think&mdash;probably they are right&mdash;that the young people who will have a vote for the first time would almost certainly vote against the proposed change in the Constitution.  To prevent that, it is suggested that the referendum will take place around the end of March.  Somebody said the other day that it would be held at the end of March and the wag of the party suggested that would be appropriate&mdash; Spy Wednesday.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government are attempting to get this Bill through so that they can have the referendum before the new register comes into effect on 14th April.  This is a very mean thing to do.  I pose the question that Deputy Corish posed on a number of occasions: &ldquo;Why, when even the backward Six Counties, Britain and all the other countries we talk of joining in Europe have introduced a vote at 18, was not the Constitution amended so as to give a vote at 18 before this question came up?&rdquo;  Because the Government are afraid of themselves.  It is for the same reason that they do want to go to the country <Col N="1334" /> under any circumstances except for something like this&mdash;because they fear to be beaten.  They would not be in such a rush with this Bill but for the fact, as Deputy Cosgrave said today, that they need the support of Fine Gael and will almost certainly get it in order to have the Constitution amended.</P>
    <P>I should like to warn Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that many people who vote Fine Gael and many who vote Fianna Fáil in the normal way will be very chary about agreeing to hand over the law-making function for this country to a group of faceless men in Europe, ten of whom we may have a right to elect.  We may be told those ten will have the right of vote but they know, if they are sensible at all, that ten people going to Europe have very little contact with their native country, as we saw out there.  A number of them who went to Europe found it extremely difficult to get elected to their own Parliament when they had been acting in the European Parliament for a while and completely forgot that they had a country behind them which they were supposed to represent there.  I believe that quite a number of people who normally vote Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will not be prepared to accept what Deputy Sherwin referred to as the Party Whip at grassroot level, but will vote according to their own common sense, and if they do, for, I think, the third time in a constitutional amendment, a Fianna Fáil Government could be in for a very rude shock.</P>
    <P>I suggest one thing: when this matter came up, in view of the fact that there are at least six sections of the Constitution which have to be altered, and possibly four or five more when it starts to work, would it not have been a better idea if the Taoiseach had decided to re-write the Constitution, if he and the Government had decided that an opportunity had arisen for them to sit down and redraft a new Constitution? If this Constitution is as bad as Deputy de Valera said it was tonight, it is pretty bad and it is about time it was re-written.</P>
    <P>The proper thing to have done would have been to redraft the Constitution Let us have a new Constitution and <Col N="1335" /> let us then decide whether or not we want to hand over the running of the country to somebody else because if we allow this amendment of the Constitution to go through here, if it is carried in the country and put into operation, Oireachtas Éireann will in a very short time become no more than a glorified country council.  Most of the powers they have can be taken from them and we will be handing over to other people the right to do things which we do not believe should be done.  Indeed, some of the Holy Joes who sit on either side of this House, if they find in a couple of years time they are asked to agree to some of the legislation which has been passed in some of the European countries, they may have red faces going to their chapel gates to explain how they happened to agree to allow that sort of legislation be passed and be imposed on this country.  Therefore I think that even at this stage Fine Gael would be very well advised to reconsider their position.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael apparently decided that they would put in amendments on the next Stage and said that the reason they would not vote with us on this was because they want to establish that they were in favour of going into Europe, of joining the EEC.  That phrase &ldquo;going into Europe&rdquo; always jars me because I think of all the other portions of Europe which are outside the EEC and which apparently would not be very welcome in it anyway; but if Fine Gael want to support entry into the EEC, can they seriously suggest that those are the terms on which they would like to have the matter decided by the general public?  Do they consider the terms laid down in this proposal to amend the Constitution are the terms they want?  Should they not oppose it at every opportunity? The first opportunity they got was here tonight when they could, without interfering with their proEuropean attitude, decide that they were not going to take this hotchpotch which has been dumped out by the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, to this House, in an effort to persuade them that anything at all will be accepted <Col N="1336" /> as long as the support of the Fianna Fáil Party is behind it.</P>
    <P>I say this deliberately because I know that when it comes to the question of voting on this, we are going to be putting to the test again the roaring Republicans, those who were so noisy not so long since about their being better Republicans than anybody else.  I would very much like to see a definite attempt being made to put the Government to the test, because when we put the Government to the test a few weeks ago, at the instigation of Fine Gael&mdash;and we voted with them on it&mdash;the people who did not want a general election, the people who did not want to defeat Fianna Fáil, were the people who did all the shouting about the necessity to do away with corrupt leadership.  When the corrupt leadership was put to the test they either found it convenient to be out of the House or they voted, with the exception of Deputy Sherwin, with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We have had so much of this in the House since the last general election that most of us are sick and tired of it and we would like to see a final test on an issue of importance like this, because if Deputy Jack Lynch and his cowboys were beaten on this one, they would have no option but to go to the country, even though it is coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest, though I have not been persuaded by the remarks addressed by the previous speaker to the Fine Gael Party which seemed to me to misconceive the situation and our position on this Bill.  I think it is logical for the Labour Party, given the position they adopt on the wording of the amendment, to oppose the Bill.  I can understand that.  I think their position on the amendment, for reasons I will explain, is incorrect, but given that they reject the form of the amendment completely and seek to word it in a completely different way, it seems logical to vote against the Bill, the whole of the Schedule of which to them is objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our case, however, we believe that our approach&mdash;and before anybody <Col N="1337" /> jumps down my throat, I mean the general approach to this Bill&mdash;is the correct approach but that the wording of the Bill is seriously and, in one respect, fatally defective; that there are, therefore, changes to be made, one at least of which is vital.  There are three possible ways of tackling this problem.  I should never confine it in that way&mdash;there are at least three possible ways, and somebody with ingenuity can think of another.  When one examines the three methods of tackling this problem, one is forced to the conclusion that of the three the preferable method is that adopted by the Government, had they not failed completely to draft it in such a way as to confine the Bill to the job that needs to be done and it is our function, the function of this party, to put that right.</P>
    <P>What are we trying to do in this Bill?  First, we are trying to make sure that the Bill is so drafted that if the people did decide in favour of membership, their decision will in fact be effective.  It would be quite wrong for us so to draft the Bill that if the people voted in a referendum in favour of membership subsequently it transpired that because of some legal defect, the membership they had sought to ensure by their vote was not secured. Therefore the Bill must be so drafted that if adopted by the people, it will be effective and unchallengeable in the courts.  I do not mean to say that it cannot be challenged but that any challenge should be bound to fail.</P>
    <P>Whatever are our views, Labour or Fine Gael, if any of us creates a situation in which there is a defect in the Bill such that, following its enactment by the people a challenge to it could succeed, then we would have failed the people.  Of course the people are entitled to reject this referendum if they wish, and the Labour Party no doubt will try to persuade them to do so, as they are perfectly entitled to do. If the Bill is rejected, that is that, and we have to accept that situation, but if it is adopted and subsequently it is found that there is a flaw or defect in it, we will all have failed the people. The job of the Labour Party and of ourselves in this respect is so to design this Bill that, while it is limited strictly <Col N="1338" /> to the purpose for which it is required, which the Government have failed to do, it will nevertheless be effective and, if adopted, cannot effectively be challenged in the courts.</P>
    <P>It is because the Labour Party approach, for reasons I will suggest later on, would lead to a situation in which the Bill, if adopted by the people, could be challenged, and would be open to challenge and might be successfully challenged or that the views of the Irish people if they are expressed in favour of EEC membership in the referendum might be frustrated, that it seems to me the Labour Party's approach is unwise.</P>
    <P>Of course, these matters are arguable. I am sure a good case could be made the other way but to me this is the reason why we differ on this particular point.  Just as they feel that our views may have been influenced by our general attitude to the EEC, I feel that their views on this Bill may have been coloured by their opposition to, or partial opposition to, or their distaste for&mdash;perhaps that is the best word&mdash; EEC membership.  That may have influenced them in adopting a particular approach to the wording of the Bill which I think is unwise, and might be unfair to the Irish people if they adopt it.  Therefore, the first thing we have to do in this legislation is to make sure it works, that there is no flow in it and that it cannot be faulted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Labour Party wish&mdash;and I hope I am not wrong&mdash;to draft the Bill in such a way that it refers specifically to Articles in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; but my experience of the Fianna Fáil Party is that about once every two years&mdash;and twice this year already&mdash;their drafting of laws is so defective that they are found to be in conflict with the Constitution. Consequently, I am not prepared to believe that they or, frankly, anybody else, could so draft a list of amendments involving particular Articles as to exclude the possibility that some Article overlooked could be used by somebody seeking to overturn EEC membership in the courts and used successfully on some legal point.  I nearly said some legal quibble.  That is the problem we have to face.  If we are to make sure that the Bill does what we want it to do and that the Irish people are not frustrated, we must have a wording which is watertight as regards effectiveness and not capable of being challenged in the courts.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, we must also ensure that the Bill does no more than is necessary.  It would be quite wrong if we permitted our Government to legislate in this House in a manner not required by EEC membership and in a manner that could over-ride the Constitution. That would be quite wrong. We must do nothing that would give to our Government the power to legislate on a matter where EEC membership does not require legislation in a manner that would over-ride the Constitution. That is the first thing we have to ensure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, we must ensure that any legislation enacted by the EEC which over-rides our Constitution is necessitated by the obligation of membership of the Community.  It would be wrong if the Community at any stage purported to legislate&mdash;any of the three Communities as there are technically three&mdash;in relation to a matter which did not arise from the Treaties and which did not involve obligations of membership of the Communities.  If such legislation were to be introduced by them, it would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Treaties.  If that legislation even though it was <i>ultra vires</i> the Treaties should over-ride our Constitution that is a danger which has to be guarded against.  That is something with which we must concern ourselves.  It is not, <Col N="1340" /> perhaps, a great danger but we must ensure that nothing is done that involves over-riding anything in our Constitution beyond that necessitated by membership of the Communities.</P>
    <P>So we walk a tight rope in this legislation.  Not surprisingly there are disagreements between us and, indeed, I am sure these disagreements are quite genuine.  We are trying to make sure that the Bill is watertight, that it covers all possible cases and that it does not overlook some aspect of the Constitution which could be used in some technical way in the courts to invalidate the decision of the Irish people and, secondly, we want to make sure that the Bill does not permit our Government to legislate on matters that are not required by the EEC in a manner that over-rides the Constitution and that it does not permit the EEC, purporting to act under the Rome Treaty or the Paris Treaty but not actually doing so, to over-ride our Constitution.  That is the tight rope we walk.</P>
    <P>Given that situation there are several approaches.  In a sense there are basically two approaches but the second one has two sub-approaches. The first approach is the one proposed by the Labour Party, as I understand it, in which we amend each Article of the Constitution that requires amending. The difficulty here, as I have already indicated, is to be sure which Article needs amending.  I will be talking later about some of the points made by Deputy Keating.  To me Deputy Keating conclusively disproved his own case because he raised a series of doubts about Articles of the Constitution. He mentioned Articles that had not hitherto been mentioned, for example, Article 10, on which I totally failed to follow him.  He may have a point but I could not follow it.</P>
    <P>He raised doubts about it.  He said there might be something here which would conflict with EEC membership and might have to be dealt with.  Once you get to the stage where you are going through the Constitution and looking at Articles and saying: &ldquo;There might be something here that would involve a conflict,&rdquo; and once there is such evident uncertainty as to which Articles might or might not conflict <Col N="1341" /> with EEC membership now or in the future, then you are in a position where any attempt to legislate, as the Labour Party suggest, Article by Article, is bound to fail.</P>
    <P>The fact that Deputy Keating produced Article 10, which had not struck me as a problem at all, suggests that some other ingenious claimant before the courts in future years might take some other Article we have not thought of, and which the Government did not think of, and which the Labour Party did not think of, and say: &ldquo;This was not covered by the constitutional amendment and, on these grounds, I claim that the EEC is in conflict with our Constitution.&rdquo;  The law being what it is, and constitutional law being what it is, such a claimant might will be proved right and EEC membership overturned, the wishes of the Irish people frustrated, and possibly very severe economic hardship inflicted on this country if it was forced into a situation of having to leave the EEC even temporarily at that stage.  No doubt that could be remedied by a further referendum.  We must be careful about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating, in his skilful attempt to illustrate how many Articles might be affected, totally undermined his own case for approaching the Treaty Article by Article.  He showed to me, anyway, that no matter how carefully one approached it, the final result might be that one might omit some Article which might prove crucial. That approach, therefore, is too dangerous. The whole thing could be upset. I do not think that any party concerned to ensure that the wishes of the Irish people are carried through and that they are not frustrated on a legal technicality could reasonably advocate that approach.  We are forced, therefore, to adopt the alternative approach, that is, a global amendment rendering membership of the Communities compatible with our Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are two possible ways of approaching that global amendment. I think that in terms of constitutional law the method adopted by the Government is the least satisfactory but in terms of politics, in terms of ensuring that we do no more than is necessary, <Col N="1342" /> no more than the Irish people want us to do, and that we do not put them in a position of having to vote for more than they want to vote for, and more than they need to vote for, perhaps, the Government's solution is the better one.  These two approaches to the global amendment technique are, on the one hand, to have a general amendment related to economic co-operation and Irish participation in economic unions or communities expressed generally, and on the other hand to name the communities involved.</P>
    <P>In general, constitutions express themselves in very general terms.  It is not normal in a constitution to refer to specific bodies other than the actual organs of Government in the State.  For example, in Article 29 when this Constitution was drawn up for reasons that were probably good in constitutional practices as well as in current Fianna Fáil politics at that time, I think it was right that the king should have been submerged in verbiage, as he was.  You will find the king nowhere in our Constitution by name.  There he was and there he stood.  He signed our passports and he accredited our ambassadors and our foreign ambassadors were accredited to him.</P>
    <P>All that was done in an Article in which the poor king never got a mention. At the time I am sure much was made of that in this House.  It certainly was convenient for Fianna Fáil to tackle it in that way.  It was an ingenious way of producing a constitution which could become a republican constitution if at any stage we decided to become a republic and to eliminate the king.  It was a very ingenious piece of drafting.  I think it was basically drafting in accordance with the sound constitutional principle of avoiding specific references and speaking in general terms.</P>
    <P>The terms used are:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of the State in or in connection with its external relations, the Government may to such extent and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law, avail of or adopt any organ, <Col N="1343" /> instrument, or method of procedure used or adopted for the like purpose by the members of any group or league of nations with which the State is or becomes associated for the purpose of international co-operation in matters of common concern. </P>
    <P>One would need to know a good deal of Irish history and constitutional history and politics to know that that meant the king.  It was under that beautiful piece of general verbiage of an unspecific character that I got my first passport and, indeed, I went on my honeymoon under the protection, God help us, of King George V who, at that time, was almost 12 years dead. The sense of economy of the Government at that time was such that even after the king had died, they continued using his passports until such time as it was necessary to reprint some more. I got my passport in 1938, two and a half years after the king had died and I went on my honeymoon on that passport in 1947.  If nothing else, that illustrates something of the sense of economy of the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>Under that principle it would be good constitutional practice if, instead of the wording of this amendment it were worded, for instance, &ldquo;the State may become a member of an economic union or community of countries and if it does so the following can flow from that&rdquo;.  That would be the better approach but in the present circumstances it is right that we should set aside good constitutional practice and that we should abandon the principle of generality in constitutional drafting and that we should be specific, because if the Government had adopted that general terminology and then, depending on the exact words used, it might have been alleged that in some way there was opened up the possibility of our involving ourselves in some other kind of community with obligations not known to the Irish people at present and that that could be done without the wishes of the Irish people being consulted at a referendum.  That could have been a good political point. Indeed, it might have been a good legal and constitutional point, but the <Col N="1344" /> desirability remains of narrowing this down to the net issue so that extraneous issues such as other Deputies have tried to drag in, for example, defence and foreign policy, could be excluded absolutely.  Therefore, the Government were wise in what they did in abandoning the kind of constitutional practice illustrated by the present wording of Article 29 and they were wise in taking the line of naming specifically the particular Communities in question.  To me, that approach is the one that is preferable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I sum up my remarks at this stage by saying that we reject the approach of naming each Article of the Constitution separately because even someone as ingenious as Deputy Keating might fail to spot one which some subsequent person might spot, challenge in the courts and overturn the decision of the Irish people.  On practical political ground, I reject the possibly preferable solution on constitutional terms of a general reference to economic union within the Communities and I favour the particular approach which the Government adopted of naming the Communities in question and then saying that anything necessitated by virtue of these Communities shall be compatible with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Where I fault the Government is on the particular wording they use. Although the structure of the amendment seems to me to be right and I find it hard to see or accept any argument against its overall structure. I cannot accept the actual wording. On this score we must challenge the Government and insist&mdash;I use the word advised&mdash;that it be amended in the manner suggested by Deputy Cosgrave, in a manner necessary to limit this amendment to the minimum necessary for the purpose at hand.</P>
    <P>Before developing the question of amendment, I should like to look at some of the Articles of the Constitution that have been referred to and to make some comments on them. Article 1, which was referred to by Deputy Keating, is the Article which mentions the inalienable right to determine our relations with other nations.  Frankly, I could not follow <Col N="1345" /> the Deputy's argument because what we are doing in joining these Communities is exercising this inalienable right.  If, in fact, any exercise of the inalienable right involves alienating it, then Article 1 is meaningless in this respect and although I agree absolutely that the extent to which there is a sharing of our sovereignty in this Treaty was far beyond that in any previous treaty, that it is quite different in its character and that it is right that the Irish people should be told this, nevertheless, any treaty or agreement with another country which limits the rights in international law of this country to act in accordance with its particular wishes at any point in time, involves giving up a right.  As Deputy Keating would seem to suggest, it involves alienating it.</P>
    <P>However, if any exercise of our inalienable right to determine our relations with other nations involves alienating the right, then, Article 1 is meaningless and, so, that argument falls to the ground.  Any action which we take in this Parliament in accordance with our Constitution in our relations with other nations is an exercise of this inalienable right.  What is meant by Article 1 is that nobody else can push us around in this respect; that nobody else can tell us what we are to do in our relations with other nations and that only we can decide to what extent we will share our sovereignty in any particular instance.  Our inalienable right means that the British Government, which for so long exercised sovereignty over this country, no longer has power to do so.  It means that only by the voice of the Irish people could we sign a treaty or join the Communities we are now joining.  It is nonsensical to give any other meaning to Article 1.  Therefore, it seems to me that Deputy Keating's point is a bad one.</P>
    <P>Again, on Articles 2 and 3, I do not understand the point made.  This country signs treaties regularly.  We sign quite a number every year and we sign them on behalf of this State, not on behalf of national territory.  We have never claimed to do so and nobody has ever suggested or recognised any right on our part to do so.  This Treaty, <Col N="1346" /> like every other treaty we sign, will be signed on behalf of the State.  Our rights are confined to that.  According to international law, we are not the sovereign power in Northern Ireland. We all have our aspirations with regard to Irish unity, to which we are entitled and which can never be taken away from us until such time as they are fulfilled, but our right to represent the interests of the people and our right to sign an agreement is limited to this State.  No other State in the world has suggested or would suggest any decision other than that.  Most States are jealous that each State would concern itself with its own affairs and confine its actions to the area over which it exercises sovereignty <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto.</i> Therefore, to suggest that in signing this Treaty we are in some way giving up some claim that we have, even if the way in which we press that claim is always desirable, which it is not, is to suggest equally that all treaties signed in the past involved giving up this right.  I see no difference in this Treaty than any other and the argument is as spurious as the argument put forward in 1949 for not joining NATO.  I am not suggesting that we should have joined NATO, nor do I think that we should do so now or ever, but the argument put forward at the time was that Article 4 of NATO involved a mutual commitment to defend each other's territories and that by that reference we were in some way giving up a right of some kind in respect of Northern Ireland.  In so far as there was any sensitivity on that, a footnote reserving our claims would have met the situation but that decision was taken on wrong grounds.  The decision itself was a good one, but taken for the wrong reasons.  There is no good pretending there is something peculiar about this particular Treaty.</P>
    <P>On the question of sovereignty and Article 5, I, unfortunately, was not able to hear Deputy Ryan.  I regret that because I would be interested to hear how he developed this theme but I believe that my views on sovereignty would be very close to his.  I understand that he traced back sovereignty for some time.  It is right to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> Sovereignty is something that we have come to associate with a particular single level of government.  This is a very curiously simplified concept which to somebody in the medieval period would have seemed native in that anybody could be so silly as to think that sovereignty must rest with one particular level of government.  I suspect that if such a view were expressed in medieval Europe, people might have laughed and said: &ldquo;Well, he comes from a rather primitive part of the world where they do not yet understand how governments work.&rdquo;  What is curious is that we have reverted to this attitude during the last three centuries. Sovereignty is something that can rest at several different levels.  In fact, in medieval Europe, under the feudal system, sovereignty rested at many different levels.  There was no one level at which there was total sovereignty.  A feudal lord, owing allegiance to a superior lord, did have sovereignty, that is, the final right to dispose of a number of matters without any interference from above.  In other matters those rights were reserved to his superior lord.  That system ended because of the evolution of the absolute monarchy in the 16th and 17th centuries.  The absolute monarch arrogated to himself all power, taking it from inferior feudal lords or, in some cases, from superior feudal lords, whether the emperor, the Pope or some other monarch from whom he held territory and, indeed, taking power also away from free cities under him, free communities under him and concentrating all that power at one level.</P>
    <P>Then, as time passed on, these absolute monarchs gave way to democracy and all power became vested in the democratic Parliament of the people and so we end up with a position which to a medievalist would have seemed intolerable, that the Government here can abolish Dublin Corporation.  All power is concerntrated at one particular level.  That is a very native concept which is a particular emanation of absolute monarchy in Europe and if one looks at the perspective of history it does not make much sense.  It is a curiously inadequate concept because, <Col N="1348" /> just as in the feudal period there were good reasons for power being shared at different levels, so today, more than ever, sovereignty cannot be concentrated only at one level because the decisions that have to be made are ones which cannot in practice be made only at one level.</P>
    <P>You can concentrate a lot of power at the level of the State, you can take all rights away from subordinate bodies so that they can be abolished at the stroke of a pen&mdash;this is our system; it works in a kind of way&mdash; but it is alienating people from authority because once you get a situation where there is no power that has any right of its own other than the sovereign government of a nation and nothing underneath it, then people are levelled down and lose their sense of involvement and you get an undesirable situation.  It is my hope that we will, as time goes on, learn to develop power so that there may be inferior sovereignties, that there may be in the future regions of Ireland which, for certain purposes, exercise sovereign power that cannot be taken away from them by the Government.  That would be a healthy thing and out of that would emerge much more involvement of people in running their own affairs.</P>
    <P>At the moment that does not concern us.  What concerns us is the other way up, the fact that there are many decisions which no country can take on its own with any reality.  The pretence that any country in Europe, for example, is in a position to control monopolies and international companies whose operations extend throughout the Continent and other continents is absurd.  No one country in Europe can tackle companies like Standard Oil, for instance.  It is indeed questionable whether even on a continental scale some of them can be tackled.  I should hope they could. This is because many problems are moving to the scale where they cannot be tackled nationally and the necessity emerges for international action.  National sovereignty at this stage if maintained absolutely undiluted, simply means that the people acting through their democratically <Col N="1349" /> elected Government confine themselves to a position of powerlessness in the face of private interests who do not confine themselves to single States or nations but whose power extends worldwide.  As long as individual nation States do that, as long as the people of Ireland, the people of Britain, France or Germany, continue to confine themselves in that way and not recognise the need to tackle these problems on a continental, and later on a world scale so long will the peoples of the world be exploited by private interests instead of controlling private interests to their advantage.</P>
    <P>The curious thing is that this argument, to me absolutely compelling, seems not to hold any attraction for those whom I would have thought should be attracted by it, members of a socialist party and a socialist party should be and is, to some degree, an international party.  I do not understand their cavalier rejection of this.  I can only attribute it to the unfortunate influence on the development of Irish socialism of some aspects of James Connolly's teaching, if I may dare to make a criticism of one of our national heroes in this House.  I think his influence is, in some respects, unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I want to establish clearly that unless sovereignty is shared in regard to certain economic decisions at a higher level the people will suffer.  They will be exploited instead of controlling their own destiny.  It is not simply at that level.  On issues like advertising, for instance, what hope is there of our controlling abuses of advertising when any attempt to do so in Irish papers in respect of Irish goods would only inhibit Irish firms in competition with international firms, English firms, advertising in papers or television reaching this country?  We cannot control the abuses of commercial advertising alone.  Only on a European scale could it be controlled, only, perhaps, eventually on a world scale.  To pretend we have power to do so is nonsense.  We have the legal right to control it but the exercise of that right would be so damaging to our own interests that we dare not do it.  Take industrial democracy. Can we proceed to introduce <Col N="1350" /> industrial democracy without being inhibited by the fear that if we do so, when other neighbouring countries do not do so, we will lose foreign investment, that it will go elsewhere?  I do not think so.  We have to have regard to that.  Progress in industrial democracy can only be made on a European wide basis.  I do not believe we will make real progress so long as we must fear competition from other capitalist States in this respect.  The competition of international capitalism leads inexorably to the need for some kind of communal control over these key decisions. Those who pretend that by sitting back in our tight little island we can govern ourselves and control our own interests when countries like France, Britain and Germany despair of doing so unless they get together are not facing the reality of the situation and they are unconsciously betraying the interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the whole development of sovereignty and the way in which it has been exercised in the past that the devolution of sovereignty upwards in respect of certain functions does not render a State any less of a sovereignty.  A practical example is Germany in the period 1871 to 1918. In that period there was a German Empire but some of the German States retained their sovereignty.  They may not have had much power because of the superior power of the Prussian army in the military situation they were in but they were recognised as sovereign States and they retained functions which could not be interfered with by the German imperial authority. That situation evolved into a single nation State because of the linguistic and cultural ties between these communities but they were sovereign and recognised as such.</P>
    <P>What distinguishes a country as a sovereign State?  It seems to me that the residue of sovereignty must rest with the State.  It may have devolved upwards or downwards in certain aspects of its sovereignty but the basic elements of sovereignty must rest with it and its sovereign status must be recognised by other countries and its right to exchange diplomatic representation and to negotiate agreements <Col N="1351" /> with other countries must be recognised. That is what sovereignty means in international law, if I may express it in layman's language as somebody who knows very little about international law.  That is the sovereignty which we have and which we shall retain within the EEC.  To suggest otherwise is nonsense.  Of course, part of our sovereignty in economic affairs we shall share with other countries.  That will not make us other than a sovereign, independent, democratic State and Article 5 of the Constitution is unaffected.  Indeed, I would be prepared to stake a lot on it.  If we were saying which Articles would be affected I would be prepared to put my money on leaving that one out, and take my chance of the Supreme Court ever deciding that we were not a sovereign State.  Of course, they could not decide anything of the kind if we were a member of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating also suggested that within this Community we would not be sovereign because we only have ½ per cent of the GNP, whereas Germany, with 20 per cent of GNP, would be sovereign.  I do not know what this means.  To me it is meaningless.  &ldquo;Bigger countries have more interest than smaller ones.&rdquo;  It is precisely why, therefore, we must join the Community because it is the exercise of the greater power of larger States which enables them to exploit weaker and smaller States.  The reason why the EEC is necessary, the reason why it has been accepted enthusiastically by the smaller members of it and why they are the ones who are the great exponents of it is that it gives protection against exploitation by larger countries.  The reason why we should join, the reason why there is incalculable&mdash;and I use that word advisedly&mdash;economic advantage to us to join is that it will end the power of Britain to exploit this country economically. That is the reason why it is important that we should join from an economic viewpoint.  It is because within it, even with our ½ per cent of GNP and our 1 per cent of population and our much larger but still small 5 per cent of voting power, we <Col N="1352" /> will be guaranteed against exploitation, whereas if we remain outside we can be exploited and will be exploited as we have been exploited for the past 50 years and nothing said by opponents of EEC membership has ever suggested in the slightest way what we can do to stop ourselves being exploited by other neighbouring powerful countries.</P>
    <P>They talk about our remaining outside and suggest that in some way it will benefit us but they cannot tell us how the exploitation we have suffered from would end, how they propose to take away Britain's or these other countries' power to exploit us if we remain outside.  That is not explained because it cannot be explained, because it cannot happen out, be joining, this power can be removed and that is precisely why there is an expansion of sovereignty by joining, because it enables us to protect our rights in a way in which we cannot protect them outside.  That is a sharing and expansion of sovereignty and it makes it worth our while to join.  So much for that one.</P>
    <P>Article 6.2 is the one which says:</P>
    <P>These powers of government are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would have thought, in fact, that the effect of this amendment of the Constitution is to enable us to exercise our powers of government under this particular section in order to devolve certain functions to other bodies on our behalf.  I would have thought that membership of the Community is compatible with Article 6.2 but I recognise a doubt on this point and I think the doubt should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating on Article 10 left me cold.  I have read it three times and I cannot find out what was the point he was making in his reference to the Coal and Steel Community.</P>
    <P>Article 15.2.1 is an important one:</P>
    <P>The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas; no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to amend that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> I may be wrong but I think certainly one would have to have regard to that because, in fact, the EEC system of regulations involves legislating for this country.  We would be sharing our legislative power with a legislative body which at this moment is the Council of Ministers, that is, the ministers of Governments democratically elected by member States.  It is an indirect system of democracy, too indirect, in my view unsatisfactory, and one which when we join I hope we will seek to improve and will have the support of all parties in this House in seeking to improve. It cannot, however, be described as undemocratic when the body which will be legislating will be members of Governments elected democratically by the parliaments of member States themselves elected democratically.  It is democracy, even if it is indirect democracy, but I can see a need to concern ourselves with that particular Article of the Constitution as we shall be sharing that particular power.</P>
    <P>Article 15.6.1º has been mentioned:</P>
    <P>The right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is nothing whatever, as I shall refer to later, in this Bill or anything being done under it which in any way affects that and I think that one thing that could come usefully from this debate is an end to the spurious talk about neutrality and defence which I admit has not been helped by some unfortunate remarks by Government spokesmen.</P>
    <P>Article 28.3.1º is the next one that I have a reference to:</P>
    <P>War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies here.  That is utterly irrelevant to the matters we are dealing with.</P>
    <P>Article 29.5.1º says:</P>
    <P>Every international agreement to which the State becomes a party shall be laid before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Clause 2º is:</P>
    <P>The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving <Col N="1354" /> a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Depending upon how the legislation works, it may well be necessary to cover that particular amendment.  But the fact that I think some of these are necessary and that Deputy Keating thinks others are necessary and somebody else may get up yet and mention another one that neither of us has mentioned, shows the futility of attempting to legislate by naming particular Articles, the futility and the danger of it, the danger of frustrating the wishes of our people if we adopt that technique.  That method is out.</P>
    <P>I have said that the second method involving a general phraseology about an economic community, joining economic communities or involving ourselves in economic co-operation is unwisely wide.  We are left, therefore, with the Government's proposal.  Let us consider the specific wording of it. The crucial wording which everybody is directing his attention to is the wording which involves the words &ldquo;consequent on membership of the Communities&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities.</P>
    <P>I am sure you can argue this both ways.  I have not heard the full debate. Arguments may have been made that &ldquo;consequent on membership&rdquo; has a narrower meaning than that which this side of the House is attributing to it. I do not mind how much argument there can be.  The fact is it is arguable and I think the weight of argument is on our side but if only an ounce of argument was on our side, not the whole weight of it, it would be vitally necessary to change this.  It would be intolerable if any Government in this House were permitted to override the Constitution at their whim by simply introducing a Bill: Licensing Laws (Consequential on EEC) Bill, 1982 and deciding to extend the licensing laws because they do not have any controls in France as to what time pubs close, not that that is a constitutional matter; <Col N="1355" /> I am taking a bad example.  But, the idea of any Government simply adding in the words, &ldquo;Consequential on EEC Membership&rdquo; to the Title of an Act, whether or not it was required by EEC membership, and would be able to override the Constitution, is intolerable and in so far as any doubt exists on that and, at the very mini-mum, a doubt exists, a grave doubt to my mind, those words must go.  We should do no more than is necessary is to ensure that, in so far as any legislation by this Government is necessitated by the obligations of membership, that legislation is not incompatible with the Constitution.  If we can ensure that and no more than that, we are doing our job.  We must not widen it beyond that and must not make it possible for this Government or any other Government to use the excuse of the EEC membership to override the Constitution in matters where it is not necessary. I do not think anybody can argue that in confining it in this way, in proposing this change of words, we are doing anything incompatible with the requirements of the Treaties of the Communities.  I do not think it is conceivable in any sense that if the wording is changed here and the Government go back to Brussels with this, they could be told: &ldquo;Oh no, this does not satisfy our needs&rdquo; because clearly, by definition, the Community cannot demand of us more than that we do those things necessitated by the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>So that, proposing this amendment which I think there can be no question about&mdash;that it is necessary is evident&mdash;will not in any way prejudice our membership or create a situation where the Community would suggest that they are dissatisfied and will not accept our constitutional amendment. That I think cannot happen.  This amendment, therefore, is one that must go through.  There can be no argument against it.  On that we have to insist.</P>
    <P>There is another amendment which I think we will be putting down also to line 11.  It relates to the ability of the Community to legislate directly for this country.  That is an integral part <Col N="1356" /> of the Community.  In joining it we have to accept that.  There are limitations on this which I shall mention in a moment, limitations which have not been mentioned in this House and to which attention should be drawn.  At least, I do not think they were mentioned. This power exists within appropriate limits.  It is important that we make it clear again that the only cases where our Constitution can be overridden must be cases where the Community legislates but legislates in accordance with the Treaties.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable, at least, that the Council of Ministers of the Community may at some stage in the future purport to legislate by way of regulation in respect of some matter which, in fact, does not arise from its Treaties and is not required by or derived from these Treaties.  They might act, in other words, in a manner <i>ultra vires</i> the three Treaties.  Now that is something which can, of course, be challenged in the European Court of Justice, but it is also something against which, apart from that challenge, we must secure ourselves.  Our courts must be entitled to say whether or not any act or regulation of the Community is or is not pursuant to the Treaties. They must be entitled to deal with this matter.  They may have to refer the matter of interpretation to the European Court, but they must be entitled to deal with this matter of whether or not any regulation of the Council of Ministers is, in fact, pursuant to the Treaties; if it is not, it must be possible to challenge it in our courts, the point of interpretation being referred to the European Court of Justice and, in the light of that interpretation, the decision being rendered by our courts.</P>
    <P>Our courts are not to be overridden, as some people suggested; our courts will continue to deal with cases, all the cases they deal with now but, if a point of interpretation of the Treaties arises, they must, of course, refer that to the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>I think we should put in there the words &ldquo;pursuant to the Treaties&rdquo;.  It may be tautologous.  It may be argued that they are not necessary, but they will certainly do not harm and, in <Col N="1357" /> certain circumstances, they could do good.  It is wrong that there should be any possibility of the Council of Ministers legislating for this country by way of regulation other than in accordance with and pursuant to the Treaties and arising out of the Treaties.  On this particular point I want to draw the attention of the House to Article 235.  It is a very important Article in the Treaty.  It is one which opens up powers of legislation to the Community and it also closes up.  Others may draw attention to the opening up aspect.  I want to draw attention to that and also to the closing up aspect. Article 235 says that if any action by the Community appears necessary to achieve in the functioning of the Common Market one of the aims of the Communities in cases where this Treaty has not provided for the requisite powers of action, the Council, acting by means of a unanimous vote &mdash;we will, of course, have the right of veto here&mdash;on the proposal of the Commission, and after the Assembly has been consulted, will enact the appropriate provisions.  This is a power of degenerate legislation to cover any point that may have been omitted anywhere in the Treaty.  To some degree it is open-ended.  It is important that the attention of the House should be directed to this because it opens up the possibility of legislation beyond what may appear to arise directly from the wording of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>There are two points to note.  The first is that this can only be done unanimously.  Our Government can, therefore, veto it.  The second is that, even if our Government failed to veto it, and if some Government here, such as this Government, launched us into some commitment which runs outside the aims of these Treaties, even if our Government agreed to it, that particular legislation would fall.  It would not be valid under Article 235 and we would be entitled in our High Court and in our Supreme Court to deal with the matter and to take action in regard to it because the only legislation possible under Article 235 is legislation to achieve one of the aims of the Community and these aims are spelt out.  They are spelt out in Article 2, which says it shall be the <Col N="1358" /> aim of the Community, by establishing a Common Market and progressively approximating the economic policies of member states, to promote throughout the Community a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, an increased stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living and closer relations between member states. Is there anybody on the Labour benches who is against any of these perfectly laudable objectives?  It is only these things that this Treaty can deal with, either in the explicit requirements of the Treaty or in the broader context of Article 235.  To talk about neutrality and defence in that context is clearly nonsense.  Any attempt to apply this Treaty to any matter of that kind would be <i>ultra vires</i> and would be so found by our Supreme Court and by the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the members of the Government who talked about neutrality and defence originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  If any member of the Government purports to agree unanimously to something involving neutrality and defence under this Treaty that will be <i>ultra vires</i> the Treaty and will be so found by the European Court of Justice and by our High Court and our Supreme Court. That is an important point.  So they need not try to get away with that because they will not get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leaves us with one other matter. I am not entirely clear about this myself. There is, I think, a case for and there is a case against.  Should we start spelling out provisios for things which should not be underwritten in this way?  It is clear to me that the power invested in the Communities through the Treaty is strictly limited to these aims and these aims are such that they cannot extend to matters like warthat is quite clear&mdash;and I do not think they can extend to human rights either. On the other hand, there are fears in this country which have been aroused by propoganda, some of it unscrupulous propaganda, on this subject and there may be something to be said for adding in what I believe to be a tautologous provision at the end as a <Col N="1359" /> reassurance to people who may have been misled by this propaganda, a provision setting out certain Articles of the Constitution dealing with such matters as war, the declaration of war, defence and the human rights Articles 40 to 43.  These should be covered. But there is a danger here.  It is, I suppose, one we need not worry too much about.  There is the danger that, if we do this, if we spell out these Articles, where do we end?  There is a problem there.  If you stick to human rights, for example, there is a bit of a danger in that obviously you are not going to start picking and choosing which human rights; you are going to include Articles 40, 41, 42, 43 and, possibly, 44.  Are you then going to create a propaganda situation for illdisposed people in Northern Ireland to say that here we are re-enacting and reinforcing provisions, such as Article 44, dealing with the special position of the Catholic Church and the prohibition on divorce.  Will we be re-enacting and reinforcing these and would this be used against us?  I think there is an argument there that we have to consider and certainly, if we do decide to insert these provisions, it would need to be made very clear that, when we do so, we are doing so not because we think all these things need to be kept but because we think it is a matter for us to decide if they are EEC.  As long as that is made clear, there is a case for inserting provisions shere.  On this I have a fairly open mind but, in any event, I suppose some of this may in the long run prove irrelevant because it is quite clear we are going to have to enact at some stage a new Constitution.</P>
    <P>So much for the details of the Bill. Behind all this lies the basic issue of whether we should or should not join the EEC.  This is not a subject to be developed at length in this debate.  We can come back to it in the debate on the White Paper in January or February next, but I think it is worth making a couple of points about it.  First of all, the economic arguments for membership are overwhelming.  It requires an incredible effort of suppression and distortion to hide how overwhelming <Col N="1360" /> they are.  The effect on Irish agriculture will be incalculable and the effect on the rest of the economy through the impact on agriculture and the multiplied effect of farmers' spending is even more incalculable.  The more I look at it the more I feel that any estimates I have made of the benefits have been grossly understated.  We have, I think, failed to grasp the enormity of the benefits and how they would be dispersed through the economy.  I should like to say at this point, without dwelling on it, that it is the Government's responsibility to make clear these facts to the Community.  If this Government fail in their duty, if they produce a wishy-washy White Paper like the wishy-washy pieces of material coming out, with all due respect, from the Department of Foreign Affairs, one of which we got this morning, in which there is hardly a figure of any kind, if that sort of stuff is trotted out, full of the usual cliches and no facts and no figures, it will not be surprising if the Irish people are taken in by the propaganda campaign to which they are being subjected and fail to grasp the realities of the possible gains&mdash;indeed, the certain gains&mdash;in membership.  It is the absolute duty of this Government to state these fully.  It is also their duty to state the losses.  I am not suggesting any suppression or any attempt at distortion. I am simply saying that in the White Paper the Government have an absolute duty to produce a quantified analysis of the gains and losses, using the best possible techniques for that purpose and indicating the range of error, which will be quite wide.  But, no matter how wide it is, the lowest figure for the benefits will far exceed the highest figure for the losses and that must be shown and the Irish people must not be misled by the inadequacies of a Government which so far have failed to put forward any of the case for the EEC with any kind of coherence or quantification.  The people must not be misled by a combination of the ineptitude of the Government and the unscrupulous propaganda of people opposed to membership using selective and, in many cases, dishonest arguments.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the political issue, I shall not develop this at length now as <Col N="1361" /> I have said something already about what is involved.  What is involved is the sharing of decisions which cannot be taken at national level, decisions which we fool ourselves if we think we have power to take at national level. There is no reason why we should devolve to any authority but the Government and Parliament of this State decisions which we can take effectively ourselves to the benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>The Rome Treaty has been designed and devised, with considerable skill and success to select only those aspects of economic affairs where member States and national Governments&mdash;no matter how large they may be; some with populations approaching 60 million and gross national products many times ours&mdash;are no longer capable of taking these decisions because the scale of the activity runs far beyond that of taking these decisions because the scale of the activity runs far beyond that of a nation State.  These decisions have to be devolved upwards if our interests are to be protected and if we are not to become the playthings of international cartels and monopolies and at their mercy.  If we are to be free to control our own destiny, free to legislate in the way we want, free to control brain-washing through advertising and free to legislate for industrial democracy, if these things are to be achieved and if we are not to become simply the plaything of an international capitalist system, it is vitally necessary that the relevant decisions&mdash;and of course only the relevant decisions&mdash;be devolved to a body which has some chance of taking them for the benifit of the people and taking them democratically, as they must be taken.  That is why we have to join; the truth of that must be told.  Unfortunately, part of the Left in this country is not telling the truth and not explaining these issues to the people; it is up to others on the Left to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have reached the stage where we can be seen to be taking positive steps towards building up this country economically and socially.  This Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill sets out to amend the Constitution in order to allow us to sign a Treaty with the EEC countries.  It states, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3º The State may become a member <Col N="1362" /> of the European Coal and Steel Community (established by Treaty signed at Paris on the 18th day of April, 1951), the European Economic Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957) and the European Atomic Energy Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957).  No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>That is a simple amendment to the Constitution and adequate to deal with the situation.  Deputy FitzGerald felt it could be copperfastened and I am sure his suggestion will be closely considered.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will get a speedy passage through the House.  I was pleased to hear Deputy FitzGerald talk knowledgeably about the first Constitution, the present Constitution and the Treaty of Rome.  Like Deputy FitzGerald, I do not know what the consequences for this country will be if we fail to become a member of the EEC.  I am surprised that the Labour Party should move an amendment to reject the Second Reading of this Bill. I have searched my mind in an effort to try and find a logical reason as to why they should be against it.</P>
    <P>This Treaty is basically an economic Treaty.  Any breaches of that Treaty will be brought before the European Court.  Since the EEC was founded only one or two matters have been brought before the European Court. The EEC was established in 1957 and since then it has grown in volume and output and the social aspect, which has been admired throughout the world and even in the East, has also grown.</P>
    <P>We are being given the opportunity of becoming members of an economic unit with a population of 270 million people; that figure includes the population of Britain and Ireland should we <Col N="1363" /> enter.  The benefits that will flow from such a union are tremendous.  Ever since the Reformation, barriers have been built up between nations.  This growth of nationality has led to the growth of many powerful nations and the impoverishment of weaker nations. Nothing was done about rectifying this imbalance until after the last war, when men of goodwill suggested means by which weaker nations could be protected in a genuine way.  The EEC evolved on 25th March, 1957.  The value of such an economic union is indicated by the progress the Six have made during that time.  I would have been much happier if we had been members at the very beginning but unfortunately this was not so.  We are now seeking to subscribe to and become members of the EEC. As members of it we must accept and keep its regulations and if we breach those regulations at any stage we may be brought before the European Court.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we signed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain and the Treaty of Rome is not unlike that type of trade agreement, it may be a little more complicated, but the Commission itself is composed of foreign ministers from each member State and each member State has the power of veto.  This clearly indicates to me that membership of it cannot be in any way extended beyond what is contained in the Bill before the House.  Only in this field should we examine it.  We have been legislating here since 1922 on behalf of the State and I do not see our sovereignty in any way threatened as a result of the wording here.  If the working is weak or possibly ambiguous here and there, there is sufficient intelligence and legal expertise among us and men of literary merit who can probably improve on the wording.  I would welcome all such help in drafting an amendment within the limits intended and that is that we are becoming a member of these three European bodies, that and no more. Anything that might be inserted beyond that would be a matter for this House, whatever Government is in <Col N="1364" /> power, and for legislation at a later stage.  This document, Bunreacht na hÉireann, must be amended only in such a way that all the rights reserved for citizens of this State in it shall be preserved.</P>
    <P>The benefits of EEC membership are obvious, but difficult to quantify.  For our farmers they are capable of some quantification.  The benefits for manufacturers are better and wider marketing opportunities, something we did not have before.  We had to negotiate our markets instead of having the opportunity of selling in an open market. I am appalled that this Bill should be opposed.  If we stay out of the Common Market tariff barriers will be raised against us in every country we trade with and outside Western Europe we shall be dependent on quotas being negotiated and we shall end up with a stop-go industrial life.  When countries are short of a particular commodity at a particular time they will say: &ldquo;You may now export to us&rdquo; but when the gap is filled they will just as quickly impose tariffs, making it prohibitive to export from here to that country.</P>
    <P>Accession to EEC gives us the opportunity of trading in a much wider field and, as a person with some experience of fighting hard for markets and trying to maintain them against competition from all over the world and trying to maintain employment in our industries&mdash;and the numbers employed are growing and we are exporting even under present conditions&mdash;I anticipate this move will bring us better opportunities that will test our efficiency and our ability to be better manufacturers and to improve and sell our products in the rather highly sophisticated market of Western Europe.  Firms that have grown up under protection and have merely been supplying a market of three million or fewer people and which have some exports but are producing too many goods, none of them in an economic or a decent way, will have the opportunity of rationalisation so that uneconomic lines can be dropped and they can take advantage of longer or even continuous runs for the growing market that will be available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> I have searched and I see no other answer for us.  If there was, I would say this is not necessary but in our present position and looking to the future of our people&mdash;and I am concerned about our people because without them there is no future; there would be no living for anybody&mdash;I would never wish to curb opportunities.  This is why I am surprised that the Labour Party should oppose this Bill.  I see no objection to it and certainly no loss involved.  We are already importing large quantities of goods and despite tariff barriers goods are coming in from countries with which we have no trade agreements. This is something we must consider, if our people, rather than ensuring their own prosperity and employment opportunities and their standard of living, to suit only their taste for a particular style or some such reason, buy imported goods.  We have such people now and no doubt will have them in the future.  I have experience of this also but I know the vast majority of our population have more regard for the common good and the general welfare than to purchase imported goods in preference to home produced goods.</P>
    <P>I see this Bill leading to a wide extension of trade.  Sometimes I feel that few people recognise the economic advances we have made; they are not aware that not only are we an agricultural country hoping to provide a better standard of living for the agricultural community but we have become industrialised and we want to promote more industries.  We are now exporting industrial goods in large volume.  It is the making of this treaty with EEC that gives us the wonderful opportunity of going into a free market to trade in competition with our partners there.  This will be a Community of 10.  For Ireland to stay out and leave it a Community of nine would not in any way upset the Europeans. We ought to recognise that not only are we an island, but we are an island off an island off Europe.  We must ask ourselves where we are going to sell our goods, whether we are going to turn our backs on this opportunity, as has been suggested by the Labour Party, or put to the real test the ability of this nation to manufacture goods of <Col N="1366" /> quality efficiently and our capacity to sell our goods in a larger market and therein obtain an economic price.</P>
    <P>Industrially the EEC is the salvation of this country, not its ruination.  Agriculturally it ensures much higher prices for our farmers, ensures that our farmers will have an incentive, well though they are doing at the moment, to utilise further the land of this country, which is a fertile land, a green land, a land that is highly productive.  Here in the northern hemisphere we do not get all the sunshine we would like, but we have a mild climate throughout the year.  We have to extremes of weather; we can nearly go through any part of the year without wearing an overcoat.</P>

      <P>We are getting soft when we have heated cars.  In this affluent society we have forgotten the hardships of 20 years ago.  We are talking about changing times and about keeping this affluence developing.  This is what this matter is all about that we are discussing this evening.  Free trade and not the isolationist policy of the Labour Party is the only policy that will allow Ireland to become more prosperous and efficient. This is a unique opportunity for agriculture, and I would hope that our Irish farmers would continue to prepare, as I know they have been preparing, for this era which will provide them with guaranteed prices and a guaranteed market for their produce. This will be achieved by Ireland joining the EEC on equal terms and with an equal voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not say any more in regard to the benefits of EEC membership, because I appreciate that a White Paper will be issued in February next. Like Deputy FitzGerald, I hope that this will indicate, if not in absolutely detailed terms, at least in approximate terms, the benefits to be gained.  It would be foolish of me to say in this House that everything will be rosy.  I know there will be losses here and there, that there will have to be changes here and there.  I know that Irish manufacturers, by and large, are <Col N="1367" /> aware of this; that workers in the various industries are aware of it.  Any firm that has not made provision for the changeover, that has not planned adequately for it, may face a difficult time.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill wholeheartedly. I shall welcome also any help that can be given towards ensuring that the sections will be drafted in a manner that will confine them to the intent and purpose of this amendment that is being introduced; to ensure that our commitment is confined to the terms of the three treaties, now that we have an opportunity of becoming a member of these three Communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Members of the House, both those on my right and on my left, may not have much regard for the Labour Party.  Some of them have not concealed their dislike for the Labour Party, particularly on this issue.  However, there is one thing for which we should get credit whether, in the view of the right or left here, we are right or wrong, that is, the argument we have stimulated in this House, and stimulated over the last ten years, on the question as to whether or not this country should become a full member of the EEC.  We are concerned&mdash;and I think we have shown more concern than most people &mdash;about the workers and the small farmers.  Clichés such as &ldquo;wonderful opportunity&rdquo; and &ldquo;great challenge&rdquo; will not satisfy the Irish people that the best thing to do is to go into the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Bill is concerned, we want the question as to whether or not we should apply for membership to go to the people as quickly as possible, but we want it to go in a proper manner. This is a false kind of discussion, because here we are discussing two things: No. 1, whether or not we should go into the EEC; and, No. 2, the manner in which our Constitution should be changed.  As far as the first point is concerned, we do not know the details.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald admits we do not know the details, but as yet he is fulsome in his support for <Col N="1368" /> membership of the EEC.  In any case, the details, I presume, will be available before the issue is put to the people for them to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We found ourselves in this position before.  We found ourselves in a similar position in January, 1965, when every member of this party offered his criticism of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  We were laughed at and scorned then and we heard the boasts&mdash;afterwards proved to be sham boasts&mdash;of members of the Fianna Fáil Government, particularly those who negotiated the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in 1965.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is now Taoiseach, told us that as far as jobs were concerned we did not have anything to worry about, even though in that particular agreement we stripped off progressively and pretty rapidly the protections which were necessary for industry.  We did not hear afterwards a reiteration of the declaration by the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Charles Haughey, that as a result of that agreement the farmers would benefit to the tune of £10 million.  They are not prepared to say that now because the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement has proved to be what we said it would be, a disaster for industry and no advantage for agriculture.</P>
    <P>In March or April of next year we will have, to describe it broadly, a referendum on membership of the Common Market.  I would add my plea to that of Deputy Tully that we do not try to pull another fast one on the new voters and that we should try to have this referendum after the 15th April, when those who are now 21 years of age will be entitled to give their decision on whether or not we should, under the terms offered, become members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to this.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was made as a result of an important decision.  This Party fought against it and I believe we were proved right, but this is the most important decision this country has taken in the last 50 years.  We should not take it <Col N="1369" /> lightly and we should not speak in the tones of Deputy Gallagher, who spoke with sincerity, because he accepts what his colleagues in the front beach have told him.  He believes when we get into Europe we will have a greatly increased market and that we will be able to compete on equal terms, or, as he suggested, on better terms than those who are so long established, not alone in the six existing member countries but in the other three applicant countries, particularly Britain.</P>
    <P>We are, as I said, discussing two issues in this but we do not know the terms because as yet we have not had a White Paper.  It may be said that this White Paper is being delayed because there are some things yet to be decided on, for example the question of fisheries.  I believe we should have had a White Paper.  Maybe I am wrong in this, maybe there are other things to be cleared up, but we could have had a White Paper on all the other matters and have a special report on the outcome of the negotiations on fisheries.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to discuss the implications of membership of the Common Market in this particular debate because I do not think it is one which lends itself to a discussion on the implications.  We are discussing a measure which it is proposed to put before the people and as of now we do not know the terms which have been discussed by our Government and we do not know what specifically are the Constitutional changes to be made. This is a very important question for the people to decide but the unfortunate truth is our tragic dependence on the British economy has certainly got us into a dilemma.  Of course, we do not now hear the declaration by the former distinguished Taoiseach who suggested on one occasion that we would go it alone.</P>
    <P>We should be absolutely clear on this.  The decision with regard to the British application, if successful or otherwise, because they have not yet made a definite decision, will influence the decision of the Irish nation, having regard to the dependence of the Irish economy on the British market and on the British economy.  It is a complex and a many-sided problem.  I do not <Col N="1370" /> think we should try to convince the people to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I believe we should approach this matter objectively and honestly.  Above all we should think of the people and think of the unfortunate record that we have had for such a long time in respect of the smallness of the increase in the gross national product, the unemployment figures we have and other economic indications which show that becoming members of the European Economic Community can indeed be disastrous for many hundreds of workers in this country.</P>
    <P>The decision to be made will drastically transform the economic and political life of this country.  The Bill introduced by the Taoiseach this morning sets down the wording of a new subsection to the Constitution. This certainly has added confusion. There was confusion in the minds of the Fine Gael Party with regard to the alternative they intend to propose, which we hope we will see very soon. It has introduced some complications which had not been anticipated.  My party believe that these new complications, as far as the Constitution is concerned, are highly dangerous indeed. I remember on a few occasions the Taoiseach said that the actual changes to be made in the Constitution would be made known but as yet we only have this blank cheque that the Government hope to get passed by a majority in this House.  They say that this is consequent on our membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>We have no dispute with the first sentence of the proposal because we have always asked the Taoiseach inside this House and outside it that the question be put fairly and squarely to the people, giving them all the information necessary for them to make up their minds whether they would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that simple proposal.</P>
    <P>We have no criticism to make of that only to say, as we have said during the last four years, that we do not agree with the proposal to join the EEC, and there is no new evidence to suggest that we should change our minds because as far as the terms are concerned we know very little.  All we <Col N="1371" /> know is that there was not a genuine effort on the part of the Government or any of their spokesmen to negotiate terms that would safeguard employment, particularly of people in weak sectors of our industry.</P>
    <P>Logically, and I suppose that is what Deputy Gallagher implied, we should be supporting this Bill so that it could be put to the people as soon as possible after the White Paper has been issued.  Our opposition to the Bill is not in regard to the first sentence of the proposal, even though we will be asking the people to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; because we believe, in accordance with the information, or lack of information, that we have had there has not been any effort to negotiate as we believe the Government should have negotiated having regard to the state of our economy.</P>
    <P>The second sentence of the proposal is a different matter and frankly we do not want that to go to the people by way of referendum in the manner in which it is presented to us now.  It has been quoted, I suppose, by every Deputy who has spoken in the House, but I want for the record to quote it again.  The second sentence is:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State. </P>
    <P>The key phrase as far as I am concerned, and as far as my party are concerned, is that which says:</P>
    <P>...consequent on membership of the Communities, </P>
    <P>I am not sure that I know what that means.  Does it mean, as in my view it does, that there can be no conflict between any law or act of this State and of the Communities arising out of EEC membership and the existing provisions of our Constitution? There cannot be a conflict because this provision overrides all other Articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> I know it may be pleaded that the changes must be related to our membership of the three Communities, but how that is to be determined is something which must be spelled out in this debate, something that must be made perfectly clear to the people who will have to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that proposal.  Deputy Tully mentioned Article 28 (3) and said it had the same effect.  Of course it has the same effect.  It is the one that enables the Offences Against the State Act to be passed and I do not need to quote it because Deputy Tully did so during the course of his remarks on it.</P>
    <P>In any case, the sub-section can override all other sections of the Constitution, and the proposal of the Taoiseach is not specific.  I was about to describe it as a general form of amendment, but I think a better description would be that it is a blank cheque for a Fianna Fáil Government, for any Government, to make what changes in their judgment are necessary for membership of the three Communities.</P>
    <P>I wonder what has happened about the committee the Taoiseach told us he would establish, perhaps six or nine months ago, when he was questioned about the changes necessary in the Constitution.  That reminds me that about two years ago, when we suggested it would be necessary to change the Constitution, we were &mdash; I will not say assured &mdash; but we were given the opinion that it would not be necessary to make changes at all.</P>

      <P>We had a long discourse from somebody who described himself as a constitutional lawyer.  Deputy de Valera gave us a long defini-tion, or non-definition, of sovereignty over a period of five or ten minutes and he pushed it aside and said it did not matter, that in our Constitution it would not affect our position in the EEC.  He said that was a section that need not be removed.  I wonder if this will be in the package when the Constitution comes to be amended?</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach what was to be the function of the committee which he said were to be established under the chairmanship of the Attorney General.  We were told the committee were to examine the Constitution to see what changes or amendments might be necessary in order to qualify this country for EEC membership and for membership of the other Communities in accordance with the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>I remember another occasion when Deputy Haughey &mdash; I do not know in which capacity, perhaps as Minister for Finance &mdash; listed three or four amendments that originally appeared to be harmless because they did not appear to do much damage, but the Government in a White Paper listed six, seven or eight.  Whether they are the specific amendments in this package I do not know.  I know it is not good enough to ask the House to give approval to a Bill in respect of changes in the Constitution by putting the proposal in this way.  Neither is it fair to the people to be asked to vote on such a vague suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the campaign for the Constitution of 1937.  I think the campaign was engaged in in 1936.  At any rate, the people knew what was in the Constitution.  It appeared to be a harmless sort of Constitution and the people had an idea of what was in it.  May I say this objectively?  That referendum <Col N="1374" /> was held at a time coinciding with local elections and, of course, the referendum was not for or against the Constitution but for or against Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour.  One of the few merits I see in this proposed referendum is that it is being presented on its own, not tied up, I hope, with local elections or a general election.  I should not refer to a Presidential election, because that does not arise.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what has happened to this committee.  Will this committee be the advisers of the Government if the proposals contained in the referendum are passed?  Does this new subsection which it is proposed to insert into the Constitution mean that laws passed in consequence of EEC membership will not be referable to the Supreme Court?  This has to be said and the people must know what they are voting for.  Will we have two sorts of law passed by the Oireachtas, one, laws amenable to whatever is left of the Constitution and the courts of this country and, two, those which are not? Or even a third form, Commissioners' regulations and directives?  These laws that do not go to the Oireachtas at all are not referable to the courts because they are already passed by the EEC Commissioners.</P>
    <P>So far as regulations are concerned, and so far as my information goes, there have been 6,000 regulations made by the Commissioners.  If this country becomes a member of the EEC I presume we must accept these regulations. They do not have to be implemented by way of ministerial order or get the approval of this House.  What is the point in a written Constitution if there is a clause to the effect that certain laws, Acts or measures are to be placed above and beyond the Constitution in which that particular phrase is embodied? In my view, if passed, this Bill will make a mockery of the Constitution. It has been described by Deputy Tully as a sloppy, careless piece of draftsmanship.  We have had some examples of this from the Government over recent years.  We have had the Marts Bill which was deemed to be unconstitutional.  On that particular occasion the lawyer Deputies warned the Government of the time that on <Col N="1375" /> reference to the High Court, in their view, it would be deemed to be unconstitutional. We had the Electoral Act in which Deputy Dr. O'Donovan was involved.  That was also deemed unconstitutional.  When Mr. de Valera was Taoiseach we had the Sinn Féin Funds Bill.  That Bill, because of sloppy and careless draftsmanship, was deemed to be unconstitutional.  Legislation was introduced to give new powers to the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate the disposal of certain moneys in which, it was alleged, certain Members of this House were involved and this, too, was deemed to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the High Court or the Supreme Court view of this Bill would be?  What would their view be of a proposal to the effect that we would give this blank cheque to whoever were the Government and whoever had a majority to change the Constitution to provide for acceptance into any of these three Communities?  It is possible &mdash; one could plead anything &mdash; that another section is being introduced into the Constitution in accordance with the articles of the Treaty of Rome or the other two Treaties which have been mentioned in this Bill.  This is not just a Bill.  It is something farreaching, indeed.  The Constitution is being amended, or it is proposed that it be amended, and I believe that the very nature of the constitution, in which the Fianna Fáil Party have always expressed such pride, is being threatened.  Maybe it is unintentional that it is being threatened, but this is happening with no less effect than if it were done deliberately.  I do not believe it is done entirely for legal reasons.  I may be wrong on that.  The Taoiseach will have to prove otherwise. I believe that the Government do not want to specify article by article, section by section, and sub-section by sub-section the changes necessary for membership of the EEC and of the two Communities.  They would find it very difficult to explain why certain of these articles were to be changed or deleted.  I do not believe that they want to admit that Article 6.2 to which Deputy Vivion de Valera referred would have to be amended.  It reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> 2.  These powers of government are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear not alone to the people but to the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party that this is one of the possible amendments.  Article 15.2 might have to be amended.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.</P>
    <P>The regulations of EEC will become domestic law in this country without any reference to the Oireachtas.  The Government may not want to have to explain to the Fianna Fáil Party that Articles 29.5 and 29.6 will have to be amended in relation to international agreements.  Article 34.1 and 34.4. 6º will have to be amended.  Article 34. 4.6º reads:</P>
    <P>The decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>If it is said that this should be deleted the Government should have the added responsibility of telling their constituents or those to whom they speak that this will disappear from the Constitution that was drafted under the leadership of Mr. de Valera.  I believe that it has been put in this form because the Government do not want to be put in the embarrassing position of admitting the extent to which the Constitution which was framed by Mr. de Valera is about to be revised for EEC membership.  One can imagine a Fianna Fáil Deputy standing on a wall in the country or outside a church explaining why we are amending Article 34 or any such Article of the Constitution.  It is easier for him to say &ldquo;Vote `yes' because we in the Fianna Fáil Party say so&rdquo;.  He does not then have to defend the various changes in the Constitution which are being made.  The import of this apparently innocent second sentence contained in the Schedule to the Bill extends even beyond the points which I have made What is also in question is the way in which the Constitution is now being amended.  In my view the new proposal <Col N="1377" /> is contrary to the spirit of Article 46.1 which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Any provision of this Constitution may be amended, whether by way of variation, addition or repeal,...</P>
    <P>That procedure is not being followed in this instance.  On the contrary, we have the dangerous innovation of one subsection overriding and thereby repealing unspecified sections of the Constitution although they would still be written into the text of that very Con-sitution. I do not think it is a fair and clear way to put such a drastic change in our Constitution to the people.  The proposals contained in the Constitution of 1937 were very well-known and the people had an idea of what they were voting for or voting against.  The Government's proposal, if carried, will be tantamount to a constitutional mess.  We will oppose the Second Reading certainly, and I think we have given adequate reasons for doing so, and for supporting the amendment proposed by Deputy Keating and seconded by Deputy Thornley.  This proposal by the Government will make a shambles of the Constitution, and if the proposals suggested in the White Paper and by way of comment in this House are to be implemented, what are we left with in the Constitution?  We will be left with quite a number of platitudes about the duty of the State towards poor people and about the responsibility of the State in the matter of private enterprise. We will be left with lots of clichés and virtually no Constitution.</P>
    <P>I think every party in this House is in favour of having a Constitution, unlike some of the European countries, and if the Constitution is to be changed in such a drastic fashion, especially when one remembers that the Constitution needs to be changed, according to various comments and speeches by the Taoiseach, let us scrap this one entirely and put a different Constitution to the people of Ireland.  The three parties would be better served in engaging in that sort of exercise than in giving a blank cheque to the Government to change the Constitution to such an extent that there would be nothing left but platitudes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> This Constitution has been described as sectarian; this Constitution has been described, in certain of its Articles, as being a bar to the unity of this country.  We do not often have referenda in this country and I suppose this will be another big deal, and it is possible that we will not have the same opportunity to make the necessary changes in our Constitution, not alone to provide for the aspirations of the people in this part of the country, or for the people in the six counties of north-east Ulster, but the three parties should draft and agree on a Constitution that would be acceptable by all the people of the country.</P>
    <P>We reject this proposal that Ireland should become a member of the European Economic Community on what we believe to be the terms, or nonterms, and we reject this proposal because, in effect, it is giving a blank cheque to this Government to make a mess of the Constitution about which they have proudly boasted since 1937.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate &mdash; I must admit I did not hear the start of it &mdash; for some time now, it has appeared to me that two distinct things are coming up.  One is that certain members seem to wish to debate the rights or wrongs of entering the European Economic Community and others wish to debate very narrowly the subject now before us, namely, the proposal to amend the Constitution in this Bill which is now being debated on Second Reading, with the amendment from the Labour Party. I am no lawyer, and I would desire as far as possible to limit my remarks to a more general approach to the Second Stage and the Labour amendment, but at the same time it is necessary to draw attention to certain facts relating to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first fact one must draw attention to is that the Taoiseach did leave himself open to the accusation of asking for a blank cheque in his contribution this morning because he finalised his statement by saying that this was a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The first thing I want to say is that it is by no <Col N="1379" /> means, for the people, a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and it is not quite fair for the Taoiseach to say that this referendum is just a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;No&rdquo; situation. There are many complex things, many different factors that might make people change their minds on what way they would vote.  The necessity devolved on the Taoiseach, if not to go into every detail of our problems in relation to the Common Market &mdash; negotiations are as yet not complete &mdash; at least to be far more explicit than he was and to define precisely for what he was asking, remembering that each one of us here under the Constitution, which he is now desiring to amend, is merely a Deputy for 20,000 to 30,000 people, men, women and children.  Remember he still has a mandate at least to put the Members through the Division Lobby.</P>
    <P>As I stand here and as every other Member of the House stands here, whether of long or short service, of wordy debate or in, perhaps, complete silence, our position is that we have the responsibility on an amendment of the Constitution of representing these 20,000 to 30,000 people; some of them, are old, and, perhaps, in the case of backward districts because of their great age and the fact that there were no great educational facilities in their youth, quite uneducated; many of them are but children, and we here are facing to-night a situation in which we are giving a Second Reading to a Bill to amend the Constitution which is, in fact, the whole concept of the laws under which they must live.</P>
    <P>Their rights go back, whether it is in relation to a minor traffic offence, or, perhaps, the offence of being in a licensed premises after hours, away over in the quietude of Deputy Geoghegan's constituency to that Constitution and the district justice, the President, and the Supreme Court &mdash; everybody is bound by it.  So that for the Taoiseach to come in, as a senior lawyer himself, and say that this is simplicity, to change this Constituttion which his party pushed through this country with a determination which some of us barely remember and which <Col N="1380" /> many of us, including yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who might have a few more years on us, clearly remember, a determination which was unparalleled &mdash; to come in and say that the change is just a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;No&rdquo; is, in my view, not quite good enough.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to advert to a few of Deputy Corish's opening statements.  He said, and I think, in utter sincerity that he felt that from both sides of the House the Labour Party had been assailed because they were objecting to entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite specific about the approach of our party to this most important problem.  Decisions have been made within the various structures of our party.  We accepted the fact that, when Britain decided with a majority of 112 votes in the House of Commons to go into the Common Market, this country could not afford to pay the common external tariffs which would be raised against all our exports to Britain and to Europe and that therefore we had no choice.</P>
    <P>We were the first party to address ourselves &mdash; and I made this claim quite specifically &mdash; to the imminence of direct trade with Europe on a freer basis during the sixties.  We knew the degree of bargaining that was going on on the Continent and we felt that our Government were rather slipshod in their approach to this matter.  Like the Labour Party we criticised the Government, even though the Labour Party criticised the Government on the basis that they did not want to go into the Common Market.  We want to go in on the best terms possible in relation to employment, the expansion of our gross national product and the wellbeing of our people.</P>

I do not think the Fine Gael Party at any time acted as a crutch for anybody.  Having been 16 years in this House I look back with satisfaction on the work done by the inter-Party Government from 1954 to 1957 and on the great spirit of camaraderie and the friendships that existed then between myself as a young Deputy who, I admit, came in here thinking more about football and perhaps even lighter themes than of poli-tics, and men like the late Jim Everett. In this matter the Fine Gael Party are acting as a crutch for nobody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that the Labour Party decided that their amendment on Second Stage was the proper way to deal with this loose piece of legislation which was introduced by the Taoiseach in a loose and improper way.  We decided in our wisdom, or lack of it, that the right procedure was to deal with this Bill on Committee Stage and to put down reasoned amendments.  The question of whether we were right or the Labour Party were right can be decided when this debate is over.  There is no rivalry on this matter and there is no question of any antipathy between the two parties.  The fact that the Labour Party are opposing entry may have led them <Col N="1382" /> to take a different line from the line we are taking.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that the Taoiseach came in here this morning looking for a blank cheque.  We will deal with that on Committee Stage.  The Labour Party have set about dealing with it in their own way on Second Stage. This morning when the Taoiseach said it was a question of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; he exposed the fact that the Government cannot get across to the people any of the details or difficulties or advantages in their approach to the Common Market because of their own disastrous political situation and because of the fact that the only way the Taoiseach can succeed in staying here is by trotting dissidents through the division lobbies.  This is not a strong Government doing their job as it should be done.</P>
      <P>In asking for that blank cheque, instead of going into all the details involved in entry into Europe, he exposed the fact that at the moment the priority is not this Bill and is not what is known as the Value-Added Tax Bill, but a general election.  There is no doubt about that.  This is the most important matter that has affected this country in decades.  The Taoiseach gave us a simple explanation of the draftsmanship of the Bill and no more than that.  Having done that, to say that he is asking the people for a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; is unfair to the people and improper, and it exposes his own party's weakness and his own weakness in not being in a position to tell the people the facts concerning what changes there will be and when we can expect such changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of things to be said in relation to this Bill and, with respect, I would submit that the Taoiseach should comment on these matters rather than have them commented on by an ordinary Member such as myself. For instance, those who have made a close study of the Common Market in so far as we are concerned, tell us that if we join, there will accrue to the Exchequer here in 1973 between £30 million and £40 million in agricultural subsidies that will not have to be paid and that in the first year there will be <Col N="1383" /> a minus sum on that by way of contribution to Brussels of £3 million which figure will probably increase to about £10 million within five years. Surely the Taoiseach should have said that the matter has been studied in depth, that the farmers will get their prices and that most of the amount that we save by way of agricultural subsidies will be devoted to the relief of social welfare recipients.  However, we will be in Government when the time comes to do that because one can sin for a certain length of time and get away with it but when the sinning continues for too long, it catches up with one.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that in dealing with an amendment to the Constitution, particularly in respect of an Article such as Article 28, the Taoiseach would have considered himself obliged to deal with the question of our sovereignty but he did not do so and, in fact, has made light of the subject on other occasions here. Article 28.4.2º reads:</P>
    <P>The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State adminis-tered by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>What about the particular items that may have to be dealt with in Brussels? What about the collective situation in respect of Article 43 relating to private property?  Article 43.1.1º reads:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.</P>
    <P>Article 43.1.2º is as follows:</P>
    <P>The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.</P>
    <P>I have here a leaflet which was issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs on what will be the position in respect of the purchase of land by non-nationals. In this leaflet we are told <Col N="1384" /> that the Land Act of 1965 governs the purchase of agricultural land in this country by non-nationals and that the Act lays down that non-nationals who have not lived continuously in Ireland for at least seven years cannot buy rural land except with the permission of the Land Commission.  We are told that rural land required for industrial purposes and holdings of up to five acres for residential purposes are exempt from the requirement and that non-nationals who have lived in Ireland for seven years or more may purchase land on the same terms as Irish nationals.  In Article 43 I take &ldquo;man&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo;.  I do not know whether I am correct in that but Article 43 raises the question in relation to our land.  There is the question as to whether non-nationals will have to be given the right to buy Irish land on the same terms as our own people and that any strictures such as those imposed by the 1965 Land Act in respect of the purchase or selling of land when such land might be needed for uneconomic holdings could be the only stricture applied to people from Holland, France or anywhere else so long as they had resided here for a given period.</P>
    <P>This is not a simple amendment to our Constitution.  The two Opposition parties here, whatever their general approach to entry into Europe, are faced with this situation.  If the Government get their way and this Bill is passed, the measure will be going through the House at the same time as what is probably the most complex Finance Bill of the decade is being put through its Final Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not read it either but when I mentioned the Bill to somebody a short time ago, the rele-vant passage in the newspaper was brought to my notice.  This is a responsible <Col N="1385" /> reporter's opinion.  It can be no better or no worse than the opinion of any responsible Member of this House, depending on how informed it was.  We have been asked to give a speedy passage to the Second Reading of this Bill although Members of this House do not know whether this referendum will be debated at every chapel gate, in every public house and at every hearthstone in Ireland at the same time as the effects of the value-added tax Bill are being debated.  I contend that it is totally impossible to expect a nation of employees, of very few large employers, of small employers, of very many small shopkeepers and of people who provide the various services, to take a decision on this particular issue when facing them are the effects of value-added tax.  Although I was rap-porteur to the economic committee of the Council of Europe on value-added tax less than four years ago, I should not like to have to stand up and talk on that particular Bill for any length of time.</P>
      <P>We have to make a decision on whether to allow this Bill through the House and at a street corner in Limerick or in a place like Ballymakenny in County Louth, Deputy Coughlan and I will have to discuss entry into the Common Market and at the same time explain what effect value-added tax will have on a farmer, a shopkeeper, a schoolteacher, a garda or a postman. That would certainly sway my decision on whether this Bill should go through speedily or not and in what form it should go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things to which we must address our minds is that whatever the decision of Opposition members may be on entry into Europe when every possible arrangement has been publicly produced, there is still the problem of whether this Bill should go through in its present form, whether it should be amended or whether it should be delayed.  You have that on your mind knowing that the Taoiseach seems to be able to trot 75 people through the division lobby.  That problem is there.  As a pragmatic practising politician, I would suggest that perhaps the most enthusiastic European in our party is Deputy FitzGerald.  I <Col N="1386" /> should not dream of suggesting who might be the most active anti-European in the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

      <P>I should not dream of suggesting who is the greatest anti-European in the Fianna Fáil Party either, or who is the most enthusiastic, but whoever they are, it does not matter which party they are in, the question of value-added tax arises and when this Bill should go before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned something that saddens us all &mdash; the question of older people in remote areas; the question, even, of older people who had been in poor employment in towns in times that were unjust and the fact that they have not had the benefit of the education that Members of this House have had and that our children are now enjoying and that, indeed, most of the people of our age enjoyed. How are we to decide, if the Government will not tell us, whether we should have this Bill and the other one discussed at every street corner in the country or whether this Bill should be held up?  These are matters that are of direct relevance to this Bill. A practical approach to this Bill would be that on Committee Stage the reasoned amendments of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; I have no doubt that if the Second Stage is passed and the dissidents walk through the lobby with the Taoiseach that the Labour Party will have reasoned amendments down as well &mdash; should be considered by the Government not in any party political way but in a responsible way and that the views of the Opposition Party should have as much importance in their minds as the set course they prepared for themselves so many weeks ago.  There was a set course prepared and I think that at the moment the ship that is sailing that course is rocking in a storm.  I agree with Deputy O'Donovan that the probability is that the value-added tax Bill will be jettisoned but what was the urgency anyway and why confuse this highly important amendment to the Constitution <Col N="1387" /> with this highly involved Bill? Do the people know what the people in the House should know, that the Italians signed the Treaty of Rome in 1958 and that they now have got their last six months notification that they must introduce value-added tax? I do not want this debate to meander on to value-added tax but it is a long time since 1958 and when one finds that our Government take the attitude first that value-added tax must be applied on January 1st, 1972&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>At any period the net value of the tangible assets is equal to the amount of capital employed</P>
    <P> * Accounts for 1971 not yet available.</P>
    <P>** The Racing Board has no loan, preference or ordinary share capital.  The figures shown for capital employed above are the net assets at the end of each accounting year and represent the accumulated surpluses of the Racing Board and its predecessor, the Board of Control for Mechanical Betting, since the formation of the latter in 1930.</P>
    <P>*** In the case of the Racing Board there is no yield in the commercial sense on capital employed.  Similarly the Board's accounts record no profit or loss in the commercial sense. The Board's income is applied to administration expenses and grants for the benefit of horse racing.  The accounts record a loss of £23,000 in 1968 and surpluses (accumulated) of £42,000 and £71,000 in 1969 and 1970 respectively. </P>
