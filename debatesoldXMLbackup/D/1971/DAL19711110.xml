      <P>The introduction of value added tax at this time could be disastrous for the economy.  It will only exacerbate a situation which is giving rise to considerable concern at the moment in all sections of the community. Prices have spiralled.  The country has not got over the shocks following decimalisation.  The Minister for Finance may grin at this and think it is of no concern.  Obviously, he is not aware of the concern of the people who do not fully understand the situation following decimalisation.  As I have said before, decimalisation was a psychological confidence trick on the public.  They have not yet recovered from the shock.  I often hear people saying that they do not understand it but that they are not able to buy the essentials of life for their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have massive protests soon from the public about the cost of living. People are waking up to the fact that they cannot continue enduring the effects of the high cost of living.  The increases in the cost of living are felt very much by those on fixed incomes, those in the really lower income group and those on old age or disability pensions. <Col N="1581" /> It is becoming more than obvious that these people are deprived of the essentials of living.  I have heard it said that poverty does not exist in Ireland and that our country has become a rich man's club.  Unfortunately, those who are most badly hit by the rising costs are the people who are unable to articulate their grievances. These are the silent people who suffer. Many of them suffer from malnutrition. They make little or no protest.  They just accept their position as normal. We do not recognise their problems or do anything to help them.  The Minister should not say that the value added tax will make little or no change in the cost of living.  The Minister said yesterday:</P>
    <P>The tax proposals represent little more than a change in the method of collection and their incidence and impact on prices should be broadly similar to the incidence and impact of the present sales taxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that this is a lie and is not correct.  It is not correct to say that value added tax will have little or no impact.</P>
    <P>Why must we take this initiative? Why must we push this tax through without giving the public an opportunity of discussing and considering it and letting the Government know their opinion of it?  It is not vital that this tax should be introduced before Christmas or early in the New Year. There is no urgency about it.  It is not a precondition for entry into the EEC. If it were the Italians would not only now be thinking of introducing a value added tax.  They would have been compelled to introduce it long ago, which they were not.  They propose to do so in the future.  I have not seen any demand in the discussions between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers of the EEC for the introduction of a value added tax before we are admitted into the EEC.  Britain says she will consider introducing it by 1973.</P>
    <P>When I told the Minister there was public concern about this and that he should postpone it, he said he would postpone it for two months.  That is not long enough to give the public an opportunity to discuss it.  The Minister <Col N="1582" /> has received representations from various business interests but he has not received representations from the public. The public want an opportunity to think about it.  The Minister has not tried to explain it to the public.  Can you imagine small companies and small businesses trying to work out percentages such as 15.56 or 5.26 or 16.37?  Can you imagine how complicated life will be under this new method of taxation?  Life will be so complicated that more small businesses will have to close down.  It is obvious that the Minister has this in mind and that he wants to put an end to these small businesses.  He will not let them survive. They already have a tough problem but he has decided to make life more and more difficult for them.  Can you imagine 16.37 per cent being worked out on a product costing ten or 15 pence?  It is utterly ridiculous. Why was it not worked out to the nearest unit and fixed at 15 or 16 per cent?  Because the Minister knows the value added tax will bring in more revenue.</P>
    <P>Small business people have been unpaid tax collectors for too long.  I had discussions with grocers with small businesses and it was interesting to hear their grievances and the justification for their complaints.  They mentioned that a ¼lb. of Lyon's tea costs 2/6d.  The label states that it costs 2/6d but when they tell a customer that they have to add on turnover tax naturally the customer resents it.  The small trader is obliged by the Minister to add on the tax or else he has to pay it himself. That is one of the problems created for those people.  They have to try to explain the Government tax. The Government should have been explaining it.  The Government said: &ldquo;We do not care how you collect it. Just have the money for us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They fooled the public into thinking that the tax was 2½ or 5 per cent. People thought that if something cost £100 they would have to pay £105 but if you bought something costing £100 you had to pay £106 because the person who sold it to you had to pay turnover tax on the £100 plus the 5 per cent.  This was the fraud and the deception in the turnover tax.  These uneven <Col N="1583" /> figures such as 16.3 per cent expose the fact that we did not have a 5 per cent turnover tax and that it was not a proper sales tax.  It was a tax on tax.  The people were duped for too long about this.</P>
    <P>There is mounting public concern about the taxation system.  We find now that the overhead expenses of small businesses have increased enormously with the result that they are closing down, and more will have to close down if the Minister persists in this proposal.  Why is there not some public educational programme in relation to VAT?  Why is it not explained to residents' associations? Surely the educational programme on VAT should not be confined to business people only.  Why not extend it to radio and television programmes? Let us ask the public to comment on it.  We are not in the EEC yet.  We must have a referendum and the wishes of the people must be taken into consideration.  I think we are jumping the gun.  We must have a referendum to find out how the people feel about entry into the EEC.  This should be thrashed out before we talk about VAT.  We should be trying to find out if conditions and terms for entry are satisfactory and safeguard the rights of the people.</P>
    <P>If it is not the intention to collect more tax, why is there this urgency to shove this Bill through?  The Minister has admitted that the turnover and wholesale taxes are simple to operate and that the administrative cost is low. He says it is less than 1 per cent.  He has not explained what the administrative cost will be of operating VAT.  I have no doubt that it will be five times as much as the cost of operating the present system because it is so complicated.  It cannot be operated as effectively, or as simply, or as readily as the turnover and wholesale taxes. It is complicated all along the line. The Minister's excuse is typical of the Minister.  It is the petty mind which thinks: &ldquo;I am afraid that under the present system there may be fraud.&rdquo; This runs through every debate in which the Minister has participated.</P>
    <P>It costs 25p to 50p to collect 10p <Col N="1584" /> turnover tax on books which come here for review.  This is the petty mind operating our tax structure.  The Minister is always thinking in terms of fraud and of people trying to defraud the Department.  The amount of fraud is very small.  If we have to bring in a complicated system to prevent fraud we might as well give up altogether because it will cost too much.  We could have an army of civil servants and others employed in trying to detect fraud and evasion.  This would not be worth the effort.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for bringing in VAT and the Minister knows it.  In every contribution he makes in this House foremost in the Minister's mind is the fact that people are trying to defraud the Government, the tax authorities, and the Department of Finance.  This is no excuse for bringing in VAT.  If my life and the lives of others are to be made much more complicated so that the Minister may save a few thousand pounds I say that is not worth it.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked the postmen to collect the turnover tax on these books. We know the delay involved in trying to collect 5d or 10d.  It costs almost 50p to collect 5p or 10p.  This system will operate in the case of value added tax.  Life will become much more complicated. The Minister has not given a satisfactory answer to the small traders.  Will their life be easier or will they be more and more involved in tax collection and have less time for their normal business?  Could we not have waited until we had seen how the system operates in Britain?  Could we have learned a lesson from Britain?  I have heard Government Ministers here saying that they would wait until Britain had introduced a certain measure so that we could learn from their experience.  Could we not wait and learn from the experience in Britain in relation to value added tax?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he personally has seen how the value added tax system operates in France, Germany, Belgium and the other EEC countries that have that system?  I can tell the Minister that the rates envisaged here on essential goods are higher than in any of the EEC countries where the <Col N="1585" /> value added tax is in operation.  The Minister says that the value added tax will apply to the same goods as those to which the wholesale tax applies. Would the Minister consider toothpaste to be a luxury article?  Does he regard it as a medicinal article?  If toothpaste is considered a luxury article, it shows little concern for the health of our people.  Advertising campaigns urge people to clean their teeth.  Yet, wholesale tax is applied to toothpaste on the basis that it is not an essential commodity. There is wholesale tax on medicinal shampoos for the treatment of diseases of the scalp on the basis that they are not essential items, that they are luxuries.  The same system will operate under the value added tax.  The Minister has not excluded essentials like medicines but he does exclude pet foods.  Medicines do not matter to the Minister, pet foods do.  I wonder has the Minister gone balmy?</P>
    <P>This would have been a tremendous opportunity for the Minister to correct mistakes made by his predecessors and to exclude from tax medicines for human consumption.  It is an absolute disgrace that medicines for animals should be regarded as more important than medicines for human beings. Medicines for cattle, dogs and other animals are excluded but turnover tax is payable when it comes to the health of the people.  That has been the system and the Minister is going to continue it under VAT.  It is a crazy system.  The Minister has not the courage to say that a mistake has been made and that he will correct it when VAT is introduced.  I should like to know what the Minister will do about it, whether commodities such as I have mentioned are considered more important than pet foods.</P>
    <P>There are a few points in the Minister's speech that I should like to ask him about.  How long more has Italy got before she will be obliged to introduce VAT?  This is important for us. The onus is on the Minister for Finance to answer that question and to tell us why Italy has not yet introduced VAT. Italy has been in the EEC since the beginning.  The Minister says that Italy has not introduced VAT yet.  If Italy has not introduced it I should like to <Col N="1586" /> know why we are forced to do it now.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the Bill has been drafted to conform as far as possible to the directives of the EEC.  The directives of the EEC are to apply to us but they do not apply to Italy.  There is something farcical about this.  If the directives do not lay down standard rates for the tax, why is the present system not acceptable to the EEC or has the EEC told us that the present system is unacceptable to them?  I should like the Minister for Finance to answer that.</P>

      <P>I will not have the resources of this State employed chasing a few evaders of tax.  If the Minister employs a postman to collect 10p and it costs 50p to do it, I say <Col N="1588" /> there is something cockeyed about the system.  If the Minister can defend that, he had better get out of office fast because his rationale is completely wrong.  The Minister for Finance is out of step.  He does not understand the basic rules of economics.  One cannot employ 50p to collect 10p.  If that is the system, he is the wrong Minister for Finance.  I would say that he has a social conscience but I think the Minister should get into another Department. He does not understand finance.</P>

      <P>Quite right.  I appreciate your tolerance.  You have been more than tolerant.  I want to emphasise a particular point about this. We have a Civil Service employed for the operation of the different Departments, but if we introduce a complicated system like this just to catch <Col N="1589" /> a few evaders it is not right that they should have to waste time on it.  There are a few people evading the turnover tax and the wholesale tax.  This complicated tax will make people's lives very difficult.  I spoke to an accountant the other day who said to me: &ldquo;For God's sake, when are you going to get rid of Colley?  He is making life a hell for us.  He is changing this and changing that.  Whatever they said about his predecessor he understood people and did not make their lives difficult.&rdquo;  I know the Department of Finance are saying the same thing about the Minister. He is as cockeyed about this thing as he is about other things.</P>

      <P>Have a bit of sense.  If there are five countries in the EEC operating this system how can the <Col N="1590" /> Deputy say that it is an impossibly complicated system and that the country will be ruined by it?  Let us have a rational approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister very much.  I would like an explanation as to why Italy has not introduced this tax yet.  I would like to know why Britain has not introduced it yet, why we must be ahead, why we cannot give the public an opportunity to study this tax.  You could learn from the public.  If we are to have a complicated tax system like this once this Bill becomes an Act you cannot change it.  The Civil Service who will operate it have to go according to the letter of the law.  It is not democratic if this Bill is to be bulldozed through without giving the public an opportunity to study it.  Last May I asked the Minister if he would extend the time to give the people an understanding of it.</P>
      <P>I spoke to many people about this tax and asked them if they knew anything about it.  They asked me where they could learn about it.  There is a lot of pressing legislation which we need and the Government are talking about lack of time.  This is not urgent. The Minister is collecting a lot of money as it is.  He says the increase in revenue will not be there so therefore the Exchequer will not gain or lose by this.  I will be glad to meet the Minister on any point but I am not prepared to meet him on this.  If he means what he has said and is not telling a fraudulent lie there is no urgency about this and we could postpone it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should spend a little money from the Department of Finance in having a few of his inspectors invite the associations to participate in discussions on this tax.  I do not think this would be too difficult.  I know there are many men in his Department who are very keen on doing something like this.  There should be public discussion on this matter.  No Minister can decide whether a thing is complicated or not without hearing the views of the public on it.  What section of the public has been fully informed about this?  Is it just the traders or the manufacturers?  I am being fair to the <Col N="1591" /> Minister, despite what I say about him, in asking him this.  Has the Minister gone to the public and said: &ldquo;We are changing the system; there will be a new system.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is obvious the public do not know about it.  I am a little dense on this and all I can see is the difficulty of people trying to work out 16.37 per cent of a carton of Vim. When you operated the other system it was 15 per cent of a certain figure but now you will have to operate this complicated figure.  Could the Minister explain how the operation of 2.68 per cent or 3.85 per cent will be easy? There is silence again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I want to explain to the Minister.  This 5.26 per cent will apply to an individual item. Before it was 5 per cent of a total turnover. That is the difference.  The other was turnover tax.  This is tax on individual items.  Has that gone through to the Minister's brain?  Now will he answer that?  This is the difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the tax that operated and this one.  If a man had a turnover of £1,000 he paid 5 per cent of that.  This will be 5.26 per cent on an individual item. On something costing 18p the tax will be 5.26 per cent of that.  Am I right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has a turnover on items worth £1,000, at 5.26 per cent he would pay 5.26 per cent of £1,000, and if he has another turnover on the higher rate he will pay on that; although, as I have indicated, there are ways of arriving at approximate figures for small shopkeepers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the documents and it has not been clarified for me.  I wish it were, and I am <Col N="1594" /> prepared to go to any course that the Minister or his Department arranges.  I even went to one where the inspector came out from the Department to small traders.  I attended to try to be edified, but unfortunately it was not explained. Is this not all the more reason why we should postpone this, have a programme of education on it and ask the public's opinion on it?  Would the Minister not seriously consider this in the interest of everyone, small businesses, manufacturers and the public, the public who want an explanation of what is happening when the cost of living goes up more and more?  If the Minister will do this I shall be prepared to co-operate with him in any way, and I shall certainly encourage people to attend these meetings and learn about it.</P>
      <P>I think we are putting the cart before the horse.  We are trying to put this through before the public know anything about it.  Even a Minister is trying to look through documents himself to see if he can get an explanation of it.  I can tell him this much, and I say this without fear of contradiction, the Minister does not understand the value-added tax.  He can tell you the broad principles of it; I can tell you the broad principles of it, but he cannot tell you how it operates.  He cannot explain the situation in regard to 5.26 per cent on an individual item, because VAT refers to tax on individual items; this is the whole purpose of it, tax added on along the line.  I would love to hear about that from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I want this out of the Dáil until the Minister gives the people a chance to study it.  That is what I am asking.  The Minister says:</P>
      <P>It has been stated in the press and elsewhere that the value-added tax has resulted in severe inflation in the continental countries which have adopted it and that similar results may be expected here.</P>
      <P>Then he says what we are doing here is limited almost entirely to a change in the method of collecting tax.  I thought it was just a change in the method.  So we can take it that it is not limited to that.  Perhaps the Minister will explain what he means by &ldquo;almost entirely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister also says that all of the countries which had unhappy experiences on the changeover were attempting to do much more.  He is admitting that when there was a changeover to this value added tax from the previous tax there were unhappy experiences in the EEC countries. This is exactly what happened and this is why there is cause for public concern in this country.  The changeover in the continental countries created chaos.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unhappy experiences&rdquo; is a euphemism for what happened.  It was a dastardly thing that happened in these countries.  We have a right to know exactly what happened in the change-over to the VAT, and to see what can be done about it here to avoid a repetition of the chaotic situation in some of these countries.  It comes to my mind when I see this here and the Minister has admitted it here.  He said they had &ldquo;unhappy experiences&rdquo;.  This is serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I will just go over it again.  &ldquo;There will, therefore, be no ground for an increase in prices generally.&rdquo;  This is like the Taoiseach&mdash;this is just an aside&mdash;in his speech about Deputy Des Foley; he said he would initiate no action, but that did not mean that others would not.  You have to read the speeches of Ministers and the Taoiseach very carefully.  Now might I ask the Minister to elaborate and explain because one has to read between the lines here?  He says: &ldquo;There will, therefore, be no ground for an increase in prices generally, though there may be some minor changes...&rdquo; A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I do not know whether or not you have noticed it, but in regard to minor changes, if one looks up the <i>Oxford Dictionary,</i> one finds there are no such things as &ldquo;minor changes&rdquo;.  This is a relative term.  If a woman buys a piece of meat or some essential foodstuff, minor changes can mean anything.  You could not confine the term to anything definite.  To the Minister for Finance a change of 10p in the price of a piece of meat is a minor change; to an old age pensioner it is disastrous.  I want this clarified.  I am not going over individual sections of the Bill, but I am dealing with what the Minister says here and &ldquo;minor changes&rdquo; to the Minister are not minor changes to somebody on a fixed income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister grasps the situation.  When an old age pensioner is asked for a rent increase of 5p she does not sleep.  She comes to me looking for an explanation.  To her it is disastrous, but to the Minister for Finance 5p means nothing.  It is a relative term, depending on the person to whom it applies.  The Minister has not spelled out these minor changes.  As the system operates the increases will be embodied at various stages along the line and this will have a more disastrous effect on the cost of living than decimalisation.  The country should be given an opportunity to recover from the shock of decimalisation before another shock increase is imposed.  Tremors from the decimalisation shock are still being felt.  The people most affected are <Col N="1604" /> those who are unable to voice their grievances, those who accept with resignation that this tax must be imposed, and they are hungry in consequence because they cannot afford basic essentials.</P>
    <P>It depends on what meetings you attend.  I heard of somebody at one of these exclusive clubs who thought the half penny should be abolished.  It was a nuisance which upset their change. Such people are out of touch with the significance of the half penny to the old age pensioner or the disabled persons. This is what is wrong.  It is because of the fact that the lowest coin is now the ½p that the cost of living went up so much.  In America they have 100 cents to the dollar or one-hundredth part of eight shillings but our smallest unit is the ½p which is really two and a half times that amount under the old currency system.  People say: &ldquo;It is up a ½p&rdquo; but it is much more than that.  We did not have a smaller unit and this was responsible in no small measure for the considerable increase in the cost of living.  Only now are the people feeling the tremors of that shock increase; they will be reeling if this new system is inflicted on them.</P>
    <P>If small businesses are compelled to operate this system, more and more people will have to be employed and overheads will be increased.  In addition to the tax itself these businesses will have to recoup the cost of extra labour involved in operating it, further increasing the cost of living.  The Minister admits the system we have is simple, easy to administer and costs less than 1 per cent for administering.  The Minister has not said that EEC countries have ruled out our present system.  He said it was the closest to the EEC system and if so, and if Italy has not yet introduced value-added tax why should we not ask to be permitted to retain the present tax system with wholesale and turnover tax?  Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked for that?  The Minister says there might be some cases of people attempting to defraud the Revenue; that will happen under every form of taxation and I do not think it justifies the introduction of this new system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> We should consider asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to find out if we could retain the present system during an interim period of a few years.  Rushing into this now will affect the cost of living considerably and do untold harm.  It will bring the people on the streets.  Housewives have reached the stage when we will get this bubble exploding and there will be people marching on the streets protesting against the terribly high cost of living. If this happens it will bring further chaos and confusion to the country.</P>

      <P>I was amused when I heard the Minister accusing Deputy O'Connell of backing tax evaders.  On one occasion here I pointed out that the Revenue Commissioners could unfairly tax somebody.  Legally, they could do so but morally they should not; yet they did it.  If one is to be fair the other must be fair.  I am not in favour of the tax evader but neither am I in favour of the Revenue Commissioners hammering somebody in the wrong.  The Minister told us this new system would simplify everything, that each person would pay a little more and it would not bear heavily on anybody.  Let us be honest about it: the customer pays for everything.  If a business takes in an accountant to work out turnover or value-added tax the cost is added to the price and the customer pays for it.  The man in the street pays for everything.  No large or small business can employ somebody unless it can afford to do so and if it cannot afford to do so on present prices it must increase its prices or go out of business.  This is the fact.  Anybody who says this will cost less is talking nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard of the 2½ per cent turnover tax; in actual fact it was 2.6 something per cent.  Then we had another 2½ per cent when the two Ministers were fighting as to who would be Minister for Finance.  Again, we found there was an increase that was more than 2.6 per cent.  Anybody who took up the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week could see that since decimalisation prices have increased and that the lowest increase is 15 per cent.  First, I should like to blame the previous <Col N="1606" /> Minister for Finance who said when introducing it that the ½p would go out after a while, that it would not matter, that 1.2d. would not matter.  There was no such thing as a six-tenth piece.  The lowest coin we now have is the ½p or 1.2d.  He told people that halfpennies did not matter any more and therefore we are really working on 2.4d as our lowest coin.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister pointed out that in 1964-65, the first year of the operation of the turnover tax, it yielded £13½ million, equal to about 6 per cent of total Government revenue. This year he said that the sales taxes combined are expected to produce about £80 million or up to 14½ per cent of total Government revenue. I should like to have, in respect of the same years, the percentages devoted to social welfare.  I should like to know what percentage of our total income is represented by our social services now as against 1964-65.  Then we would see where the money is missing and find out where it is going.</P>
    <P>I remember that the commission on income tax which was set up recommended turnover tax rather than direct taxation.  What happened?  It was introduced as an additional tax on top of the other taxes.  I came in here at that time.  I was elected at a by-election.  I remember Deputy Haughey appearing on television&mdash;he was not Minister for Finance then; he was then where he is now&mdash;and pointing out to the people that all they would have to pay was 2½ per cent.  First of all, that was incorrect. It was 2.625 per cent.  He told them that the old age pensioners would get an increase of 5, 6 or 7 per cent. Of course the 2½ per cent was on the amount of money they would spend on eating, drinking and buying clothes, the 6 per cent was only on 30s which all pensioners were getting at the time. That did not come out.  They were again misleading the people.  Let there be no doubt but that there will be an increase in the cost of living on account of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The present sales taxes are relatively simple to operate and economical to administer.  They were introduced in order to provide a <Col N="1607" /> broader base for indirect taxation than had been afforded by the traditional sources&mdash;mainly tobacco, beer, spirits and hydrocarbon oils&mdash; which had, up to then, provided the bulk of indirect tax revenue.</P>
    <P>I do not remember any recent Budget in which these items were not increased except when the 2½ per cent was put on.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>One of the biggest disadvantages of sales taxes such as our wholesale and turnover taxes, is that the duty of paying tax to the Revenue falls on one section of the business community only.  The value-added tax, on the other hand, has, as its principal feature, the spreading of the tax over the whole process of production and distribution.  We were also aware that the European Economic Community had prescribed a common form of value-added taxation for adoption by all member States and that, as members, we would be expected to introduce a similar type of tax in due course.</P>
    <P>I think we are mad to do it before England.  The Minister says it is easier to spread out this tax but I say the tax must be paid by the customer; who collects it does not matter.  However, if one takes the manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer, it is easier for one of those to employ an accountant to do it than for each of them to have to employ an accountant.  That means there will be three people doing the work which will result in higher prices. Admittedly in the smaller retail businesses it will simply put more onus on the employer himself but he will have to engage an outside accountant if he has not got an internal one and he will have to be paid because nobody can afford to work for nothing.  I cannot understand why the Minister could not say that the EEC are doing it and we must have some similar tax.  Also, our rates here can be different from those in continental countries.  The Minister already tried this with the corporation profits tax and had an uproar from the business community.  Where the business community could afford it they put <Col N="1608" /> it on to the customer again, where they could not afford it because of competition from England they wrapped up their businesses and disappeared.  One good thing about this tax is that imports are on the same basis as goods produced in the country and exports are on the same basis as goods produced in other countries.  The number of sales of items on which taxation is higher in Ireland than on the Continent will be less because there cannot be a good export market unless there is a good home market.  If an item is made more expensive there will be less sales at home which will make it less competitive abroad.</P>
    <P>When the turnover tax was introduced by Dr. Ryan&mdash;I do not think it was his brainchild but he was the man who put it on the table of this House&mdash; he said there would be no inspectors going round, that one would write in his turnover and send it in.  He expected us to believe that.  I said if anybody ran a business that way he would be broke the next day.  Of course, it did happen and when people forgot about it for a year or two inspectors were out and now they are checking and rechecking even more than the Revenue Commissioners do, because the Commissioners accept accountants' figures and the turnover tax people do not.  I do not blame them.  It is their job to collect what they can.  Now we have the Minister for Finance saying that there is avoidance of turnover tax. There may be but I would say it would be small.  I agree that the value-added tax will have cross references from various people.  The wholesaler will send in a figure and also the retailer and these can be checked against each other so there are industrial spies to make sure the Government will get their money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell pointed out that the turnover tax on £100 should be £5 but in fact tax was paid on £105, in other words a tax on tax.  The Minister has pointed out that this will stop this double taxation.  I think the amount gained is something like £3¼ million; it might be a lot more.</P>
    <P>There was one good thing about turnover tax.  If one was running a business and there was a shortage of <Col N="1609" /> stocks and a shortage of cash it was not in one's sales.  When turnover tax was first introduced I objected to the fact that one had to pay turnover tax on the net profit even though some of the goods might have disappeared. Under value-added tax one has to pay £10 tax on £100 worth of goods.  If £50 worth of those goods are stolen or broken one is £55 short.  I was talking recently to a representative from one of the big supermarket chains and he reckoned that on the 5.26 per cent, if they are to come out the same as they do under the turnover tax, they will either have to add a small percentage or get a rebate.</P>
    <P>With regard to exports the Minister pointed out that a manufacturer can collect whatever value-added tax he may have paid on his raw materials. There could be 20 or even 30 different raw materials and components and it would be very costly to have to make sure no value-added tax had been charged on all these items.  When the finished goods reach their destination value-added tax at the rate applicable to the country concerned is charged and the same will be the case on imports. All this is going to mean a great deal of paperwork.  Marks and Spencers decided some 25 years ago to get rid of most of their accountants and devise a new accounting system. The result was that their profits doubled the following year.  I realise value-added tax is necessary if we go into Europe but I can see a situation coming about in which we will have more accountants than workers on the shop floor.  As I said before, no matter how many people are employed the customer pays eventually.</P>
    <P>The introduction of value-added tax is being postponed from 1st January to 1st March; that does not make much difference.  In the past we have lost tourist trade because we have a different tax system from that which operates in Britain.  I fail to see why we have to introduce value-added tax before Britain.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concessions which have been made in respect of newspapers. The small country newspapers in particular should not be killed by higher prices.  Before the introduction <Col N="1610" /> of turnover and wholesale tax a person would very often buy a national newspaper and a country newspaper but now he buys only one, usually a national newspaper.  There will not be any value-added tax on car hire charges and public transport but the Government get enough already from the tax on oil and petrol.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see farmers will have to pay value-added tax on the foodstuffs they use.  The final result is that the last seller, probably the butcher, will get a rebate.  It is expected the farmer will get more money for his beasts but that is not necessarily so. It may happen in a period of scarcity but in a period of abundance I do not think he will get more money.  The net result is that the farmer will pay tax on the feeding stuffs, <i>et cetera,</i> that he buys.  I agree that the farmer who puts his cattle out to grass will not have to pay value-added tax but if we go in for the concentrated feeding that farmers in Europe do then our farmers will have to buy foodstuffs and this is going to be very costly.</P>
    <P>There is to be a 11.11 per cent tax on dances.  The Minister says:</P>
    <P>As this special rate will not affect the great majority of traders the value-added tax remains, in essence, a three-rate tax.</P>
    <P>This tax is also going to be charged on food and drink.  I do not know how that compares with other taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it is disgraceful. A young man who takes a girl to a dance has to pay 50p or 75p admission. He finds when he goes to buy a drink, that drinks are more expensive. He thinks the proprietor is charging him too much because he does not realise the Government are imposing this extra charge.  The retailer usually gets a hammering when the Government imposes extra taxation. I do not see any reason for taxing the food and drink sold at dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the imposition of the value-added tax as from 1st March, 1972.  It brings within the scope of the tax the delivery of goods <Col N="1611" /> and the rendering of services in the course of business within the State.  It also imposes tax on goods imported into the State. Am I correct in assuming that delivery of goods means that a person who delivers goods by lorry is charged value-added tax?  What will happen is that large firms, for instance, Guinness and Company or Lamb Brothers, instead of hiring CIE or an independent carrier, will get their own lorries to deliver goods.  A firm using their own transport can put down what figure they wish for delivery charges. When deliveries are made, an all-inclusive charge is charged and the actual cost of transport is not shown. What might happen is that the independent transport people and CIE, who have many workers in their employment, will be in trouble because most of the firms will make their own deliveries.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the estimated turnover tax at the moment in respect of building costs is only 3 per cent.  This would mean approximately £200 for the smallest house but I am not sure if the tax is so low.  It is stated that the value-added tax will not affect land or buildings already in existence no matter to whom they are sold unless and until major building, rebuilding or demolition work constituting development is carried out.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister state what is major building?  Does it mean adding a toilet to a house, adding 20 square feet to a building, 200 square feet or 2,000 square feet?  Will the valuation be that decided by a valuation officer or will it be guesswork on the part of the Department? We know that the Revenue Commissioners keep adding tax and one has to pay.  We can take the example of a widow who extends her premises and who is told by the Revenue Commissioners that they estimate the value of her building on the market as worth £100,000.  What appeal has she against this decision?</P>
    <P>In the Minister's brief it is stated:</P>
    <P>A sale of immovable goods will be deemed to take place when an interest in them is transferred for a period of ten years or more. <Col N="1612" /> Transfers of less than ten years duration will not normally be taxable as sales.</P>
    <P>Do I take it that value-added tax is chargeable on a 35-year lease of a premises?  If so, what is the rate chargeable? Today there are people leasing property on a 35-year basis with a break every five or seven years.  Is the 35 years regarded as the duration in this case?  I think that at the moment a person has a right to renew over a five-year lease but I am not sure on this point.  The Minister has made a broad statement that in respect of leases of less than ten years one pays value added tax but does not pay tax if the period is more than ten years.  I am not sure if fully-furnished flats are covered in this Bill.  The Minister has stated:</P>
    <P>Transfers of less than ten years duration will not normally be taxable as sales.  Where building work is carried out on behalf of a registered person such as a manufacturer or shopkeeper the new system will result in significant relief because, whereas no allowance is given at present for the wholesale and turnover taxes payable on materials used in the construction of factories and business premises, under value-added tax full credit will be allowed for the tax charged to a registered person.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge turnover tax is not payable in respect of renovation work or the purchase of anything not for resale.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that although there are three types of taxes only two will apply but I do not agree with this. For instance, in some shops in small towns they could sell foodstuffs, television sets and cosmetics and there are three types of taxes payable.  For goods and services, mainly food, drink, fuel, clothing, medicines and so on there is a tax of 5.26 per cent.  Thirty per cent is payable on cars.  At the moment if a person buys a car and is charged wholesale tax, he pays only on the selling price.  People frequently go to different garages for estimates because prices vary.  In addition, a person can get a trade-in price for an old car, perhaps £150 or £200 depending on the car, and he will pay tax on the <Col N="1613" /> selling price only.  I realise it includes wholesale tax but with VAT the tax will be charged at an earlier point.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Connell was speaking, the Minister said it had become necessary to introduce VAT to keep in line with EEC policy and Deputy O'Connell pointed out that Italy has been in the Community for quite a while but they have not yet introduced this form of taxation.  Perhaps we are trying to have one up on Britain, regardless of the results. Here we have corporation profits tax, income tax, turnover tax and wholesale tax.  There they have got purchase tax, only on luxuries or semi-luxuries. Essential foods are not taxed in England.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that our income from tourism has been running at between £100 million and £90 million annually but we cannot expect, even if the Northern Ireland situation eases, to sustain this rate because our foodstuffs are dearer, our hotels are more expensive and beer, taking the same gravity level, is 8p a pint dearer here.  Of course we have read the statement of a hotelier who said that his rates had increased by 100 per cent during the past number of years.  The main cause of our drop in tourism is the fact that food and other essentials are dearer here because of taxation than in England and the mainstay of our tourist trade has been visitors from England and Northern Ireland. Luxuries are cheaper here but if you go to Dún Laoghaire and meet a tourist from the car ferry and open the boot of his car you will find he has taken all the groceries he can carry because, except for one meal a day, he will cater in this way because of the difference in food prices.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister said that at its introduction turnover tax yielded £13½ million annually, in 1964-65.  The new tax will yield £80 million, six to seven times as much.  If we gave a <i>pro rata</i> increase in social welfare benefits the less off among us might be able to survive to go along with this new tax.</P>
    <P>Another point is that this tax will <Col N="1614" /> be payable immediately, even before the goods are sold.  The manufacturer must pay it before he sells, and the same goes for both wholesalers and retailers.  This is passed on immediately to the consumer.  If three months credit were allowed it might ease the burden somewhat for a period but, as it is, businessmen would be better off working for somebody else.</P>
    <P>On the introduction of turnover tax and again when the wholesale tax was introduced we had promises from Ministers that the cost of living would not be affected adversely.  This has never been borne out and we will have the same formula again in relation to this tax.  When we come to the matter of price control, of course the task will be an impossible one because the costs of the producer, of the wholesaler and the retailer will all go up and the consumer will be the victim once more.</P>
    <P>All along the line we have had promises that have never been fulfilled. The attitude of Fianna Fáil has always been to promise something now and then forget it in three months time.  If we introduce this tax before a similar tax is introduced in Britain, our tourism will decrease still further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>One can measure any piece of taxation legislation against the number of its stated objectives.  First, the purpose of tax is to raise revenue. People are inclined to think that the matter ends there and that, so long as the money comes in, one way of raising it is as good as another.  Yesterday, for example, I listened to the Minister's argument against dependence on beer, cigarettes, spirits and petrol on the basis that one was in danger of entering a situation where this would be precarious and would lead to an over-kill situation which would not result in money being raised.  Of course one objective of taxation policy is to raise the money that the public need, and if it is considered simply in that way, one can argue about easy collection and can put forward arguments that may be valid ones.  One could say that the base of money gathering could be spread by indirect taxation methods away from the old narrow basis that we had before the introduction of turnover tax <Col N="1615" /> which, indeed, is still a very important source of revenue.</P>
      <P>However, there ought to be two other major objectives in taxation policy.  One should be the matter of managing the economy.  If there is one point on which, belatedly, every economist and everyone in this House is agreed, it is that the rate of inflation in Ireland, in Britain and inside Europe is a great threat to the stability of our whole economic system, to the stability of wage structures, of prices and everything else.  Inflation is a key problem and a taxation policy can serve either to diminish inflation or can serve to increase it or, for that matter, it can be neutral in this regard. The second aspect on which any tax must be judged is its effect on the economy as a whole and its effect on the management of the economy.  The third criterion is of particular importance to people on these benches although we are not alone in this and this is that taxation should be an instrument of increasing social justice. As well as being a means of managing the economy it should also be a means of diminishing differences in income, of promoting social equality and of producing a situation where very few people are too rich and nobody is too poor.  It should be an instrument of transfer of wealth.  Of course, this is particularly a Labour view and has been traditionally so in this country and in other countries where there have been Labour parties who could articulate a distinct viewpoint.  It is against the latter two requirements that one must evaluate a VAT proposal&mdash; against the requirement of economy management and against the requirement of increasing social justice and diminishing inequality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one considers taxation not simply as a way in which money is raised but against those other criteria, then VAT is a profoundly unsatisfactory and undesirable form of taxation.  This is particularly so so far as Ireland is concerned for reasons that I shall come to.  I wish to speak first about EEC policy.  The third superficial justification for this taxation is that we are getting in line with the EEC. The history of VAT in the context of <Col N="1616" /> the Community is that many countries have resisted bitterly its implementaion and have retained national control over their taxation system.  The Italians are still resisting it and signs are that they will continue resisting. After 13 years of Community membership they, as the weakest member in terms of <i>per capita</i> income and the most precarious, economically, of the Six, do not consider that this form of taxation suits their requirements.  Indications are that they will continue to seek and to get exemption certainly beyond the present period which expires within the year.</P>
    <P>One of the central objectives of the Community is to eliminate all features from the internal economies of the participant countries which would, to use their phraseology, distort free trade.  Of course, differences in taxation would distort free trade.  A stated objective is a uniform taxation system not alone in the mechanism by value added tax plus some direct taxation but also on the level at which VAT is assessed and gathered.  They declare the objective that there should be uniform VAT throughout the Community be they Six members or Ten members.</P>
    <P>Of course this would be essential if the dream of the rule of the market place&mdash;a dream that has not operated in any capitalist country during this century&mdash;were to be implemented fully.  They are trying to move in that direction.  In other words, the package we are now being asked to accept will result in a package of tax, the equalisation of VAT in all the participant countries of the EEC.  Then we are left with the possibility that national Governments can ring the changes on other direct taxation forms where there is a unified VAT and where there are the individual national differences in forms of direct taxation.</P>
    <P>The reality of that will be that direct taxation will tend to get less important and that, if extra revenue is needed, particularly in weak countries where the revenue gathered from industrial activity is not sufficient, the indirect taxation will have to be heavier. If direct and indirect taxation are added <Col N="1617" /> together, or income tax and VAT to put it at its simplest, then there would be a heavier tax burden in the weaker countries economically where industrial activity is less.  There would be an accentuation of the difference of the level of industry between the already weak and the already strong areas.  The effect of this would be to sharpen regional and national inequalities.  One sees this happening inside the Community already.  Far from industrial equalisation and levelling, the opposite process is to be seen at work.  It is to be seen at a level which is overcoming the effect of national regional policies.  The Italians and the French have national regional policies but the tendency towards inequality, towards the concentration of capital, in which taxation policy has a part is working more strongly than the national regional policy.  At this moment of relative slump inside the EEC countries the inequalities now, though they showed signs of diminishing a little in the past year, are increasing again.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental objections from the point of view of our economy to a VAT.  I listened to the Minister, thinking that we might have some arguments as to why we should take this course now.  I did not hear any.  I thought the Minister made an extraordinary feeble justification for a major taxation change.  All I could really hear the Minister say was: &ldquo;The others are doing it and we must do it too&rdquo;&mdash;a &ldquo;me, too&rdquo; attitude.  In order to rush to carry out this &ldquo;me, too&rdquo; position before some of the member countries of the Community and before the participants who wish to and may adhere over the coming year, we want to be the first in the queue of conformists in regard to VAT.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at the effects inside the country if we pass this Bill.  I recall a debate on the effect of decimalisation. I recall solemn, pompous, straightfaced, unequivocal promises from the Government side that it would have no effect on prices.  We know the answer now; we knew it then.  I suspect that the people who were uttering these bland statements to the contrary knew themselves what the answer would be.  There was an effect on prices <Col N="1618" /> following decimalisation.  On this occasion the argument that this new tax will have no effect on prices is so unconvincing as not to be worth arguing about.  The tax will be gathered from areas of economic activity from which tax is not now gathered and this will be passed on to the ultimate consumer. The squeeze on profits and the effect on existing inflation is such on all those people who are selling products with freedom to determine the price that they will use any precedent such as the transformation of the situation&mdash;such as decimalisation was and VAT will be&mdash;as an excuse to increase their prices.</P>
    <P>VAT will have an inflationary effect in this country.  That is undesirable from the point of view of the economy as a whole, but also from the point of view of the individual consumers who are already outraged.  If we were not so preoccupied with other things of national importance, north and south, we would certainly have a strenuous campaign raging about prices at the moment.  This tax will make the situation worse.  We knew in the budget of of 1970, which increased indirect taxation, that this was a diametrically wrong diagnosis of what the danger to our economy was.  We took a position from these benches which, for the Labour Party, was a departure from the traditional position but one which was totally vindicated.  We knew it was a mistaken budget and that instead of diminishing inflation it would increase it.  It gave the Government a vested interest in inflation.  The same thing will happen now.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Irish people are showing extraordinary patience and forbearance in the face of price rises. Taking the global cost of living index the rise is more than 10 per cent, but on individual items of particular consumption in some cases the rise is up to one-third in a year.  Raging inflation is making nonsense of the National Wage Agreement and is bearing heaviest on those least able to pay. Inflation is increasing the differences in living standards and increasing social inequalities.  This will be one further effect of VAT.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy P. Belton with <Col N="1619" /> interest.  He has knowledge of the operation of business enterprises.  VAT will also increase the differences between the competitiveness of different sizes of industries.  Deputy P. Belton spoke about this fact and said that the tax will be paid by the small businessman who purchases something he needs in the course of his productive process rather than after he has completed the product and sold it.  Surely it is not a secret to the Minister or to anybody else in this country that there is a very considerable squeeze on at the moment in regard to all businesses in the country, but particularly the smaller ones.  Surely it is not a secret that big, economically-powerful, particularly multi-national, companies are much stronger in regard to creditraising and much more credit-worthy than small companies.  The effect of this taxation policy will be to increase the problems of the small and middle-sized businesses in regard to their present liquidity much more than it will increase the problems of the big businesses who can find sources of guarantee, money to borrow and international assistance in a difficulty in a way in which the small ones cannot.</P>
    <P>The effect of VAT will be to diminish the competitive power of the small industry and increase the domination of big industry.  Anybody I talked to, whether a retailer or involved in the newspaper trade from the commercial end of it, who is concerned with the economics of the newspaper and distribution costs, has profound apprehension about the rush that will be entailed in putting this scheme into operation by the time the Minister wants it.  Inevitably there will be confusion. If there were any good reason for doing this now we might say that we would put this extra burden on every small business and retailer, and, indeed, on the public servants who have to draft regulations and who are already greatly overstretched and of whom too much is expected.  We would agree to do all that if we were given a single, good reason why it has to be done now.  I listened in vain for any such good reason in the Minister's speech.  I will listen to the Minister's <Col N="1620" /> reply.  It would be wrong to prejudge it. Perhaps the Minister can give us one good reason, or even break that one reason into a number of lesser reasons.  There is no cogent argument for the rush except the need to argue, which is not an argument at all but a piece of acquiescence.</P>
    <P>One could elaborate and people with more intimate knowledge of retailing, of business and of industry than I will elaborate, but the effects on small businesses are clear; the effect on prices is clear; the effect on the public servants who will have to rush this measure through are clear.  There will be an extra load on their backs to have regulations prepared and to have the &ldquo;small print&rdquo; worked out in order to have VAT workable in time.  The Minister told Deputy Dr. O'Connell earlier on that the thing was clear, but then demonstrated that he was not too clear about it all himself.  If he does not know&mdash;and of course he does know; he is not so isolated or so out of contact&mdash;let me add my voice to the other voices which are trying to tell him that this is not a simple change in administration.  There is great confusion and great apprehension.  There will be a great rush and consequently a great mess if he insists on the time-table he has offered.</P>
    <P>We are assured that he does not want to raise extra revenue and that this is just a transfer of the revenue-gathering mechanism, a spreading more widely of the revenue-gathering mechanism through indirect taxation and that it will not raise any more money.  If that is the only argument for the rush and if we disbelieve that, the argument for the rush is that with the oncoming economic difficulties that are plain to be seen and that are speedily getting worse, the Government will need more revenue.  In fact, they see this as the source of extra revenue although they are not saying so now, and they will proceed, when they have got the legislation through on the &ldquo;no extra revenue&rdquo; argument, to extract extra revenue from VAT.  That is the only justification for this haste because the &ldquo;me-too get ready for Europe&rdquo; argument is too fatuous to be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> Let us look briefly at the arguments against VAT.  In the European context we will be the poorest <i>per capita</i>&mdash;if we go in and this is getting us ready to go in&mdash;of any of the Ten, the slowest growing in terms of economic growth if you take it over a period long enough to average out the ups and downs, and also much the smallest.  The next smallest economy is the Norwegian economy which is three times bigger than ours.  We differ from all the other economies, whether they be big or small, in that, in fact, this is an open economy which is an appendage of the British economy and not an independent sovereign economy at all.  The Danes and the Norwegians had wit enough to know that, without a good deal of currency control and a good deal of economic independence, it was impossible for small peripheral economies to develop and they have very controlled economies even though they are now becoming more open.  The section of their total GNP which goes to exports is greater as they have had their exporting successes.  At any rate this is a tendency which occurs everywhere.</P>
    <P>There is no comparable economy to ours in the Community, in poverty, lack of growth-rate, smallness and lack of control of its own affairs even in matters of currency.  When we get this harmonisation in Brussels it may even be OK for countries with big industries and with a great deal of economic activity which generates satisfactory revenue because of the scale of their industrial operations.  The levels will be calculated in relation to a quarter of a billion people and their average need. Our need will be quite different because, in fact, taxed at levels that will give sufficient revenue to a country with a hugh industrial sector like Germany it will not give sufficient revenue here and will have to be topped up by direct taxation.  Our taxation rates globally will be higher than in the central countries.  The differences in rates of taxation will be an added argument against industrialisation as if there were not enough already.</P>
    <P>The central argument is this argument. As a country gets richer&mdash;and <Col N="1622" /> this is again a general tendency whether it is 2 per cent or ½ per cent or 5 or 6 per cent, hopefully, a year&mdash;with direct taxation you have the possibility by putting a threshold which assists indirect taxation, once your revenue gathering gets strong enough and once your income gets big enough, you can cut out of this effective taxation the whole of the poorest section of the community. You can exclude a very significant slice of the poorest people if you have direct taxation.  You can just raise the limit and, below that limit, no tax. There is the argument about raising money on spirits, beer, cigarettes and petrol.  Up to the present, increases in the price of petrol did not bear on the poorest section of the community and when you are that poor, although it is desirable that people should have the consolation of a drink and a cigarette, you can cut out spirits and even beer before you cut out food.</P>
    <P>Indirect taxation with a cascade tax across the whole of the economic process, with only very limited areas exempted, bears on everybody formally and equally but, if you look at it for a moment, not equally of course.  It bears the heaviest by far on those who have the least.</P>
    <P>This is the great central objection to it.  What is good for the rich countries of Europe&mdash;and I think we are inclined to forget how much richer they are than we are&mdash;is not good for us.  If you accept VAT and then accept the harmonisation of VAT the levels of VAT will be decided in relation to their interests and not ours.</P>
    <P>Put at its simplest this is legislation for the rich.  What is inimicable to the interests of the rich is graduated income tax that bites harder and harder as incomes go up.  What the rich want is that the whole burden of tax-gathering should be borne by the whole population, regardless of what their incomes and standard of living are. That is what VAT is giving them, in pursuit of policies which are, in fact, a reflection of the big business policy, the rich man's policy which is at the very core of the thinking of the European Commission and the development <Col N="1623" /> of the European Community as it is going at present.  It may not always go that way.  There may be a gathering strength of the left wing forces to humanise the Community and Community institutions.  Since it was established it has been operating laws and taxation policies and all sorts of decisions which increase the social differences and which increase the division of society into &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; and which exempt the rich more and more and bear more and more heavily on the poor.</P>
    <P>What this country needs at the moment is not to equate itself to or make itself identical with EEC taxation policy but to fight a rear-guard action for as long as we possibly can inside the rules&mdash;assuming that we go in and I do not make that assumption. If the argument is that we have to get ready, we know from the Italian experience in particular and the experience in other countries that we do not have to have VAT in operation to be accepted as a member.  We know that we can fight a rearguard action for many years under various escape clauses and rules against its full introduction. We know that if there is equalisation of VAT all across the Community&mdash;and we have the weakest industrial sector&mdash;this will bear most heavily on us.  Therefore, we should not rush to the implementation of VAT but we should delay it, and block it, and put it off by every mechanism we can think of, and every device we can invent by reading the small print and by seeing the delaying tactics that have been used by countries that are currently members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I have not talked about the small print.  I have tried to talk about principles. This is bad legislation; it is unnecessary.  It was not justified in any way by anything I have heard the Minister say.  The presentation of the arguments in its favour are not even frank because it will be inflationary and it will be used to gather more revenue as soon as it is through.  It is utterly contrary to the national interest at this time.  To think of equalising our taxation system with that of the Community before a Community regional <Col N="1624" /> policy exists which will pump out capital from the centre into the peripheral areas&mdash;if it ever exists and it certainly does not exist now&mdash;is to commit national suicide.  To think of equalising a taxation system before a real regional policy exists is, in fact, to commit national suicide or to participate with a lot of other decisions is a committing of national suicide.</P>
    <P>We have objected bitterly on all sorts of issues and will be doing so over the coming months to the policies of the Government in regard to the EEC and to the terms that they have negotiated, because they are the negation of national interest.  There were lots of ways where they could even have pursued their scheme for full membership and put in the protections and the caveats and protected the national interest.  If ever there was such an issue, the issue of VAT is that issue. Who wants it, apart from the Minister? Farmers are promised a kind of exemption which in fact, will not be water-tight and will be bogus and they do not want it.  The workers, who will bear a larger share, because it taxes all necessaries, do not want it.  No small businessman wants it.  No retailer, no shopkeeper, wants it.  It is contrary to national interest in regard to the attraction of capital and the retention of our competitiveness.  It is inflationary and it is against social justice. The Minister wants it for reasons he will not say.  He says it is to be in line with the EEC.  In fact, it is to raise extra revenue in the long run.  This is the negation of policy making.  This is the negation of the use of budgetary policies for the protection of national interest, for equalising social inequalities and for managing the economy effectively.  This is, in fact, running away and surrendering.</P>
    <P>It would be pleasing if it were the only example but, in fact, it is all of a piece because the central contention now, as far as I can see, in Government thinking is that, as control of our economy is the basis of any sovereignty, apart from legal sovereignty, as an economy, we have no hope; the efforts and the aspirations of the last half century were all essentially mistaken; the best we can do is to get ourselves <Col N="1625" /> into Europe without any protections or any reservations, to equalise all our arrangements with the European arrangements as quickly as possible and then, at least, if there is no employment for small farmers here, if there is not the industry to soak them up here, they will be able to be freely mobile under this great principle of mobility of labour, not just to England which, although a different culture, speaks the same language, but also to the golden triangle of Europe which has neither the culture nor the language of the displaced people.</P>
    <P>This is, in fact, the abdication of any will to rule, the abdication of what bits of sovereignty, tattered as they are, we possess.  It is the abdication of the use of budgetary policy for the protection of national interest.  It is, in fact, the abdication of government entirely, in the hope that somehow, if we let Brussels do it for us and if we follow them slavishly, the situation will be all right.  If one analyses the effects of VAT, all of the indications are that if one follows Brussels slavishly, what is good for Germany or Holland is not good for us and, far from being all right, it will be all wrong.</P>
    <P>I will await with interest any arguments from the Minister in his summing up.  I am prepared to listen to arguments.  There were not any in his introduction.  I cannot see the arguments which will prevent myself or my party from voting against this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>The title of this Bill is &ldquo;Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1971&rdquo;.  In the first paragraph of the Minister's introductory statement he said that the purpose of the Bill is to implement, with effect from March 1st next, the proposals for a value-added tax to replace the existing wholesale tax and turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When turnover tax was imposed on the Irish people some years ago we were assured by the Minister that it would have very little effect in increasing the cost of living, that the effect would be scarcely noticeable, that it was a very fair tax, that everybody would be caught in the net and that when everybody became a taxpayer <Col N="1626" /> the burden on the individual would be light.</P>
    <P>Then the wholesale tax was introduced, a tax upon a tax.  Then there was the change in the currency system, the introduction of decimal currency, which has been referred to by other Deputies this morning.  We were assured by Ministers that all these changes and all these new measures would be of such an order that their effects would scarcely be noticed.  If ever there was sugar coating, there certainly was sugar coating of the pill in relation to the imposition of these taxes.  The proposal to introduce VAT will be another serious imposition.</P>
    <P>I want to speak first about the newspaper industry, with particular reference to the problem of provincial newspapers.  Recently, newspaper proprietors in the West of Ireland had discussions with their Deputies and Senators and pointed out the many problems with which they are confronted. I appreciate that not only the provincial papers but the national newspapers have had many problems over the years.  It is true to say that outside this country, particularly in Great Britain, the newspaper industry has taken a terrible hammering.  Great Britain has a strong economy.  The newspapers there have great advertising revenue and a very large readership. We are concerned here with the manner in which taxes are operated within our own Republic.  The national papers must be going through a very difficult time.  However, in my opinion, the national newspapers have got the ear of the Minister to a greater extent than have the provincial papers and therefore I am mainly concerned with the problems affecting the provincial newspapers.</P>
    <P>As I have said, discussions have taken place in various regions between the newspaper proprietors and the elected representatives.  The facts were laid bare.  The facts are that if the value-added tax is applied to this industry, many of these newspapers will be faced with closing down, with consequent serious loss to all those connected with the industry, editors <Col N="1627" /> and reporting staff, and the people who are employed in the printing business such as compositors.  That in itself would be a very serious thing but when you take into account the important part that these newspapers play, particularly in the Connaught region, we realise the great educational value they have.  It is a common thing when the local newspapers are bought and read in the homes in the west of Ireland to have them bundled together and posted to our kith and kin in England, America and even in Australia so that our exiles are kept in touch with local happenings.  There is no doubt in my mind the wonderful boon and the wonderful source of happiness those local newspapers are to our exiles abroad.  We have heard the case made about the difficulties with which this industry is confronted and if value-added tax becomes law next year this industry will be placed in further difficulties.  It would be a very bad day, not alone for our people who are still in the west but also for our emigrants, if some of those local newspapers had to close down.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware, according to the statistics recently published, that there is a serious decline in population in the western areas.  There is also the question of the closure of small businesses and the opening up of supermarkets in small towns of a population of 2,000 or 3,000.  This means a serious loss in advertising revenue for the local newspapers.  There is a smaller readership because of the decrease in population.  The newspaper proprietors were obliged to increase the price of their papers to help them to pay their increased costs but I am afraid that they have lost revenue because of the decrease in readership. Those people were also obliged to pay increased wages over the past 12 months which further increased their overhead costs.  I hope my appeal for the small newspaper offices in the west of Ireland gets through and that the Government realise the serious problems with which the newspaper industry is confronted.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech <Col N="1628" /> on the Second Stage of this Bill in paragraph 3 stated:</P>
    <P>The increased revenue generated by these taxes has helped to finance the acceleration of the economic and social development which has taken place during the last decade.</P>
    <P>I am aware that such developments have taken place in different regions in this country, notably Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Galway and to a lesser extent in places like Sligo, Drogheda and one or two other places.  So far as the west of Ireland is concerned I am well aware, despite the fact that the Minister for Finance and the Government got increased revenue from taxation in this country, such as turnover tax and wholesale tax on petrol, motor cars and other items, we in the west of Ireland did not benefit to the same extent as the other regions throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to open up a debate except to point out that we have not benefited.  We have had to pay the taxes.  Money in the west of Ireland does not come from earnings locally but from the remittances which come from our workers who go across seasonally to England or those who emigrate permanently to England and other countries throughout the world. Therefore, it is most unreasonable to think that when our emigrants return <Col N="1629" /> home later in life they find, when they want to buy a pint of stout or a glass of whiskey or perhaps even footwear, that we are not satisfied with all the taxes imposed in the past but that we have, in fact, added further taxes, and it is proposed to increase taxation further as from 1st March next.  This is not a great encouragement to our emigrants.  Speaking on the tourist industry on many occasions we have referred to the increase in hotel bills, the increase in the price of petrol and various other increases.  As always happens when legislation of this type is introduced, it has the effect of increasing the cost of living not only of our people resident here but of our exiles who return from time to time and who supply a large part of the finance that keeps the country going.  We seem to be in a great rush to enact this legislation.  In page 3 of the Minister's brief he said:</P>
      <P>Among the three countries, apart from Ireland, that have applied for membership of EEC, Norway and Denmark already have a value added tax on the general lines of the EEC model and the United Kingdom has announced that it intends to adopt a value added tax as from April, 1973, in replacement of the existing purchase tax and selective employment tax.</P>
      <P>The British are prepared to wait until 1973 while we are determined to get this legislation through hurriedly.  It seems to me that the main reason why the Minister is anxious to get this legislation passed quickly is to enable him to get increased revenue.  I do not want to misquote the Minister but I have heard him express himself along those lines.  He has pointed out to the House that there are many people who are evading their responsibilities.  I am satisfied that the majority of our people are meeting their responsibilities fairly and squarely.  The main concern of the Government down through the years has been to extract more money from the people.  Far from relieving the overburdened tax payers, this legislation will have the effect of increasing the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition of taxation has <Col N="1630" /> always been a serious source of worry to people engaged in business.  From living among the people and discussing their problems one gets to know what the situation is at first hand.  Often when a public representative calls on a businessman, a grocer, publican, garage proprietor or anyone else, he will immediately introduce the subject of turnover tax and wholesale tax and taxation generally.  He will point out to you, and rightly so, that he is crippled with taxation, that it is nearly impossible for him to balance his budget, to keep his business going and that he is finding it increasingly difficult every day of the week.  The implementation of the turnover and wholesale taxes has had the effect, as Deputy Belton said here this morning, of increasing their overheads generally and in the long run it is the consumer who must pay for all because the businessman, if he is capable of running a business, knows very well that all these overheads must be taken into account and passed on to the consuming public.  Bigger businesses have had to employ extra staff with consequent increases in wage bills and in the cost of keeping accounts.  These costs have been passed on to the consuming public with the result that there have been demands for increase in wages from workers.  There have been protest marches.  Many people have raised their voices in order that the Government of the day would do something to meet their problems.  I am afraid that, as Deputy Keating said, there will be more and more of these with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>Not alone have there been increases in the cost of foodstuffs but in many other commodities as well.  A man who was engaged in the concrete pipe manufacturing business told me he was notified about the sixth increase this year in the price of cement alone.  He told me some of it was attributable to taxation and some of it to the fact that workers had to be paid higher rates of wages.  We all know that whatever the cause is&mdash;and I say it is taxation in the main and the fact that we are travelling along an inflationary road&mdash;it is the workers who have to try to provide new homes for themselves who, in the <Col N="1631" /> long run, will have to bear this additional charge.  It is not surprising therefore that there have been so many strikes and so much unrest.</P>
    <P>In page 5 of his speech the Minister refers to the publication of a White Paper inviting the views of interested parties on this proposed legislation.  The Minister referred to the fact that he invited business people and others to make their comments on the White Paper in regard to the operation of the value added tax.  He got replies from some 200 bodies.  I have not heard of any body from Mayo being invited to comment in this manner.  I can see no benefits or blessings in this piece of legislation for the people I represent in east Mayo.  We hear a great deal about industrial development in these areas.  I have not seen much of it and I cannot see this legislation doing anything to improve the position.  Far from it.  I believe the danger is that those who might consider going into these regions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This legislation, far from benefiting these regions, will cause a still further deterioration.  That was pointed out many years ago in connection with other measures and what was said then has been borne out by the facts.  Recently there was an announcement that the population decline in the West continues.</P>

If this Bill becomes law&mdash;it will, of course, be bulldozed in the usual fashion through the House&mdash;I am sure we can look forward, with dismay, to still further increases in our rates; instead of being £7 10s in the £ they will be £8 in the £.</P>

      <Col N="1632" /> One's range is limited somewhat in this debate but one is tempted sometimes to go outside the scope of the debate.  I apologise to the Chair if I have transgressed.  I am bringing a few points to the notice of the Minister in the hope that he will consider them.  He should give special consideration to the problem of the newspaper industry in the West, to the problem of the small shopkeeper and of those who find it so very, very difficult to meet their present demands.  This legislation seems to me to be rushed and it will be a still further imposition on people who are in a poor position to carry any more burdens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally against this Bill.  I will sit in this House, unless I have to serve on the Public Accounts Committee, through every Stage of this Bill.  I will examine every section and every subsection and every line of every section and subsection.  I will question every line in the Bill until such time as the measure is fully explained and the ordinary people, the small shopkeeper and the small businessman, fully understand the implications of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a vicious piece of legislation which will bear very heavily, and unnecessarily so, on the business community. I can use the Minister's own speech to support me in this contention. In his speech the Minister talks about &ldquo;the spreading of the tax over the whole process of production and distribution&rdquo;.  I do not think this is desirable.  He said earlier: &ldquo;The introduction of the sales tax to this country &mdash;the turnover tax ... followed by the wholesale tax ... was one of the most significant measures in the tax field in recent years&rdquo;.  It certainly was.  When the turnover tax was introduced in 1963 it ignited spiralling prices and the spiral has gone on ever since increasing in momentum.  Again, the Minister said: &ldquo;The present sales taxes are relatively simple to operate and economical to administer&rdquo;.  That statement alone is a complete condemnation of this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of system do we want?  Of course the system we have is simple to operate and economical to administer. <Col N="1633" /> Why not leave the system alone?  The Minister said: &ldquo;The added value tax, on the other hand, has, as its principal feature, the spreading of the tax over the whole process of production and distribution&rdquo;.  On that count alone this is a damnable Bill.  Take, for instance, an animal, a heifer or a bullock; at the moment the turnover tax on the final product, the meat, is 5 per cent.  Actually it is 6.52 per cent, thanks to some genius in the civil service.  It is collected at the retail end of the production line, namely, the butcher.  He must account for it.  Under this legislation it is envisaged that the farmer will have to increase his price in order to get a rebate.  The mart where the animal is sold will have to start fiddling, perhaps, with invoices in order to get a rebate. The slaughter house will also have to have invoices in order to get rebates. Finally, the butcher will have to have invoices to get rebates.</P>
    <P>We are having a five-fold increase in the collection of tax.  That is only one example; it applies equally to a sweeping brush, machinery, office equipment.  Over every activity in the commercial and industrial spheres this tax is to be condemned.  To my mind, it will mean that every firm must keep very accurate and complex accounts. I have not heard from the Minister nor read from any experts an estimate of the extra cost on business people which this tax will entail.  I should like to have that estimate.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the increased cost in relation to the collection of taxes on behalf of the Government by private individuals in respect of wholesale and turnover tax.  I suggest the damnable system now about to be introduced will cause a five-fold increase in the cost of collecting taxes for the Government.  There is no need for this.  One of the Minister's main criticisms of the sales taxes was where he stated:</P>
    <P>While compliance by traders in the operation of these taxes has generally been very good the fact that such a large amount of revenue is now involved has raised doubts about the adequacy of the relatively simple administrative machinery of these taxes, and the Government <Col N="1634" /> have been considering for some time what improvements in the collection machinery could be introduced.</P>
    <P>Here, I see, lies the reason for this Bill which is a blatant attempt to substitute legislation for what is admitted to be a relatively simple system.  This Bill must be seen as another attempt by the Fianna Fáil Government to introduce a measure which will crucify again the people of Ireland.  I forecast that when this Bill becomes law the revenue the Government will gain will be at least 50 per cent higher than current revenue under the wholesale and turnover tax system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will go into every office and it is so designed that it will catch every person in the country apart from a few exceptions. I suggest it will catch farmers also. That is contrary to what the Minister said and I shall come to that at a later stage.  This is the first Bill in our history which will, in effect, tax farmers' output.  I say this because I am satisfied that the rebate, which is apparently granted under this system will not, in effect, neutralise taxation of the farmers' output.  I believe there is a catch in this somewhere, and I think it is in the flat rate of rebate suggested. I believe that the intention is to tax farmers' output under this Bill.  The extra revenue that will be gained from the agricultural community will cause a large increase in revenue for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going into the Bill I wish to quote some statistics from the 1965 Budget and the 1970 Budget.  Revenue under the headings, tax revenue, motor vehicle duties and non-tax revenue&mdash; that is of course, the wholesale and turnover tax and so on&mdash;in 1964-65 amounted to £219,045,000; in 1969-70 this increased to £411,012,000, an increase of approximately 87 per cent. This was the level of increased taxation brought about directly and subsequently on the introduction of the turnover tax and later the wholesale tax and increases in tax revenue generally.  It was 87 per cent in those <Col N="1635" /> six years.  Over this period the consumer price index, according to the autumn edition of the Central Bank Report, which was based at 100 in mid-August, 1947, was, in 1964, 171 points and in 1970, 232 points.  This means there was a 35 per cent increase in price levels between 1964 and 1970. In 1971 the index jumped to 256 points representing an increase over the period 1964-71 of approximately 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>This tremendous increase in Government activity caused certain increases in consumer prices.  Nobody would mind if we had tremendous prosperity. We have had election manifestos, white papers, programmes for economic expansion and we have had marvellous by-election and general election rallies. But I put it to the House that one of the most vital statistics relevant to this debate concerns what has been the result of this increase in the Government's activity.  The result, in the period 1964-1970, according to the Central Bank Report, 1970-71, is that the number of people at work decreased from 1,071,000 in 1964 to 1,066,000 in 1970, a decrease of 5,000 people at work in those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mind discussing calves.  In 1967, because of the crazy scheme introduced by the Government, farmers were giving away week-old calves because they could not sell them.  That is nearly going back to the economic war.  However, I do not want to deal with the history of this State.  I prefer to deal with current circumstances.</P>
      <P>This is a tax on all stages of production. It will increase quite radically the cost which the businessman will have to bear.  I do not see many valid reasons for changing over especially since England are not going to change over until 1973.  I do not see why we have to rush into VAT.  I think we are making a mistake.  I have read that there is quite an amount of opposition to this in England.  We should have waited a considerable time before we went bludgeoning on with this type of legislation.  We have been condemned in the past for aping British legislation. I would hate to think that on our accession to the Common Market we will ape European legislation.  Surely we can think of our own systems, best suited to our conditions.</P>
      <P>I want to restate something that was said when the turnover tax was introduced. It is wrong to tax essential foodstuffs.  Essential foodstuffs should either be exempted from tax or should be at zero tax level.  Apparently the Government are unconcerned about the rapidly rising cost of living, but the ordinary person in the street has to face up to it.  The inflation from which the country has suffered in the past two years has brought a fair number of our people to their economic knees.  People living on social welfare benefits, on private pensions or private fixed incomes from investments, have been having a lean time in the last three or four years, and the Fianna Fáil Government have done precious little to alleviate their circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> The publication of the rates of value-added tax is interesting.  Under the system there are four rates.  There is 5.26 per cent; 16.37 per cent; 30.26 per cent.  There is a special rate for dances&mdash;I do not know why they should get a special rate&mdash;of 11.11 per cent.  It is interesting to note that we have a rate of 30.26 per cent.  Admittedly it is on certain luxury goods but it is a very high rate and I wonder if it is completely justified.  The rate of 16.37 per cent is a relatively high rate and it is to be spread over a fairly wide range of goods.  The basic rate of 5.26 per cent will now apply to goods and services.  This is an important innovation in relation to the tax system because it will apply to most things, including food and drink for human consumption and live animals, although there will be a rebate in relation to farming.  At this juncture there is a valid case for exempting essential foodstuffs such as bread, milk, meat, potatoes and vegetables from value added tax.  I would appeal to the Minister to exempt these products.</P>
    <P>On page 12 of the White Paper on the <i>Proposals for a Value-Added Tax,</i> which was laid by the Minister for Finance before each House of the Oireachtas in March, 1971, it is stated, &ldquo;the tax is not an inherent part of a trader's costs&rdquo;.  I do not believe the suggestion that there will be no costs on a trader who has to collect this tax for the Government.  The introduction of the value-added tax will increase considerably the expenses of traders and businessmen because under the system traders and businessmen will have to have a complete accountancy system, including detailed invoices of purchases and sales, which they will have to produce for inspection when necessary.  It is going to shake a good few firms to have to spend money collecting money for the Government I would suggest that the Minister consider rebating to businessmen and traders a sum sufficient to cover the increased cost of collecting this tax for the Government.  It would be a relatively simple exercise within the system suggested and would serve as a sugar coating on the deadly pill that <Col N="1640" /> traders will have to swallow.  Some gesture of this kind would be very welcome in trading circles.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the elimination of double taxation I should like to refer to page 15 of the White Paper which states:</P>
    <P>The amount of this double taxation is calculated at £3.5 million a year.  It will be eliminated under the value-added tax because traders will get credit, against their liability, for tax borne on all expenditure which is incurred for business purposes except certain items, like private motor cars, as indicated in paragraph 47.</P>
    <P>I came across a contradictory statement on page 39 and I should like the Minister to clear the matter up for me. It states:</P>
    <P>When the value-added tax comes into force building work (including demolition, development, construction, decoration and repairing) will be chargeable at 5.26 per cent. Steps will be taken, however, to limit the impact of the tax on private dwellings, Government and local authority properties, hospitals, churches and institutional buildings generally to what it is under the present system.</P>
    <P>In other words, special steps will have to be taken to reduce the impact of this tax on such buildings.  The White Paper continues:</P>
    <P>This will be achieved by providing that only 60 per cent of the consideration for construction work or for the delivery of immovable property will be chargeable to value-added tax.</P>
    <P>This is contradictory to the spirit of the changeover to value-added tax.  I fear that the charging of 5.26 per cent tax on a wide variety of buildings not referred to in the White Paper will cause a sharp rise in the cost of those buildings.  There is contained here a source of revenue which is not being admitted to by the Minister from buildings such as offices and so on.  I should like to know why special procedures have been introduced to cope with that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> The speed with which value-added tax has to be returned is not matched by the speed with which rebates to traders will be made.  I feel there should be a special provision for the speedy settlement of claims in relation to rebates.</P>
    <P>On page 18 of the White Paper, when discussing the effect of the changeover on retail prices, it states: &ldquo;These factors should tend to the lowering of prices.&rdquo;  I do not believe that.  When the turnover tax was introduced the opportunity was used by traders to increase prices.  When the wholesale tax was introduced an opportunity was also taken to increase prices.  We changed over to decimilisation recently and this was used, especially by retailers, to increase prices.  I should like to repeat what Deputy O'Higgins said yesterday, that this Bill should not be put into operation until such time as there is an effective scheme in force so that a keen eye may be kept on any increases that occur.  It will be necessary to have some increases in order to recoup the expenses of gathering this tax and I have suggested a method by which this can be overcome.  A submission of the NFA that there should be a zero rating in respect of some agricultural items has been rejected.  There was sense in this suggestion and the Minister might reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to newspapers, and in particular provincial newspapers, the Minister has reduced the tax from 16.37 per cent to 5.26 per cent, with the exception of advertising content.  It is well known that many provincial newspapers are not economically viable but they are a vital part of the fabric of our society and they deserve special attention.  They deserve special consideration and perhaps the Minister would consider reducing the VAT on advertising as this would help in relation to the revenue of the provincial papers.</P>
    <P>I note that exports will not be liable to VAT and this is as it should be. However, I do not know what the position will be in the Common Market.  Will we be able, as an independent <Col N="1642" /> nation, to establish our own tax at the three rates or will we have a direction from Brussels in this matter?  Will we be told we must conform with the rates prevailing in Europe?  This is an important matter and the position should be clarified. We are not at the same stage of economic development as the EEC countries and we should make it clear that we wish to maintain our independence in regard to these rates.</P>
    <P>There are a number of exemptions and, in general, they are sensible but I do not understand why services rendered by professional people should not be included.  In relation to getting exemptions, I understand there are proposals to balance the revenue under this heading.  Goods such as essential foodstuffs which are charged at the rate of 5.2 per cent should have zero rating under this tax system.  This opinion has prevailed in this House since the introduction of the wholesale tax.</P>
    <P>I wish to restate my total opposition to this Bill.  The Minister stated that the present taxes are relatively simple to operate and economical to administer and this is one of the best arguments in favour of retaining the system. I do not see any reason for complicating the collection of taxes and I consider we are bowing to Brussels just as in the past we bowed to England.  This is wrong, we should not have to bow to any centre of power.  This Bill is a vicious measure.  It is an attempt to get at increased sources of revenue and it has not been explained fully to this House.  There was a mild attempt in the White Paper and in the Minister's speech to state that revenue under VAT will be similar to the revenue available under turnover and wholesale taxes. This will be seen in the years to come as an attempt to get at sources of revenue hitherto untaxed, including farming activities.  In future years my allegations will be borne out.  I will go through every section of this Bill; I will question every line and every sentence in it until such time as it is explained to this House and to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have prevented the Minister from getting in but in such an important Bill <Col N="1643" /> it would be rather early to ask the Minister to reply until such time as Deputies have been able to offer an opinion on what is almost a revolutionary change in taxation.</P>
      <P>With regard to taxation proposals, the tendency in this country in the past few years has been to eliminate gradually the small man.  From the point of view of the Minister for Finance it may be desirable to have the major taxpayers collectively grouped so that they may pay the large sums involved into the coffers of the State.  People who pay fairly considerable amounts of taxes are encouraged to pay them as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is searching the highways and the byways for revenue in order to meet the strong inflationary demands created and he may have regarded this tax as a haven of refuge just as the introduction of decimalisation recently was responsible for securing for the tax gatherers&mdash;of whom the Minister for Finance is the official head&mdash;a considerable increase in funds.  One of the most disquieting features of this type of tax is that it is enabling the Minister for Finance to get money in advance.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to stress that point I wish to deal briefly with the reason the Minister has given for introducing this tax.  He maintains that as we are to become members of the EEC&mdash;a move with which I concur&mdash;it is necessary to have any question of taxation within the market equated before vital decisions are taken in which we will join later.  Of course it has taken them all the years they have been in existence as a Common Market to equate their taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Digressing from this immediate discussion in regard to value-added tax, in the matter of entering the EEC with a unified financial policy, I do not see there is any case whatever for us to equate our taxation policy.  The Minister for Finance finds himself faced with a situation, which I cannot say he has inherited from his predecessor, where he is in considerable deficit in funds to meet the many charges that come his way.  I should be happy to see the <Col N="1644" /> Minister for Finance getting all the funds he finds it necessary to get provided always that I was satisfied the priorities were right.  However, that is a matter for another day's discussion.</P>
    <P>The point is are we to make this revolutionary change in our tax structure with the goodwill of Dáil Éireann? I am a confirmed European.  I always have been.  I have always felt, in contradistinction to some of my colleagues, that Europe is our future because it gives wider scope and enables us more than anything to have fiscal freedom and to take our own line in regard to negotiating markets.  But that does not mean that we should jump into the EEC and with undue haste try to bring our taxation into alignment with theirs.</P>
    <P>In the early part of the speech the Minister dealt with the reasons for this tax and his sole reason, as far as I can see, was that we should bring ourselves into alignment with the EEC.  I take that with a pinch of salt and probably the Minister had his tongue in his cheek when he said it.  Of course he has brought in this taxation because he is financially embarrassed and the only way in which he can equate the balance of payments and meet demands is by introducing this new tax.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister said this tax is in alignment with other taxes, the wholesale and the turnover taxes, and that these have been producing sizeable revenue for the Exchequer and that they are easy to collect.  This tax may be easy to collect but we know that the turnover tax was a human disaster and the hardships it left in its wake will never be fully assessed.  The turnover tax, the first of these new taxes, was responsible for pushing out of business innumerable small concerns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that Ministers for Finance are in a somewhat more difficult position than their colleagues because their job is to get as much money as they can into the coffers in the most efficient way possible, and not to care overmuch about the human background.  He will pardon me if I say so, but I think the Minister for Finance here was rushed into this by <Col N="1645" /> his advisers whose natural concern is not with the general public, not with the electoral prospects of the Minister's party, with which I have no concern. His advisers were concerned purely and solely to get in money, and it seems the Minister has accepted that advice, that whichever way he can get money it must be got at as early a date as possible. The Minister has fallen for that advice hook, line and sinker.</P>
    <P>The general tendency of taxation policies of Ministers for Finance has been to get the money in in advance and in this connection I wish to give a simile in relation to the value-added tax.  It is a tax that is collectable immediately, before the individual concerned, the producer, has had any chance of getting the money that is payable to the Department.  The Department have the money in the kitty and they could not care less how the producer gets it.</P>
    <P>In legislation introduced here not very long ago it was thought desirable that payers of income tax would have to pay in advance, whatever their commitments might be.  This has caused untold hardship.  I am talking about the less well off people because they are the people who suffer the greatest hardship in this case.  Innumerable people are paying tax and they have been told by the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners that they have to pay the tax when it becomes due on the 1st January and that, if they do not do so, they will be charged an increased rate of interest on it before the end of the month.  This is an advance charge being thrown on the public, thrown on people who are not big enough financially to have somebody to advise them.  The value-added tax will have exactly the same effect on the small business people.</P>
    <P>Small business people cannot afford to employ accountants.  For that matter, business people in the middle grade cannot afford them either.  The Minister must be aware that in many cases small business people are not capable of dealing with taxation.  We are creating a situation here that will result in all small business people being forced out of business.  Indeed, <Col N="1646" /> many have been forced out already because of the huge supermarkets that are to be found all over the country. If one motored through the suburbs of this city, say 20 years ago, one would have seen many small businesses but one after another these have been forced out of business.  The introduction of VAT will be the final blow to those that still remain.  The Minister may invite me to produce evidence to substantiate what I have been saying but, of course, the evidence is there already.  What the wholesale and turnover taxes have done towards putting small people out of business is mild compared with what will happen when this new system is introduced.  This system of taxation is not a suitable one for this country.  Because of the turnover and wholesale taxes&mdash;the latter, incidentally, is not an equitable tax&mdash;there has been a gradual disappearance not only of small businesses but of some very strong firms that had been in existence for generations. I am a believer in democracy in the full meaning of that word and I am a believer in the small person being entitled to an equitable deal, but big combines, whether they be capitalist or trade union combines, are not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is no longer an equitable deal for all.  The big taxpayer will undoubtedly be able to produce a cheque for taxes because he has absorbed the business of his associates.  The Minister said that the turnover and wholesale taxes are easy to operate.  Of course they are but they will not be nearly as easy as the value-added tax which will pour the money into the coffers.  In speaking in this debate I am at a loss for quotations, having come in in a hurry and without any notes but so far as I am aware the Minister estimated that he would collect £80 million by this tax. He is more likely to collect £120 million by it.  He will then come here and with great gusto declare that the value-added tax has been a tremendous success. It may be a success in bringing in revenue but the misery that it will leave in its trail will have to be seen to be believed.</P>
    <P>Having spent most of my life in rural Ireland I have considerable knowledge <Col N="1647" /> of life in rural areas.  Not only have I been associated with the people as a parliamentarian but I have been associated with them also as a medical doctor and it is in the latter sphere more than any other that one becomes aware of and understands their human problems. I want to tell the Minister that in rural Ireland there is great apprehension in respect of local newspapers.  While some people may not read a daily paper, almost everybody in rural Ireland reads the local papers.  They are part and parcel of rural Ireland. These provincial newspapers have been going through great difficulties because of the imposition of taxation and because of the inflationary system in which this country finds itself.  The position is such that many of them have found it impossible to continue publishing and in places where there were three or four papers there are now only one or two.  Maybe from the point of view of the average Deputy that may be an advantage because instead of having to submit speeches to three or four papers he will now have to submit them to only one or two.  However, the point is that these papers served the public well and those that have not gone by the board are barely able to exist.  For those that are still being produced, the introduction of value-added tax must surely be the straw to break the camel's back and it is likely that many more will cease publication. Some have been taken over by the daily papers.  This new taxation will put an extra charge on the daily papers so that they too will be hit very hard.</P>
    <P>Five or six years ago one could buy a daily newspaper for a couple of pence.  Now the <i>Irish Times</i> costs 5p and the other papers cost 3½p.  They will find themselves in a position where they will not be able to carry on. The first thing they will do is to cease publication of the rural papers which are not paying.  We will then have no rural papers in Ireland.  Does the Minister not consider that that would be a great disadvantage to rural Ireland? The daily papers will throw aside the rural papers in order to increase their own circulation.  I am not accusing the daily combines of trying to destroy the rural papers.  I am <Col N="1648" /> accusing the Minister of wrecking journalism in this country.</P>

      <P>The increased burden will still be there.  If the Minister can tell me that by abolishing turnover tax and wholesale tax and simply putting on the VAT, not specifically on newspapers but on all papers, that he is going to reduce the overhead charges on Irish journalism I will withdraw anything I have said.  But the Minister is not going to do this.  He is increasing the overall charges.  I wrote to the Minister, and I thanked him for the concession to newspapers, but at the same time the concession will not ease the burden or save rural journalism.  This concession will not save journalism anywhere.  Of all the things necessary nowadays to keep democracy and freedom of speech alive journalism is the most important, whatever one thinks of journalists.  Whatever one agrees or disagrees with them journalism is absolutely necessary to the democratic way of life here.  I would ask the Minister to consider that fact.  The Minister has come in here without sufficient information.</P>
      <P>I must revert to the turnover tax. Originally the economic adviser to the Fianna Fáil Government, whom I will not mention here because he is not a Member of this House, was responsible for absolutely destroying the economic life of this country when he advised the then Minister for Finance&mdash;not the present Minister&mdash;to introduce turnover tax and said that he saw it as a sure source of revenue and that all the Minister would have to do each year was to increase it and, hey presto, everything would be grand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> The Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for collecting the tax and who will be responsible for collecting this VAT opposed the advice given by this distinguished fellow whom so many people refer to as being the great architect of modern production in this country.  It was a political and economic disaster of the first order. The Revenue Commissioners who have to collect this tax advised the Minister against it.  They pointed out to the then Minister for Finance the disastrous situation which would accrue from all this, but the Government went on with it.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the people to whom I belong and about whom I know more than I do about any other group&mdash;the farmers of the community.  At the present time the farming community, through their sales of beef in this country, are keeping the country from sinking into total economic disaster.  Anything that tends to lighten the burden on the agricultural community would be welcome.  I understand that the agricultural community require more than £100 million to be pumped into agriculture to put them into a strong position so that they may face and be able to accept the market which will be at their disposal when we join the EEC.  I believe we will join the EEC.  Any extra taxation on the farming community, even though their brothers in the city which the Minister represents may feel the farmers have got away with it for years, would place an extra burden on them.  Under the existing rate of taxation there is no specific charge on the farming community. There has been no great inflationary charge on the farming community as regards their own actual products.  There have been indirect inflationary charges which the farmers feel strongly about but these do not affect the small man as much as the big man.  The small man is in the majority and must be considered.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous escalation of rates.  The escalation of rates is due to the combination of turnover tax and wholesale tax.  There is no direct charge on the farmers.  Agricultural commodities are free of tax.  That is a fair comment.  Even the Minister cannot gainsay that.  The Minister may <Col N="1650" /> not like what I am saying at the moment.  The next procedure which I shall mention is the very complicated system which was devised by officials in the Department of Agriculture who, incidentally, are not keen on the VAT. It applied to the markets and to agricultural charges as a whole.  The officials worked out an extremely complicated scheme which they were good enough to explain to me.  I am not as clever as some of these people and could not fully understand it, but so far as I could make out the scheme was that a fellow who took the beast into the mart to sell it was not going to be charged any extra tax because it was assumed that the VAT had already applied to anything he had utilised for the purpose of bringing his beast into a state which enabled him to sell it. Therefore there was not to be any extra charge on him.  There was a catch in the scheme.  When a man sold a beast the mart was responsible for producing the amount of the VAT and paying it to the Exchequer.  Therefore, it is only begging the question.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious if one brings a beast for sale that, and is not directly charged the tax, one is going to get less for the beast.  The fellow buying the beast will, in his own mind, take off a percentage.  Prices will escalate and actually the man selling the beast will be charged.  I am not very clear on this. I am not clear from the Minister's speech as to whether the very clever people with degrees in economics, who always rather frighten me, decided the scheme was unworkable or not, or whether the scheme is to apply, or whether it was accepted in principle that the farmers are producers and have already paid sufficient VAT on fertilisers and foodstuffs, which were not previously taxed, and in their extra expenses in regard to labour because of the escalation of costs in this country. There will certainly be increases in wages.  Rates have increased.  This does not apply to the farming community alone but to the country as a whole.  Rates have increased fourfold in the last few years.</P>
    <P>I am trying to convey to the Minister that he, as Minister for Finance, is dependent on agricultural production in this country to produce the wherewithal <Col N="1651" /> to keep the wheels of the economy going to pay for the raw materials imported, to keep our balance of payments and our balance of trade right. In other words, it is the base and foundation of our industry here even though many people are leaving the land but collectively and indirectly it employs many people and is responsible for keeping us alive here.  Agriculture is the greatest avenue of production provided the Government can see its way at least in the relief of taxation.</P>
    <P>One other point with regard to agriculture is that concerning machinery.  I am subject to correction on this, but I believe that agricultural machinery to date has been free of turnover tax and wholesale tax, with certain reservations. There are certain minimum amounts to which import duty may be reduced. The Minister has not made the situation clear on this point.  We do not know what is intended.  This is one of the secrets of this age.  The Minister has not told us whether it is to be taxed. If it is taxed this means a further imposition.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago, or even ten years ago, that would not have made very much difference because farms were run largely with manual labour.  There was a much bigger employment content in the rural community.  Now it is declining all the time.  Even if the Minister is not looking at the human side of the question, he must look at the revenue he will get in.  For the purposes of production, the cheaper the farmers costs were, the more they could produce, and the more they could produce, the more they helped to maintain the balance of payments and the trade balance, and the finances available to import raw materials to keep the wheels of industry turning.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister has the money to pump into industry I do not know. He does not seem to have money to cope with the continuing problem of inflation which is devouring and ruining this country.  If the Minister imposes extra charges on raw materials, he will increase the charges on the farming community and there will be a backlash which will hit everyone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> I have said enough to demonstrate to the Minister that this tax is not suited to us, without many exemptions. It is not so much the tax that worries me but the change that is coming over the whole of Irish life.  We are a nation of small owners and always have been.  Whether we live in a castle or a cottage, we have always been proud of the fact that we own our own property and that we are free. The trend of taxation is gradually eroding that.  It is gradually creating a new outlook on life which is alien to all of us.</P>
    <P>I cannot speak for the city of Dublin. I can only speak for the people I know who complain bitterly about what has happened.  Nobody in rural Ireland is happy with the changing circumstances. If ever a death blow is dealt to private enterprise, be it small or large, it will be value-added tax.  I do not know what negotiations are going on between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and those with whom he is discussing these matters abroad.  I do not know whether he has indicated to his colleague that this tax is necessary and that we must push it through immediately.  I feel that it is not necessary.  We could very well go on as we are.  The existing taxes have made a disastrous crack in our economy but it would be better for us to go as we are going.</P>
    <P>The Minister should listen to this debate.  If he finds that he cannot amend this Bill to deflect the consequences I have mentioned away from the economy as a whole, perhaps he could leave it in abeyance until we are a member of the EEC and then bring in whatever adjustments are necessary. If he goes ahead with this Bill he will not ease the economy, he will not ease his own burden and he will not ease the burden of those who advise him. He will cause untold suffering.  Nobody likes to be put out of a business he has been in for generations.  This will happen if the Minister goes ahead with his present proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty as a public representative to voice some of the views of the people of my constituency which is one of the largest constituencies in the country covering <Col N="1653" /> the counties of Offaly and Laois.  It is a constituency with quite a large urban population.  In this constituency there are numerous small villages and towns. There are large numbers of farmers, large numbers of grocers, and large numbers of people with small businesses. For this reason it is important that I should state the views expressed to me by those people.</P>
      <P>It would appear that this Bill is introduced in a valley period in politics.  I do not think that phrase is particularly apt.  Normally this Bill would be introduced at a time when the Government had a period of years to run in office.  Coming at this time the Bill is unwise and dangerous.  If it is passed, its effects will be serious.  I should like to mention the situation in regard to small grocers' shops not only in Laois and Offaly but throughout the country.  In every small village and small town and, in fact, in many big towns, the family grocer, as he is called, carries on a business and provides a very important service.  The many thousands of such people have served the country well.  The grocer, his wife and his family depend on their business for survival.  These business people are slowly but surely being taxed out of existence.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of small family grocers got in touch with me about this value-added tax.  There was fear in the hearts of many of them that the final deathknell was sounding for them and that shortly after this tax goes on they will be forced out of business. The enormous burden of rates on these people is crippling them.  They have to pay the ESB charges which are rising daily and the post office charges which are also rising.  Some of them have to pay social welfare stamps for their employees, although very few of them can afford employees.  Over the past few years they found life becoming much more difficult daily and, at the end of each week, they found that their profits were getting smaller and smaller and, indeed, dwindling away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the situation in which the small grocer, the small family businessman, finds himself today.  With the cost of living soaring these people, together with other sections of the <Col N="1654" /> community, daily find that their standards of living and their weekly incomes have decreased.  It is undeniable that the small family grocer is being pushed out of existence.  If the value-added tax is put into operation there will be heard, not too long afterwards, the fall of the auctioneer's hammer in many grocers' shops.  As surely as night follows day the small family grocer will be forced out of business.  The small family grocer is a supporter of every section in this House.  He is a person for whom all of us have the highest respect.  It is incumbent upon us to recognise that small family grocers are barely able to survive and if we allow their profits to be still further reduced we will be failing in our duty on their behalf.  If the value-added tax is put into operation every small grocer will need a qualified accountant to keep his books.  These people are barely able to survive and the value-added tax will be the final straw that will break the camel's back.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago there were two by-elections, one in Cork and one in Kildare.  Prior to these by-elections, the turnover tax had been introduced. Everybody warned that the tax would have a serious effect on every section of the community.  That proved to be the case.  When everybody was up in arms about it there was a wage increase granted which helped to stifle public protest and bring about acceptance of the tax.  This was the start of the economic difficulties in which the country has found itself in the last few years.  Various speakers on this side of the House indicated the serious effects the turnover tax would have.  The tax was imposed against the advice of people on this side of the House.  It was pointed out at the time that it would be a mistake to impose the tax. It has proved to have been a mistake. I am not saying that everybody on this side of the House is wiser than those on the other side of the House or than the Department of Finance but our warnings as to the tax being a mistake have proved to be correct.</P>
    <P>In the Budget of this year the turnover tax was doubled.  This has led to a substantial increase in the price of <Col N="1655" /> food and other essential commodities. It is now proposed to replace that tax with a value-added tax.  I shall come back to that matter in a few moments. It is appropriate to mention at this stage that there is one other factor which has contributed to the increase in the cost of living, namely, the introduction of decimal currency.  It was necessary to introduce decimal currency but its introduction has led to an increase in the cost of living.  It should not be forgotten that one section of the community that had to bear the brunt of the cost of decimalisation were small grocers and people in that type of business.  They had to meet the increased cost out of their own pockets and they did so voluntarily.  Housewives also had to meet the consequent increase in the cost of living.  For their sake also it would not be wise at the present time to have a value-added tax.</P>
    <P>Already the consumer has to bear a substantial increase in the cost of living.  If the value-added tax is imposed the situation will continue in which costs increase while wages remain static.  In view of the large-scale redundancies and high unemployment a value-added tax will have a more serious effect than the Minister or any of his advisers believe possible.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

Since all the institutions and hospitals which he controls are to varying degrees supported and paid for from public funds contributed by Irishmen of all religious denominations, these statements have caused very grave concern among the religious minority of the Republic and further they must prove to be destructive of the Taoiseach's and his Government's attempts to ease the fears of the Northern Unionists and bring about unity of our people, North and South, by peaceful means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no organised formal post-graduate teaching programme for general practitioners conducted in Health Board hospitals. From time to time, various bodies such as the Royal College of General Practitioners, Irish Medical Association, <i>et cetera,</i> seek, and are given, facilities in Health Board hospitals for the holding of post-graduate lectures or seminars.  If approached, I readily authorise proposals for the grant of leave facilities to enable medical officers employed by Health Boards to attend.  In addition, lectures by visiting consultants are organised occasionally by Health Boards and while these are mainly directed towards junior hospital staff, local medical practitioners are usually invited to attend. <Col N="1665" /> The whole question of post-graduate training for general practitioners will be examined by the newly constituted Consultative Council on General Medical Practice.  I have asked the Council to consider specially what arrangements will be necessary to ensure that general practitioners are given opportunities to keep themselves wellinformed on new developments in medicine.  As soon as the Council are in a position to let me have their views, I will take appropriate steps to bring about a more organised approach to this important subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily a matter for the Eastern Health Board which has taken over the administration of the Central Mental Hospital as from 1st September.  I may say, however, that a post of Director of Forensic Psychiatry has been created and is filled in a temporary capacity, pending the making of a permanent appointment. A working party, containing representatives of the Health Board and my Department, has been established to consider how new buildings, which I have agreed should be provided at Dundrum, can best be planned and <Col N="1666" /> utilised.  Needs in regard to treatment and research will, no doubt, be kept in mind by the working party and by the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>I could not say how long it will take.

      <P>The number of patients on the register in former Dublin Health Authority Psychiatric Institutions at the <Col N="1668" /> 31st December in each of the years 1960-1965 was as follows:&mdash;3,625 in 1960, 3,687 in 1961, 3,727 in 1962, 3,679 in 1963, 3,643 in 1964 and 3,553 in 1965.  The most recent figure available (November, 1971) is 2,855.  This shows a reduction of 23 per cent on the highest figure (3,727 in 1962) recorded in the period covered by the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>This unit became available for use towards the beginning of this year.  As indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 9th June, 1971 I feel that the appointee to the second post of geriatrician to the Eastern Health Board, who will be in charge of the unit, should be involved from the beginning with the working of proposed arrangements.  The person recommended for this appointment declined to accept it but I understand that the Local Appointments Commission have recommended another candidate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to hospitals, specialist clinics in Dublin hospitals, which presumably the Deputy has in mind, are arranged between the health board and the hospitals concerned and the functions of the Minister for Health are limited to approving the financial arrangements.  For various reasons a uniform appointments system is not feasible but of the 22 hospitals in Dublin where out-patients clinics are held 18 have varying systems of appointment in operation. I would be glad to investigate any specific complaints the Deputy has in mind with a view to improving the situation. <Col N="1669" /> In so far as dispensaries are concerned, the normal practice is that they are held at specified times each week and patients are attended on a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; basis.  Pressure has been experienced, especially in the densely populated areas, at the commencement of dispensary sessions, as a large number of people queue well before the hour appointed.  In any case, as from 1st April, 1972, in the case of the Eastern Health Board area and from 1st October, 1972, in the case of other areas, persons with full eligibility for health services, will be seen by general practitioners in their private surgeries.</P>
      <P>An appointment system is in operation for the child health service, which was introduced on 1st November, 1970, and I understand that it is working satisfactorily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I explained to the House one of the reasons.  One of the reasons is a purely technical one. We have to get into operation an elaborate computer system for the fee services and for the drug prescriptions. It is absolutely essential to get it going for one area before it is applied to the others in order to find out what mistakes are being made and in order to eliminate them.</P>

I, myself, <Col N="1670" /> have absolutely no feeling about it at all.  I am very glad to be able to start the service and the fact that part of it will start on April 1st and part on October 1st does not give me any feeling of regret, I am so glad to see the service starting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>In addition, approximately £14,000 was spent on other forms of anti-smoking publicity, including advertisements in periodicals, printing of posters, prizes for competitions, <i>et cetera</i>.  I anticipate a further expenditure of around £20,000 on anti-smoking publicity from now to the end of the current financial year, most of which will be on television costs.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to the Deputy's questions on this subject on 9th February and 23rd June, 1971, Radio Telefís Éireann has also shown some anti-smoking filmlets without charge, as part of their public service contribution.</P>

      <P>The code of advertising standards for Ireland stipulates, <i>inter alia,</i> that advertisements for alcoholic beverages should not be specifically addressed to the young and that persons featured in advertisements should be obviously over 18 years of age.  As regards television advertising I am informed that RTE insist that persons shown in advertisements of alcoholic beverages must be obviously over 21 years of age.  I must say that I would prefer to see the 21 year age limit being applied to all advertising of alcoholic drinks, though of course I am aware of the fact that the purpose of this limitation could be circumvented by those who wished to do so by showing persons just over 21 years of age. <Col N="1673" /> The code of advertising standards for alcoholic beverages, which is a voluntary code, was only recently introduced but I have made certain suggestions to the Institute of Advertising Practitioners for its improvement.</P>

      <P>The quota restrictions on Irish exports of agricultural goods to Britain for which there is a common organisation of the market in the European Community will be abolished on the accession of the two countries to the Community.  This will be the case for butter and sugar and also for cheese in respect of which a system of voluntary restraint on our part is in operation.</P>
      <P>There is also provision in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement for restrictions on potatoes and bacon. Until such time as there is a common organisation of the market for potatoes in the Community member States are permitted under certain conditions to maintain national arrangements including quantitative restrictions on imports.  The position in regard to imports into Britain of bacon has yet to be clarified in the negotiations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether his Department have at any time given consideration to the tourist value of the availability on a legal basis of traditional poteen; if so, the result of such consideration; and, if not, if he will examine the matter since many of the areas traditionally associated with poteen are depressed areas.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that one of the attractions for <Col N="1684" /> tourists is to secure a drop of the &ldquo;mountain dew&rdquo; or a bottle of poteen?  Would the Minister not take steps to make it more readily available under proper and effective control?  I am sure the Minister appreciates there are great possibilities in it from the tourist revenue and employment point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the widespread concern caused by the reported proposed withdrawal of dentists from the scheme of dental treatment <Col N="1685" /> of insured workers; if having regard to the considerable suffering and cost which will be imposed on many people as a consequence and the protracted delays to date in negotiating a settlement of the dispute, he will now personally intervene; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of all the factors involved in this dispute and I do not accept the implications in the question, particularly in regard to protracted delay in negotiations.  An increase of 15 per cent in the fees payable to dentists for services provided to insured persons under my Department's dental benefit scheme was granted in November, 1970, retrospective to August, 1970.  A claim for a further increase, based on a practice costs survey submitted by the Irish Dental Association on 17th May, 1971, has not yet been finalised.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department met again with representatives of the Irish Dental Association, negotiating on behalf of the panel dentists, as recently as Thursday last, 4th instant, in connection with this claim.  Progress has been reported and arrangements have been made to hold a further meeting at an early date.</P>
      <P>The situation has been somewhat confused by the overlapping of this claim with two other claims from the Irish Dental Association&mdash;one in connection with the form of agreement to which each dentist subscribes on becoming a member of the dental panel and the other in regard to the fees payable in respect of certain types of treatment which, at the request of the association, I agreed, in October, 1970, should be paid for on a grant-in-aid basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to state whether the proposed withdrawal will be implemented, or is there a hope that it might be withdrawn on receiving an assurance that the negotiations will be brought to an early conclusion? I think the Minister will accept that there is a dreadful backlog <Col N="1686" /> in respect of dental treatment and we could not tolerate a situation in which this became immeasurably worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope the withdrawal in the dental service will not take place because this is a body with which my Department have had the most cordial and harmonious relations in the past.  They are operating a most beneficial scheme, a scheme in which a certain amount of professional dedication was evident and necessary. I do not wish to have any alienation between my Department and the dentists.  I paid tribute to the good relations that existed during the years and when I met the dentists I leaned over backwards to meet their demands. While I do not wish to say anything that would in any way affect issues which are in the course of negotiation at the present time, for the benefit of the House I should like to say it is not correct to assume that our dental practitioners operating this scheme are not reasonably well looked after relative to any other dental scheme in the world.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that by comparison with other sections of the public service&mdash; for instance the doctors&mdash;the dentists have a legitimate complaint and grievance?  Would the Minister agree that the major reason for the shortage of dentists in the public health service throughout the country is the low payment given to the dentists and that so long as this situation continues we will have a shortage of dentists and a bad situation in relation to dental care?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that what is being asked for in these questions has been acknowledged and granted already in many other countries where the processing of native brews and wines is concerned?  Is he aware, in particular, that in Scotland the making of whisky is now legalised and that many traditional <Col N="1691" /> whisky makers in Scotland are now the recognised suppliers to many of the main distillers of Scotch whisky, and that many small industries have resulted from this?  In that regard does the Minister not see the great potentiality of providing much needed employment on similar lines in depressed areas here?</P>

      <P>As I have pointed out, it is open to any person to set up a distillery provided the complies with the regulations.  The Deputy is probably aware that there is available on the market now a spirit called &ldquo;Potcheen&rdquo;.  This is a trade name used by Ivernian Distillation Blenders, Ltd., of Cork, to describe a blend of spirits manufactured by them.  The company do not distill spirit but purchase them from other concerns.  The operation is carried out subject to the control of the Revenue Commissioners. Of course, if the Deputy wishes to set up a distillery he can go ahead and do so provided he complies with the regulations laid down by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I had been discussing various objections I have to this Bill in relation to this particular tax.  There are quite a number of items in respect of which I would like to see granted exemptions from this value-added tax. I would specifically refer to hospitals, orphanages, schools and such institutions&mdash;all <Col N="1704" /> places where education is carried on, any type of school, convent, college or university which buys food, clothing, furniture, food utensils, and so on.  There is a very wide selection of these institutions.  I notice that the Minister mentions some of these exemptions in the Bill, but while they are mentioned in the Schedule, I am not completely satisfied that all the services I have in mind are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These points would be relevant on Committee Stage rather than on the Second Stage, when the Deputy can go into more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that I would hope all the organisations I have mentioned would be granted a zero registration number so that they would be completely exempt from this tax.  As the Ceann Comhairle has suggested, I will come back to this point at a later stage, but this is important because a zero tax number will make sure that these people are exempt from this value-added tax.  The importance of this is that all these institutions are finding it a strain to keep going, and if they are not granted exemptions, it will mean for any of them who buy furniture, cutlery and such items that they will have vastly increased costs, so I would hope that all these will be completely exempt.</P>
      <P>I have been endeavouring to read carefully through the exemptions listed in the document laid by the Minister before the Oireachtas in March 1971 and I have read section 6 of the Bill and the different Schedules.  There is a particular item&mdash;amongst a number of others&mdash;which I do not see mentioned in the First Schedule and which I hope would be exempt.  One of the items is motorcars.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with them at length, but I was making the point, when the debate was adjourned for questions, that <Col N="1705" /> there are large-scale redundancies in different sections of industry and one of the industries which has been heavily hit by redundancies is the motorcar industry.  This is one of the industries which I would hope to see exempted from this value-added tax. The Minister may have some proposals or may be able to give me some guidance in this regard in his reply to the debate.  There is no motorcar assembly plant in the constituency I represent so that this is something which is not personal to me, but I do feel that the industry has been suffering pretty large-scale redundancies and I hope that it will be exempt from this tax, together with such machinery as tractors, combine harvesters, ploughs and other farm machines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These are details for Committee Stage.  The Deputy may not discuss them in detail on this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will exempt all the items I have mentioned. They are important exemptions and they should be borne in mind by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I note that, after very considerable pressure from members of the Fine Gael Party, from the provincial newspapers and from many different organisations, the Minister has seen fit to reduce the proposed rate of tax on newspapers and periodicals.  He has reduced it from 16.37 per cent to 5.26 per cent.  I believe.  This is a considerable reduction but the amount of revenue the Minister will get from value-added tax on newspapers and periodicals will not be sufficient to offset the dangers and disadvantages that will accrue from the imposition of this tax on newspapers and periodicals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout Ireland there are quite good local provincial papers.  I cannot speak for the national newspapers.  I do not know their financial situation but I presume they will be able to carry on in the future.  With the exception of the <i>Western People,</i> the <i>Kerryman</i> and a few other provincial papers, the circulation of most provincial papers is somewhere in the region of 30,000 to 40,000.  Their margin of profit is negligible in some cases.  Many of them <Col N="1706" /> manage to keep going with advertisements and so on.  They are vastly different from the local provincial newspapers in England and in the Common Market countries.  Ours have a much smaller circulation.  Because of that they will be heavily hit if added-value tax of 5.26 per cent is imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>The provincial papers are doing a very good job.  Since the advent of television many people do not purchase a daily paper.  They rely for much of their information on the provincial newspapers.  It would be disastrous if many of them went out of existence. They help to keep the people in the country up-to-date with the events in their local areas and most of them deal with the national issues on a fairly general basis.  They are finding it very difficult to keep going.</P>
    <P>They also have a very big employment content.  I come from the town of Birr and the local paper employs a staff of 20 to 25 people.  This is very important to their wives and families. It is an important industry in the town. Birr is only one example.  There are 40 or 50 of these local papers throughout the country.  They are important industries and it would be a pity if they were adversely affected.  They pay high wages and high charges for electricity and postal services.</P>
    <P>Many of these papers have been losing some revenue which formerly accrued to them.  They printed the register of electors, and so on.  In Offaly this work has now been taken over by the Offaly Council.  I understand that a similar position obtains in Donegal and obtained for a period in Wexford. This type of work was an important source of revenue to the local papers and it has been lost to them in Offaly and in Donegal.  It is important that the public should be informed and the local papers help to discharge that duty loyally and well to their readers. I am not certain about what revenue the Minister will receive if he imposes value-added tax on provincial newspapers and periodicals.  It would be wiser for him to exempt them from it.</P>
    <P>I should also like him to confirm that fertilisers, seeds and manures will be exempt.  This is important to the farming <Col N="1707" /> community.  The farming industry is one of our most important industries. Different statements have been made in relation to the discussions that have taken place between the NFA, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance on how the value-added tax will affect the farming industry.  I should like to get a clear and unequivocal statement from the Minister on exactly how the value-added tax will affect cattle marts, and so on.  There has been quite an amount of discussion about this.  I am not clear as to how the exemptions will apply. The economy hinges to a very large extent on exports of cattle, sheep and bacon.  The Minister should state clearly how this tax will affect the cattle marts. This is important because if our exports of livestock were diminished, a very grave recession could ensue.  These exports run into millions of pounds annually.  The Minister should clarify this matter when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The figures given in the Explanatory Memorandum and in the White Paper include two decimal points.  Dances will be chargeable at a tax exclusive rate of 11.11 per cent.  Other figures are, for example, 16.37 and 5.26, 30.26, 76.05, and so on.  It should not be difficult to round off these figures.  The Government have a sufficient majority to force the Bill through the House.  Therefore, the Minister should introduce rates which will not include decimal points. In order to calculate the tax on the figures suggested in the Explanatory Memorandum, the shopkeeper would have to spend a considerable time on this work after he had closed his shop on a Saturday night.  It would be an almost impossible task.</P>
    <P>There would appear to be no sound reason for such percentage which will mean that shopkeepers and organisations who have to collect the tax will have to round off these figures for purposes of book-keeping and in doing that they will, in fact, be increasing prices. Therefore, the figures suggested will lead to a further increase in prices.  The figures may also have the effect of making business people purchase calculating machines, involving extra cost, <Col N="1708" /> which they should not be asked to incur.  It would be quite simple for the Minister to have the figures amended.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the value-added tax will very seriously affect small family grocers of whom there are many in the country and who are already finding difficulty.  They will be forced out of business.  That is something that I would not like to see happening. On their behalf I want to say that this tax will have repercussions so serious that in the next five years grocery shops will be closing on a very regular basis.  Those grocers who are able to survive will find that they will need the services of an accountant on a full-time basis, again involving extra cost which I do not believe they can afford.  It is important that these people should be considered when the Bill is going through the House. These shops have barely managed to adapt to the turnover tax and they are now faced with a further change. The turnover tax caused a substantial increase in the cost of living but that increase will be found to be very slight in comparison with the increase in the cost of living that the value-added tax will cause.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to the Minister and his mathematics, <Col N="1709" /> when this value-added tax is applied the cost of living will be vastly increased and when, in the future, people come in here and inquire about the rise in the cost of living I am perfectly sure that they will have personal knowledge of the fact that the £ will have fallen in value; I believe we will be purchasing less with our £ when this tax is imposed.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest about it.  Those in business will have to adapt their accounting system.  They will have to prepare a completely new set of books. They will have to prepare different sets of accounts.  The cost of all this will have to be absorbed by the housewife when she comes to purchase her goods. I honestly believe this tax will lead to an increase in the cost of living. When the Minister is replying I should like him to deal specifically with the question of how this value-added tax will affect the farming community, the cattle marts and the livestock industry generally.</P>

In bringing in this value-added tax we are doing no more than is presently being done in the European Economic Community of which we hope to become a member in the not too distant future.  With regard to the effect of the tax on the cost of living, this is bound up in a whole series of other matters. Its immediate out-turn is problematical. The Minister has assured us that, as far as the Department can calculate, it will be a replacement of existing taxes which will be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter that is causing some concern is the cycle of payment.  Will the tax be paid monthly or three monthly, or will the period be longer? Many businesses extend credit for long periods.  Builders providers are one of these.  From time to time, because of the peculiar nature of the building industry, they are unable to pay their accounts and the general average is 4½ to five months before they pay.  Manufacturers by and large seem to do better.  They pay within 28 days or, at the most, 60 days.  I should like the Minister to deal with this because if the tax is demanded immediately, or every month, the manufacturer, the <Col N="1710" /> wholesaler, the distributor and the retailer will have to borrow to pay the money.  I have a certain sympathy with Deputy Enright's remarks in this respect. The tax could possibly bring about increased costs if the money is demanded immediately.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the effect of the tax on the information media. Provincial newspapers are going out of business or are being taken over by larger concerns.  I am anxious to preserve the widest possible spread of information. The more papers there are the better the spread.  I should not like to see provincial newspapers disappear. As well as conveying local news they also convey national news, sometimes news the national dailies do not carry to the same extent.  They also provide regular, well-remunerated employment. When there was scarcely any industry in the country these were going concerns. I know that circumstances vary but there are some countries which have not imposed any heavy taxation on the newspaper media.  I should like the Minister to bear this in mind.  I am aware that, as a result of negotiations, the value-added tax on newspapers has been reduced to something like 5.26.</P>
    <P>I understand also that advertising will be subjected to value-added tax. Advertising is essential to our economic life.  If the cost increases advertising may cease or less space may be taken.  This will reduce the earning power of the newspaper.  I am speaking more now for the provincial papers than for the national dailies; the latter are in a better position where advertising is concerned.  The provincial and county papers depend largely on local advertising.  If the cost increases advertising may be discontinued. I would ask the Minister&mdash;I do not know what the cost would be to the Exchequer&mdash;to relieve these papers entirely from taxation of any description.  He could tax the kind of information that we would all be better off without.  There are some publications which do not add anything to the character of mankind; there are others who think otherwise, but I am not one of them.  There is information in all kinds of papers, periodicals and books which is essential. <Col N="1711" /> So long as we remain&mdash;I hope it will be for many centuries&mdash;a democratic society that we will give the maximum liberty to our news media and that nothing will be placed in their way, either to push them out of business or to influence them, whatever their political leanings may be or whatever the content of their editorials may be.  Our lives are enriched by their opinions and the more such opinions we receive the better we are informed.  If we find they fail, and I know many will fail, then that amount of opinion is being withdrawn from us and we may ultimately find ourselves in the hands of a few newspaper owners who can colour public opinion to a large extent without the value of that wider mix which we get from provincial papers.</P>
    <P>In principle I support value-added tax.  I think it is essential and is an equitable form of tax.  From what I have read about it in countries where it operates&mdash;and I know it operates at differential rates subject to the requirements of each country&mdash;there has been no great outcry against it.  We shall have what I might perhaps improperly describe as equalisation of all things as far as possible in the Common Market and I hope taxation will come into this category although I am aware of our peripheral geographical position. I conclude by appealing to the Minister that provincial papers in particular be relieved from taxation of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reaction of most members of the public to the VAT proposal is one of fear that it will involve increases in the cost of living.  To some extent I know that these fears are unfounded and I also know that to some extent cost of living increases that would have happened in any case will be attributed to VAT.  But there is certainly a danger that the new tax will be used as an opportunity in certain areas to increase prices to the consumer.  In other countries where value-added tax operates it is fair to say they have somewhat more elaborate systems of price surveillance than we have and they are, therefore, in a better position to ensure that VAT or any other tax <Col N="1712" /> of that nature does not result in increased consumer prices other than normal increases due to the actual tax itself.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to take particular account of public fears in this matter and to examine the price surveillance machinery available to him to see if it is adequate, and, if it is not, to consider expanding it to ensure that fears expressed regarding its effect on the cost of living may be set at rest.</P>
      <P>I would not attempt to criticise VAT as a tax system because I have no great knowledge of the system but my initial reaction is that while its yield may be somewhat better in terms of revenue than a system of wholesale and turnover tax, it is possibly much more labour intensive for both the revenue people and those bearing the tax and they will have to engage in much more elaborate accountancy.  We should bear this in mind.  It is simply not enough to look at the yield in the Government coffers.  We must set against that the effort that must be put into raising this yield by civil servants and also by the public who must comply with the various regulations governing the operation of the tax.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to keep a very careful eye in the long-term on this tax and see if, in an EEC context, it might not be better if the general European purchase tax were not some system other than VAT and, if he might as representative of the Government, promote the adoption of some other system if it can be shown that another system would be more efficient. Although we are a small member of EEC we should not feel precluded from taking the initiative to improve the EEC in any way and this should extend to the tax system suggested.  VAT may well be the best system but this is a consideration that should always be kept in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to echo what many other speakers have said in regard to the application of VAT to newspapers. I understand the Minister has made concessions in response to fairly strong representations to him by various provincial papers.  He will probably be aware that in some, if not in most countries in Europe, newspapers do not <Col N="1713" /> bear any value-added tax.  I ask him to investigate the practice in other European countries more closely and see if such a concession could not be made here.  Just because in the past it was customary to tax newspapers under other systems of taxation does not mean we should feel precluded from excluding newspapers from VAT. This should be considered.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that the period within which payment of the tax must be made is, perhaps, unduly short. Apparently, the tax must be paid in general within one month of the date of the transaction on which it is due. I think this will result in serious injustice to many concerns because they would have to pay tax long before being paid by their customers.  They will have to hand over to the Revenue Commissioners tax on money they have not yet received themselves.  I think it is true that the majority of commercial transactions are on a 90 day payment basis.  It appears this tax will be on a monthly payment basis.  In this context I think the Minister should follow the example which apparently is being set in Britain where it is proposed that firms be given 90 days to pay the tax instead of the 30 days proposed here.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with the very great difficulties this will impose on retailers.  Recently a retailer expressed to me the fear that he would have to use two if not three cash registers in his shop in order to operate the different rates of tax which will apply under VAT.  At present grocers can charge the turnover tax at the checkout point on the total of any sale to a purchaser.  Under the new system they must include the tax in the marked price of each item and they will, therefore, have to collect the tax separately on each item.  Obviously, this will cause considerable difficulty and this will lead to increase in prices in smaller items, because where one has to apply this to something which is worth a penny it will be very difficult to find a price equivalent to 5.26 of a penny in order to add that on so obviously what will be done will be to make the price 1½ pence which will be considerably higher than the rate which is <Col N="1714" /> intended.  There is a definite danger of its affecting small items of purchase.</P>
    <P>While I am certainly not prepared, at the moment anyway, to put forward any particular solution to this dilemma, which possibly is inherent in a value-added tax system, I would ask the Minister and his advisers to give the matter very close consideration to see if they can find some way out of the likely effect of value-added tax dis-proportionately increasing the prices of low-priced items.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the effect of this system on agriculture.  In trying to deal with this subject one would have to understand the system which is possibly something I do not do.  I do not fully understand the whole idea of this value-added tax system but as far as I can understand it the idea is that farmers at point of sale of their goods will be given a refund of approximately 3.5 per cent of the value of the item being sold.  The intention of this refund is to compensate them for the value-added tax which they will have borne on the various inputs which they have bought in the course of producing that item.</P>
    <P>It obviously is not intended to compensate them for inputs such as labour because labour is not covered by the system.  Therefore, it is accepted that 3½ per cent is possibly an adequate figure if one is to accept an average. It would be obviously unfair to give a full refund of 5.26 per cent because there are certain of their inputs which are not taxable, for example labour. While this figure, globally, may be a reasonably fair one I think it will be unfair in its application as between different farmers.  I think it will be rather unfair to the highly intensive producer in that he will be the producer who will possibly be using more taxable inputs per unit of agricultural produce sold.  He will have used more fertilisers and more bought-in feeding-stuffs per beast sold than will the extensive producer who is not making an effort to increase his productivity.  This should not be the case.  The object of any State intervention in the agricultural field should be to increase <Col N="1715" /> productivity and to encourage intensive production rather than to give an incentive, however marginal, to extensive production.  This is one reservation which I have.</P>
    <P>A proposal was put forward by the NFA of which the Minister and probably all Members of the House are very well aware.  This proposal should be given pretty careful consideration. The proposal is that the principal agricultural inputs, namely, feedstuffs, fertilisers and seeds, should be taxed at zero and that the tax incurred in grantaided farmbuildings, water supply schemes and land reclamation should be repaid to the farmer by means of an addition to the grant; that machinery used solely or mainly on agriculture, e.g. agricultural tractors, combine harvesters, ploughs, <i>et cetera,</i> should also be taxed at zero.  This will leave a number of other inputs which are used in production, which are not so easily distinguishable as specifically agricultural inputs, and they will continue to be taxable in the normal way and the refund will be paid in respect of these inputs.</P>
    <P>I think this would be somewhat fairer because the effect of this system would be that a farmer would be getting a smaller refund but that he would not be bearing tax on certain of the other inputs.  It would be fairer because, at present, the level of farm incomes which are being covered will mean approximately a tax burden on the farming community of £8 million to £10 million.  If this were reduced, while the refund which the farmer would be getting would also be reduced, it would mean that the input which would be taxable would be somewhere in the region of £3 million.  If there is the injustice that it would be discriminatory as against intensive producers, to my mind it is better that this discrimination should be operating over a smaller area, namely the area of £3 million of taxable inputs, and consequent refunds, rather than over a wider area which would be the case if we were including the specifically agricultural inputs such as feedstuffs, fertilisers and seed, farmbuildings and machinery, which are, at present, proposed <Col N="1716" /> to be included.  This is a proposal which merits consideration.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise, in case there is any misunderstanding from the rather garbled explanation which I have been trying to give, that this proposal does not involve a lessening of the tax burden on the farming community.  The proposal merely means that instead of paying the tax on the inputs and then getting the equivalent refund at the point of output, they will not pay it in the first place and therefore not get the refund.  Overall, the same amount of money will go into the tax coffers from the farming community but the burden will be distributed more equitably. I think it has been argued that it is very difficult to distinguish, particularly in the field of machinery, what constitutes a specifically agricultural machine and that this would create difficulties in providing an exemption. To the best of my knowledge, this distinction between specifically agricultural machinery and non-agricultural machinery is already being made in that non-agricultural machinery is going to bear the tax at 16 per cent whereas specifically agricultural machinery is going to bear it at the 5 per cent level.  This distinction is already being made, so the administrative difficulty of removing the tax completely from agricultural machinery does not appear to be very great at all.  I urge these few considerations and apologise to the House for the fact that they have not been presented in a clear fashion as I have only just started to look into the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I have not had an opportunity of studying the full implications of value-added tax.  There seems to be an uneasiness, I suppose it is not unnatural, amongst different sections of the public as to how this particular tax will affect them individually.  Small traders, who are probably one of the most vulnerable sections of the community with regard to extra taxation, are apprehensive about the ultimate implications of this tax.  I have heard value-added tax described as one of the best systems of indirect taxation because unlike income tax and other <Col N="1717" /> such forms of taxation it is not calculated to stop increased production.</P>
      <P>When turnover tax was introduced in 1963 we were told it would bring in £12 million a year in revenue.  The argument put forward at that time was that turnover tax was necessary because it would be found in time that the four traditional methods of taxation, namely, tobacco, beer, spirits and petrol, would be inadequate.  With the present agitation about the dangers of cigarette smoking I think we can expect a fall-off in the consumption of cigarette tobacco in the years ahead and this will mean a consequent fall in revenue while Government expenditure will be increasing.  As I already said, in 1963 it was expected to collect £12 million from turnover tax but tax from that source is now running in the region of £80 million.  Apart from wholesale and turnover tax industrial producers are heavily taxed.  Most people believe that our lack of competitiveness is due to this tax on companies which is at a higher rate than that payable in Britain.  The Minister must have realised this because the other day he decreased company tax.</P>
      <P>The only excuse offered for reducing a tax which was introduced only a few months ago was that the Government needed the money and they had to get it.  That is not a very logical way of approaching a tax structure.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is replying I would like him to tell the House whether value-added tax will affect people who have not been paying tax heretofore.  Will it bring the farming community into the tax net to an increasing degree?  Will it prove more oppressive on small traders?</P>
      <P>Value-added tax is levelled at three or four stages and this will require a considerable degree of book-keeping. I suppose many traders have already been drilled in this form of record keeping but I feel that this new system will involve them to an even greater degree in record keeping. Small traders, even those who have done their own accounts up to now, will probably be forced to employ auditors and accountants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All told I believe value-added tax will bring the Government increased <Col N="1718" /> revenue.  I understand that the revenue people have stated that the actual amount of money collected will not be very different from what they collect from the wholesale and turnover taxes but the Minister has admitted there will be increased coverage.  If the rate remains the same but the incidence of taxation increases there must be an increase in revenue.  Increased taxation means that our position in a competitive world as a trader becomes weaker.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that when we enter the EEC we will be expected to introduce a tax structure of this nature under the accepted idea in the Community of a harmonisation of taxation as well as a harmonisation of many other activities, but, as far as I understand it, Britain does not intend to introduce value-added tax until 1973.  I wonder why the Government feel they must introduce value-added tax ten months ahead of Britain.  In our negotiations with the EEC there has been almost complete agreement on everything; the concessions that have been negotiated are the same for the four applicant countries. In fact, so far as negotiations were concerned we could have remained at home because they could have done all negotiations for us.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why we decided to introduce this tax next April when Britain will not have this tax until nine months later.  I wonder if this will have any effect on our trading relations with Britain?  Even if we enter the EEC our trade with Britain still will be very considerable and it will be a long time before there is a significant change in this pattern.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us in his reply why he decided to adopt this system.  I think originally we had decided to introduce the tax in January&mdash;a year in advance of Britain.</P>
    <P>While the tax has been described as one of the best forms of taxation by continental standards, our position may be somewhat different.  Twenty-eight per cent of our population are engaged in farming as compared with 3 per cent in Britain.  The social and economic structure of our country is still extremely agricultural, much more than any of the member or applicant countries of the EEC.  Although our <Col N="1719" /> farms are, on the average, larger than farms in the EEC countries, many of them are run-down and have a poor productive capacity.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated there were three advantages in having this tax.  One was that it would be spread over a wider section of the business community and that the tax was a little more than a change in the method of collection. The Minister added that the incidence and impact on prices would be broadly similar to the incidence and impact of the present sales taxes.  One's reaction to such a statement is, &ldquo;We have heard this before&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We were told that decimalisation would not make any difference in the cost of living and would not cause any difficulty.  Without consulting any figures, we all know now that decimalisation quite definitely had an inflationary effect.  If there is a question of a fraction it does not go to the customer but to the man behind the counter.  Therefore, I am not so sanguine or optimistic as the Minister when he states that this change will not have any impact on prices and that they will remain as they are <i>vis-á-vis</i> taxation.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister another advantage of this tax is that it should make evasion more difficult.  In so far as the tax is collected at four levels each person pays the tax at the point it reaches him and makes deductions in respect of what has been paid already.  Therefore, his contribution is only a fraction of what it would be under the present system where the entire tax is collected at the final stage. The Minister pointed out that evasion would be more difficult and this is true as each person will be able to ensure that he does not pay any more than his due.  Not alone will the traders be tax-gatherers, they will be tax-policemen. I am not saying that there should be evasion but the taxpayer now has an added function with regard to the collection of this tax.  The publican and trader are revenue officers and they may not like their new roles.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a sum of £3½ million per year in connection <Col N="1720" /> with relief from double taxation.  I do not know if that is very significant as an argument in favour of the tax.  The argument I should have liked the Minister to develop is whether it offers more incentive than the present turnover tax.  I would be prepared to accept that view with regard to income tax and this is an argument economists would put forward.  There are social aspects that might be mentioned on the other side but I should like the Minister to tell us of his views on this point.</P>
    <P>On a technical point, the new tax will be collected on the basis of fractions. The old taxation figures of 5 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per cent, increased some time ago to 20 per cent, will be replaced by 5.26 per cent, 16.37 per cent, 30.26 per cent and 11.11 per cent.  Apparently this was necessary because our turnover tax was on a tax inclusive basis, whereas the new tax is on a tax exclusive basis.</P>
    <P>I expect there are technical reasons for this but may be the only reason is that this is the way it is operated within the EEC.  Perhaps when he is replying, the Minister will tell us why it was found necessary to introduce these complicated fractions.  One would have thought that he would have introduced round figures.  Could it be that on the arithmetic of the operation he aims to take in the same amount of money under the new system as under the old? If that is the reason it does not seem a very good one.  Could this be a gimmick on the part of the Minister to give us the impression that he is so meticulous as not to take any more from us under the new system than he took from us under the old system?</P>
    <P>Like most people here I would be interested particularly in the position of the farming community under this proposed tax.  The Minister tells us that special arrangements are being made for the agricultural sector.  I understand that some activities, particularly mart sales, are being treated in a special way but I have not yet had an opportunity to study these arrangements.  I would make a plea to the Minister to consider this question of abolishing the tax on input which applies to the farming community.  In the Minister's brief there is reference to tax credit in relation to <Col N="1721" /> farmers' input of 3.85 per cent and 2.68 per cent.  Deputy Bruton mentioned an average figure of 3.5 per cent.  Representations on behalf of the farmers have been made to the Minister asking that this be treated as a zero tax but I do not know whether this would be allowable in EEC conditions.  Tax of that nature would make it more difficult for our farming community to be competitive and if such a tax is in existence when we enter the Common Market it will then be more difficult to remove it.  I wonder whether the Minister has considered the full implications of this tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister states, too, that he has modified the White Paper proposals and is introducing a method whereby cattle marts and cattle dealers will be relieved of accountability of their sales of livestock where they opt for arrangements analogous to the simplified scheme applicable to farmers and to which he has referred already.  I do not know how this will work in practice.  It would appear that whatever modifications he has introduced were probably necessary and that the alternative would be that farmers would conduct much of their buying and selling actually on their farms or, perhaps, at fairs rather than at marts.  Maybe this was an act of necessity rather than anything else on the part of the Minister.  I should be glad if, when he is replying, he would explain in more detail how charges will be made on the ordinary farming activities.  Sometimes there are several transactions involved in the sale of cattle or other stock.  A man may keep cattle for a couple of months and then sell them to another who will sell them again a couple of months later and so on.</P>
    <P>We are not speaking here in the simplified terms of an industry producing a commodity which then goes to a wholesaler and from him to a retailer and, lastly, to a consumer.  In the case of livestock there can be multiple transactions. How is added value to be calculated in such cases?  Are there to be a whole series of invoices accompanying every animal up and down the country? The mechanics of this aspect must have been worked out already by the Department and the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1722" /> and perhaps the Minister would let us have details of these mechanics when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister, when he speaks of this being a broader type of tax than the existing one, extending to a larger section of the community, what particular sections or sectors of the community he has in mind who will now be embraced by this tax who were not embraced before.  He scarcely means merely the small percentage of the community who succeed in evading the tax, the present turnover or wholesale taxes.  That percentage, I presume, is small, but when he says that this is to be a more widespread tax, what particular sections of the community has he in mind and what particular sections will be affected by that extension of the base of the tax?</P>
    <P>All in all, despite the fact that this, as a taxation system, has, in general, been described by economic experts as one of the least objectionable forms of taxation, I have serious misgivings as to whether it will prove as suitable for our particular society as it may have appeared on the continent. For many years, they had various forms of spending tax on the continent, and they eventually evolved this particular type of tax and now have developed a fair degree of harmonisation. Perhaps the Minister could also tell us, apart from the basic structure of the tax, how the rates in the different continental countries compare with the rate we are proposing here and whether the coverage of the commodities on the continent is the same as we are providing here.  In the time of the turnover tax, there were some peculiar features in that tax, and we can all recall discussions at that time about going into the local chemist's shop with a prescription, and if the prescription was for a human being, you paid tax and, if it were a prescription for a dog, you did not.  Are those types of anomalies to be carried on in this new taxation?  How does it compare in that respect with what we have had before?</P>
    <P>Essentially this is a highly complicated Bill, and I suppose none of us has had an opportunity to give <Col N="1723" /> it the study we should have as yet. It is largely a measure that will best be dealt with on Committee Stage because it is complicated and highly technical.  When we have had an opportunity of going through it in Committee, I expect we will all be a bit more informed about it than we are now. At present I can only deal in a general fashion with the points raised by the Minister in his brief, which, of course, was also a general type of brief.  I have dealt with it on those lines and perhaps the Minister would be good enough to reply to the few points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to reply to the detailed points at this stage as I think they are much more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage.  In general, the impression I have got from this debate is that the House is not opposed to the principle of value-added taxation, although opposition has been expressed to various aspects of some specific proposals contained in the Bill.  Questions have been raised about the validity of the reasons for making the change-over to value-added taxation and some other questions have been raised as to the timing of the change-over.  There is a qualification to what I have said about the apparent general acceptance of the principle of value-added taxation.  I noted with interest the approach of Deputy Collins, who said he was opposed to the whole principle and condemned it root and branch.  I will be interested to know how Deputy Collins will vote on the question of the Common Market in the light of that statement.  However, that is a matter we can look forward to with considerable interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the change-over to value-added taxation I have set out in my speech introducing the Second Stage of the Bill, but in view of the suggestion by Deputy Tully and a number of other Deputies that our EEC commitment is the only or the principal reason, I should like once again to <Col N="1724" /> summarise the arguments which led the Government to introduce these proposals.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could put it in perspective first by saying what I have said on a number of previous occasions, that is, that, even if we were never going into the EEC we should introduce the value-added tax system.  The main factor in our decision to introduce the value-added tax was that it was urgently necessary to strengthen the administrative and collection machinery of the present sales taxes which was designed to handle a very much smaller volume of revenue than we are now deriving from the turnover and wholesale taxes.</P>
    <P>The biggest weakness of the present taxes is that the collection points for most of the taxes are limited to certain types of traders, the retailers and the wholesalers.  The simplest way to rectify this was to introduce the value-added tax which would spread the collection over the whole range of production and distribution without causing any duplication of sales tax or any significant change in its incidence.  The value-added tax is so designed that the inter-relationship between the different traders who are paying the tax helps to discourage evasion.  To some extent the system is a self-checking one.  By that I mean that, to the extent that an individual trader wishes to claim credit for tax paid from the Revenue Commissioners, he has a vested interest in ensuring that the correct figures are entered on his invoices and on the invoices he receives.  In addition, since the individual traders will have to pay less tax to the Revenue than they do under the present system there will be less to be gained from evasion.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the value-added tax will remove almost completely the double taxation which exists under our present system amounting to about £3½ million a year.  The existence of this element of double taxation&mdash;arising from the fact that firms at present suffer tax on certain purchases such as office furniture and certain building materials &mdash;constitutes a small but undesirable hidden tax on the cost of goods which cannot be refunded or credited even on exports.  Under the value-added tax system, exports will be completely free <Col N="1725" /> from tax.  Any tax paid at the earlier stages prior to export will be refunded.</P>
    <P>The fact that, as a member of the EEC, we would be obliged to convert to the value-added tax system in due course was definitely a consideration, but the decision to change-over to value-added tax was made by the Irish Government alone and was based on the clear advantages which the tax has for us in present circumstances.  I repeat that, even if we were never going into the EEC, we should change to a value-added tax system.</P>
    <P>Some suggestions were made in the course of the debate that we should have taken advantage of the introduction of value-added tax to alter the incidence of certain existing taxes and to relieve, for example, those who were referred to as the hard-pressed income taxpayers.  At the same time as I was castigated for not taking advantage of this opportunity to recast our taxation system, some speakers, in the same speech, talked about the fact that the value-added tax system is likely to increase prices enormously, according to them.  I should like to make it clear that the main principle we tried to observe in introducing the value-added tax was to ensure that the introduction of the tax would not be an excuse for an increase in prices.</P>
    <P>This is the reason, for instance, why we have these strange-looking rates of taxes of 5.26 per cent, and so on. These are the mathematical equivalents of the existing wholesale and turnover tax rates.  Therefore, the operation of the value-added tax should ensure that there is no increased taxation being applied.  There will be no excuse for people to use the change-over to increase prices.  Some Deputy referred to this as a possible explanation and described it as a gimmick. It is a vitally important matter and I should like everybody to understand this.  The switch-over in the system does not mean that there is any increase in the rate of taxation.</P>

      <P>Wait for it.  We will come to that.  As far as anybody in the country is concerned it means that he knows that there cannot be an increase in the price of any commodity because of this tax, whatever other reasons there might be.  In other words, if there is not another reason and he sees an increase he knows that it is not justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be dealing with that but, since Deputy Tully raised it, let me say he and a number of other Deputies seemed to be under the impression that value-added tax has to be dealt with on an item-by-item basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the advice which is available to people but they do not have to take it.  It depends on the kind of shop they have.  The value-added tax at the retail level is a tax on turnover. The figures are worked out to be precisely the same as the existing turnover tax.  The 5.26 per cent rate is the exact mathematical equivalent of the 5 per cent rate taking one on a tax inclusive and one on a tax exclusive basis.</P>

      <P>It may be on paper but it is also out of people's pockets.  Any divergence from that is something I think people understand even if they do not know what 5.26 per cent of ninepence is.  They know that.  They will know that, if there are changes in prices which are attributed to this, they are not justified and they do not have to accept that they are justified and they can make complaints and have them investigated.  If an attempt is made to change prices on the grounds that the value-added tax constitutes an increase in the rate of taxation, people should understand that there is no increase.</P>
      <P>As I was saying, the main reason for not thinking in terms of a different incidence of rates of taxation is to ensure that this is a change-over in the method of collection and that it does not provide an excuse for increasing prices.

      <P>Some Deputies have claimed that the yield from the value-added tax will be enormously increased as against the yield from the combined turnover and wholesale taxes at present. Indeed, Deputy Collins, I think, said it would be increased by 50 per cent. Whatever the truth may be of that forecast, it seems to me that the logical explanation for what they are saying is that, apart from some minor changes in how the tax will operate, since the rate of tax will be precisely the same as the existing wholesale and turnover taxes, they must be saying that there is an enormous amount of evasion of wholesale and turnover tax, so much so that when it is caught by the value-added tax system it will increase the yield even, as Deputy Collins said, to the extent of 50 per cent.  I must say, if that were true, I would look forward with some degree of pleasurable anticipation to that result as Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice available to me is that while there is evasion and, indeed, some of us may be aware of some cases of this, and it is not in small figures as Deputy O'Connell was suggesting, nevertheless, in relation to the total yield it is relatively small, but then it is going to be caught almost entirely by the value-added tax system.  However, to say that the yield will be enormously <Col N="1729" /> increased, unless it is going to come in that way, is something that requires some kind of explanation considering that the actual rate of tax is precisely the same.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, the main reasons for not considering any change in the structure of our taxation at the moment is to ensure that value-added tax is introduced as smoothly as possible and does not provide an excuse for increasing prices.  It could well be that at some time in the future when the system has been established and is working quite smoothly changes could be made both up and down in rates applying to different commodities and, as Deputies will be aware, there are some proposals in the EEC for a degree of harmonisation but they have not developed too far yet.  But, apart from any such proposals, it is conceivable that at some time in the future a Minister for Finance here would consider making changes.  My main objective at the moment is to have as smooth as possible a change-over and also not to provide excuses for increasing prices because of the change-over.</P>

On the question of the timing of this change-over, some Deputies seemed to be under the impression that we were rushing headlong into the introduction of value-added tax.  I find this rather difficult to understand. Although that phrase was actually used by one Deputy and similar terms were used by some others, the fact is a White Paper was issued on value-added tax in June, 1968, explaining the system in general terms and a second White Paper giving the detailed <Col N="1730" /> proposals for our application of value-added tax to our system was issued in March of this year.</P>

      <P>We have to accept that in the views of some Deputies on the opposite benches the proposal first dealt with in a White Paper in June, 1968, and which is now before the House, the Bill having been circulated some time ago, represents rushing headlong in.  There are different time scales. I know some people do not like change and may regard this as a very precipitate move.  On this side of the House we are not quite so conservative.  In regard to this question of timing, I do not think that the question of the intentions in Italy or in Britain are really relevant because the circumstances in those two countries are quite different from ours.  As I pointed out in an interjection where the Deputy took Britain as an example, the existing sales taxes in Britain are far away from a value-added tax system as compared with our turnover and wholesale taxes which are very close to a value-added tax system.  Therefore, the problem in Britain will be far greater than it is here.  This is the most obvious reason why they do not propose to start until 1st April, 1973.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann having regard to the manner in which Mr. J. Gibbons, now Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, misled the Dáil on 8th May, 1970, when he was Minister for Defence, is of opinion that his conduct was unworthy of a member of the Government and of a member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Cosgrave.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>After all that has been said and done since the beginning of this whole sordid conspiracy to import arms illegally by attempting to subvert the institutions and public officials of this State, one fact is clear and incontrovertible and that is that Deputy James Gibbons, the erstwhile Minister for Defence, since promoted to the rank of Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries by the present Taoiseach, was either an accessory to these events, which were described by both Deputy Haughey and Deputy Blaney as most damaging to the welfare of this country, or else he is a moron.  He is either untruthful, or incompetent, and it matters very little to this nation which he is.  Both conditions render Deputy Gibbons unfit for membership of the Government and of this Parliament of the people, and the continuing support by the Taoiseach of this person, so demonstrably unfit for office, indicates also the Taoiseach's unfitness for the office which he holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to prove this not by quoting the evidence of people who are unacceptable to Deputy Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, but by his own sworn testimony and by the submissions of the High Court judge to the jury and the jury's decisions on those submissions.  Before I do so I think it would be relevant to refer to last night's speech by the Tánaiste. It is a speech which can best be described as one typical of a man who knows so little about what is going on that he seeks a pair for a Division in <Col N="1733" /> this House from a member of his own party, who is a member not of this House but of the Seanad, a man who was proved in the course of the trial never to have been consulted by the Minister for Defence, by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, by the Minister for Finance, by the Minister for Local Government, or by any other Minister in the absence of the Taoiseach, because he was presumed not to know anything about what was going on.  Putting him in to intervene in this debate is not really a worthwhile contribution. True, the Tánaiste, in his innocence, may accept Deputy Gibbons as a worthy man, but a jury of what Deputy Haughey described as 12 good Dublin men did not and, if we have to make an election as between what the Tánaiste thinks of Deputy Gibbons and what 12 ordinary good and true men think, I think we will rely, and so will the people of this nation, on what 12 good and true men think.</P>
    <P>Before we come to the evidence, it is important to recall that in this House, in the position he now occupies, Deputy Gibbons, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, said&mdash;though it makes no significant difference to what we are required to adjudicate upon in this motion&mdash;that a lie was one thing, perjury was another. Whether he elects between either of these, or both, or neither we have never learned.  All we do know is that 12 jurymen did not accept his version of what occurred.  In the first instance, I want to deal with Deputy Gibbons's denial of knowledge about or consent to the importation of arms. I submit that his denial was rebutted by evidence which he himself tendered in court on 10th October, 1970, because his own evidence disclosed that as early as 25th March he was told by Captain Kelly&mdash;I am sorry; as early as the last days of March and the beginning of April&mdash;that there was an attempted importation of arms through Dublin port in which Captain Kelly was involved and, on the evidence of Deputy Gibbons, we are told that Captain Kelly informed him of the presence of the Army at the docks and the Minister's query to Captain Kelly was: &ldquo;Did the Army disappear into the shadows?&rdquo;<Col N="1734" /> He admitted in the course of his sworn testimony that Captain Kelly informed him of other plans to import arms through the port of Trieste and also of an intention to import arms through the port of Antwerp.  We were also informed by him that he was aware of the presence of Captain Kelly in Vienna.  We were also told on oath by Deputy Gibbons that Captain Kelly had not identified to him, the Minister for Defence at that time, any of the persons involved with him&mdash;that is, Captain Kelly&mdash;in the enterprise; all that he knew was that Captain Kelly was involved.  The only complaint was he did not identify his companions.  We were also informed in the same sworn testimony that he admitted that he did not disapprove when Captain Kelly told him of the attempt to import arms on 25th March through the port of Dublin, nor did he express any disapproval, or condemnation, or give any order to prevent further attempts; and his excuse was he did not want to give Captain Kelly any sense of grievance by being let down, especially having regard to the fact that the declaration was made to him.</P>
    <P>Judge Henchy, in his submissions to the jury, said, amongst other things, that Mr. Gibbons had been &ldquo;assailed as a witness who was a liar and an unsatisfactory witness, and I must leave it to you to decide whether that conversation&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the conversation between Deputy Gibbons and Captain Kelly&mdash;&ldquo;took place or not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With reference to the denial by Deputy Gibbons in this House that there were people from Derry involved in the training in the use of arms in Dunree&mdash;and, if I may, I will refer now to Deputy Gibbons's own words last night when he said the purpose of arms was to kill&mdash;he, on his own admission in court and here, gave the direction and the authorisation for the training and use of arms outside the jurisdiction of this State for the purpose of killing. On his evidence in that regard, this is what the learned judge had to say: he said that Deputy Gibbons said that it was not true to say such people had been trained in Dunree, that technically training was not given to any civilian, that before training was given to people <Col N="1735" /> from Derry, the nine people, or so, were inducted into the LDF and thereby became members of the Defence Forces, so that statement was technically true and, when pressed on the point, he said that this was a statement in Dáil Éireann, thereby implying that statements of this kind which are not the literal truth are frequently made in Dáil Éireann.  &ldquo;It is a matter for you,&rdquo; the judge told the jury, &ldquo;to decide whether his conduct in regard to the statement he made in Dáil Éireann about the training of the people in the Bogside, or the statement he made in Dáil Éireann about his suspicions or that nothing concrete had emerged, are within the category of technically correct statements which are made by politicians in Parliament, or whether they show Mr. Gibbons to be a man given to half truth and lies, and whether as a result, you should treat him as being discredited as a witness.  I express no opinion but leave the matter to you.&rdquo;  To the 12 honest men on the jury!</P>
    <P>Again, his lordship, addressing the jury, said with reference to the contradiction between the evidence of Deputy Haughey and Deputy Gibbons about the conversation: &ldquo;Either Mr. Gibbons concocted this story and has come to court and perjured himself, or it happened. If there is another explanation, please act on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, later on, the same judge addressing the same jury, said that the jury might say that Mr. Gibbons should have put his foot down and told Captain Kelly that he should not import arms in any circumstances, that that was a matter for the appropriate Army authorities and that, when he got information about the attempted importation into the port of Dublin and the projected importation from Vienna and when he, Mr. Gibbons, did not do so in any categorical terms, Captain Kelly was entitled to presume that Deputy Gibbons was saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The judge added: &ldquo;That is the view that is open to you.  I will say no more about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When that jury of 12 honest men came to express their verdict they <Col N="1736" /> rejected all that Deputy Gibbons had said.  They found that Deputy Gibbons, then Minister for Defence, had misled this Dáil in relation to the training of people in the use of arms to kill in Derry.  They found that Deputy Gibbons had misled this Dáil and, through this Dáil, the people of Ireland in relation to his own involvement in the importation of arms.</P>
    <P>We are informed that within the last few days Deputy Haughey said that the time has come to leave the events of May, 1970, and their squalor behind us and to let history judge all those who played any part in them.  We find this proposition unacceptable.  We cannot leave it to the charity of history to find out what happened to £100,000 voted by this Dáil into the custody of Deputy Haughey to properly administer it to bring relief to the homeless, the distressed, the naked people of Belfast and Derry, who had no beds in which to sleep.  We cannot leave that to the silence of history&mdash;that requires a verdict now&mdash;while those responsible for this debacle, to use Deputy Haughey's own words, remain in Government, continuing the harm they have done to this nation&mdash;and by nation we mean a nation of 32 counties &mdash;by the way in which they have disillusioned the Nationalists in the north by misleading them and by the manner in which they have multiplied fear and hatred in the minds of Unionists for the rest of us because of the way in which Deputy Haughey and others abused the responsibility entrusted to them by the people of this nation.</P>
    <P>The casualness and complacency about public money, about the illegal importation of arms, the deployment of our public officials; the casualness about persons training in the use of arms in the knowledge that those arms would be used, in the words of Deputy Gibbons, to kill, indicates quite clearly that even if the reputation of this Government is to be put on the decision plate tonight, as the Taoiseach would have it, then the Government is clearly deserving of condemnation.</P>
    <P>But we have related this motion to the conduct of a member of this House, a person charged with Government responsibility by the Irish <Col N="1737" /> people through this House.  We seek a verdict upon that issue alone and if the consequences of that are unpleasant for the Taoiseach, his Ministers and the Fianna Fáil Government, they have no right to presume that their personal, individual welfare or membership of Fianna Fáil takes precedence over the interests of the nation.  That is precisely what is proposed in the Taoiseach's own threat to his dissidents uttered the other night.  We seek a verdict upon the merits of Deputy Gibbons but it is the concentration on the survival of Fianna Fáil and the efforts of the Taoiseach to hold off within Fianna Fáil those who are out to &ldquo;do&rdquo; him now or in the future that has led the Taoiseach and his Government to abandon any attempt to govern the country.</P>
    <P>The question is regularly asked these days: has Ireland any Government at all?  If this motion is defeated tonight the question will still remain: who is the Government?  Are they anxious to govern or are they, as they have been for the past 18 months, yielding at all times to their own dissidents? To those weak-minded people in our midst who say that now is not the time to ask the will of our people to prevail, we say there will be no government if this motion is defeated; the same non-government will exist as has existed for the past 18 months. The way to get a Government is to go to the people to elect a Government to execute the will of the people and that can happen within three weeks from this night if certain people vote the way they ought to vote, and as their consciences tell them.</P>
    <P>The only occasion since Deputy Haughey was dismissed from the Government, on which he was moved to speak in this House, to which he was sent to express the views of his constituents whether he held the glorious office of Minister or just as a Deputy, was a fortnight ago when he intervened to protest against the alleged prostitution of a 42-year dead poet.  We feel sure that Yeats rests peacefully tonight, unoffended by any play upon words and unaffected by Deputy Haughey's defence of his <Col N="1738" /> prostituted corpse.  But one cannot but feel that Deputy Haughey could have chosen some matter of greater moment to his constituents and the country upon which to speak after 18 months of Parliamentary silence.  Why is it that Deputy Haughey always returns to his wealthy, luxurious home in County Dublin to well-staged press conferences or to equally well-set-up television interviews, to make double-talk pronouncements on the welfare of the State instead of talking here in the people's forum where he can be challenged on what he says.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, at the conclusion of the arms trial, issued a challenge to the Taoiseach and he said then of that trial, which was arranged by the Taoiseach and by Deputy Gibbons, that it was a political trial brought by his enemies against him.  He said that those responsible for the debacle had &ldquo;no alternative but to take the honourable course that is open to them&rdquo;.  This man, who then in a moment of truth said or implied that the only honourable course open to the Taoiseach and Deputy Gibbons was one of resignation, is now ready to sell his membership of Fianna Fáil in the national interest even though it means dishonour to himself and the Fianna Fáil Party in order that he can stay behind Deputy Lynch who is still out to exterminate him.</P>
    <P>What else did Deputy Haughey say on that night of truth?  He said that the trial would have political implications which would be far-reaching.  On the same night Deputy Blaney, as yet a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, also referred to the political implications of yesterday's verdict: &ldquo;You can wait for the political implications; they will come.&rdquo;  Whether either or both or all these people and those who support them go in behind the Taoiseach tonight or not is irrelevant except that for them to do so would be an act of gross indecency because their intention still is, still uncontradicted by them, to bring about political implications and bring about the downfall of Mr. Jack Lynch, for the time being Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>We live in terrible times.  Nobody on this side of the House wishes to add <Col N="1739" /> to the disillusionment or distress of the people of Northern Ireland; nobody wishes to add to their pain.  We are quite well aware that in these terrible moments, seconds and split seconds may well count and may turn the tide between disaster and bloody civil war and peace and reunification.  But we do not see that there is any prospect of bringing about the reconciliation of minds necessary in Northern Ireland while this country is for the time being, presumably, governed by a party which is within itself torn completely asunder. It is because of our sense of the urgency of the need to give to the Republic of Ireland a Government which is united and not divided upon the basis of vicious personalities and animosities that we moved this motion in condemnation of Deputy Gibbons.</P>
    <P>We feel it is very necessary to restore public confidence in the institutions of this State.  We have no authority or right to speak other than that given to us by the people.  Nobody here can be so naive as to say that what has happened in the last two years was in the contemplation of the people when they last gave their verdict.  Quite clearly they are entitled once again to give a verdict on what has occurred and decide who should rule and guide the destiny of this nation in these terribly critical days ahead.</P>
    <P>Those critical days are not, I suspect, the next 21 during which we could go to the country and have a verdict in a general election but they may well be the next 21 weeks and if Ireland has not by then got a Government which is united and dependent for its support, not upon people who are determined to pull down the Taoiseach, then the catastrophe facing the country is probably greater than any of us in our worst nightmares can ever imagine.</P>
    <P>I saw a reference recently to a suggestion that this Dáil was like a circus. It is a fair comment, I suppose, when one considers what has been happening. The reality is that Deputy Lynch has been turning the whole country into a circus.  The Taoiseach has been putting on his own special Fianna Fáil act of quick change artistes, sword swallowers, tightrope walkers, knife throwers, cliffedge <Col N="1740" /> hangers, carpet pullers, roaring lions and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will be interested tonight in seeing whether there is, in the whole Fianna Fáil Party of sheep, one man left or preferably even a number of men who will put their country first before their own personal survival in the ranks of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>In this circus, Sir, there is also an audience and the audience are the people of Ireland, the unfortunate people of Ireland who have had to pay for the Government's mistakes and inactivity. The best that can be said about the audience is they are bored with the act which the Taoiseach is putting on but the reality is, the sad, crude, lamentable reality is that they are confused, depressed and frightened. Nothing will bring to the people of Ireland any relief from that appalling dismay which now overcomes them other than the acceptance of this motion tonight so that Dáil Éireann will, at last, have redeemed itself from the reputation which the Government's conduct has put upon it, will have redeemed itself from the reputation of being insincere and being ineffective. That can only be done by carrying this motion of condemnation against a Member of this Dáil and a Member of the Government who has misled the people of Ireland through this Dáil as to what exactly is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, Sir, I want to say this.  I have observed in recent days on the bridges and roads of your own county, Donegal, and elsewhere, slogans painted in indelible paint saying: &ldquo;Lynch Jack&rdquo;.  I wonder, Sir, whether any of the people who painted or caused to be painted those signs will dare to walk like sheep behind him tonight.  If they do, Sir, although I am not noted for extending sympathy to anyone my sympathy goes out to the Taoiseach for he will have to live with them until they kill him.  The tragedy is that, in the meantime, this nation is bleeding to death and the only way <Col N="1741" /> of relieving us from that terrible death is to accept this motion tonight, go to the country and take the people's verdict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I come to the substance of the motion I should like to make a comment on some observations that I have seen and heard from and on behalf of the public as to why this motion should be taken in Dáil Éireann at this juncture.  First of all, this is a Fine Gael motion in the name of their leader and it is and their responsibility for taking it on the Order Paper.  The public perhaps do not know, and would not be expected to know, the details of the Standing Orders of this House but in order to make this matter clear as to why the motion is now being taken I think I ought to refer to them.</P>
      <P>First of all, the motion was tabled in the early part of this year at a time when it was possible to take it because Private Members' Motions were being taken.  But, because of a rule of the House agreed to by all parties, a motion, the substance of which has been debated in another motion within six months previously, may not be taken.  It was you, Sir, as Ceann Comhairle, who decided, when the Fine Gael Party asked for this motion to be taken within that six month period, that it was not in order then.  There followed the Budget and the period up to the summer recess when the House was considering financial business, when again, under the Standing Orders of this House, it was not proper to take Private Members' Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost eight or nine months have elapsed now since that motion was tabled and when the Dáil reassembled for ordinary business on 27th October last both Opposition parties sought time for Private Members' Business notwithstanding that, at this time of the year and up to the end of the Christmas Recess, the House will be considering financial business.  Both Opposition parties were posturing about taking Private Members' Time, making ridiculous <Col N="1742" /> and impractical offers of sitting every day of every week in order to facilitate this purpose.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I was faced with a decision, one which it was not easy for me to take.  I had to weigh up my own natural instinct of facing up to a challenge no matter how distasteful it might be, no matter what the consequences might be for the Government and for myself, against deciding whether this would be the appropriate time to debate such a motion.  As I said, it is my instinct to face up to a challenge like this and not to be taunted&mdash;as I would have been in the weeks that followed the request to have this motion taken&mdash;with jibes that I was running away from it as against the position of the country generally, as against whether it would be in the best interests of the country to make time available.</P>
    <P>As to the appropriateness of the time, I had to consider the sad and unfortunate and dangerous situation that now obtains in the North of Ireland. I had to consider, too, that at this time we are facing the end of the negotiations for our entry into the European Economic Community and I had to consider the necessity for stability not only in Government but in Parliament at this time from both these points of view.</P>
    <P>As I said already in the National Executive of Fianna Fáil, because of these two considerations, we needed to show to the country and the world that we had stable Government, that we had stable Parliament and that there was no uncertainty as to where we were going and where we wanted to go.</P>
    <P>I gave this matter deep and mature thought, knowing that the result of a vote on this motion could be the defeat of the Government and the plunging of the country into a general election. Here I want to say that if this motion were not taken now it would have to be taken immediately after the Christmas recess.  The question I put to myself was whether it would be more appropriate, more capricious to take the motion now rather than wait until the spring.  Who was to say whether this sad and dangerous situation which obtains in the North of Ireland <Col N="1743" /> will have eased by the time the spring comes around when the motion would have to be taken as a matter of right?  Who was to say that the unfortunate and blind policies being pursued by the British Government of seeking military solutions to that unfortunate situation and imposing repressive measures on the minority in the North would have ceased?</P>
    <P>Certainly, come next spring this House will be in the throes of considering our application for membership of the EEC.  It is likely at that time we shall have before us the White Paper on which this House will make the decision whether or not we should adhere to that Community and immediately afterwards we shall have the obligation of putting that issue, with all the consequent legislation that it will entail, to the people for their verdict.  I decided that now was as good a time as any in that I could not be sure that the Northern situation would not have deteriorated by the spring and certainly I was sure that we would be in the throes of our examination of our application for membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>One thing that motivated me very strongly was this: If this motion was carried here tonight and if, as a result of the ensuing general election, there came to power in this country a coalition Government&mdash;a coalition of Fine Gael and Labour&mdash;what then would our position be in relation to our application for membership of the EEC when two factions in Government would be pulling in directly opposite directions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope the Northern situation will have eased by then but I know we will be involved in preparation for our entry to the EEC.  These are the reasons then why I decided to give time for this motion here this evening.  Let us examine, irrespective of personalities, what the purpose of this motion is: the purpose of this motion is to defeat the Government and so to procure a general election.  It is not any individual member of the Government who is in question, his ability or otherwise; <Col N="1744" /> it is the Government as a whole, it is confidence in this Government.  It therefore derives from that that it is the obligation of the members of our party who support that Government to support us in this motion.  I have stated unequivocally what my attitude will be in the event of that support not being forthcoming.  I need say no more about it.  This is the time, as far as our party is concerned, when there can be no equivocation and no prevarication as to where they stand in relation to Government policy.</P>
      <P>Let us now look at the terms of the motion, which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann having regard to the manner in which Mr. J. Gibbons, now Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, misled the Dáil on 8th May, 1970, when he was Minister for Defence, is of opinion that his conduct was unworthy of a member of the Government and of a member of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a very poor attempt to justify his motion on the basis of what he said.  What Deputy Gibbons said in Dáil Éireann on the 8th May, 1970, in relation to this motion, so far as I can interpret it, and I quote from column 839 of Volume 246 of the Official Report, was:</P>
      <P>I wish emphatically to deny any such knowledge or consent.</P>
      <P>That was knowledge or consent to smuggle in arms.  Moving the motion one would have expected Deputy Cosgrave to make some sort of a case in support of it which would satisfy the members of his own party at least, which they might have been able to accept, but Deputy Cosgrave's failure to do that was absolute and total.  He resurrected a number of quotations from Dáil debates and newspapers which have been hashed and rehashed over the past 18 months and, having read them into the record once more, did not know then from where to proceed or what else to do with them and to the dismay, and, I suggest, to the disbelief of those sitting beside and behind him, he sat down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave was a practising lawyer and, since court cases have been mentioned here frequently during the <Col N="1745" /> course of this debate, I can only suggest that if he had made a case to a court of law such as he made here yesterday any judge would have refused to let that case go to a jury.  Deputy Corish rested his case on a statement, made by a witness before the Public Accounts Committee last January and as reported in the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts of Tuesday, 26th January, 1971, which imputed knowledge to Deputy Gibbons, through me, of the subject matter of a meeting that that witness had with what he described as representatives of various groups in the North who were seeking weapons.</P>
    <P>It is no secret, nor has it been for many months, that various groups were in fact seeking weapons.  People came to members of the Government and to me, from time to time, seeking weapons but they were told firmly and unequivocably that this could not be done and the reasons why this could not be done were given.  I do not see where, in this allegation or this statement on which Deputy Corish seemed to rest his case, knowledge could be imputed to Deputy Gibbons of illegal importation of arms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish made two other charges and Deputy Ryan almost repeated one of them today.  I can forgive Deputy Corish, he is not a lawyer, but Deputy Ryan is a practising lawyer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish said, and I quote from yesterday's Dáil debate as reported in today's newspapers:</P>
      <P>The charges had been dismissed and in effect this meant that the jury accepted the facts as outlined and did not accept that these activities had been carried on without Mr. Gibbon's knowledge or consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan tried to suggest that the <Col N="1746" /> jury's verdict found against Deputy Gibbons.  I am surprised at Deputy Ryan's interpretation of the result of that trial.  Of course the jury found no such thing.  Deputy Ryan knows well that in any charge of this nature the onus of proof&mdash;proof beyond reasonable doubt&mdash;is on the prosecution and if there is a doubt the jury is entitled to find in favour of those accused.  It does not find against any individual witness and I reject entirely that spurious and unsustainable interpretation of the jury's verdict.  It should hardly be necessary to make such a comment in this House, composed as it is of a good sprinkling of practising lawyers.  However, Deputy Corish in his remarks yesterday and Deputy Ryan this evening were seeking to imply that the verdict of a law court could be used to reach a verdict on the propriety of political actions, in this case the actions of Deputy Gibbons.  Surely the House knows that this does not follow at all.  The fact that there was not evidence which would cause a court of law to reach a particular verdict does not mean that the acts which led to that case being heard never took place or that these acts did not call for political action on the part of the Government or the Taoiseach.  Obviously, Deputy Corish cannot draw a distinction between political and other actions, and perhaps it is as well for the good of the country that he sits on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to another reason why Deputy Gibbons stands convicted in his eyes, namely that he did not take a libel action against a person who slandered him.  I should not like to back any Deputy in this House as to his costs in an action for defamation before the Irish courts. Too many Deputies have sad memories of experiences of that sort; but I should not like to say to Deputy Corish that there is a difference between libel and what is called &ldquo;vulgar abuse&rdquo;.  I suggest that to call another person, and particularly a politican, who is called many things from time to time, &ldquo;an unmitigated scoundrel&rdquo; is nothing but vulgar abuse, and no matter against whom the charges were made it would not stand up in a court of law so far as defamation action is concerned.</P>

      <P>The suggestion is that over the last 18 months there should have been a general election and, irrespective of the outcome of this vote, there should also be a general election.  It seems to me there is one essential consideration which any Taoiseach must take into account in deciding whether he should seek a dissolution of the Dáil, apart from the situation in which the Taoiseach would no longer have a majority within the Dáil.  If there was a clear need to secure the people's mandate for a radical change in basic Government policies then obviously the people's approval of such a change would have to be sought in a general election.  Since no such change in Government policy has taken place, and since no such change is contemplated, the need for securing a fresh mandate from the people does not arise.</P>
      <P>Our policies are known to the Dáil and the country.  We have received a clear mandate from the people for these policies and we are resolved to carry them through.  There have been tests of the position of, as Deputy Ryan has described, &ldquo;the Taoiseach for the time being&rdquo;.  I was so described by Fine Gael when I was first nominated as Taoiseach but we had a series of by-elections in which this party won an unparalleled succession of victories in by-elections, so endorsing not only me but the Government in power.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a contribution and I agree with what he said that public honour is very valuable because it involves public trust.  I suggest that the only result of the moving of this motion here and the contributions we have had from the benches opposite in support of it is to besmirch honour and to lower the standards of public trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take up Deputy Cosgrave on one point in a general way.  He spoke about Cabinet responsibility, collective responsibility, and he went on to refer to the full disclosure <Col N="1749" /> of information on all occasions.  I should like to ask him what is the purpose of the Officials Secrets Act?  What is the purpose of the 30 year rule we have on non-disclosure of matters within the peculiar knowledge of the Government?  I am not suggesting there should not be public disclosure&mdash;I am speaking generally&mdash;in so far as it is in the public interest, but there are occasions when it is not in the public interest for reasons of security or for confidentiality of another nature that such disclosures be made.  I have been asked questions in this House, as have other Ministers, regarding the subject matter of discussions we have had with our counterparts in other Governments and it has been necessary not to disclose these in the interests of confidentiality and of ensuring that the results of our consultations and any talks we may have with other people will have fruitation for the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say any more about that.  I wish now to refer to a remark made by Deputy Corish which he attributed to me when I said in the debate here on 8th-9th May, 1970, that no trace of suspicion should attach to any Minister.  He implied that because there is Opposition suspicion of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries he should not remain in the Government. A similar type of implication was made by Deputy O'Higgins and, again, I must remark that this displays the Opposition's lack of political understanding.</P>
    <P>Appointing or retaining Ministers, under our Constitution is the Taoiseach's responsibility.  He must be satisfied as to the suitability of any member of the Government.  It would clearly be unreasonable&mdash;indeed, I might say monstrous&mdash;to suggest that every time anybody outside or any group has suspicion of a Minister either he should be removed from office or he should resign office.  It would be a simple matter for any Opposition to continually disrupt a Government by voicing doubt in that fashion of the various members of the Cabinet.  No Government party could allow their powers of control and decision to be undermined in that way.  It is for the <Col N="1750" /> Taoiseach of the day to select his Government in the manner he considers fit. It is for the Government party or, in the case of a coalition, Government parties, to support and regulate the manner in which this power is exercised.  The democratic control over the use of this power of Government is through the ballot box.  It is the electorate who decides which party shall govern and it is up to that party to use that mandate during their term of office and that is what we propose to do.  I come now to the position of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

In the circumstances it would be hard to blame him but I am glad that he was strong enough and man enough to stand up to that vilification.</P>

He has spent several hours before the Committee of Public Accounts.  He has come through all that not only unscathed as far as his reputation in our eyes is concerned, but he has proved to be an able and a worthwhile Minister for Agriculture. He has carried out his functions extremely efficiently and, as Taoiseach, I would pit his agricultural knowledge <Col N="1751" /> and his knowledge of the agricultural scene generally against any individual Deputy in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The words used yesterday by Deputy <Col N="1754" /> Gibbons about Deputy Cosgrave were that he was muling and puking.  I never heard these words or words like them in this House.  May I now quote something from Shakespeare, from Hamlet&mdash;&ldquo;Art thou there, truepenny? well said, old mole; can'st work i' the earth so fast?&rdquo; Of course, the difficulty about Deputy Gibbons was that he would not work at all.</P>
    <P>Let me quote from what the lawyer for the State said when completing the case in the courts against the unfortunate men who were being tried.  I will summarise it.  What he said was that if there was one thing could be said about Deputy Gibbons, it was that he did nothing, that he was a new Minister.  Deputy Gibbons pretended that he tried to find a post for Captain Kelly.  It took him a hell of a long time to find a post for him.  The Fianna Fáil Party could find a dozen posts inside a couple of months for any group of 12 people they liked, and he could not find a post for Captain Kelly over two or three months. Deputy Gibbons has said all kinds of things and yesterday he attacked a man who, as stated in this volume by Tom McIntyre, &ldquo;Through the Bridewell Gate&rdquo;, was the one man who came out of the Four Courts absolutely unscathed, and that was Colonel Hefferon.  The only case that Deputy Gibbons was able to make last night was fundamentally that Captain Kelly and Colonel Hefferon had joined the former Deputy Boland in the new Party, Aontacht Éireann.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Gibbons were attacked in the way they were attacked and vilified, whether he would not join a different party.  I noticed this evening and yesterday that the man concerned here was the Taoiseach.  Deputy Gibbons was as happy as Larry, for a change, considering what was said about him in the court, that he was the sepulchral witness, the witness who was not there at all, the chap who was really almost non-existent, and when he left the witness box, the State case was in tatters.  How did that happen? I have nothing against Deputy Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture, personally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave was accused of muling and puking yesterday because he behaved like a gentleman, behaved decently in this House.  This man got up, being safe of course&mdash;he would have talked in a completely different way if the Government were still in jeopardy.  He would not have talked the way he did yesterday, because I do not believe he has the guts to talk the way he talked yesterday, if the Government were still in jeopardy, but they were no longer in jeopardy, and so he could insult the main Opposition party any way he liked, insult men who were not here to answer him and could insult his subordinates in the Army, Colonel Hefferon and Captain Kelly.  He wiped out Captain Kelly as if he was nothing. We all know that intelligence officers are expendable.  This is a fact of life &mdash;intelligence officers are expendable, but they are not that expendable, and, mind you, the Minister for Agriculture might be surprised by what will happen.</P>
      <P>I believe that this surfaced again in the Public Accounts Committee yesterday&mdash;the piece of stuff that was produced to the Taoiseach.  What he said was this&mdash;and Deputy Gibbons's name was on the list&mdash;that, in fact, there were a number of people who were engaged in a conspiracy to import arms.  The name of Deputy Gibbons was on the list and Deputy Boland's name was not.  I wonder if Deputy Gibbons had been charged, whether he would have got out as well as Deputy Blaney did, if informations would have been refused against him. I do not believe they would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that any Justice in the court would refuse informations on the basis that he was Minister for Defence at the time.  I do not believe it for one minute, but the fact is that the man who is concerned about all this is the Taoiseach and for a serious reason, that the Taoiseach was the man who had to exist.  If, in fact, he had sacked Deputy Gibbons with the other Ministers, his credibility as <Col N="1756" /> Taoiseach was gone completely.  Let us have no doubt about that.  That is the truth and both the Taoiseach and Deputy Gibbons knew it.  Of course he is on Easy Street, because it is over for 18 months now, as we all know. There are many other things I could say but I said I was going to give Deputy Blaney time, and so I give way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but you will be quite a while before you have one of me in place of any of those. I can assure you of that.  The Taoiseach has now volunteered, without any pressure whatever, and despite what he said here, while I can accept it in part, I do not agree that it is a full reason or a complete reason why this motion should now be proffered and volunteered without any pressure from the Opposition, and indeed from an Opposition who have already accepted they were not, because of the procedure in the House, going to get time before next February or March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no quarrel with that, nor am I taking sides in relation to whether they did or did not get their motion.  What I want to put on record is, that time having been given to the House voluntarily, by the Taoiseach, his dire warnings <Col N="1757" /> of the consequences of what the vote that takes place on this motion tonight may entail come ill from him, since the consequences cannot and must not be blamed on any Members of the House other than himself.  I want also to say quickly that neither threats nor promises, neither the jeers nor taunts which I have been getting from various parts of the House, both inside and outside it, will, I hope, in any way, in the slightest degree, determine what I do here tonight in regard to this motion.  Neither one nor the other&mdash; none of these things, I hope&mdash;will be any final consideration in what I determine to do when this vote is taken.</P>
    <P>I want to say that, when listening to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, last night, I was taken for the first ten minutes with the excellent job he made of presenting the case of a man who required sympathy and whose family and those connected with him demanded sympathy because of what he has been through in these last 18 months, and, indeed, despite what I and others have been put through as a result of his activities during the earlier period before that began&mdash;despite that, and without his plea for sympathy last night my growing feeling over these months past was one of sympathy for him without any request for it, such as the one he made very eloquently here last night.</P>
    <P>When he turned from that and turned himself around and slammed into an ex-Member of this House, an ex-colleague, and slammed into his own subordinates who served him faithfully and well, Captain Jim Kelly and Colonel Hefferon, none of whom have any opportunity of defending themselves here, I felt a complete revulsion, a complete turn around, and I wiped away the idea that sympathy was appropriate in this case.  I felt that in regard to Colonel Hefferon in particular, here was a man who only 12 months ago, to say the most of it, was regarded by the powers-that-be in this State as a prime witness in order to prosecute my colleague, Deputy Haughey, Captain Kelly, John Kelly and Albert Luykx.  He was regarded as a prime witness and so he was put into <Col N="1758" /> the box in the trial that became a mistrial.</P>
    <P>Such was his evidence when he came under oath to tell the truth&mdash;and I listened to him tell it&mdash;that, when the mistrial was declared and the new trial called, Colonel Hefferon was dropped by the prosecution.  Why? Because he wrecked the prosecution case in the first trial.  Are we now to believe that he was telling lies?  Are we now to believe that the fact that he is in Aontach Éireann&mdash;which was the reason given, as I understood it last night&mdash;explains his ulterior motives of a year ago?  This man of honour, this man of long service to our Army, this man of high position, a man I scarcely knew at all, this man whom I have merely observed and listened to and seen in action, this man whom I have viewed and tried to assess, this man whom I believe was telling the truth, and who could not but tell all of the truth, is now being vilified by Deputy Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in extenuating circumstances to try to protect himself.</P>
    <P>I do not go with this idea, nor do I go with the idea that Jim Kelly who has suffered more than Deputy Gibbons should be vilified in this House.  Nor do I agree that my ex-colleague, ex-Deputy Boland, should be vilified.  Has he not suffered for his beliefs?  Has he not done what he has been praised for doing even though people may disagree with him?  Is he to be vilified in this House without any opportunity of answering, and vilified by a man on whom a censure motion is being discussed at the moment, a censure motion which I believe is justified.  I know that from my own personal knowledge, and not from any deductions made from evidence given or cross-examination either in the first trial, or the second trial, or before the Committee of Public Accounts recently.</P>
    <P>I recommend to all members of this House and to all members of the public outside it, that they should examine the book of evidence.  Get Deputy Gibbons's book of evidence, get his statement; get his evidence under oath in the mistrial; get his <Col N="1759" /> evidence under oath in the trial; get his evidence subsequently here in this House in front of the Committee of Public Accounts; and, if you are not satisfied with that plus the jury's decision, all I can say is: &ldquo;OK.  You disbelieve me.  You disbelieve Colonel Hefferon.  You disbelieve Kelly and you believe Gibbons.&rdquo;  That is all I can say about it.  I cannot elaborate to the degree I had intended but I say to the House that, in this regard, I have been brought along here month after month for 18 months and I have suffered, but nothing to the suffering that has been inflicted upon my family and my friends.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has been made to suffer.  He has been humiliated.  So has his family and so have his friends. So have others of my colleagues who are here with me tonight.  They also have been abused over these months. What are we being asked to do tonight? To come along in the interests of preventing an election or because of the threat of non-ratification and expulsion from the party, and vote against what we know; that I must vote against what I know, that I must go into the lobby and say publicly by that vote that I agree with what Jim Gibbons has done, that I do not believe that Jim Gibbons in any way misled the House, or the court, or that I agree that Jim Gibbons was right and that we who were prosecuted by the State were wrong.  That is what I am being asked to do and that I am not prepared to do for any party.</P>

      <P>You have listened to the speech of a Deputy, not an opponent, not a member of the Opposition, not a person who is dedicated to bringing down this Government, but a man who has spent his life building up Fianna Fáil.  Now he has expressed publicly his absolute detestation of everything that characterised Fianna Fáil over the past 18 months.  Is it <Col N="1760" /> necessary or does anyone expect anyone on this side of the House to say anything or to do anything other than to say: &ldquo;You are condemned from your own mouths, from your own members and from your own acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Last night the Tánaiste, the poor little man, was asked to intervene in this debate.  What did he say?  He said amongst other things that while he was a Minister&mdash;and he quoted lengthy years&mdash;he knew of no political party in the 20 civilised countries in which there had been such remarkable unity.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I need not quote any speech from this side of the House.  I only want to quote Deputy Blaney, ex-Deputy Kevin Boland and Deputy Paudge Brennan who is still in this House and who said:</P>
      <P>Every day I get up I thank my lucky stars that I took the decision, because I wouldn't want to be part of the set-up as I see it today.  It is not in the traditions of the Fianna Fáil Party I joined.  The cream of Fianna Fáil was either disposed of or left in the short space of 48 hours. We would give our right hands to have them back today in view of the things that are happening in recent times, the indecision there seems to be at the top of the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers went on to say that there was absolute unity on Fianna Fáil policy on the North.  He covered not merely the Ministers who were still in Government but also the Ministers who had been sacked or resigned. I want to put this statement to him and I quote from <i>Evening Herald</i> of 17th April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking at Arklow Deputy Blaney said that on the Government's decision an order was issued to the gardaí along the border and elsewhere that no man going to and fro with guns was to be molested and they were told to turn a blind eye.  He said that order had not been rescinded when Mr. Ó Morain, former Minister for Justice, was sacked. Deputy Blaney was a member of the Government during that time.  Whose word are we to believe?  Whose word <Col N="1761" /> is the country to believe?  Are we to believe the Taoiseach?  Are we to believe the Tánaiste?  Are we to believe the members of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party who want to remain in power and who are afraid to face the electorate?  Are we to believe a man who has risked everything?  Are we to believe Mr. Kevin Boland who resigned from this House and resigned from the Fianna Fáil Party in disgust at what happened?  Are we to believe Deputy Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries?</P>
    <P>I made it clear last night that I was not making any personal aspersion against him but I was quoting and quoting only and it is the only quotation I will give in respect of Deputy Gibbons tonight.  He said&mdash;Official Report, 8th May, column 839:</P>
    <P>I wish emphatically to deny any such knowledge or consent.</P>
    <P>This was in reference to the effort to smuggle arms and he writes, not in cross-examination, not in answer to the Counsel, the able Counsel, as the Taoiseach referred, who acted for either Mr. Haughey or anybody else in the arms trial&mdash;but he wrote this letter himself and he said:</P>
    <P>On April 30th I sent for Captain Kelly who had submitted his resignation. I met him in my office in Leinster House.  It then seemed to me that he had been an active agent in an attempt to import arms into this country.  Among other questions I asked him from what source the money for this operation came.  He replied that it came from the fund for the relief of distress in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Gibbons himself.  That is no cross-examination.  That is no words put into his mouth.  That is his statement in April this year and it conflicts directly, clearly and distinctly, in either modern or old English, with what he said in the Dáil on the 8th May.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in this House that this is not the time for an election, that there is a risk of public disorder.  I want to guarantee on behalf of this party that we stand for one Parliament, one Government responsible and elected by that Parliament, one Army and one Garda force, and that we have never been on the fringe of the law, like Fianna Fáil Deputies, when they said, as one of their leaders said, that we at least must have respect for the brave, for men who shot down gardaí and shot down police superintendents. Never did we do that, or attend funerals giving sympathy on the one hand and professing peace on the other.</P>
      <P>But further than that, I want to assure newspaper commentators, leader writers, including the leader writer of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of last Sunday, that we will, with public support, form a government that will give firm and effective and purposeful leadership. Not merely is that so, but that elections can be held and will be held again in this country, held in circumstances in which, above all else, we will ensure with the support of the Army and the support of the Garda and the support and backing of the people, that the will of the people will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have to worry because the Army that this party founded and the Garda force that it founded and the judges that we appointed, civilian or military, were never reluctant to try cases and they will try them again.  I want to give that assurance and I want to give confidence either to the public or to the political commentators or to an odd professor who may be worried that they need not worry.  We will make sure that an election is conducted and that everyone will be allowed to speak and to be heard and that ultimately a Government will be elected in which you will not have this situation that we have had over the last 18 months, month after month and week after <Col N="1764" /> week, in which Ministers or Deputies resign or leave the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

Deputy Des Foley resigned.  I nearly forgot the man from Mayo. An Teachta Micheál Ó Móráin resigned as well, according to the Taoiseach due to ill-health.  Ill-health?  No heart transplant that Christian Barnard ever performed restored a man so quickly to health.  Deputy Blaney's comment on that was that he wants the full story to be told of how Mick Moran was pushed.  He has relapsed into the Anglicised version which most of us used to know and he said he was pushed and a catspaw put in his place. That is Deputy Blaney.  That is Fianna Fáil on Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am waiting for a calming down as the Deputy may understand.  If I may proceed, I was saying that Deputy O'Higgins had spoken about the timing of the introduction of the value-added tax and I spoke about the difference in circumstances between here and other countries and I particularly instanced the situation in Britain which is quite different from ours.  Deputy O'Higgins made the point that, where highly inflationary conditions exist, the timing of tax changes is an important matter. I would agree with him on that.  I would however, disagree with him when he states that 1st March next is unlikely to be a propitious time.  Although it is true that prices have continued to rise this year, inflationary pressures are now less serious than they were last year and indeed it was this circumstance that chiefly contributed to enabling us to announce the reflationary measures which I announced on 27th October last. <Col N="1768" /> It has been the experience of other countries, particularly Sweden and Germany that the changeover to value-added tax holds little risk to price stability when it is made at a time in which the economy is not overheated and particularly in view of the fact that, in our case, the actual rates of tax are not being increased.  The same rates of tax are being applied as at present.  I dealt earlier with the question of price increases which some Deputies seem to think are likely to be enormous as a result of this.  The only thing I want to add to what I said on that is that some Deputies appear to be under the impression that VAT must be added item by item to each article in a shop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but, as I explained before the interruption, the Revenue Commissioners gave that advice to representatives of RGDATA who visited them seeking advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be.  It relates to the kind of business a person is conducting but, as I said, the value-added tax at retail level is on a tax on turnover.  Therefore, the shopkeeper can handle it as he handles turnover tax and the amount of tax will be precisely the same.  As at present it is open to a shopkeeper to do either. There is certainly nothing in this Bill to compel a retailer to charge VAT item by item.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.  It was to RGDATA who deal in selling all items over the counter.  They said it was at shelf level it should be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that there is nothing in this Bill to compel any retailer to do that. <Col N="1769" /> A number of Deputies queried the position in regard to agriculture and the flat rate credit which is being provided for.  I should like to explain that farmers and fishermen, other than farmers and fishermen who are engaged in certain specialised activities which amount to industrial activity&mdash;the general run of farmers and fishermen &mdash;need not register for VAT unless they elect to be fully accountable. They have a choice.  But those who do not elect to be fully accountable will not have to pay tax on their sales or to make returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  They will, of course, suffer tax on their purchases of inputs such as seeds and fertilisers which at present are not taxable but which, under the value-added system, will come within the tax net.  The tax on such inputs has been estimated and expressed as a fraction of a farmer's sale.  The farmer can add this fraction to the price of his own produce and in so doing the average farmer will be fully compensated for the tax which he has borne on his inputs.  This addition will be facilitated by allowing to registered purchasers of farm produce a credit or refund based on these fractions.  The addition to farm gate prices&mdash;3.85 per cent in the case of pigs and 2.68 per cent in the case of other farm produce&mdash;will thus not increase costs in the food industry because the price addition which the farmer makes will be deductible from the tax liability of the butcher or meat factory, as the case may be.  The rate of tax on food sold in the shops will remain exactly the same as it is at present, that is 5.26 per cent, and the same amount of tax as is at present collected from the butcher or greengrocer will continue to be collected but from a somewhat different source.  That is the real difference in this system. The amount of tax will be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale of livestock by a mart will not involve the mart in any liability to tax and after the introduction of value-added tax trading can take place in precisely the same way as it does at present.  Farmers and marts will sell as before but the price of livestock will be higher by the amount of the flat rate credit which registered purchasers&mdash;butchers, meat factories and <Col N="1770" /> exporters&mdash;can claim from the Revenue Commissioners.  The farmer or the mart need not inquire if the purchaser is registered.  It is up to the purchaser, if he wishes to claim a credit, to ensure that the buyer's sheet or invoice, which is in use at present in marts, is signed by the mart and is retained as evidence for entitlement to credit.</P>
    <P>The special simplified arrangements &mdash;simplified in practice though I agree that when one reads about them and does not understand them the arrangements for agriculture may not appear to be simplified, but they are in fact simplified as compared with the operation of the tax otherwise&mdash;were designed to ensure that farmers would be affected as little as possible by the tax.  I considered various ways of dealing with this problem and I am convinced that the flat rate credit is the best and the simplest.  I have carefully considered the NFA and the IAOS proposals for zero rating of agricultural inputs but I am afraid that these proposals would be impracticable: they would be complex and they would also be costly.  Flat rate credit is the method which is most commonly adopted on the Continent and it seems to be working out quite well.  The special flat rate credit for pig sales should be adequate, I think, and meets the point made by the NFA that inputs vary from one enterprise to another.  The credit allowed in the case of pigs recognises the exceptionally high input rates which are common in pig production.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by some Deputies in regard to the effect of the tax on buildings.  Deputy Donegan alleged that the tax which is at present paid on buildings is going to be increased. Some other Deputy made the same claim.  The present sales tax on certain materials amounts to about 3 per cent on average of the cost of a building.  I think that figure was disputed so I should like to place on record the manner in which it is arrived at.</P>
    <P>Under the present system certain building materials such as timber, glass, paint, sanitary fittings, heating materials and all decorating materials are liable to turnover and wholesale taxes.  On the basis of a breakdown of <Col N="1771" /> the prices of sample housing units as shown in figures supplied by the Department of Local Government it was calculated that these materials represented 20 per cent of the selling price of a house including the site.  The incidence of the sales taxes combined on these items works out at about 15 per cent on tax exclusive of prices.  Tax at the rate of 15 per cent on these materials is equivalent to 3 per cent of the full selling price.  Working on the basis of 3 per cent of the average cost of a building, value-added tax will effectively be at the same rate as at present because 5.26 per cent&mdash;to be charged on only 60 per cent of the price of the building&mdash;works out at approximately 3 per cent, so it is designed to produce the same result as we have at present.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, when introducing this Stage, and I want to mention again, that value-added tax will mean less tax on industrial and commercial buildings because registered firms will be able to claim credit for the prior stage tax which they have paid out.  They are not able to do this under the present system.  Secondhand buildings are not liable to value-added tax, unless the seller was entitled to a credit when he purchased the building.  Rent will also be exempt but landlords may opt to register if they wish, which they might consider doing where the bulk of their tenants were themselves traders. Deputy Tully made a case about the complexity of the forms&mdash;quite an effective case if one did not know all the facts.</P>

      <P>True, but they will learn very quickly what is involved. I admit the forms to be filled up for value-added tax are more complex than those at present in use for turnover and wholesale tax but I do not think they will be nearly as difficult for the ordinary trader as Deputy Tully seemed to suggest.  The draft forms, which he was quoting from, <Col N="1772" /> are attached to the explanatory memorandum and they are for the information of traders.  They are designed to cover various combinations of circumstances, but the traders will not be using all portions of the form.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that the ordinary trader will only have to use a few of these and he will learn very quickly which part of the forms concerns him and which he can ignore.  When Deputy Tully was making his case I was thinking about something which most traders do fairly frequently and that is make a lodgment in the bank.  In order to do that they have to fill in a lodgment docket.  I do not know whether most lodgment dockets are of the same kind as the ones with which I am familiar, but I know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But the fact that that heading is on it does not create any difficulty for people who do not have to lodge London cheques marked T. I would suggest the same thing arises in the case of these forms.  I do not think the traders concerned are going to be in any difficulty when they are dealing only with the things that concern them which will not of course be all of the headings involved.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will issue a guide which will explain, as simply as possible, the requirements for the traders, and as I mentioned earlier ready reckoners will also be issued to assist in the calculation of the tax.  Small traders will not be required to register or to account for the tax and the limits for registration will generally be the same as those which apply to the turnover tax at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell made a point, and I think somebody else made the same point, which is based on a misreading either of the Bill or the White Paper.  He seemed to be under the impression that we were treating pet foods and pet medicines favourably as against human foods and medicines. The fact is that pet foods and medicines are to be taxed at the rate of 16.37 per cent whereas, at present, they qualify for exemption for wholesale tax, and human foods and medicines, as well as feed and medicines required for agriculture, will qualify for the lower rate of 5.26 per cent.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the tax on newspapers and advertising.  The concession in this regard, which I announced recently, reducing the rate of value-added tax to the 5.26 per cent rate will in effect remove the wholesale tax from newspaper sales.  This will constitute a significant relief for both national and provincial papers.  The cost to the Exchequer of this reduction in rate on newspapers and periodicals is well over £1 million.  As an example of applying it in an individual case on newspaper sales of 1,000 copies per week retailing at 5p each the saving in tax will be about £200 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> Although it is true that the value-added tax must, of its nature, apply to advertising, newspapers will be able to pass on the tax on advertising to registered advertisers, for example, manufacturers and most shopkeepers. These advertisers will be able to deduct, against their own tax liability, the amount so passed on.  In these cases the tax on advertising will only be a transitory item; it will not be a charge on the profits of newspapers.  It is only where the advertiser is not registered for the tax, and this would include a Government Department, a local authority, an auctioneer and of course a private individual, that we would have a departure from the present incidence of tax.  It is very difficult to visualise that the volume of advertising by such unregistered persons would be of such an order that the tax on it would result in negativing the substantial saving resulting from the concession I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should also point out that the effect of an exemption for advertising would be that the tax on materials and equipment used by the newspapers for advertising could not be invoiced forward to a registered person and as it would not, therefore, rank for deduction against tax payable by such persons it would create a degree of double taxation on the products being advertised.  If there were no value-added tax on newspapers there would be a practical difficulty in regard to the accounting by shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the importance of newspapers, particularly provincial newspapers, from both a social and an economic point of view is well recognised by me.  Indeed, the employment involved in newspapers is a very important matter.  The recognition by me of this importance is not anything new.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce I removed price control from newspaper sales and subsequently removed price control from advertising in newspapers.  The reasons I have outlined, of which I am very conscious, were the reasons which prompted me to recommend to the Government that the incidence of the tax on newspapers under the existing turnover and wholesale taxes should be substantially reduced <Col N="1775" /> on this changeover to value-added tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton spoke about the number of rates of tax.  If we leave aside the special rate for dances, which reflects the existing position where there is a special turnover tax rate of 10 per cent, there are three rates of VAT proposed. It is expected that in practice most traders will not have to deal with more than two rates&mdash;the 5.26 per cent rate and the 16.37 per cent rate.  The third and highest rate of 30.26 per cent, which is applicable to such items as motorcars, radios, television sets and yachts will not apply as such at the retail level.  The only people concerned in this third rate will be the manufacturers and importers of these items, and at these stages, 25 per cent will be built into the price. At all stages other than the manufacturing or importing stage only the rate of 5.26 per cent will apply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton also asked a question about trade-in arrangements.  I want to make it clear that the Bill provides for the continuation generally of the present practice in relation to trade-in sales.  Briefly, it is proposed that tax will be payable only on the actual money consideration and not on the value of the article being traded in.  The full price of the new article will not be chargeable.  When the traded-in item is re-sold by the trader it will be taxable at 5.26 per cent, which is the rate appropriate to second-hand goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton had a query regarding tax on purchases by traders.  He seemed to be under the impression that it would mean that tax would have to be paid in advance.  All tax borne on a trader's purchases of stock will qualify for deduction under the credit system and, therefore, the new system does not mean that the tax will be paid in advance.  If an article is broken or becomes obsolete, the trader will pay tax only on the amount, if any, which it realises when sold.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the level of tax on essential goods and one Deputy said our rate of tax is the highest in Europe.  I want to put it on record that there is no foundation <Col N="1776" /> for that statement.  Regarding the rate of tax on food, we are lower than Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark and Norway.  With regard to clothing, we have the lowest rate of tax in Europe, including the British purchase tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher and at least one other Deputy&mdash;perhaps it was Deputy Collins&mdash;raised the question of the intervals between payments of VAT due to the Revenue Commissioners. Deputy Gallagher made the point that builders' providers generally give four and a half to five months credit.  I think the question arising here of the frequency at which payments should be made to the Revenue Commissioners is one that could be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage but, in the meantime, I should like to leave this thought with the House.  A point of view has been expressed that if the effect of the proposals in this Bill were to be that the giving of credit in business generally were to be regulated and shortened, it could be very much to the benefit of business generally, provided that the effect operated all round.  I am not putting that forward as an argument in favour of the Bill but I am suggesting Deputies might like to think about it before we go into the matter in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>

Various trade associations have strongly represented to us that there must be an interval of at least three months between the date of enactment and the commencement of the tax.  This period is required to carry out such preparatory work as setting up and testing computer programmes, arranging for the printing of special documents such as account books, invoices, price tags and so on, and for training staff and working out new pricing arrangements.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Deputy.  It is true that some of this work may be, and can be, carried out in advance of the enactment of the legislation, but since neither the statutory regulations which will contain the detailed working provisions, nor the official guide to the tax which I mentioned in the course of the debate, can be published until the law is enacted, the bulk of the preparatory work must be fitted in the period between the date on which those documents become available and the commencement date of the tax. The regulations and official guides will be published and made available to traders within a matter of days of the legislation being enacted.</P>

      <P>In a jocose manner earlier, I mentioned to the Minister that he would not get it in for next year.  Quite honestly, I think the Minister must appreciate the fact that if he is talking about introducing it on 1st March next, he surely is living in what a member of his party in this House used to say was cloud-cuckoo land. There is no hope in the world of getting <Col N="1782" /> it through this House, as it is anyway, before the end of this session, nor is there any hope of trying to persuade unfortunate people, who at present have not got a clue as to what it is all about, how to work it and to set up their accounting system in such a way that they can work it with effect from 1st March next, and the Minister might as well face up to that.  It would be more reasonable if he did leave quite a good time before amendments come in, and let us take it as it should be, because apparently this was done before with the turnover tax.  It was rushed in and apparently it has now been discovered that it is not working so well, because the Minister was moaning about the number of people who were able to avoid it.  This is more complicated and the Minister must face up to the fact that it is just not possible.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners may think they are God Almighty in this country, and they do, but there is no reason why this House should underwrite their &ldquo;god almightiness&rdquo;. This is the kind of behaviour that goes on.  If the Government want to turn this country over to the civil servants they can do it but they will not do it without protest.  The Minister pretends to be a reasonable man and, on occasion, talks like a reasonable man.  This is not an ordinary Bill.  This is a disgusting piece of legislation.  We have a turnover tax and a wholesale tax and now, within a few years, in the interests of the Revenue Commissioners the Minister is going to turn turtle and make the people who operate it&mdash;and I take it that most of them operate it honestly&mdash;do extra work for which they will get no remuneration.  They will have to collect additional tax.</P>

The Revenue Commissioners may have plenty to time because they do not have to earn their living otherwise. Deputies in this House who represent the people have to earn their living otherwise.  It is disgusting that this type of thing should be done.  There is no real reason for it.  No one would be believed for one bloody minute that the pretence that we are going into the Common Market is the real reason. The whole thing is offensive to ordinary human decency.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for increases in the civil jurisdictions of the Circuit Court and the District Court.  It also provides for a number of other important matters relating to the courts such as giving the courts power to award deserted wives and the mothers of <Col N="1788" /> illegitimate children substantially greater allowances than at present, extending the right of audience of solicitors to all courts, giving district justices power to arrange for the speedy disposal of certain urgent cases of summary jurisdiction and improved arrangements for the service of court documents.</P>
    <P>The present monetary limits on the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts have with minor exceptions been in operation since 1953 when the original limits as fixed by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, were increased under the Courts of Justice Act, 1953; the increases were made mainly to compensate for the decline in the value of money.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure reported on the question of increasing the jurisdiction of both courts in their Fifth Interim Report submitted in 1966.  The committee unanimously recommended that the civil jurisdiction limits be increased not alone to allow for the fall in the value of money since 1953 but, in view of the desirability of leaving the monetary levels of jurisdiction undisturbed for a reasonable period, to provide for the contingency of continuing inflationary trends over the next 20 years.  The committee recommended, unanimously in regard to the Circuit Court and by a majority in regard to the District Court, that there be, in addition, real or basic increases in jurisdiction.  The various levels of jurisdiction recommended by the committee and the present levels are set out in paragraph 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill as introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Government accepted the view that new levels of civil jurisdiction should be conferred on the Circuit and District Courts which would represent a real addition to the monetary limits as well as compensating for past and future inflationary trends.</P>
    <P>Taking all factors into consideration, the Government were satisfied that the most appropriate levels of jurisdiction would be, in the case of the Circuit Court, a jurisdiction of £2,000 in contract and tort and of £5,000 in equity and, in the case of the <Col N="1789" /> District Court, a jurisdiction of £250 in contract and tort.  Both courts are fully competent to undertake the proposed new civil jurisdictions; they already have large criminal jurisdictions and these are not, of course, affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of introducing the new jurisdictions will be that a wide range of actions which would otherwise be heard in a higher court will now be capable of being heard in a lower court.  This will be to the benefit of the public in a number of ways.  Litigation will be less expensive because costs in the lower court will be less and, in addition, because of the decentralisation of the administration of justice savings in travelling and other expenses of litigants and witnesses will be achieved.  Litigation will also be more convenient because of the greater number of actions which will be tried locally.  The Bill will help to bring the costs of proceedings more into line with the amount recovered in the courts having jurisdiction.  At present many actions where the amount involved is quite small have to be tried in the High Court, because of the very restrictive limit of jurisdiction on the Circuit Court and the costs in the High Court could be out of all proportion to the amount involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the new jurisdictions shall not come into operation until 1st March, 1972; this is to enable the various Rules Committees to introduce new rules of court on such matters as costs, <i>et cetera,</i> which will be necessary as a result of the increased jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I pass now to the provisions in the Bill in regard to maintenance and affiliation allowances.  The Bill provides in sections 18 and 19 for the introduction of new arrangements for the determination of these allowances in the fairest possible manner, that is, by direct reference to financial means of the parties concerned.  At present the maximum amount which the District Court may order a husband who has deserted his wife to pay is £4 a week and there is no provision for additional payments for the maintenance of any children of the marriage. The maximum allowance which <Col N="1790" /> the court may order the putative father of an illegitimate child to pay is £1 a week.  These amounts were fixed by Acts of 1940 and 1930 respectively and they have now become quite unrealistic.  The Bill proposes to empower the District Court to order a husband who has deserted his wife to pay up to £15 a week for her maintenance depending on his means and on any means the wife may have.  In addition it is proposed to empower the District Court to order the husband to pay up to £5 a week for the maintenance of each child of the marriage under 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>With regard to the maintenance of an illegitimate child, the Bill proposes to empower the District Court to order the putative father to pay a weekly sum of up to £5 again depending on the means of the father.  Provision is also made in the Bill for the conferring of concurring jurisdiction on the High Court but without financial limits both in maintenance and affiliation cases.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill makes provision for the extension of the right of audience of solicitors to all courts in the land.  At present solicitors have a right of audience in the District Court and the Circuit Court but, with minor exceptions such as the Bankruptcy Court, they have no right of audience in the superior courts.  The provision if enacted will put solicitors on an equal footing with members of the Bar as regards right of audience and will go some way towards removal of the rigid division which exists in the legal profession.  I might add that the principle of a right of audience for solicitors in all courts has been supported by a recent recommendation of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.</P>
    <P>The next section in the Bill to which I should like to refer is section 15. This section provides special procedures enabling a justice to deal promptly with urgent cases of summary jurisdiction such as prosecutions in connection with foot and mouth disease where speed is of the essence. As sittings of the District Court are held in many rural areas only once per month and as justices do not, at <Col N="1791" /> present, have power to hold special sittings to deal with such urgent summary cases there may be a delay of several weeks before these cases are brought to trial.  This difficulty will be eliminated by the enactment of the proposed provision.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill in relation to the service of court documents by registered post are contained in sections 22 and 23.  Under section 22 a wider range of District Court documents will be capable of being served by post. Under the existing law only documents initiating proceedings and witness summonses can be served by post.  It is desirable that documents such as instalment orders, maintenance orders, affiliation orders and summonses under the School Attendance Acts shall also be capable of being served by registered post and provision is made accordingly.  The section also provides for the assignment by the county registrar of summons servers to specific areas in a county and in respect of specified documents.  This provision will resolve doubts as to the interpretation of section 7 of the Courts Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 23 which relates to the service of superior court documents have two main aims, first, a far greater use of the postal service for effecting service and, secondly, the removal of the requirement for a solicitor conducting litigation in the superior courts to have a place of business within a radial distance of two miles from the Four Courts and for a personal litigant to have an address for service within the same radial distance.  The provisions follow recommendations made by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in the Eighth Interim Report with the exception that the committee recommended service by ordinary post. However, the Government considered that the more formal procedure of service by registered post would be preferable for a start at any rate.</P>
    <P>Some of the remaining provisions in the Bill call for brief comment.  Section 6 provides for the abolition of the right to jury in civil actions in the Circuit Court.  This right is very rarely <Col N="1792" /> exercised as all appeals from the Circuit Court in civil actions, whether tried by jury or not, are by way of complete rehearing before a judge of the High Court without a jury.  The proposal is supported by a recommendation of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their Third Interim Report.</P>
    <P>Section 13 declares the District Court to be a court of record.  This is merely stating in statutory form what is, in fact, the present position.  Section 21 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, makes a similar declaration in regard to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It is provided in section 14 that the only evidence of a decision of the District Court shall be an order of the justice.  This will put the District Court on the same footing as the Circuit Court.  At present full particulars of the decision in every case in the District Court are entered in a minute book at the time of hearing.  Apart from this procedure being time-consuming, it often results in perfectly good decisions of the court being upset because of minor textual errors which inevitably arise because of the need to enter the particulars hurriedly.  The proposal has been strongly recommended to me by the District Court Rules Committee.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that either the District Court or the Circuit Court may transfer any civil proceedings to the appropriate higher tribunal.  At present this power is available only to the Circuit Court.  The need for extending the power to the District Court arises from the fact that in proceedings involving a number of wrongdoers the plaintiff may be suing for damages within the jurisdiction of the District Court whereas there may be a counterclaim for an amount which would be outside the jurisdiction of the District Court.  The object of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, is that the liability of all parties to an action should be determined in the one action.</P>
    <P>The last section to which I should like to refer is section 20.  The section will enable a parent to apply to the court for a legitimacy declaration; <Col N="1793" /> under the law at present the application must be made by the child.  The section also provides that all such applications shall be heard in chambers. This will avoid embarrassment to the parties concerned and unnecessary publicity.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, to thank the members of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure for the exceedingly valuable work which they have done and continue to do.  Many of the provisions of this Bill were framed in the light of reports submitted by the committee. I hope to introduce further legislation over the next couple of years which will be concerned with other matters on which the committee have advised.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Bill will meet with the approval of the House.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this Bill, as the Minister said, is to increase substantially in civil matters the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and of the District Court; to abolish the right of trial by jury in actions in tort up to £2,000; to increase the maintenance which may be awarded to a married woman who has been deserted by her husband or whose husband has failed to support her; and to grant to solicitors a right of audience in all the courts in the land.  Broadly speaking, these are the major provisions of this Bill.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad and it is, I think, an example of the kind of Bill that can usefully be introduced in the Seanad.  Without trying to be in any way patronising, I would say that the Bill got a very useful debate in the Seanad.</P>

        <Col N="1794" /> The general tone and trend of the debate in the Seanad was what one would expect from a deliberative assembly.  I hope we will have the same sort of debate here and that the Minister will continue to be in the same receptive frame of mind in which he was in the Seanad.  The last measure here in which the Minister and I took part resulted in a rather protracted debate.  The Minister was not receptive.  However, we will leave that alone.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill to increase the jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court in tort, in the Circuit Court from £600 to £2,000, in equity from £2,000 to £5,000 and, where the Poor Law Valuation is relevant, from £60 to £100.  I believe that these increases are considerably overdue.  Indeed, the only question is whether the Minister has gone far enough in increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  It is based on a report made to the Minister in 1966 and it demonstrates to me, at any rate, how slowly great bodies move.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It took from 1966 to 1971 to get these proposals transferred into legislation. When I see that the unfortunate Opposition are expected to draft in ten days very involved amendments to a completely new system of taxation I begin to wonder.  This is hardly relevant, but it certainly occurred to me when listening to the discussion that just took place here.  The increases in the Circuit Court jurisdiction are acceptable to me.  My only reservation is whether they have gone far enough. It is desirable and right&mdash;I say this, subject to what I shall have to say on the trial by jury system later on&mdash;that people should have justice brought to their own locality and should not have to travel long distances in pursuit of justice.</P>
      <P>The jurisdiction of the District Court will be increased from £50 to £250 in the commoner type of actions &mdash;that is, actions in contract and tort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> It has been increased in various other actions too.  I accept these increases but, again, I wonder whether the Minister might not have gone somewhat further.  I know that certain branches of the profession might argue against that but any sort of running down action involving any sort of damage to a car, which is the type of litigation most common in the courts, will involve £250.</P>
    <P>Taking the Bill section by section, section 13 proposes to declare that the District Court shall be a court of record.  This is of considerable importance because it increases the importance of the District Court.  The section simply says that it shall be a court of record.  That will be a court whose records will be available and whose judgments can work an estoppel in later proceedings.  Section 14 is difficult to follow because I cannot see where we will get the records or what record of the District Court will be available.  The section provides:</P>
    <P>In any legal proceedings regard shall not be had to any record (other than an order which, when an order is required, shall be drawn up by the District Court clerk and signed by a justice or a copy thereof certified in accordance with rules of court) relating to a decision of a justice of the District Court in any case of summary jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not propose to go into any great detail.  I merely want to put the Minister on notice in the hope that he will introduce amendments on the Committee Stage.  References of this kind can sometimes be very helpful.  The order has only to be signed if required. The Minister said in the other House that in only about 1 per cent of cases will the order be required immediately. How is the record to be produced if it <Col N="1796" /> is not entered in some book?  I understand the intention is to do away with the justice's minute book.  If that is done there will be no record available. There should be some record which can be used ten, 15 or 20 years hence if a record of proceedings in the District Court are required.  I would like the Minister to look into this before the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Provision should also be made for the registration of judgments of the District Court now that it is to be a court of record similar to the provision in the Circuit Court (Registration of Judgments) Act of 1937.  Under that Act Circuit Court judgments can be registered.  Provision should be made also for converting judgments of the District Court into judgment mortgages because they can be very useful.  I do not think any of these matters have been dealt with in that section.</P>
      <P>Before coming to that perhaps I should have dealt with the section which proposes to abolish trial by jury, section 6.  This is of considerable importance.  There is a fundamental principle involved.  I believe we should hold on to trial by jury in actions where there is any serious matter at stake and an action involving £2,000 is, to my mind, a serious action.  I say that because judges like everybody are human and may have likes and dislikes. They can be honestly prejudiced in favour of plaintiffs or defendants. The trial by jury system has worked well and given reasonable satisfaction. Juries in their own way have always brought in verdicts based on common sense and rarely caused much dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>As I see it the case the Minister seeks to make in favour of the abolition of the jury system in the Circuit Court is that (1) it is rarely used at present; and (2) that appeals from the verdict of a jury in the Circuit Court would be by way of new trial to a judge without a jury.  I agree that the system is not used to any extent at present and that an appeal from the verdict of the jury in a Circuit Court as the law stands would be to a judge without a jury.  But I should like to bring the Minister back some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> In the 1930s trial by jury in the Circuit Court was availed of very considerably in actions for negligence and other actions where it applied but at that time the appeal was not to a single judge by way to retrial but to two judges on the notes taken in the Circuit Court.  You could only get a retrial, as you do now in the Supreme Court on appeal from the High Court, if the verdict was against the weight of the evidence or if the law had not been applied.</P>
    <P>In 1936 that was changed somewhat and the High Court on circuit was introduced.  Then the appeal from the verdict and jury was for the first time to a judge by way of a new trial instead of to two High Court judges on the notes.  I suggest to the Minister that it was not the public who killed trial by jury in the Circuit Court nor was it that the legal profession did not approve of it; it was the legislators who killed it by enacting that appeals would not be on matters of law only but would be by way of complete new trial.  In the position in which we find ourselves under this Bill when we will have substantial issues being tried in the Circuit Court and where we are increasing Circuit Court jurisdiction from £600 to £2,000 in the type of action I am talking about, I say the Minister should preserve trial by jury in the Circuit Court and that the appeal should be direct to the Supreme Court on a transcript of evidence only.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not agree with that he can have an appeal to the High Court but let it be on the transcript of evidence only and let there be a new trial only if the trial judge has not properly conducted the trial in the Circuit Court before himself and the jury, or if the verdict of the jury is obviously perverse or obviously against the weight of evidence or if there has been some other fault in the trial.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House unduly on this aspect of the Bill but there is a question of principle involved. Despite what the Minister said, I believe the abolition of the jury system in the Circuit Court is the thin end of the wedge.  I know the Minister <Col N="1798" /> will not agree with that but I believe it and I further believe that the argument that it will speed up trials is not valid.  Trials can be speeded up in other ways.  For example, you could have, as there is in England and elsewhere, an effort to agree medical evidence, an effort to agree professional evidence of one kind or another.  If that were done you would speed up the trial and reduce the costs and expenses involved.  We all know&mdash;I shall come to that later&mdash;that professional witnesses can add considerably to the cost of a trial both in the Circuit Court and in the High Court. That is my suggestion regarding trial by jury.</P>
    <P>The right of audience by solicitors in all courts is something which naturally, as a member of the solicitors profession, I welcome.  It is considerably overdue and I believe this section of the Bill should come into operation on the passing of the Bill although I shall urge the Minister that certain other sections should not come into operation even on 1st March but should go back a bit.  There is no reason why the section giving solicitors right of audience in all courts should not come into operation at once.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that solicitors have a right of audience in the Circuit Court at present and that they do not avail themselves of it very often.  That is true but I am glad to say that when I was younger and more ambitious and courageous than I am now, I conducted a number of defences in the Circuit Court before a judge and jury.  I think it is a pity that other solicitors do not practice more in the Circuit Court.  Might I suggest to the Minister, now that he has taken this step in the right direction, that he would encourage solicitors to appear in the superior courts if he were to declare that a solicitor is qualified to sit on the bench of a superior court. Once he has taken this step forward there is no reason why he should not follow it to its logical conclusion.  At present, solicitors are declared qualified by law to be justices of the District Courts, but they are not qualified to hold the position of Circuit <Col N="1799" /> Court judges or High Court judges.  I say that the Minister should immediately provide that solicitors would be qualified after a certain number of years practice&mdash;I think it is 12 years in the case of barristers&mdash;to sit on the Circuit Court bench.  The Minister should seriously consider that as a first step towards having both solicitors and barristers on the benches of the superior courts.</P>
    <P>It has been said and is said from time to time that there is one law for the rich and another law for the poor. It is not justified and the only reason why it is not justified is that any person with a reasonable case can, almost without exception, find solicitors and barristers to take his case up for him and fight it.  However, there are cases in which it might not be reasonable to expect members of the legal profession to take up a case because there might be no end product one way or the other.  It might be some right the plaintiff wanted to enforce against somebody who was not a mark.  I believe there is not much use in talking about having a fusion of the professions or providing that only one counsel can appear in a case in the High Court or Circuit Court until such time as we provide a proper free legal aid system here.  It is something that is overdue, something that will have to be tackled and it is something that in a few years time will be taken for granted.  In the field of medicine or in other professions people are not expected to work for nothing or work on &ldquo;spec&rdquo;.  Until such time as we have a proper system of free legal aid, as they have in Great Britain, we cannot tidy up the legal profession and the courts as perhaps they should be tidied up.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that provision has been made for a proper payment to married women who have been deserted by their husbands.  The maximum sum which a court could order up to the present time in the case of a deserted wife was £4 and that apparently had been on the Statute Book since 1940. It is high time that was changed.  I wish to congratulate Senator Kelly and others of the Fine Gael Party who introduced in the Seanad a Private Members Bill making better provision <Col N="1800" /> for deserted wives before the present Bill was introduced.  When the Minister's Bill first came into the Seanad it was not nearly so generous as it is now. It provided for an increase from £4 to £7.50.  Having congratulated Senator Kelly and Senator O'Higgins on introducing the Private Members Bill I want to now congratulate the Minister on dropping the rather meagre provisions in his Bill as introduced and accepting the provisions of the Fine Gael Private Members Bill or even going a little better.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the provision for payment by the father of an illegitimate child has been increased from £1 to £2.50.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> From £1 to £5 a week.  When we realise that the payment was fixed at £1 a week as far back as 1930 we can see how slowly our social conscience moves in this country.  It is a reflection on all of us that that figure of £1 a week, which was fixed in 1930, has stood there ever since.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this Bill to draw a few points to the Minister's attention.  There is a provision in this Bill&mdash;section 15 I think&mdash;which empowers a justice to deal as a matter of urgency with certain offences which the Minister may schedule or prescribe by order.  A district justice can hear these offences at a special court and they can be heard on two days notice. I would have enough faith and confidence in members of the District Court to accept that, if an accused person was at a disadvantage because he only got two days notice, a reasonable adjournment would be given; but again I was interested to read the Seanad debate and to see the argument that was put forward for this particular section.  It was to deal with a situation that arose out of the foot-and-mouth outbreak&mdash;another classical example of the speed with which our Civil Service moves.  Perhaps it is not fair to say our Civil Service but another classical example of the speed with which the Minister moves because the foot-and-mouth outbreak referred to must have occurred at least 20 years ago and it is only now that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> At any rate, there are places like Waterford and Wicklow and many other ones that could do with a facelift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was correctly raised in the Seanad that the finding in the Supreme Court in <i>Somebody v. the People and the Post Office</i> should be declared to be the law, in other words the doctrine of the King can do no wrong should be abolished.  I was speaking recently to a member of the senior bar who was a member of this House in 1955, although he is not now a member, and he told me that he put down an amendment in 1955 to have the law declared as the Supreme Court has now found it.  He was told: &ldquo;Oh yes, we are going to do that next year, but it would be out of order to do that in this Bill, it will have to be done in a Courts of Justice Bill.&rdquo;  He expected it to be done in 1956 but nothing was done about it until the Supreme Court declared the law this year.  I understand, although the Supreme Court declared that to be the law, it might <Col N="1802" /> not necessarily be followed by another Supreme Court.  The Minister should introduce a section in a bill to declare that particular law.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I mentioned to the Minister by way of a Parliamentary Question some time ago, which he would not agree with, is that the interest payable on judgments should be increased.  The interest at present payable on judgments is at the rate of 4 per cent and it must be many, many years since that rate was fixed.  Now that damages in the courts have gone up considerably plaintiffs can be at a considerable loss, if they are awarded £10,000 or £20,000 damages and there is an appeal to the Supreme Court, which may not come on for 12 months, or a new trial, because they will be paid interest at the rate of 4 per cent instead of 8 or 9 per cent.  I know from recent dealings with a case in England that interest seems to be paid there as a matter of course at a much higher rate than 4 per cent from the day of judgment.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the increases in the Circuit Court and District Court jurisdiction I omitted to urge the Minister to make sure that this increase, which we accept, will not lead to delays in the District Court and the Circuit Court.  There is no use spoiling the ship for a hap'orth of tar.  The Minister should look into it as a matter of urgency and, if necessary, appoint additional district justices and additional Circuit Court judges because if, by passing this Act, we are simply going to clutter up the lists of the District Courts and the Circuit Courts and cause frustration by delays we shall not be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that at the present time there is a very considerable delay in the Dublin Circuit Court.  He will also be aware that the Solicitors' Association in Waterford passed a resolution on the 28th October this year deploring the fact that their Circuit Court judge was being taken away from them on a temporary basis to relieve congestion in the Dublin Circuit Court.  The Minister should take a serious look at that and do something about it.</P>
    <P>In dealing with sections 13 and 14 <Col N="1803" /> of the Bill I omitted to say that, in my opinion, the order about which I was speaking should be signed by the District Court clerk or the District Court registrar, if it is thought fit to so call him, rather than the justice because, in some places, this will cause delay if the order has to wait until it is signed by the District Court justice.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the taxing of costs in the High Court at the present time.  It is nearly more difficult and there is nearly more work involved in taxing a bill of costs in the High Court nowadays than there is in fighting the action which gave rise to the bill of costs.  It is a most frustrating experience and much of the trouble is over witnesses' expenses.  Before the action comes on, the professional witnesses about whom I am speaking have to be assured that they will get certain expenses.  The taxing masters, in their wisdom, decide that these expenses are far too high and they proceed to allow lesser expenses.  If that was the end of it it would not be so bad but the taxing masters will not certify the bills until receipts are produced for these witnesses' expenses which are, in some cases, about half the amounts claimed.  Solicitors then find themselves sending a cheque for the amount allowed to the professional witness with a receipt which the professional witness will not sign.  He will send it back saying that it is not the fee he claimed and that it is not the fee he is going to accept.  Something should be done about this; there should either be agreement between the various professional bodies concerned or the taxing masters should allow these fees and certify the bill.</P>
    <P>There is another farce which I am sure the Minister in his professional capacity must be aware of.  If John Smith is a plaintiff and has an action which goes on in the High Court for three or four days and he has to come up from the country for it he is allowed £20 witnesses expenses.  The taxing master will not certify that bill until the solicitor produces from the plaintiff, who has been allowed the £20 expenses, a receipt that the solicitor has paid him the £20 expenses, although he has not got it.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is humiliating to be put to that and in some cases one might not get it.  I suggest it is putting the solicitor's profession into a humiliating position.  I have come to the conclusion that there is as much difficulty, if not more, in taxing a bill of costs than in fighting the action.  We have recently had a commission sitting on the status of women.  I believe women should be eligible for jury service.  I know they are already eligible but they have to apply to be put on the jurors list.  The position should be reversed and women should automatically be put on the jurors list unless they wish to be excused.  Women are playing a part in public life, they are in the professions and we are told we are only a short distance away from the time when married women will be able to remain on in the Civil Service and in local government employment.  If that is so it would be a step in the right direction that they should serve on juries unless they wish to be excused.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad the Minister changed the date on which the Bill is to come into operation from 1st January, 1972, to 1st March, 1972.  In respect of the increase in jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court I think that may be too soon.  This Bill will become law towards the end of the year and it will then be necessary to have rules and regulations drawn up and for the Minister to see if the courts are properly staffed.  I would suggest 1st August as the appropriate date.  The 1st March is in mid-term but on 1st August the courts would be on vacation and they would run smoothly into operation in the new sittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the provision that court documents should be served by registered post so far as possible.  It is time that the farce of serving documents on town agents was abolished. The documents had to be sent from Limerick or Cavan or any other area to a town agent who served them on the agent, who very often was the same person.  The documents were returned by the next post.  The procedure <Col N="1805" /> whereby documents can be served direct on the individual solicitor at his normal place of business is much better and I believe all documents could be served by post. I think it is the practice now not to appoint summons servers.  I read, with a smile, the Minister's remark in the Seanad that if he were to serve all documents by post the income of the summons servers would be affected seriously.  I know that would be serious for the Minister because, although the occupation is menial, it is a most highly political appointment in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Among the speakers on this Stage of the Bill I shall probably be the only person who is not a lawyer.  It is a technical Bill and it is difficult for a lay person to deal adequately with it.  It is obvious from what the Minister said in his opening remarks and from what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said that this measure is long overdue and is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing more confusing to the ordinary person than the legal system, whether it be the courts or the <Col N="1806" /> legal process itself.  This has resulted at times in unfair criticism of the law and of the people who administer and who work within the framework of the legal system.  Some time ago I had some Parliamentary Questions down to the Minister about the introduction of a free legal aid scheme.  No matter what one might say about the observation that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor, and no matter how one might argue that this idea is widespread, it is true to a great extent that a person's status and financial standing gives him easier access to the law than if he had not any financial standing.</P>
    <P>I realise there are many solicitors who accept cases from people who have not financial resources but that is not sufficient.  Generally speaking, such cases are accepted only when there is a more than reasonable chance of success.  I do not mention this as criticism of the legal profession because I realise they have a lot of work to do and time might not permit them to deal with cases where people have not the necessary finances or which do not have a reasonable chance of success.  Therefore, when one couples the ignorance of the ordinary person with regard to the legal system and the general idea that it is necessary to have financial resources in order to pursue a case, one can understand how much confusion exists.</P>
    <P>Even the most fundamental aspects of the courts or legal system are hidden from the ordinary person.  I do not suggest that is deliberate, but certainly a lot more could be done to make known the entitlements of the people in this regard.  I am sure that lawyers' time is often taken up in dealing with the most fundamental and basic queries for information which should be known to literate people, and if that information could be made known to the general public, it would enable lawyers to devote much more of their time to more important and more urgent cases.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect of the law which needs to be looked at, an aspect in which people should be educated, because I would hope that we would see, in the very near future, a free legal aid scheme in this country.  I am afraid <Col N="1807" /> that if it were introduced in the present situation of ignorance of the legal system, a free legal aid scheme would be taken up by people seeking information and seeking guidance on matters about which they should not have to seek a lawyer at all.  As a prelude to the introduction of a free legal aid scheme, something should be done about this matter because people who genuinely feel they have a case, that they maybe have a strong case&mdash; it is very difficult to convince such people if they go to a solicitor who, in his wisdom and experience, advises them that they have not, that the solicitor acted in good faith.  More often than not, such people will go out and say that, because they had not got a cheque book or a wad of notes, the solicitor would not attend to their case. This kind of criticism is all too common and, in most cases, is unfair criticism but it stems from this basic lack of knowledge of the fundamental principles of our legal system.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I said, is long overdue and very necessary.  It is difficult for me to understand, as a layman, why the financial jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts went by without change for almost 20 years, when one considers the almost complete devaluation of our currency in the same period.  I would hope, too, that there would be sufficient personnel available in the District and Circuit Courts to deal with the increased business which is going to accrue as a result of the passing of this legislation.  I would be interested to know if the business of the Circuit and District Courts has diminished as the devaluation of the currency has gone on.  I should imagine that the courts would be dealing with many more cases in the early fifties than they were in later years.</P>
    <P>I welcome any measure which will make litigation less expensive and the aim of this Bill is to do that.  I sincerely hope that that will happen because sometimes the ideal of a measure like this does not always come true.  The expense of litigation is something that has proved unjust in some cases, not in all, due, in the main, to the very co-operative attitude of the <Col N="1808" /> legal profession, or most of the legal profession.  I could quote, as one could quote in relation to every profession, examples of non co-operation in this field.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome the increase in the amount of allowances to deserted wives.  It is very much overdue, and indeed I hope that this matter will be kept under review, not every 30 years or so, but with the same frequency as social welfare benefits are reviewed. There is one point in relation to these allowances, that the maximum of £5 allowance in respect of the maintenance of each child of a deserted wife goes when the child reaches 16 years of age. Here the Minister could copy the change, over a year ago, in the social welfare benefits to widows, who can claim an allowance for a dependent child up to 18 years of age.  With the availability of post-primary education, it is now likely that a child will be at some kind of school until at least the age of 18 years, and we should not place the deserted wife in a less favourable position than a widow who gets the allowance for a child up to 18 years of age.  I would ask the Minister to let us know if there is any good reason why this allowance could not be continued until the child reaches the age of 18 years, because this appears to be Government policy in relation to certain other benefits.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the provisions for the extension of the right of audience of solicitors to all courts in the land. This is a good provision because the situation in provincial towns is that the only people readily available to the public in the field of law are solicitors. It is better that a solicitor in one of these towns could deal fully with a case himself rather than having to wait until he has referred it to somebody else.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the abolition of a right to trial by jury in civil cases in the Circuit Court.  We should be very slow to limit this right in any way even though, as the Minister has stated, the number of times that this provision has been availed of has been very few, but the fact that it is there is a comforting feature of the system as it exists. <Col N="1809" /> I would hope that the reform of the courts and of the legal system generally would continue.  There are many other aspects of law reform that are overdue.  I assure the Minister that any proposal he may put forward here regarding the updating of the system will have the full backing of this party.  We hope to see a system of justice that will be less expensive, that will be more readily available to the people and that will not give rise to the type of suspicions and criticisms that are voiced now.  I urge the Minister to continue his efforts in this sphere.  I know that he has been considering some form of legal aid and I hope that such a scheme will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The attendance here tonight and the possible small attendance that we can expect during the Committee Stage of this Bill might be said to indicate that only legal men will be dealing with this measure.  It is not that other members have no interest in the Bill but, rather, that they know very little about it. People outside very often regard the legal system as being a closed shop.  I do not know why that situation should exist.  Perhaps we might hope for some amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage that would improve certain measures contained in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to avail myself of the opportunity to look briefly but generally at our courts.  Of course, our courts are independent of the Executive.  They are the third arm of the Constitution but at the same time they are dependent on this place for their jurisdiction and, to some extent, for their rules of procedure. The fact that they are a constitutional arm of the State emphasises their importance to us and, perhaps, this is a factor that has contributed to what I would consider an unsatisfactory development in relation to our legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts, being, as it were, an organ of the Constitution and being places to which citizens have a right to resort for the purpose of resolving their differences, must be serious institutions and they must appear to be serious institutions.  Consequently, <Col N="1810" /> their procedures must be formalised with all the dignity and authority that that formality can give; but I wonder sometimes if the formality of our courts has existed for so long that citizens approach the courts with apprehension and, in many cases, in actual fear.  The very formal nature of the proceedings in the courts and the technical nature of these proceedings gives the litigant&mdash;the person for whom they are designed&mdash;a feeling that he is an outsider while those working there are possessed of some peculiar knowledge.  I get the impression regularly from members of the public that the courts, instead of being places to which they should be able to resort without any fear, inhibition or apprehension, are places to be avoided.  Of course, it could be that the very cost of going there is the reason for these fears and apprehensions, but I shall deal with that question later.  A person going to court should be able to go in the same frame of mind as he would approach any other organ of the State, perhaps the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Labour, but perhaps not in quite such a free and easy manner.  The courts have an important position under our Constitution and it is necessary that their proceedings should be formalised.  There is that air about them and there is a feeling among litigants that the courts are to be dreaded.  It is difficult to see what the solution is.  The phrase that comes to mind is an unhappy one, the people's court.  That now has an eastern European connotation and we certainly do not want anything like that here.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the High Court and the Supreme Court, to some lesser extent the Circuit Court, and the District Court to an even lesser extent, all produce this feeling amongst litigants.  Perhaps it is a good thing that litigants going into the courts should have a slightly awed feeling towards those tribunals so that their conduct before them will be that much more regular, and their acceptance of the decisions will come that much easier perhaps.  It is difficult, I can see, to get a balance.  I suppose in the ultimate one has to rely on the humanity of the persons working the courts system. <Col N="1811" /> From my own personal experience, the judicial personages with whom I have come in contact have been men of humanity and impartiality.  It is the reputation of the system that is, perhaps, at fault rather than the practitioners within it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to improve access to the courts for ordinary citizens by making their local courts more powerful and capable of dealing with a greater variety of cases.  To that extent it is very much to be welcomed. I have no complaint about the proposed jurisdiction for the District Court and the Circuit Court.  I have no doubt that the amount of business in both of these courts will be increased dramatically once this Bill comes into operation.  I wonder has the Minister considered all the implications that will flow from these increased jurisdictions?</P>
    <P>Let us take first of all the question of the number of judges available in the Circuit Court and the time available to deal with the existing criminal jurisdiction and now the enhanced civil jurisdiction.  I think it was in the Minister's reply in the Seanad that I read that there is no delay in the High Court.  I agree that, happily, that is so.  It is still a long procedure to get into the High Court but there is no delay if the procedure happens to go smoothly.  The Minister mentioned that in the Circuit Court the backlog was more or less confined to Dublin.  I beg leave to differ from the Minister because it is my experience that a considerable backlog is building up in the different circuits throughout the country.  At times this backlog can be eased and some of it cleared.</P>
    <P>The backlog is generally caused by criminal business which, of course, has to take precedence.  There may be a run of criminal cases in particular sittings for two or three terms.  This results in a build-up of civil cases awaiting trial.  A special sitting may clear the backlog but the position for the public and for the practitioners is unsatisfactory because there is no way of knowing when the backlog is likely to be cleared, or when a judge will have time to hold a special sitting.  It has been my experience that many of <Col N="1812" /> the cases comprising these backlogs are settled.  It may be a good thing that they are settled, but it is not to be desired that they should be settled in default of the parties getting a speedy trial.  That factor eliminates quite an amount of the backlog.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic for the Minister to say that there are few problems in the Circuit Court in rural Ireland.  The problems are there and when the enhanced jurisdiction comes into effect it will not be as easy to settle a case where there is £1,500, £1,800 or £2,000 at stake as it is in cases in the present instance where the sum involved may be £150 or £200.  The backlogs will remain because, unhappily, the amount of criminal business&mdash;and again I am speaking from my own experience in a limited area&mdash;is not decreasing, principally because of prosecutions for dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily injury under the Road Traffic Act, a new type of crime in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>In the District Court I wonder too if there will be complications which were not foreseen by this increase in jurisdiction?  In the larger areas a District Court sits possibly three times a month and in some cases four times a month.  In most towns it rarely sits less than twice a month.  Again, speaking from experience which I would submit is average experience and typical of country side experience, I find that the business of a District Court takes well into the afternoon.  The business taking up this time is entirely summary.  Occasionally there may be some civil litigation.  If that happens the business will certainly go into the late afternoon.  Generally the summary cases, that is, Garda prosecutions for lights on bicycles, parking offences, Attorney General prosecutions at the suit of the Garda Superintendent for dangerous driving, petty larcenies, misdemeanours of that sort and minor felonies, take up the greater part of the working day of the District Court in an average Irish town or village.</P>
    <P>Unless the sittings of the District Court are to be increased I cannot see under the present structure that there will be time for the district justice to <Col N="1813" /> deal with the amount of extra civil business that must come into his court as a result of this increase in jurisdiction. This is a serious problem and it will have to be tackled immediately and arrangements made before this Bill becomes law.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the appointment of extra justices.  It seems to me that this will have to be done.</P>
    <P>There are some districts I know where there are gaps in the week and where a justice might have two days without a sitting.  In some districts by increasing the number of sittings which a justice has to hold, part of the difficulty might be overcome.  I would suggest to the Minister that it is a real problem and that the District Court as at present constituted is not geared to handle the extra business that will come to it as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am unable to speak for the District Court office.  My experience has been invariably that these offices are run most efficiently.  I have never yet met a District Court clerk who was not absolutely and completely on top of his job.  I have no doubt that they will be able to handle the increased work but I do not know the mechanics of the District Court office well enough to be able to comment on that.  I suggest to the Minister&mdash;although I am sure he has done it&mdash;that he should have serious consultations with the District Court Clerks' Association, so that when the new jurisdiction comes into effect its arrival will be smooth.</P>
    <P>The most serious thing from the point of view of the public is to decide whether or not these changes will make any difference in the cost of litigation and, unhappily, I am afraid they will not.  The Circuit Court at the moment is, in my opinion, an expensive court to have to have resort to.  Take a decree for, say, £250, which is now going to the District Court but presently in the Circuit Court.  In an action which is fought to the stage where there is a decree for £250, the taxed costs of a successful plaintiff, assuming normal witnesses' expenses normal counsels' fees, will be nearer to £200 than to £100 and as these costs have to be borne by the unsuccessful litigant on the other side one can <Col N="1814" /> expect that his total bill will be in the region of £250 to £300.  One can readily understand why people may be apprehensive of engaging in litigation.</P>
    <P>Failure in an action, unless backed by an insurance company, can involve a party in what could be, to him, a crippling sum but yet the issue might have been such that he had no choice but to take the chance of going to law, There are certain legal issues in which it is not possible to forecast in advance the result.  All the lawyer can do is make his estimation of the facts and of the law on the situation and give his opinion as to which side is likely to be successful.  That opinion may be discounted by the actual proceedings.  A witness may present himself badly.  The instructions he got might not have been complete.  There are various imponderables which can enter into a legal action which can produce a result contrary to what the professional people opined originally and if the litigant is unfortunate enough to be affected by these things he can have a very expensive quest for justice.</P>
    <P>I do think that the system is wrong that an ordinary citizen with an ordinary income should have to be put in such financial jeopardy to get his rights.  I would echo Deputy Pattison's appeal to the Minister to consider as a matter of urgency the provision of legal aid in non-criminal business.  It is an excellent thing to have local courts with a realistic jurisdiction but it is not realistic if it is financially out of the reach of the person who wants to resort to those courts and, as a social service, the time has now come when we should fall into line with many modern States and ensure that no citizen is inhibited or actually prevented from going to court because of fears of the financial implications.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in the Seanad, or perhaps in his speech here, that the Rules of Court Committees will have to sit down immediately and revise the rules for the Circuit Court and District Court to take account of the increased jurisdictions.  Of course, the first thing they are going to have to do or will be pressured to do or will probably do automatically is to look at the costs involved and the argument that the <Col N="1815" /> costs will have to be increased as the responsibility of the practitioners are being increased by virtue of the greater sums becoming involved.  It is right, of course, that legal practitioners should be paid according to the responsibility of the tasks they carry out but that should not be the sole criterion and in my submission should not be the main criterion.  I may be unpopular with colleagues for advancing that particular view but I know it is a view held by many within the professions.  It is difficult to establish a yardstick to measure the value of a professional service.  Some attempts have been made to evaluate the cost of these things and certain activities in legal offices which one thought were profitable have been shown scientifically to be the opposite and, of course, the reverse has been found to be true also.</P>
    <P>So, I would ask the Minister to perhaps consider something more sophisticated than the present Rules Committees when it comes to establishing what should be the cost structure, certainly under the new District Court jurisdiction and, I think, under the new Circuit Court jurisdiction as well.  It would be a pity, as I say, to see these jurisdictions enhanced in this sensible way but to find the public inhibited from using the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> Again, with regard to the procedures in the courts, I should like to say a few words on the question of pleadings and the mechanics generally for getting a case as far as a hearing. In the District Court the matter is simple and I would make the suggestion that it should not be interfered with.  An action is initiated by a simple document and all it need carry is a simple averment of the nature of the action, that AB drove negligently and thereby damaged CD, causing him £X loss.  That is sufficient to start an action for negligence in the District Court. In the Circuit Court this has been excessively formalised in the manner which I have referred to earlier and that simple statement is expanded into numerous paragraphs which are only in my submission, verbiage on the essential averment of negligence or breach of contract.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that certainly the District Court Rules Committee does not bring in any form of complicated pleadings.  The aim should be to keep the District Court as simple as possible. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11th September, 1971.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of South African citizens at present resident in this State; if inquiries have been made as to whether any such persons are or have been engaged in or connected with intelligence or political activities in support of apartheid; if he has seen reports of activities by the South African intelligence service in Dublin; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The official records in relation to aliens in this country do not include citizens of South Africa, who, in common with citizens of some other countries, are, in accordance with statutory instruments made under the Aliens Act, 1935, exempted from the requirement that aliens resident here must register with the Garda.</P>
      <P>In referring to inquiries, I assume the Deputy has in mind the possibility that inquiries might have been made by the Garda following on the newspaper reports to which he refers.  If such inquiries were made, they would, of course, be confidential.  I have, in any case, no statement to make in relation to the reports.</P>
