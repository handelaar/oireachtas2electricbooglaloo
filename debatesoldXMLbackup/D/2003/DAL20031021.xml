    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the matter of Dáil reform is essentially one for the House itself, which under the Constitution has responsibility for making its own rules and Standing Orders. Responsibility for promoting Dáil reform is shared by all parties in this House and the Government will play a constructive part in exploring with those parties opportunities for improving procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions need considerable debate because there is a huge amount of reform needed, as the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, will agree. Are there plans to bring about the reform we continually talk about on this side of the House? For example, in the last election, six Deputies were returned for the Green Party, yet we could not form a group. If that number increases to seven in the case of a Green victory at a by-election, those seven Deputies will still be denied the democratic right to form a group.</P>
      <P>Is consideration being given to allow further debate on Dáil reform? Such matters as the promise of crèche facilities in the Houses have been around for years. It is now more appropriate to plan for a retirement home because by the time the crèche is built, those who intended to use it will be looking for the former.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" />It should be required that Ministers reply to a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; question with a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer. That is a matter that has given rise to tribunals, including the beef tribunal. This is a necessary requirement to Dáil reform rather than have the Ceann Comhairle continually saying &lsquo;he has no control over a Minister's or Taoiseach's answer. It makes a mockery of the Dáil if we are not able to insist that questions are answered in a straightforward fashion. Those three points cover a range of reform issues. Will the Minister of State indicate when we can make decisions on these?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the size of groups has not come up previously in considerations of Dáil reform. The Deputy will be aware that in the previous Dáil, the Whips agreed to a programme for changes in procedures in how we carry out business in the Chamber. At the first meeting of the Dáil reform sub-committee, of which all the Whips are a party, it was agreed that a number of those proposals would continue for further consideration, while others were thrown out. There have been ongoing discussions at the Whips' meetings to see how we can promote various ideas which can lead to better working processes in this House. We all recognise elements that need to be changed. There is time-wasting that needs to be avoided and more time should be available for legislation and debate. These are all issues that need to be agreed by all parties. It is not simply a matter for Government and Opposition.</P>
      <P>The provision of a crèche facility does not exactly fall under the heading of Dáil reform, but it comes under the facilities available within the House. More than any other party, the Green Party is aware of the ongoing developments in Kildare House, as it has been uprooted from there. Half of the building has been vacated for development and the crèche will be included in that.</P>
      <P>The third question is one for Ministers and the Ceann Comhairle to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>When will it be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any appreciation in Government of the damage being done to the standing of Dáil Éireann by the manner in which we organise our business? Is there any appreciation on the Government side of the irritation caused to so many Deputies by the constant sniping in the media about the manner in which we organise our business? The irritation is due, at least in part, to the fact that we know it is true. For example, how can the Minister justify the House not sitting next week? Is it not the case that there are 111 Bills on the Government's schedule of promised legislation, yet the House rises next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least irritation among those of us who seek to do the job as best we can is a more understandable emotion than the cynicism that appar<Col N="1359" /> ently afflicts the Government, which believes there is no need to pay any attention to what the media say as they would say that anyway. As a result, it does not do anything and goes on as before. While there have been many changes in this society since the First Dáil, if the Members of that Dáil were to come back they would be perfectly comfortable with the procedures we apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Any change Members bring about in the way in which we operate this House will be done because it is the wish of the Members, not because anybody else dictates that to us. This is why the responsibility for this lies not with Government or Opposition but with the Whips of the various parties. Anything we do must be done by agreement between us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte may be right. Perhaps there is a lack of appreciation among some elements of the media about what we do. I am sure Deputy Rabbitte would agree that does not apply to the political correspondents who operate within the confines of this House and see exactly the amount of work carried out by all Members and the dedication and commitment they apply to their work.</P>
      <P>The same can be said of the legislative process. The Deputy referred to 111 Bills which have to be produced. Those Bills will constantly be produced by the Parliamentary Draftsman's office, working in conjunction with my office, which in turn works with all Ministers to ensure we can pursue our legislative programme and have Bills published. There is a huge amount of pressure on the legislation programme with a view to having legislation prepared. Time can be allocated to this so that it will go ahead next week as always.</P>
      <P>The committees will also meet next week. Members of this House constantly ask that increased recognition be given to the work of those committees and a good time to do that is when the Dáil is not sitting in plenary session.</P>
      <P>We can do some things to address efficiency. Last week 20 Members raised 20 different issues under Standing Order 31, all of which represented nothing more than time wasting. There are adequate ways at various times of the day when these issues can be raised. From a Government point of view, less than half of the time spent in this Chamber is allocated to special debates and to legislation. If we want to progress legislation we need to allow more time for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each week since we returned, we have allocated time for special debates. I would be the first to accept those debates are hugely important. We spent a full day debating the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. We had special statements last week on the Intergovernmental Conference and the proposed European constitution. There will be statements this week on the European Council meeting. We will debate the tobacco regulations and the Hanly report. While all these matters are important, they also take from <Col N="1360" /> the amount of time we spend dealing with legislation in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about wanting to improve the status and standing of this House in the eyes of the public or the media or if we want to change our methods to be more efficient, then we must do so as a group and agree it together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle is like me in that, every time I see the words &ldquo;Dáil reform&rdquo;, I become concerned. There have been a number of reforms since I was first elected to the House which appear to have left us worse off in the eyes of the public and the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister of State indicate what has taken place at the Whips' meeting. I circulated a paper last April concerning Dáil procedures, an issue which is more relevant. Procedures and Standing Orders are at the heart of the issue because, as the Ceann Comhairle knows, once they are laid down, they can be operated effectively to give the public a clearer image of what their public representatives do.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State keep in mind in the reforms, review or changes in procedure that take place the necessity to have Government involved in the proceedings of the House as much as the Opposition and backbenchers? It is of critical importance to conducting business to have the Government ready and responsive. Will the Minister of State take into account and incorporate in the proposals the need for simple matters such as Ministers answering matters on the Adjournment relevant to their Departments? That is critical. There is no sense in one Minister answering several such matters.</P>
      <P>I could go on, but it would be a breach of procedures and Standing Orders and I do not want to encourage that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the elements of the original reform package agreed between the Whips have been introduced successfully, one of which is electronic voting. Another is that, while the Taoiseach takes current issues on Tuesday and Wednesday, his attendance is not mandatory on Thursday. This was agreed by the Whips in the previous session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>No other prime minister in the world answers questions that are not notified in advance or have not been seen beforehand, yet this happens successfully every week in the Dáil. Other issues in the reform package will be progressed.</P>
      <P>I have invited each of the parties and Whips to come forward with their proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that this is not just something for the Government Chief Whip. This is something for all parties to do in the interests of the running of the House. I have yet to see proposals from those who talk loudest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to take up the challenge and will submit a document to the Minister of State within the next few weeks. However, is it not the case that, when this happened before, her predecessor launched with great fanfare his proposals for Dáil reform &ndash; the Séamus Brennan way forward? We had several sincere interviews with the then Chief Whip about what he was doing to reform Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>What is the justification for the House not sitting next week? How can the Minister of State say it is the responsibility of all groups when the position taken by the Government, apart from claiming authorship, is that there will be a committee week every month but the House will not be convened? I have no objection to there being a committee week, but the House ought to convene in the morning and the Taoiseach ought to make himself amenable to the House on the issues of the day.</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that what the Minister of State referred to as time-wasting is frustration on the part of backbenchers who have no other opportunity to raise an issue of the day that concerns their constituency or a matter in which they have a specific interest other than the Standing Order 31 provision to which she referred?</P>
      <P>Is it not correct, as Deputy Durkan said, that one can be in the House coming up to midnight to find that the four matters on the Adjournment will be taken in a desultory performance by one Minister of State who reads out a script from a Department which he has never visited and of which he has never heard? How does sending in a Minister of State dignify this House? Private secretaries make telephone calls to find out if tonight is Ivor Callely's night and they send him the answer on some complex subject that the same Minister of State, Deputy Callely, skilled as he is in the local constituency, will not know anything about. Is that any way to treat this House? Is that what is happening?</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that there are 16 Bills published at the moment, none of which has reached Second Stage, and the Minister of State is putting the House into recess next week? How can that be justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the proposals raised including those for committee week, I had some discussions with the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants some time ago and that was an issue of concern. There are issues that have to be resolved across the board with regard to that. In our discussions as a Dáil reform committee one of the proposals was to have a five-week term consisting of a committee week and Dáil weeks. It was decided as a general rule not to proceed with it on a regular basis. However, there is an <Col N="1362" /> opportunity for committees to be given more time.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by the Deputy, I agree with him that it is desirable that the relevant Minister be present in the House for all the matters on the Adjournment. Deputy Rabbitte will recall from his time in Government that Ministers receive quite late notification as to when the matter will be taken in the House. Ministers' diaries fill up and they are often informed at 4 p.m. that they are required that night and they may already be committed to attending another function later that night&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the proposals for Dáil reform was to move the Adjournment to the morning and notice would be given the evening before. These are very practical proposals and ones which might lead to a better interchange and exchange of views, particularly on local issues which are very important to all Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does a timeframe exist within which a programme of Dáil reform will be brought before the House? We are all aware that the Whips are working on this issue and I acknowledge that it is an inclusive participatory process. Does the Minister of State envisage a timeframe for an end to the debate and when will substantive proposals be put before the House?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that No. 48 on today's Order Paper is a motion tabled by the Sinn Féin Members seeking the accommodation of Northern representation in this House, with MPs from north of the Border having the opportunity to participate in this Chamber. Notwithstanding any other element or aspect of Dáil reform, will the Minister of State consider providing Government time to allow this motion to proceed before the House in line with the Taoiseach's stated commitment to facilitate this important change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Other than the document which was agreed by the previous Whips, there are very few new proposals, other than a proposal to do with timing which I tabled and a proposal on parliamentary questions tabled by Deputy Durkan earlier in the year. Until the Whips present other real proposals it will not be possible to present a timeframe in which we can finalise it. There has been much talk about the proposal and much time has been given to it in this Chamber. However, nobody has presented any real suggestions or changes. Deputy Rabbitte indicated that he will submit proposals, as did Deputy Kenny on an earlier occasion. The Government will consider all those proposals. It is in the interests of this House that we work on that issue as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Ó Caoláin's question about Northern representation in the Houses of the <Col N="1363" /> Oireachtas, this has been raised regarding a number of issues but for the last while we have been working in a vacuum regarding Northern Ireland. I am hopeful that today's events can allow us to move forward now that a new context has been created. The issue will be examined in the context of Dáil and Seanad reform.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State recognise that she has unwittingly betrayed the Government position on this important issue when she says that Ministers' diaries fill up? This is Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The many kinds of fixtures which fill up ministerial diaries are regarded as more important than being in Dáil Éireann to answer the elected representatives of the people. That is what is wrong. The approach of Government is to hold a press conference to launch the Hanly report, far removed from the Dáil Chamber. The last place a Minister would think of announcing any initiative is in the Dáil Chamber. Is that not the problem? I heard what the Minister said about all groups here. The only thing of which the Minister for Transport does not claim authorship is the Luas. He was quick to lay claim to what he termed the &ldquo;Brennan proposals&rdquo; in respect of Dáil reform.</P>
      <P> What is the justification for the House not sitting next week? The Minister of State has still not answered that question. I do not see the justification for it. There is no point in explaining to the media&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any point in explaining to the media that we are here until 10.30 p.m. at night and coming up to Christmas we will be here until midnight? That will not be written about, yet there is constant sniping in some sections of the media by some journalists who never set foot in the place. Such people know nothing about the task of being either a legislator or a representative of the people. They only work approximately one third of the hours&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that most Members of the House work. There is no point in appealing to their better sense of judgment on this matter. Are they not making reasonable criticisms, notwithstanding what I have said, of the way we order our business? While we take recesses like that <Col N="1364" /> next week, it is difficult for us to maintain a credible position in criticising some of the more superficial comment to which we, the Members of the House and the House itself, are subjected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the dual mandate was abolished to give more time to legislators to be in the Dáil and that, therefore, Dáil sitting time would be extended, that we would sit for more days than the 66 in 2002, for example. Will the Minister of State clarify this matter? A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer will suffice.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, in conjunction with the Standards in Public Office Commission, published a code of conduct on 3 July 2003. This placed a requirement on Ministers and the Taoiseach to give accurate and truthful information to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to correct any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Does this still stand and should it be enforced? How should it be enforced given the misleading of the Dáil by the Taoiseach over the meeting between his special adviser, now Senator Mansergh, and the Real IRA? The incorrect information was given on 5 November, yet it was only corrected the following year, on 14 October 2003. Will the code be enforced? Does it mean anything? Are &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answers required to be truthful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will reassure me in regard to my concerns about the Adjournment debate being taken in the morning. This would release Ministers for some purpose about which I am unclear. Will she confirm that, as Deputy Rabbitte said, during a sitting day Ministers are supposed to be located in either the Dáil or the Seanad, as the case may be? In the event of such a change, I am concerned that Ministers might leave backbenchers from all parties in the House to have a discussion among themselves. I stand to be corrected on this point.</P>
      <P>It is fundamental in a democracy that the interaction between Government and Parliament continues to the fullest possible extent. Does the Minister of State accept that there is a general recognition in the media and among the general public that there is a greater need than ever for Government to interact with Parliament? That interaction involves all the elements which have been pointed out by speakers on this side of the House including short, succinct answers to questions rather than speeches. I am sure the Ceann Comhairle is about to point out that I should not make a speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adjournment is just that and takes place at the end of the Dáil's business each day. All Ministers are here at all times when the Dáil is sitting unless officially paired for Government business and they are accountable throughout that time. It is only because the matters are being raised on the Adjournment and late notice is given that Ministers are sometimes not available late at night. If, as Deputy Durkan has said, the debate were to move to the morning, it would no longer be the Adjournment but the &ldquo;commencement&rdquo;. It might be a better way of doing things as people would have advance notice of topics and could commit to attending.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Sargent's point, I did not launch anything this July and I am not aware of the codes he spoke about.</P>

      <P>While there were many reasons for the removal of the dual mandate, the main ones were to increase locally based representation, to strengthen local democracy, to ensure a larger pool of representatives and to encourage people into both processes. The removal of the dual mandate gives us the opportunity to find ways to use time which Members did not have up to now.</P>

    <P>However, we must also be cognisant of people who have to travel and of family-friendly policies. That feeds into Deputy Rabbitte's point. Various issues have been raised and while some Dublin-based Deputies argue that the Dáil should sit between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., rural Members say it absolutely should not. Those Deputies do not wish to find themselves in Dublin with nothing to do for days on end. Our profession is particularly unfriendly to family life but the standardised school calendar, which means that all schools are <Col N="1366" /> off next week, might be an opportunity to adopt family-friendly policies. We could, for example, ensure that next week Members have more time to spend with their families.</P>
    <P>We are looking at, perhaps, longer sitting days. There are issues relating to that. It is unfortunate, as Deputy Rabbitte says, that the media will not look at the length of time we spend here but will simply count the sitting days. In that case, if one spends an hour here on a Friday, will one get more credit for spending an extra four hours here on a Tuesday or Wednesday? That would be wrong. It is true, however, that the way we do our business can be improved by proper discussion among Whips and by the committee considering Dáil reform. We can only make real progress when this matter is debated by people who have genuine ideas and are willing to consider it neutrally rather than as members of the Opposition versus the Government to ensure that the House conducts its business efficiently, thereby improving Members' standing in their own eyes and in the eyes of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is timely given that the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, for which my Department has responsibility published the results of a national population survey of drug use yesterday, 20 October. This is the first occasion that a comprehensive survey has been carried out on an all-island basis on the extent of drug misuse.</P>
      <P>On cocaine, the survey shows that 3.1% of the population have used the drug at some time; 1.1% used it in the past 12 months; and, 0.3% used it in the past month. Compared with similar surveys undertaken in other European countries, these figures suggest that Ireland is roughly average in terms of use.</P>
      <P>While anecdotal evidence would suggest that cocaine use has increased, the Deputy should be aware that the numbers presenting for treatment are still very low and, in total, make up approximately 1% of those in treatment. Similarly, cocaine-related offences remain relatively small compared to other drugs and account for approximately 3% of all such offences.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that additional guidelines are required at this time. I am confident that through the implementation of the 100 actions in the national drugs strategy 2001-08 and through projects and initiatives operated through the local drugs task forces and the young peoples facilities and services fund, the problem of cocaine use can be addressed.</P>
      <P>Each of the local drugs task forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in its area based on its own identified priorities. About &euro;130 million has been spent locally. Regional drugs task forces are also being established in each health board area and many of these are now up and running. As a first step in the process of developing action plans the task forces are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas and the level and range of existing services. Where cocaine use is found to be a problem, this can be reflected in the measures proposed in the action plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State read the relevant section on the prevalence of cocaine use during the past year? The tables in the survey <Col N="1368" /> from which he quoted show that Ireland was third of ten European countries for the use of cocaine, coming after Spain and the United Kingdom. Looking at the cohort of young people across Europe using cocaine, Ireland lies fourth. Our position is not in the middle but in the top three or four and the problem is far more serious than the Minister of State says it is.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the number of convictions for cocaine use over the year 2001 which is the last year for which figures are available. The increase in the Dublin region was 53%, in the northern region the number of convictions went up from two to 13, in the western region from seven to 17 and in the southern region from 21 to 51. There has been a significant increase in convictions. Notwithstanding what the Minister of State said, I do not accept that he has any treatment facilities available for people who are using cocaine because the only treatment there is for the problem is one-to-one counselling. This is very expensive but is necessary. Will he consider including more money in his Estimates to provide counselling for people who have this significant problem?</P>
      <P>Community groups are telling us that there is a significant increase in cocaine use among young people yet the Government is sitting back and doing nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy questioned the figures for cocaine use last year. The figure for Spain was 2.6%, the United Kingdom was 2.0% and the Netherlands and Ireland were 1.1%. Of the nine or ten countries surveyed we are joint third. While considerably behind some of them, overall we are about average or slightly ahead.</P>
      <P>The number of convictions for cocaine use has gone up. While convictions and seizures increased from about 170 in 1999 to 300 two years later, they are still only 3% of overall drug convictions. Most drug convictions are for cannabis which is the big problem.</P>
      <P>There is no substitute treatment for cocaine use as there is for heroin use with methadone. Counselling and behaviour therapy sessions are what exist and we can only treat those people who come forward. The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the strategy are flexible enough to allow them adapt. The authority did commence a clinic some months ago in the north city specifically for people with cocaine difficulties. The problem is that these people are slower to come forward because they do not realise the damage cocaine is doing to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that cocaine is exclusively a young person's drug. Traditionally cocaine was used by the more professional classes but its use has spread into other sectors of the community. Anecdotal evidence would suggest there has been an increase in its use in recent times. However, we have not got that in hard facts and figures yet. I do not think it is young people of 15 or 16 years of age who are using it. It is still people well into <Col N="1369" /> their 20s or 30s who are more likely to be using it.</P>
    <P>The drugs task forces are being funded. There is no difficulty with their funding and they can adapt their plans as necessary.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board is an independent statutory body, under the aegis of my Department, with responsibility for overseeing the disbursement of unclaimed moneys from the Dormant Accounts Fund. The board presented its disbursement plan for approval this summer and following detailed consideration, including consultation at Cabinet level, it was approved on 30 September subject to a number of amendments.</P>
      <P>The specific amendments to the plan include ring-fencing a level of disbursements towards RAPID, CLÁR and drug task force areas. I believe that a reasonable proportion of these funds should be directed towards projects in areas designated by Government as experiencing particular social and economic disadvantage.</P>
      <P>As regards funding for persons with a disability, the plan was amended to ensure a focus towards those who require intensive levels of support in areas of health and personal social services. I believe that such a focus is appropriate given the particular pressures faced by families of those who require such supports. The third main amendment relates to the addition of IT as a measure to tackle disadvantage. The inclusion of this measure is important in promoting access to &ndash; and competence in &ndash; technology, in particular for young people in disadvantaged areas and for persons with a disability.</P>
      <P>Now that the plan has been approved, the board is making the necessary practical arrangements for its publication which I understand is scheduled for mid November. In addition, the board is currently advancing its consideration of the practical arrangements necessary to enable commencement of the implementation of the plan. In this regard, it is anticipated that arrangements for the board to engage a service provider to administer a funding programme on its behalf will be finalised shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The amount to be paid from the fund this year <Col N="1370" /> will be dependent on the level of applications received. While early disbursements from the fund would be desirable, one of my major concerns is to ensure that, as a new entity, the board develops and puts in place transparent procedures by which it can fairly seek and assess applications, decide on funding and review effectiveness of spend. Work on this process is well advanced and I expect it will be concluded shortly, thus opening the way for disbursements to commence.</P>
    <P>The current value of the fund is in the order of &euro;180 million, including a reserve which must be maintained to meet claims for repayment and various costs associated with administering the scheme. However, consistent with advice from the Department of Finance, the board has agreed that not more than &euro;30 million will be disbursed annually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State not think it strange that the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board was set up in June 2002 and we still have not had publication of its report and neither have application forms been made available for people to apply to the scheme? He mentions a service provider. Are we talking about an organisation such as Area Development Management, ADM, to administer the fund on behalf of the disbursement board and does this mean, in effect, that virtually no money will be allocated in the 2003-04 year, as was indicated? The indication was that &euro;30 million would be disbursed in this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The board is an independent body. It was set up in the summer of 2002 and has been working on its plan. It submitted it to the Department of Finance in late June in accordance with the timetable laid down. It has now gone through Cabinet and has been agreed by the board. It will be published in the week commencing 10 November and the board hopes to reveal full details of how it is going to allocate the fund.</P>
      <P>Yes, we are talking about a service provider, since the board is a statutory body and does not have huge back-up like the organisation the Deputy has mentioned. Negotiations are ongoing and an organisation like that will assist in the processing and the paperwork. As to whether moneys will be spent this year, I believe some will be allocated by the end of December. At this stage probably little or nothing will be spent, but from about the second week in November things will move very quickly. About &euro;30 million will be spent in the first 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this is a cumbersome model? I have little confidence in his expectation of the sort of money that can be allocated within the 2003-04 year. Effectively he is extending the timescale to the end of 2004. Is it not appalling that &euro;200 million is lying in an account when community and voluntary organisations are crying out for money, particularly <Col N="1371" /> against the background of the cutbacks that the Minister of State's Department brought about in these areas in the last budget? We can be far from sure that similar cuts will not occur in the 2004 budget. Does the Minister not agree that the amount of time that has been wasted is disgraceful and that the organisations that need money to provide essential services are kept waiting while this over-cumbersome model is being put in place? We cannot be sure in fact that any money will be allocated this year, much less in the early part of next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is appalling or disgraceful. There was about &euro;180 million in the fund and 15% is being held back, so about &euro;150 million will be allocated. I do not know what cutbacks the Deputy is talking about. There have been no cutbacks in our Department. Since we were here last we have, during the summer, announced the training and federation grants which means new money under the White Paper. Many of those community and voluntary groups have received money and a lot of them were very grateful for it over the summer. Whatever about the past, it will all be announced in the second week of November and we will fast forward from then.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will define the unique settlement pattern found in rural Ireland; and the way in which Government policies are helping to define this pattern as stated in a recent speech made in Killarney.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. As I stated in Killarney recently, we have in our country a unique settlement pattern based around the baile fearann, or townland, and the parish. Villages and towns obviously also play a role in rural areas, but the traditional settlement pattern gave a cohesiveness to society that is vital for the economic and social well-being of our people. We need balanced spatial development, and part of this is the development of our countryside, as outlined in the national spatial strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out in the strategy, in many rural areas the combination of a high dependency on a changing agricultural base, a scarcity of employment opportunities and resultant out-migration has weakened their demographic, economic, social and physical structure. In my statement welcoming the publication of the strategy last November, I said it sets down clear markers for the way ahead in rural development. The strategy <Col N="1372" /> addresses many of my concerns in relation to such issues as rural housing, services and cultural identity. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew rural communities. In this way it aims to ensure that key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and also that rural settlement policies are responsive to the differing local circumstances in different areas.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is currently at an advanced stage in preparing rural housing guidelines and it is subsequently proposed to issue these as a public consultation document before the end of the year. The guidelines will also be aimed, through the operation of the planning system, at securing greater public awareness of the issues involved in rural settlement policies and greater consensus on the practical implementation of those policies.</P>
    <P>Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in 1999. The policy agenda is a broad one, involving the remit of many of my colleagues in Government and their related agencies. It covers such issues as agriculture, infrastructure, transport, environment, health, education and enterprise and the challenge is to ensure coherence in pursuing our rural development objectives.</P>
    <P>Given the lapse of time and other significant developments since its publication, I am considering initiating a review of the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Given that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is preparing guidelines on rural housing does the Minister not see a role for his Department in preparing similar criteria for sustainable rural communities? Does he think that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs could play a positive role if it were to identify such criteria? I suggest that those criteria might involve maintaining critical mass in towns and villages, and services such as schools, Garda stations and post offices. As the Department has responsibility for community affairs, surely it should emphasise this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the ongoing debate about rural settlement patterns and the effects of one-off housing, does the Department have a role in presenting useful statistics and information in order that this debate can be conducted in a proper context? For instance, of the 54,000 houses built last year, at least 30% were one-off housing. If it is the case that there are inconsistent planning departments in each local authority area, does the Department have a role in putting forward national criteria to make them more consistent? They could establish whether people in family situations or people who are prepared to work in the agricultural sector are not getting planning permission and decide whether clauses should be put in place to the effect that such developments could not be sold on for a set period. In that way, these devel<Col N="1373" /> opments would not be seen as a future commercial gain but would be an investment in the local community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked several questions and I will try in the brief time available to me to answer them as succinctly as possible. As was the case with the spatial strategy, my Department will be involved with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in drawing up the rural housing guidelines. The second issue is one about which there is a grave misconception. Of course we want to keep the schools, post offices and services in our towns and villages but if we depopulate the countryside, we will not have children for the schools or customers for the post offices. Those who think, for example, that the majority of the children who go to school in Cornamona, where I live, or Clonbur come from the village of Cornamona, are mistaken about the settlement pattern we are discussing. Most of the children attending rural national schools in villages and towns &ndash; some schools are located in the towns while others, such as Scoil an tSeana-Phobail, are away out in the country &ndash; come from the whole parish, the half parish or the school catchment area. Therefore, one cannot strengthen rural towns and villages if one weakens the baillte fearainn that make up the area.</P>
      <P>The third point is that there must be a creative tension between the absolute requirement for people to adhere to national policies and the freedom within national policies for local authorities to have autonomy on certain issues. The Green Party has preached for many years about the need for local autonomy. We have already laid down the broad parameters in the national spatial strategy. We will build on that in the national rural housing guidelines but, within those parameters, we must afford the freedom to the local authorities to make the decisions on their own areas. To do otherwise would be to undermine everything for which the Green Party stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I further suggest to the Minister that in terms of future planning and the role his Department can play, there is a possibility of being a lead Department in terms of many of these ideas. His Department could give a lead to the Department of Transport on the absence of transport in many of these communities; to the Department of Health and Children on the basis that mental health is affected by degrees of rural isolation and no one seems to be measuring this; and, to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of the effects of crimes committed in isolated rural areas. All of these factors need to be taken into account in a coherent national strategy that the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government will not be able to create in terms of guidelines on rural housing alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but &ldquo;lead&rdquo; is a word one must use carefully. There is only one Government and there are different Departments but we must have one coherent policy. My Department works in conjunction with all of the other line Departments. It is a cross-cutting Department on an urban and a rural level but it cannot go off and devise policies on rural policing separate from those of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, although we do have an input into those policies. That is why a Cabinet Minister has direct responsibility for rural development as part of the senior ministry. We always feed into the system by holding bilateral meetings and so on. Perhaps the best example of how we have managed to exert influence would be to examine how Gaeltacht, island and CLÁR policies have been formed in consultation with other Departments but have spanned a range of activities. These include, for example, the very comprehensive transport policies that exist for islanders under the aegis of my Department.</P>

Will efforts be made to curtail the level of administration as against the level of funds being spent on projects and development in general? I notice from a reply I received today from the Minister's colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, <Col N="1375" /> that the summer jobs scheme has been more or less sidelined to the partnership bodies yet those bodies would not have received any funds to deliver on that. They are being asked only to give advice and so on. A total of 4,600 students were left in limbo last year as a result and it caused serious pressures on those in deprived areas. The Minister can say whatever he likes but that is a fact of which I have proof.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister undertaking this review for the sake of it or is he committed to actually ensuring that best value is given for money? In light of the fact that the Minister's budget was curtailed 11 months ago, perhaps he will have an increased budget this year and the review may not be necessary. If he has to deal with a similar budget allocation and the groups use up a considerable amount for administration, will the review deliver best practice and best delivery to the communities they represent?</P>

      <P>I cannot pre-empt a Government decision on this matter and cannot make a statement on something that has not yet happened. However, the objective of the review is quite simple and it does not matter how much money is involved. That is the mistake people make; they think that if money is plentiful there is an excuse not to examine best practice in the system and that we continue to live with the old systems all the time. I do not agree with that view. Money always was and will be a scarce commodity. If it is so plentiful, why bother taxing the people? Why should we not still use it efficiently? I concur with the theory that no matter how plentiful money is, we should be as careful with it as if it were our own, even more careful as it is the taxpayers' money. I fully agree with the Deputy that the objective of everything I do is to ensure that as much of the money as possible goes to deliver front-line services. That is exactly what we are trying to do.</P>
      <P>As everybody knows there are two steps in this process. One is to stop the ever-growing number of bodies adding to the complication for the citizen, and the second is to try to rationalise and make more efficient the existing bodies. I have pointed out time and again that as a member of a community, I get confused as to what all these bodies are doing. Those who visit my clinics and receive the telephone list of the contacts who might be able to offer assistance in various areas are testament to the fact that people want some order and rationality introduced to this sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to establish through this question whether there will be order. Many people are anxious about their own situations and the need for a better service being delivered on time. Does the Minister accept that there is duplication? Does he agree a great deal of time is being spent by administrators attending meetings with other administrators to ensure there is no duplication? Does he also accept there is a lot of <Col N="1376" /> administration involved in accountancy matters and so on? One person informed me he spends a day and a half per week dealing with the information demanded of him by Departments in general &ndash; not necessarily the Minister's Department. That is in addition to the fact that he has a person looking after finance. How can one justify a requirement on the part of a person with higher capabilities to spend a day and a half literally filling in forms? This was brought to my notice by more than one person. There is a plethora of forms designed to ensure that all of the groups concerned are not duplicating each other.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I are totally of one mind on this. He is correct &ndash; he has put his finger on what we are trying to achieve. On a recent visit to an island of 200 inhabitants, I was informed that because of structures which Government had created in a hotch-potch manner, the community development organisation on the island had 20 bank accounts. That represented one community bank account for every ten persons on the island.</P>

      <P>One could say that, but, unfortunately, there was probably no money in most of them. However, Deputy Crawford has hit the nail on the head with regard to what we are trying to do. I should point out that those working in the system will always emphasise the reason their job is most important. That is understandable. Most people see the solution to excessive bureaucracy in terms of adding more staff, rather than seeking to simplify the situation. As I have repeatedly said to community groups, this is as much an examination of what all of us have done in Government over the years to add to these structures, whatever their origin &ndash; some of them were established for good reasons, such as implementation of EU schemes and so on &ndash; as it is an examination of the groups concerned. I hope it will be seen in that spirit.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is the role of my Department, supported by ADM, to co-ordinate the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, therefore, a matter for each of the other Departments to report on the implementation of the programme regarding proposals that fall within their remit. No major report has been submitted to my Department <Col N="1377" /> regarding the administration of the RAPID programme. As part of its co-ordinating role, my Department receives regular updates on the implementation of the RAPID programme.</P>
      <P>These updates include informal <i>ad hoc</i> updates, reports prepared for regular Department liaison meetings with ADM and reports prepared by the national co-ordinator for the RAPID national monitoring committee. In addition, the RAPID area implementation teams report regularly to the social inclusion measures groups of the city and county development boards or RAPID county monitoring groups, which report quarterly to the RAPID national monitoring committee via ADM. Information from these reports is analysed by ADM and key issues for action across all Departments are identified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to an earlier question, the Minister spoke of ineffectual structures for administering services. He also stated, in response to another recent question in the House, that he could only comment on RAPID plans within the remit of his own Department. However, he has overall responsibility for the implementation of RAPID. He read his reply to the question very quickly, referring to a national monitoring committee and other monitoring committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister have overall responsibility if he is not getting frequent reports from ADM as to how the administration of the scheme is proceeding? How does ADM relate to the national monitoring committee? Who is in charge of the RAPID programme? From what the Minister said, he appears to have a fairly tenuous role as the overall implementor of RAPID which, in the final analysis, is not really being implemented at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies O'Shea and Crawford appear to be in agreement with me. The system is rather labyrinthine, as I have said time and again. The national monitoring committee of RAPID makes its pitch to various Departments. When I came to the Department and sought a list of all proposed actions, I was informed that, in the original strand, there were approximately 1,000. There are only, perhaps, ten or 12 Departments directly affected, excluding those such as the Department of Defence, which are not so involved. That represents an average of about 100 actions per Department and the Deputy will appreciate the difficulty of handling that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us deal with the direction I wish to take, as I believe Deputy O'Shea may wish to do. I have always stated my belief that the RAPID programme, however well meaning it may be, is too labyrinthine in its modalities. With a target date for implementation at the beginning of next year, my intention is to separate all of the small issues <Col N="1378" /> which can be dealt with locally. For example, does a problem with a CCTV camera have to be referred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than being handled at local level? If an area needs to be landscaped to eliminate cider parties, is it really necessary to involve central government through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government? I do not believe so.</P>
    <P>We should separate the big issues from the smaller ones and provide a small leverage fund to deal with the latter on a local basis, somewhat analogous to the system which operates in the CLÁR programme. The remaining smaller number of major issues, which I believe would be of manageable proportions, would then be dealt with as between one Department and another. I have been known to favour an approach on the basis of Department to Department and, ultimately, Minister to Minister to resolve the bigger issues in debate, rather than using outside bodies to interact with Departments, as I believe the results tend to be better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has finally admitted that the whole administration of the RAPID programme is in quite a mess and is not really going anywhere. I admire his aspirations, which have some merit. However, will anything happen? That is the real question. I believe the Minister will admit that RAPID is not really working. We now have a situation in which the Government is raiding the dormant accounts fund to provide some money in that regard. On my understanding of the Government's promise, approximately &euro;2 billion was to be front-loaded. That is just not happening and we are now reduced to robbing a charity fund to push this very ineffective programme forward.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wrong. Amazingly, he congratulated me on my statement in Tallaght very early this year, in which I gave a timetable for the beginning of next year. His party leader castigated me in this House for stating that I did not believe the programme was working and that I intended, through the process to which I have consistently adhered, including monitoring committees, regional assemblies and so on, to bring about this change. The Deputy's leader castigated me for taking precisely the action on which he has complimented me today. However, that is life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the answer. I have set a target date for implementation of a different way of operating RAPID by the beginning of next year. On the dormant accounts issue and RAPID, the position is quite simple. By statute, the dormant accounts fund falls to be directed towards those who are in greatest socio-economic <Col N="1379" /> need. If the Government and its Ministers did not prioritise that money towards RAPID and CLÁR areas, we would, in my view, be in contravention of the legislation. It is additional and it is entirely within the spirit of RAPID that money should be front-loaded towards the RAPID areas which are the areas of greatest need.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Official Languages Act 2002, which was enacted in July 2003, was one of the key recommendations contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta. Implementation of this Act will address many of the issues raised in the report, particularly in relation to the provision of improved public services through Irish and the status of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I established an advisory committee in October 2002 to advise on the actions necessary to facilitate the practical implementation of various recommendations contained in the report. In the context of advice received from the committee, I am commissioning a comprehensive linguistic study of Irish usage in Gaeltacht areas. This will form the basis for the development of the Gaeltacht as an Irish-speaking area and for a review of Gaeltacht boundaries. Tenders in relation to this study are currently being evaluated by my Department with a view to appointing consultants and commencing the study in the very near future.</P>
      <P>An action plan which will highlight the advantages of choosing Irish as the household language and which will primarily target parents in Gaeltacht areas, particularly those with young children, is currently being finalised. My Department is also finalising a review of existing schemes which play a significant role in regard to strengthening the usage and transmission of Irish in the Gaeltacht, namely, scéim labhairt na Gaeilge, scéim na gcúntóirí teanga and scéim na gcampaí samhraidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the other issues and initiatives being progressed or under consideration at present is a submission, highlighting the critical issues affecting the Irish language in primary and post-primary education in the Gaeltacht, which has been forwarded to An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta. The linguistic impact of planning policy in the Gaeltacht was the subject of submissions made by my Department to local authorities responsible for Gaeltacht areas in the context of the preparation and <Col N="1380" /> implementation of county development plans and local area development plans. Work is also in hand on the preparation of special support mechanisms for Gaeltacht communities in order to assist them in drawing up suitable language plans aimed at the maintenance and strengthening of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht. Proposals for the restructuring of Irish language pre-school services in the Gaeltacht administered by Údarás na Gaeltachta are nearing completion. I intend to press ahead with these and other initiatives in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply bears a remarkable resemblance to one to a similar question on 25 June. Bille na Teanga has been passed into law but the linguistic study is still not under way. The Minister is not doing anything to effect this report. There is ongoing consultation with advisory committees and so on but does the Minister not agree that virtually nothing has happened in regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta since 25 June?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally disagree with the Deputy's proposition. There is a great deal of preparatory work and it is continuing apace. One of the implications of implementing reports of this type is the requirement for money. Therefore, some of the finalisation of this work has to be done in the context of the Estimates process. For example, one cannot implement An Teach Teanga without having a language commissioner, but I cannot have one without a budget line and I cannot get a budget line without an Estimate. Therefore, all these issues are moving towards a point and I am confident that, by the beginning of next year, we will be able to implement radical change in the way in which we promote the Irish language in the Gaeltacht. There will be some painful decisions to make because I must make choices in regard to where the new financial priorities are in terms of the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I cannot redraw the boundaries of the Gaeltacht, having received the liguistic report, without giving people in those areas a linguistic choice to make since part of the report addresses attitudes in areas as well as language usage. I cannot predetermine the boundaries until I get the report. There are issues in regard to boundaries, particularly in regard to the functional area of Údarás na Gaeltachta, which is now defined as the Gaeltacht. However, Údarás na Gaeltachta operates in the city of Galway, apart from the official Gaeltacht. There are complex issues which I will address in the coming year.</P>

      <P>In regard to the boundaries of the Gaeltacht, it is disappointing to hear the Minister in regard to the delinking of the Údarás na Gaeltachta elections from the local elections. I would have thought that the constitutional provision for the holding of local government elections every five years should also apply to Údarás na Gaeltachta. Does the Minister intend to correct this matter once the boundaries are sorted out and the next set of Údarás na Gaeltachta elections are out of the way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider postponing the elections until the boundaries are finally set aside and settled since it would not make sense to proceed in the context of significant changes potentially excluding certain areas from the Gaeltacht?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Statute dictates that Údarás na Gaeltachta elections must be held within five and a half years of the date of the previous election. Therefore, I would have to come back before the House to postpone it. Most Gaeltacht people do not favour holding Údarás na Gaeltachta elections on the same day as the European and local elections because they feel they get lost in the process.</P>
      <P>I accept that this is a democratic risk but, up to now, in areas where a very strong and very weak Gaeltacht are linked, such as in Galway city, there has been a low turnout in the areas in which the Irish language is not spoken. Therefore, it has not yet had an overweening effect. However, they could all turn out, which could upset the balance of representation on the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta. It is something I have considered seriously and will continue to consider. There are a number of remedies which I could put in place before the next elections as well as changing the Gaeltacht boundaries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, the review of the Western Development Commission is in progress but will not be finalised before a separate study of how best to support enterprise in rural areas has been carried out. The terms of reference for the review of enterprise support in rural areas are as follows: to identify and describe the availability of official support for enterprise, including tourism enterprise, in rural areas, that is, all areas excluding the greater Dublin area, the gateways and hubs, as defined in the national spatial strategy, and their areas of influence, and their structures of delivery, and to identify weaknesses or gaps, if any, in supports and-or their structures of delivery taking account of EU state aid law, the national spatial strategy and Exchequer financial constraints. In regard to the previous point, it will identify the likely effects of, and make recommendations on, designating areas as the only ones where official assistance will be provided for establishing certain services and industries, where such sectoral targeting does not exist.</P>
      <P>Arising from consideration of the above and previous points, it will recommend structures of delivery, focusing on the sub-regional level, including the number and role of agencies needed to optimise enterprise, including tourism enterprise, development in rural areas and avoid unnecessary duplication.</P>
      <P>For this purpose, regard should be had to the role and function of the Leader companies, county enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland, the Western Development Commission, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Fáilte Ireland, the regional tourism authorities and the amalgam of Bord Bia and Bord Glais. In so far as issues are already addressed under the terms of reference for the major tourism policy review currently under way, they do not form part of these terms of reference. I expect that this review will be completed by mid-December next.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred in his answer to duplication. Is the duplication involving the Western Development Commission, the Leader programme and county partnerships <Col N="1383" /> responsible for the underspending of the national development plan funding by &euro;634 million in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the under-spend, which is the subject of another question, was due to complex factors. Some of the organisations were held back by foot and mouth and we expect them to catch up. There is also the question of major infrastructural development, which is mainly NRA-led, a serious issue. The terms of reference of the report, however, are not all about structures &ndash; we are sometimes obsessed with structures rather than supports.</P>
      <P>Without pre-empting any report that might be prepared by the consultants, the issues are simple. Despite our best efforts, rural areas are not attracting the development we would like to see. There are many agencies &ndash; the Western Development Commission, Údarás na Gaeltachta and others &ndash; which have been given considerable sums to tackle this problem, with varying degrees of success, but there is still a haemorrhage into the big cities and towns. We are asking this group to analyse the best way to maximise for the existing spend ways to attract industry, enterprise, development and tourism into rural areas. We have asked the group to look at every aspect and not just to re-arrange the deck-chairs in terms of structures. That is why the terms of reference specifically mention targeting certain types of industry in certain areas &ndash; to achieve a critical mass in them, particularly if they are linked to a gateway town with a speciality and a university.</P>

      <P>The Minister recently asked Galway County Council to look at a number of towns within the county with a population greater than 1,500 to establish their capacity for decentralised projects. What does that signal for the decentralisation programme and about thinking within Government? Is there a clear view in Government about where decentralised projects will be based? Will the national spatial strategy be used as a basis for directing projects to towns?</P>
      <P>It was stated at the council that the Minister is looking at towns along the western corridor railway line. Does it make sense then to use the national spatial strategy to implement the decentralisation programme? The Minister for Transport referred previously to saving the corridor by building the critical mass in towns along it. This is an opportunity for the Government to decentralise Departments to towns identified under the national spatial strategy which are located along the corridor.</P>

Following that statement, I asked the Western Development Commission to bring the local authorities together to state clearly that towns along the corridor, from Ennis to Collooney, will be defined as growth nodes in their development plans. By doing so, we will create the circumstances that will make things happen. If a person wants something to happen, rather than just wishing for it, something concrete to make it happen must be done.</P>
    <P>In that context, I asked the commission to look at the possible intermesh that would result from re-opening the western rail corridor to link with the east-west rail corridors and the possible role it might play in creating a matrix on which decentralisation could be based. We all recognise there are certain requirements for decentralisation, such as accessibility. The Western Development Commission has been working on this and I hope to see its report within the next month.</P>
    <P>This report, however, will be different from previous reports because it will be cemented by action at local authority level where, if necessary, there will be material alterations to county plans to designate these towns as special towns for development. That should create the circumstances for growth and growth will make it easier to persuade planners that we need to open commuter railway lines in the west.</P>

      <P>In light of the most recent statistics from the CSO indicating that the deepest pockets of unemployment, the worst depopulation and the lowest levels of wealth distribution are all in the west, does the Minister consider that there has been a failure of resources or of existing structures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a failure of resources because urban areas receive more <i>per capita</i> in resources than rural areas under all headings. Unfortunately, some of the resources received by urban areas are to deal with disproportionate spending on justice measures because of the social problems that exist. We certainly have not, however, succeeded in tackling rural migration that leads to the sucking of the active, developing and entrepreneurial groups into urban areas and that is why I set up the enterprise review with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is about time we re-examined the area in the context of today's changing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the vast majority of the rural population completed only first level education 40 years ago, the idea of establishing manufacturing industry so they could work in that industry seemed sensible. Now, however, up to 70% of the rural population completes second or third level education and it is not so simple. Even if 500 industrial jobs are created in those areas, the best and brightest young people would not necessarily stay because they are looking for employment that is commensurate with their education. The task before us is <Col N="1385" /> more complex than it was in the past but there are creative new solutions involving transport, the clustering of industries in certain areas and encouraging those from rural areas with good qualifications to create industry rather than depending on foreign direct investment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs guarantee that he will make a difference for rural development in areas that do not have proper infrastructure? At the recent meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, I questioned the Northern Ireland Minister of State regarding the N2, the road from the fourth biggest city in this country, Derry, to Dublin. He advised me, in no uncertain terms, that the main emphasis of the Irish Government is on the M1 and the extension to Belfast as a priority. His comments frightened me. Is the Minister in a position at Cabinet to make a difference and make certain that the infrastructure that is needed, such as roads, railways or broadband, is provided?</P>
      <P>Small industry cannot exist in areas like counties Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, where there is no railway, if there is not proper alternative infrastructure. Deputy Keaveney said it takes her five and a half hours to come from her home in County Donegal to Dublin. Obviously, it takes a business person the same time. Infrastructure is, therefore, vital to these areas.</P>

      <P>I will not argue the details with Deputy Crawford. However, my understanding is that if one is going from Dublin to Carrickmacross, one goes up the M1 into Ardee on the link road and then to Carrickmacross. The preferred route from Ardee to Dublin now is the motorway.</P>
      <P>However, the issue for Deputy Crawford is how to get from Ardee to the Border. The Carrickmacross bypass has already been given the go-ahead and it has gone to construction phase. My memory may be faulty, but there is planning going ahead in Castleblayney and other towns. I agree with the Deputy it is important that the N2 from Ardee to the Border, and the following section across Northern Ireland, is completed as fast as possible.</P>

    <P>I am disappointed &ndash; I have made no bones about it &ndash; that the spend for the BMW region was not up to target for the first three years. I accept that the NRA has not delivered on the Government's targets. I have made strong representations to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, regarding this issue. The Government policy is the national development plan. The NRA is obligated under the NDP to follow Government policy. Target expenditure <Col N="1386" /> in the BMW region will have to be greatly accelerated to meet the targets in the remaining years of the NDP and to achieve the completion of the plan as outlined by Government within the timeframe of 2000 to 2006.</P>

      <P>The new strategy on western development is currently being drawn up by the western development commission. Can I take it from the directions given to the commission by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that there should be positive discrimination in favour of the towns in the seven counties that fall within its remit? Is it true that the programme should be concentrated in terms of the smaller towns that are not classed as gateway or hubs in the national spatial plan?</P>

      <P>A number of my colleagues have stated that there is no point in bringing decentralisation to towns that are already growing to their utmost capacity. It should be focused on areas that need decentralisation to give them the kick-start for growth. That has been made clear by myself and some of my colleagues. I fully support this move.</P>
      <P>We have to make hard and rational decisions to prioritise towns that fit certain criteria in terms of accessibility and so on. They also need the kick-start of development to get them growing. I discussed this matrix approach of criteria with the commission, so that they would see how it would fit in the western region. Their remit is for counties Donegal and Clare and the Connacht counties. The work they are doing could be a working example of how this could be developed throughout rural areas in the State, where the decentralisation programme should be directed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express a warm welcome for the unfolding events on this historic day for the people of Northern Ireland. I am sure everyone in the House will join me in expressing the hope that we have finally reached a point where the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement will take place. I repeat again my support, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, for the efforts of the Government in attempting to see this achieved. I commend the Taoiseach and his colleagues for their continuous efforts in bringing <Col N="1388" /> about the unfolding events of today. I hope they will be real and fruitful.</P>
      <P>The House will also be aware that Ireland's EU Presidency term begins in ten weeks. Deputies have expressed serious concern over the continuing deterioration in Ireland's competitiveness. A recent report on the world economy placed us 24th in the competitive category, falling from the 11th place we held last year. On the four major areas examined by the report &ndash; Government efficiency, economic performance, business efficiency and infrastructure &ndash; we fared poorly. For infrastructure, we were placed last. For inflation figures we were placed 25th out of 29.</P>
      <P>On 22 September, the EU Competitiveness Council met in Brussels, dealing with the internal EU market, industry and research. Looking at the attendance list, every EU state except Ireland was represented by a senior Minister. Ireland was represented by a deputy permanent representative. This is on the watch of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. Her Department has two Ministers of State, Deputies Fahey and Michael Ahern. From examining the list of public engagements on 22 September, there were none that were more important than this Council meeting. With the EU Presidency term beginning in ten week's time and with an issue central to our economic development in competitiveness, why were the Government and the Tánaiste's Department not represented at this important EU meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the comments Deputy Kenny made on the unfolding events in Northern Ireland. Like him, I hope this sets the scene for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and for only normal electoral politics to operate on the island of Ireland. The events of today are a staging post along this route. Subject to the agreement of the Whips, it is the intention of the Government to have a debate on the unfolding events, perhaps tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I was absent from the meeting of the Competitiveness Council because of a private family event, which had been in my diary for some time and I am sure everybody can understand that. I attend any meetings where decisions are made. While I have not been great at attending the informal councils over the years, I have attended them more recently because of our upcoming Presidency. Ireland was one of the drivers in seeking the creation of the Competitiveness Council to bring together the internal market, industry and research. Ireland has taken the lead in proposing suggestions to a high level group to make the council work more effectively so that the cross-cutting issues can be addressed and the council does not operate as three separate entities in one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months I have engaged with my colleagues in the applicant countries and from existing member states to determine how we can move the agenda forward during our Presidency. As the <Col N="1389" /> Deputy may be aware, while the Council has an important role to play, the decisions we make at home have an equally important part to play. Although we have slipped in some of the competitiveness measurements, the country still does remarkably well. For example, our foreign direct investment in 2002 was 19% higher than the previous year. Unemployment is still low at 4.4% and inflation is now down to 2.9%. As the general election stated &ldquo;A lot done, more to do.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that. I am delighted to see the Deputies are listening at least. In particular, we need to be far more innovative. We must make a greater effort to invest in research, development and technology, which we have sought to do through the establishment of the science foundation, etc. We are losing basic manufacturing jobs and this will continue. However, I hope that economic growth in the future will come through productivity growth, fuelled by innovation, which is the strategy that is in place.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputy Kenny that I will be at the two-day meeting of the Council in November. Yesterday I had a long meeting with the Commissioner with responsibility for research. I will be at as many meetings on these matters as I can physically attend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for her clarification. I have no wish to interfere with her agenda and if she had undertaken a personal commitment, I accept that. While I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, was away on official business, I do not see any evidence of public engagements for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. I would have thought that in a matter as important as this, Ireland should have been represented by a Minister of State at the very minimum. With due respect to the deputy permanent representative who attended on behalf of Ireland, the attendance record makes very poor reading. The Government should not leave deputy permanent representatives to deal with sensitive political issues like stem cell research, which was discussed at the meeting, or the strategy for competitiveness, which as Deputy Richard Bruton pointed out dealt with inflation, insurance costs and infrastructural costs. These are fundamental matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out the seriousness of this. Given that Ireland will assume the Presidency in ten weeks, this is a critical misjudgment by Government. We should be represented at the very highest level. If the Tánaiste was unable to <Col N="1390" /> attend, she should have made sure one of her junior Ministers did so. The world competitiveness report has indicated that we have slipped seriously in terms of inflation, insurance costs and infrastructure. It is a shame that it was left to a deputy permanent representative to handle the affairs of Government at such an important meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Since our entry into the EU, there have been many meetings at which we have been very ably represented by our officials. While clearly it is not good practice for this to be the case in all circumstances, sometimes it is unavoidable. There are a huge number of EU meetings. Ireland is the only country in the EU to have one Minister with responsibility for the different areas that come under the Competitiveness Council. Most other countries have separate Ministers for research, internal market matters and industry, which mean they have a larger pool from which to draw. However, I take the point and I am not arguing with Deputy Kenny. It is only in exceptional circumstances that we would not be represented by a Minister or a Minister of State at a Council meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Kenny in wishing the Government well in the events in Northern Ireland, which have not yet concluded. We look forward to having the opportunity at the earliest possible time to debate what has transpired when there is more clarity.</P>
      <P>I refer the Tánaiste to the tragic events in recent days in respect of the phenomenon known as &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo;. I refer in particular to the irresponsible and dangerous use of cars by young people and the tragic events in County Clare at the weekend where two young girls were killed in a car said to be more than 20 years old, which apparently had been purchased by the driver for &euro;150. In a separate development, court proceedings began yesterday in respect of the deaths of two gardaí who were killed while trying to protect the public from a stolen car on the Stillorgan Road.</P>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste recall that on two occasions in recent years, in April 2000 and April 2002, the Government parties voted down the Bill introduced in this House on behalf of the Labour Party by Deputy Broughan that would have at least dealt with some of the major aspects of this so-called joy-riding phenomenon? This Bill would have strengthened the law and in particular made it an offence &ldquo;to supply a vehicle to an under-age person in such circumstances as to give reasonable apprehension that that vehicle will be used by an under-age person in a public place.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Tánaiste now accept it was a mistake for the two Government parties on no less than two occasions to vote down Deputy Broughan's Bill? Whereas we can never be certain that the tragedy that happened at the weekend could have been averted, it is possible that it might have been. If the Labour Party now re-introduces that <Col N="1391" /> Bill, will the Government support it? If the Government refuses to support it, when will it introduce its own measures to tackle a phenomenon that haunts many communities in parts of this city and in parts of the country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my sympathy to the families of the individuals who lost their lives so tragically at the weekend in what the Deputy said is broadly called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo;. It is fair to say the Government would always be open to any legislative measures or any penalties that would prevent this happening. However, we would all acknowledge that no law in the world could stop many of the things we would all like to see prevented. I understand that the Garda authorities have indicated they have adequate legislative powers in this regard. There have been ongoing negotiations on the implementation of an EU directive on the return of what are called &ldquo;scrap cars&rdquo;. This is obviously a matter for the Minister for Transport.</P>
      <P>While I cannot recall when the Labour Party introduced its Bill, if it were the case that any law could prevent this from happening, that party would be pushing an open door as far as the Government is concerned. However, the issue is much more complex. It is a question perhaps of enforcing the current law before we go down the road of introducing new laws in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say that the Tánaiste seems to be out of touch with this phenomenon, which is a problem in the constituency she now represents and in the one she represented until recently. The Government voted down the Labour Party Bill in April 2000 and in April 2002. It is not a fact that there is adequate legislation. The acquisition of company cars by young people for &euro;100 or &euro;150 is a major cause of the problem. In this case the car, which was more than 20 years old, was acquired for &euro;150. Deputy Broughan's Bill would have dealt with this and would have made it an offence to sell that type of car to such a young person as well as dealing with a number of other matters.</P>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that the previous Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, promised to give effect by April 2002 to mandatory regulations to provide for the safe disposal of end-of-life vehicles? For some reason, although his commitment was that it would be signed into law in April 2002, this still has not happened.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Broughan re-enters the Bill, can we have agreement in the House that it will pass Second Stage to allow it to proceed to Committee Stage in order that we may address a phenomenon that scourges law-abiding citizens in many parts of this city and country&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have come from Mountjoy Prison. I visited some of the 11 ordinary working people incarcerated there and in Cloverhill for peaceful community protest against the brutal policy of the Government of threatening to leave uncollected the refuse bins of tens of thousands of householders and compliant taxpayers because of their boycott of the bin tax which they correctly believe they have paid through general and other taxation. Working men and women, fathers, mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers have been carted off to jail within days of peaceful community protests. They had no recourse except to protest in this way.</P>
      <P>It is six years since the massive tax evasion scam by the Ansbacher criminals came to light. Ansbacher man has never darkened the doorway of a courthouse let alone found himself behind prison walls. It is many years since councillors were revealed as being up to their necks in corruption with speculators. Not one has darkened the doorway of a courthouse on that account let alone been jailed for it. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners now says that the amount stolen from the tax fund by the largest tax evasion racket ever seen in the history of the State and probably of the European Union which was organised by some of the largest banks and financial institutions is moving towards &euro;1 billion. Not a single board member has been in front of a court let alone in jail for this monstrous theft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the nauseating double standards of the Government and of the economic, political and judicial establishment in the State cause the Tánaiste even the slightest embarrassment?

      <P>I thank the Chief Whip for providing a brief note on the meaning of these motions. Could that be followed with a simple paragraph as to whether or not the committee discussed these matters and, if so, what did it say about them? For instance, in the case of Simpson's Hospital which Deputy Rabbitte referred to as being for poor, decayed, blind and gouty men, the House does not know what the committee thought of this or what it said in discussion. There is nothing in the Chief Whip's note to that effect. I thank the Chief Whip for providing Opposition Deputies with these explanatory notations but I request that she follows that with a simple paragraph as to the committee's opinion of the referral.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today requires the House to take Nos. 17 to 21, inclusive, in one block and they are very different. There was a discussion earlier about Dáil reform and certainly this is badly in need of reform. There is no connection between Nos. 17 and 18. As Deputy Kenny said, No. 18 is about blind, gouty, decayed and poor men, and now includes women as well. No. 17 is about the non-contractual obligations of Rome II, back from committee. They bear no relationship to each other and the House is being asked to take them together.</P>
      <P>In the same breath, the House is being asked to take three other motions of referral to committee. There might be some sense in grouping together the referring of some matters to committee but for the House to make decisions on them together when they come back from committee makes a nonsense of the whole procedure.</P>
      <P>We discussed this at the Whips' meeting and I understood that there would be a short report from the committee to the Dáil on foot of the discussion that had taken place and the decision made by the committee. It is quite extraordinary that the House is now being asked to take these motions together without any report being available. That is not what we were told would occur.</P>

      <P>On the Deputy's first question about taking the proposals together, a proposal grouping one or more items of business in one proposal is in order when the proposed arrangement to be followed is the same for all items. The proposal in this case is that the House takes all items without debate. The items can be voted on separately when put before the House after the Order of Business. It should be borne in mind that a proposal on the Order of Business is a narrow procedural motion making arrangements for debate and nothing else. The proposal is a motion put forward by Government and is in accordance with precedent.</P>

If a party wishes to oppose one of these items that have been grouped together, is the Ceann Comhairle ruling that the party must vote to oppose that without having the opportunity to <Col N="1398" /> express to our colleagues whose support we seek in that vote our reason for taking that position? I can see that no parliamentary approach to proper responsible debating would agree to such an order. If we want to oppose one of these items, we should have a brief opportunity to express our view. The bundling together of these items is a deliberate attempt by the Government to prevent such opportunities.</P>

While I do not have the latest information on what is happening regarding Northern Ireland business, can I take it that we will be in a position to have a full debate on it in the House? Depending on the circumstances as they unfold, I hope that everybody will be able to speak in a positive manner about the holding of elections on 26 November and the possibility of the heralding of a new dawn for the entire island.

      <P>I asked the Tánaiste some two weeks ago about planning legislation arising from the Taoiseach's comments in Sligo on one-off rural housing. She indicated that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is preparing a new planning Bill. When I subsequently asked the Taoiseach about the same issue, he informed me that there was a separate Bill to deal with the promised infrastructure board, from which I gathered that there are two items of legislation being prepared by Government, a planning Bill and a Bill dealing with the infrastructure board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about this, he informed me that a Bill is due in regard to the infrastructure board and no legislation is envisaged to deal with one-off rural housing.

      <P>On Committee Stage I asked the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources if he could indicate the number of international maritime safety conventions which had yet to be approved by the House. It seems to Opposition Members that the list is long. As the Ceann Comhairle will know, the Bill before us seeks to legislate for increased amounts of liability cover in respect of oil pollution but there are a number of other important conventions to which the Minister referred on Second Stage. These include the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems of Ships, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage and, in particular, Annex 6 of the International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, MARPOL 73/78. The Minister told the select committee that the conventions were incorporated in the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003, of which this legislation was supposed to be a part.</P>
      <P>While I understand the urgent need to meet the 1 November deadline, it seems the Minister is adopting a risky position by lethargically failing to legislate as soon as possible in respect of the conventions I have outlined. I hope he is not. It would probably have been better for the House if he had brought forward a full Bill during this session. What is the position on what appears to be a very long list of international conventions on marine safety and pollution which we have not yet ratified? They have a critical influence on our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister referred to the European Maritime Safety Agency which has just been established. While he is bringing proposals to Cabinet in relation to our arrangements in this area, is the agency something for which we will <Col N="1408" /> also have to legislate? This is a vast Department with a very important remit for crucial national resources both on land and at sea, which must be a key element in the Minister's thinking. Perhaps he will clarify the first point I made on this fairly non-controversial Bill which needs to be passed this week and then signed into law.</P>
    <P>Regarding the definition section, could the Bill have been used, as the Labour Party believes, to have made some progress on the single hull issue? The Minister referred to sensitive sea areas, the PSSAs, to which he has given some attention and about which there have been extensive discussions at IMO level between Ireland and a number of other countries. Given his comments on Second and Committee and Stages, I am not clear if the 48-hour notice rule, which Ireland and a number of other countries are putting forward, will apply to single hulled vessels of fuel oil traversing our waters. Will these old 1970s ships, which have caused disaster after disaster, be consigned at long last to history? I was referring to the Oil Pollution (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Act 1998 and section 3 of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act 1988 where there is a definition of ships. Will the Minister clarify whether he can take steps under this legislation to try to deal with some of the concerns raised on Second and Committee Stages?</P>
    <P>The amendment before us is very simple. I asked the Minister on Second Stage if the Attorney General's office keeps a handbook to help Government Ministers and their staff to frame legislation. This would be helpful to the Labour Party when seeking to amend legislation. If such a handbook exists for the drafting of regulations or Bills, perhaps he would let the Opposition have a copy of either or both, which would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to delete lines 14 to 32 in page 7 and substitute a textual amendment of the European Communities (Civil and Commercial Judgments) Regulations 2002 as follows:</P>
    <P>29A.&ndash;The European Communities (Civil and Commercial Judgments) Regulations 2002 are hereby amended by the insertion of the following regulation after regulation 3&ndash;</P>
    <P>'3A.&ndash;(1) Paragraph (2) shall apply only to a Judgment of a Member State in relation to the Supplementary Fund (within the meaning of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act 1988).</P>
    <P>(2) The Brussels I Regulation and these Regulations apply in respect of a Judgment of a Member State other than a court or tribunal of a territory of a Member State to which the Brussels I Regulation does not apply.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What the Labour Party proposes to do is to improve the drafting of the Bill. We understand that the Attorney General's office decided recently to make just textual amendments rather <Col N="1409" /> than non-textual amendments, which are more difficult to understand. We have tried to directly amend the regulation rather than simply refer to it. The Minister said on Second Stage that he is not prepared to accept this but we believe it is better drafting practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments and for tabling the amendment. As I said on Committee Stage, I cannot accept the amendment on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for allowing us the opportunity to introduce the Bill earlier than anticipated because of the 1 November deadline. The other conventions to which the Deputy referred will be included in the miscellaneous provisions Bill which is being taken in the Seanad on Thursday. We are not aware of any other conventions that must be put in place by way of regulation or primary legislation.</P>
      <P>As regards the European Maritime Safety Agency, we are represented on that agency by an assistant secretary from my Department. We are fully active in that regard. On the booklet regarding preparation of regulations, if my memory serves me correctly, my assistant secretary informed me on Committee Stage that a booklet is available, which will be made available to the Deputy. Perhaps the Deputy will come back to me if he does not receive the booklet.</P>
      <P>Given that the amendment is fairly complicated, I will explain why I do not intend to accept it. Section 11 inserts a new Part 4A in the 1988 Act. Part IV (sections 25 to 29) deals with the recognition and enforcement of judgments in accordance with Article 8 of the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1992. The text of section 25 extends these provisions to the recently adopted supplementary fund, to which I referred on Committee Stage, without the need for amendment. Article 8, paragraph 2 of the supplementary fund protocol provides for the application of other rules provided their effect is to ensure that judgments are recognised and enforced at least to the same extent.</P>
      <P>This provision was included at the request of the European Commission in light of Regulation 44/2001EC on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters which was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 22 December 2000 and came into force on 1 March 2002. The regulation is binding on all EU member states with the exception of Denmark. Regulation 44/2001 was adopted following the conclusions of the 1999 meeting of the European Council in Tampere and the Council programme of measures for the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" />Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty of the European Union and the treaty establishing the European Community, is not bound by this regulation nor subject to its application. S.I. No. 52 of 2002 gives effect to 44/2001/EC in this State. Part 4A provides for SI 52/2002 to apply in respect of EU member states other than Denmark.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Broughan provides for the text of SI 52/2002 to be amended. As I advised on Committee Stage, I am satisfied that the text of section 11 now before us is adequate to ensure compliance with the regulation as far as the supplementary fund protocol is concerned, that is, that it is totally unnecessary to amend SI 52 of 2002. In the circumstances I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of things I wish to say about the legislation. In regard to drafting, our legal advice is that it is well drafted for the purpose it seeks to achieve. For that reason no technical amendments have been tabled by my party. Whereas we had some reservations regarding the pace at which this legislation has gone through both Houses and is now being finalised, its content appears sound.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Broughan on the issues he raised in regard to single hulled tankers and the creation of special areas of protection at sea, out of which I hope we can keep single hulled tankers. In other words, as tankers pass by the Irish coastline and the European coastline the intention is to keep them a certain distance off shore in the event of accidents. Ireland should lead the debate rather than go along with other European countries which are proposing change. Ireland is, perhaps, more vulnerable than any other European country given that it has 11% of European waters, is on the western periphery of Europe and many foreign oil tankers travel through its waters on a daily and weekly basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said he intends to amalgamate the maritime safety directorate and the Irish Coast Guard. Is it his intention that the new marine safety agency will assume responsibility for managing a crisis in the event of a serious oil spillage or a tanker becoming involved in an accident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of our capacity to know at all times the number of ships and oil tankers passing through Irish waterways, has the Minister plans to increase aerial surveillance through our air force or satellite surveillance of Irish waters? Ireland is required to survey about 140,000 square <Col N="1411" /> miles at all times. Apart from that I am pleased the legislation will be passed before the 1 November deadline. This is important legislation for an island that is vulnerable to an oil spillage or an accident at sea. In recent years other European countries have suffered the consequences of, for example, the <i>Prestige</i> in Spain and accidents in the Bay of Biscay. I am pleased the levels of compensation have been increased by 50% by the international fund, the supplementary fund and the insured boat owners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and am happy to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo many of the comments of my colleague. I thank the staff of the Department and the Minister for the briefing. It was unfortunate last week that Committee Stage of the Bill clashed with the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which debated the important issue of mobile phones. While we have a good deal of territory to cover in this portfolio, we are just the hurlers on the ditch. Obviously it would have been beneficial if we could have been in two places at the one time last week but that was not possible and we had to be in the House.</P>
      <P>I commend the general principle of the Bill. It is another development in this area. I hope the other oil pollution Bill, to which the Minister referred, will be published as soon as possible to enable us move forward another stage in regard to the protection of our coastline. Clearly, as an island nation, the primary responsibility rests with us. We should take an increasingly hard line on this in regard to mariners, shipping companies and so on who use our waters. I commend the Minister on the 25% port inspection rate which he has increased greatly during the past year or 18 months under the Paris memorandum. However, much work remains to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on the 48 hour notice required for particularly sensitive sea areas? Will that happen in the near future or is there any way in which the Government can make it happen? Under this Bill, liability refers to ships. Clearly, single hulled ships are covered as are the desirable double hulled ships. Maritime safety is critical for the economy and the nation. In the Dublin region we consider that the closure of the Dublin Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre would be a backward step. It has been compared to the moving of Air Traffic Control from Dublin Airport to Shannon or Galway. I fought here for the three maritime marine rescue co-ordination centres &ndash; the three radio centres &ndash; at Valentia, Malin and Dublin, to remain in existence. I hope the Minister will reconsider that matter given the critical importance of maritime safety on the busy Irish Sea, where 80,000 to 100,000 people may be traversing it and, perhaps, five or six major ships, carrying fuel oil and other toxic cargoes, may be moving up and down. It is <Col N="1412" /> important the marine rescue co-ordination centre remains.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill. I hope that the full maritime safety Bill, which will deal with dangerous cargoes, will come before the House as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good in our limited role as substitutes on the side of the pitch to be able to help the Minister out of his trouble. I said on Second Stage that the Minister arrives regularly with the homework done at the last minute on Sunday night. It was nice to be able to get it through in that case. It is regrettable it was not possible to combine the various Bills in one simple Bill. Given the support which he sees from the Opposition, where there are sensible improvements in terms of environmental protection in particular, Members are willing to facilitate rapid passage of the Bill. If we have learned anything from this, I hope it is that we will move towards more consolidated Bills rather than taking one Bill after another. It would save the time of this House, would lead to better debate and, I imagine, would order the work of the Minister's Department in a better way. That is one lesson from the passage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>While I do not think the Minister heard my speech on Second Stage, I was interested in what he said on the possible designation of special areas of waters to the north and west of Ireland but it was slightly unclear as to the likelihood of change. I understood the International Maritime Organisation, the IMO, had ruled this out but the Minister made it look as if it was being reconsidered, given that various countries had put together a joint proposal for the north-west Atlantic. I am keen to hear whether this is something we think can be progressed. If so, we should use every effort to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the issue of the financial consequences on several occasions. On the potential financial consequences of a maritime disaster, we are talking of figures of &euro;500 million-&euro;700 million in com<Col N="1413" /> pensation or as an insurance fund. Will the Minister consider bringing these facts to the land-locked Minister for Finance in County Kildare to press on him the importance for us to provide proper resources in respect of maritime safety, in particular, the provision of a proper maritime tug for the west coast? This is important. When we look at the potential costs of a maritime accident, the cost of a tug increasingly justifies itself, even to a Minister for Finance reluctant to invest in this area.</P>
    <P>This need extends further given the recent evidence in respect of two US Navy merchant vessels approaching the south-west to be scrapped in Hartlepool. I imagine they are approaching ever closer every day. The Minister's response is that we have contracted tugs from the European mainland in the event of an emergency. This impresses on me that we have not made proper provision for maritime safety or protecting the west, north and south coasts. I encourage the Minister to use the figures from the Bill which show what the international community says is the likely cost of a maritime accident. We should do whatever we can to try to prevent such accidents.</P>
    <P>I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say about special areas of conservation. We look forward to his early substitution.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for allowing me to get the Bill through. It is important because the deadline is 1 November by which date we need to have the legis<Col N="1414" /> lation passed. I agree that it would have been preferable to try to bring forward three Bills in one but the Attorney General's office had a different view. Because of the deadline, we had to take this Bill on its own but the debate on the miscellaneous provisions Bill will start in the Seanad next Thursday.</P>
      <P>We have been leading the charge with regard to changes at EU level, particularly in the aftermath of the <i>Prestige</i> disaster. As I said on Committee Stage, it is easy for us to do this because we do not own any single hull oil tankers. It is more difficult for countries like Greece which, because it includes 3,000 islands, has difficult decisions to make with regard to the transportation of oil from island to island. On the banning of single hull vessels, with Spain, France and Portugal, we were the prime movers in the bringing forward of the deadline which was 2015 but is now 2008. As of this year, the phasing out of such tankers has commenced.</P>
      <P>On the issue of PSSAs, sensitive areas around the seas, Ireland was to the fore in moving that this should be mooted by a number of EU countries at IMO level. The IMO has agreed, in principle, to examine the issue. With five other countries, we are putting the case in which I hope we will be successful.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of tracking, of which there is a limited amount. However, under a new EU ship tracking directive, which we are to bring forward by February, there will be much greater monitoring of ships entering and leaving EU waters.</P>
      <P>On the issue of port state control, as Deputy Broughan said, over a year ago our percentage was low. Today, at over 30%, it is one of the highest in the European Union. The reason for this is that we took on nine or ten extra marine surveyors. Our record is good. I hope it will continue to be so.</P>
      <P>The <i>Princess Eva</i> was successfully dealt with and used at EU level as an example to other countries of how to deal with this type of crisis &ndash; immediately and in a co-ordinated way. I thank the Irish Coast Guard and the marine safety directorate for the work they did. While the crisis was not hugely publicised, it was a huge logistical issue to put right. I add a word of caution. The ship was examined a fortnight earlier as part of port state control procedures in a port in the European Union. It left port and got into difficulty in the Atlantic. On the proposal for the amalgamation of the maritime safety directorate and the Irish Coast Guard, I believe they should be co-ordinated into one body which will be responsible for managing any disasters that may happen, as instanced by Deputy Coveney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the proposal for the establishment of coastguard monitoring stations, I have visited Valentia and I am more than happy that the service is capable of dealing with the situation. My information is that the service in Malin is also capable. A couple of weeks ago, because of an asbestos problem in Dublin, staff had to move to Valentia. Moni<Col N="1415" /> toring of the coastline was undertaken in both Valentia and Malin without a problem. It is not a matter of saving money. The money will be reinvested in the service. I am assured by the officials involved that there will be no difficulties in co-ordination. I would not like Deputies to suggest that any air-sea, or coastal rescue service will be reduced because of this. That is not the case.</P>

      <P>Massive investment has taken place in the Coast Guard and maritime safety over the last six years. When I did the Estimates last year, I decided this area would not take a cut in funding because it is one in which we must continually invest to ensure safety. In the past we had to rely on the British for rescue services around our coast but now they rely on us. Our service is second to none in Europe. We have been well served by the investment which will continue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the positive comments of Deputies about the Bill. I hope when it is passed, we can move on to deal with the other issues which will be addressed in the miscellaneous provisions Bill.</P>

      <P>Tá ríméad orm an díospóireacht seo a oscailt sa Dáil inniu ar an Dara Céim den Bhille seo. Tugann Bille an Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 2003 deis dúinn díriú isteach ar chursaí a bhaineann lenár n-oileáin amach ón gcósta. Dar ndóigh beidh deis ag na Teachtaí a gcuid tuairimí a chur in iúl faoin reachtaíocht ar ball beag agus tá mé ag tnúth go mór le cloisteáil uathu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I measc na spriocanna atá leagtha amach i ráiteas straitéise na Roinne Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuai<Col N="1416" /> the agus Gaeltachta tá ceann ar leith a bhaineann le forbairt tuaithe, Gaeltachta agus oileán, sin é, chun cúnamh a thabhairt chun pobail inmharthana agus bheo a chothú sna háiteanna sin. Ba mhaith liom cúpla rud a rá faoin sprioc thábhachtach seo go ginearálta roimh dhíriú isteach ar fhorálacha sonracha an Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Is fiú a mheabhrú don Teach go bhfuil os cionn 40% de dhaonra na hÉireann, sin é, thart ar 1.5 milliún duine, ina gcónaí i gceantair tuaithe. Ceapaim go bhfuil tuiscint mhaith ann anois, go háirithe ag éirí as an obair ar fad a rinneadh i ndáil leis an straitéis spásúil náisiúnta, ar na hathruithe móra ata tarlaithe cheana féin agus atá fós ag tarlú sna ceantair seo. Airím anseo an ghluaiseacht daonra idir dhaoine áitiúla ag bogadh i dtreo na gcathracha agus a mhalairt treo, an fheirmeoireacht ag dul i léig, riachtanais agus rialacha nua i gcursaí pleanála agus comhshaoil ach go háirithe, easpa áiseanna agus infrastuchtúir agus rudaí eile. D'aithin an Rialtas a riachtanaí agus até sé go gcuirfí cur chuige straitéiseach i bhfeidhm a bheadh dírithe ar phobail a chónaíonn i gceantair tuaithe. Ba mar gheall air sin a tugadh an cúram d'fhorbairt tuaithe don Roinn nua Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta. Is é an dushlán atá os cómhair mo Roinne ná polasaithe a aimsiú a thugann aghaidh ar na hathruithe atá ag tarlú sna pobail tuaithe, tacaíocht a thabhairt dá bhforbairt agus cothromaíocht réigiúnach níos fearr a chur chun cinn.</P>

Tá CLÁR ag diriú isteach ar na ceantair tuaithe faoi mhíbhuntáiste is mó a d'fhulaing titim sa daonra idir 1926 agus 1996, meántitim de 50%. Sa bhliain 2002 ghnóthaigh daonra iomlán de 284,000 buntáiste caiteachais de thart ar &euro;14 mhillliún a caitheadh ar thacaíocht don bhonneagar fisiciúil, pobail agus sóisialta faoin gciste CLÁR. Dar ndóigh, tagann cuid mhaith de na hoileáin mhara faoin gclár seo freisin, mar shampla: Árainn Mhór ó thuaidh; Inis Bó Finne, Cliara, agus Inis Tuirc san iarthar; chomh maith le Béara agus Cléire ó dheas.</P>
    <P>Is í bunaidhm pholasaí na Roinne i ndáil leis na hoileáin ná forbairt inmharthana na n-oileán mhara sin a bhfuil daoine ina gcónai orthu a chur chun cinn agus iarracht a dhéanamh leibhéil shasúla seirbhíse a sholáthar do na hoileánaigh. Is feidir an bhunaidhm pholasaí seo a sháiniú i dtrí chuspóir straitéiseacha mar seo a leanas: fáil isteach shásúil ar chóras iompair i rith na bliana ar fad do phobail oileán a éascú; pobail na n-oileán a spreagadh chun eagraíochtaí ionadaíocha a bhunú a oibreoidh le Ranna Rialtais, le háisíneachtaí Stáit agus le húdaráis áitiúla chun bonneagar, tionscal, talmhaíocht, iascach, turasóireacht agus araile, na n-oileán a fhorbairt; agus polasaithe Rialtais maidir leis na hoileáin a chur chun cinn agus a chomhordú.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" />Tá mé thar a bheith bródúil as an méid atá bainte amach do na hoileáin le blianta beaga anuas. An chéad chéim a tógadh, ná bunú an choiste idir-ranna comhordaithe um fhorbairt oileán i 1993 chun athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar straitéisí forbartha do na hoileáin agus na tosaíochtaí sin a mheas. Cuireadh an tuarascáil fhoirmiúil ar fáil i 1996. Ba é an chéim ba shuntasaí ná freagracht shonrach i leith na n-oileán a bhronnadh ar an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán a bunaíodh i 1997. Is cúis áthais dom gur thit na dualgaisí seo ormsa ag an am mar Aire Stáit ag an Roinn sin go dtí 2001 agus arís anuraidh nuair a ceapadh mé mar Aire ag an Roinn Gnóthai Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá sé rí-shoiléir go bhfuil lán-tacaíocht tugtha ag an Rialtas seo agus an Rialtas a d'imigh roimhe do chaighdeán saoil na n-oileánach a fheabhsú. Tá an soláthar i leith fhorbairt na n-oileán méadaithe ó faoi bhun &euro;2.5 milliún sa bhliain 1997 go dtí beagnach &euro;8.5 milliún i mbliana, sin é, &euro;6.12 milliún i leith thograí caipitil agus &euro;2.35 milliún i leith thograi reatha. Tá infheistíocht mhór déanta in infrastruchtúr na n-oileán chomh maith le seirbhísí le seacht mbliana anuas. Ina measc tá iompar farantóireachta agus aeir, céibheanna, bóithre, soláthar leictreachais agus uisce, sláinte agus oideachas.</P>
    <P>Gan aon dabht is í rochtain shábhailte an tosaíocht is mó a bhaineann le hinmharthanacht phobail na n-oileán. Tá feabhas íontach tagtha ar na seirbhísí farantóireachta ó 1997 &ndash; faoi lathair tá 14 seirbhís á maoiniú le hais cúig cinn i 1997. Is fiú a lua chomh maith go bhfuil seirbhísí aeir á maoiniú go dtí na hOileáin Árann chomh maith le seirbhís ingearáin do Thoraigh i rith an gheimhridh. Rinne Ollscoil Cranfield staidéar ar leith ar sheirbhísí aeir chuig na hoileáin i 2001 agus tá na moltaí sin fós á meas ag mo Roinn. Cheana féin, tá dul chun cinn sásúil á dhéanamh chun aerstraicí a chur ar fáil ar Inis Bó Finne agus ar Oileán Thoraí mar atá geallta i gclár an Rialtais. Ceapadh comhairleoirí le gairid chun staidéar a dhéanamh ar na seirbhísí farantóireachta agus ar an infrastruchtúr atá riachtanach ina leith. Táthar ag súil leis an tuarascáil sin go luath.</P>
    <P>Tá infheistíocht ollmhór déanta i gcéibheanna oileánda le cúpla bliain anuas. Mar shampla, tá níos mó na &euro;1 milliun caite ar chéibh an Leab Gharbh in Árainn Mhór, &euro;2.4 mhilliún caite ar chéibh Mhachaire Rabhartaigh le freastal ar Thoraigh agus ar Inis Bó Finne agus &euro;1.75 milliún ceadaithe do chéibh Rú an Átha le freastal ar Oileán Cliara agus Inis Tuirc. Tá forbairtí móra beartaithe do na céibheanna ar Oileán Cliara agus Inis Tuirc iad féin, a chosnóidh tuairim is &euro;10 milliún agus tá pleanáil maidir le mórfhorbairt na gcéibheanna ar na hoileáin Árann ar siúl chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Is é dúshlán mór eile do mo Roinn na deiseanna fostaíochta inmharthana a chur ar bun ar na hoileáin. Caithfear a admháil go bhfuil na hoileáin Ghaeltachta ag fáil seirbhíse maithe ó Údaras na Gaeltachta a d'fhógair scéim nua fiontair le gairid do na hoileáin seo. Faoin scéim seo, <Col N="1418" /> anuas ar na gnáthdeontais caipitil agus fostaíochta, beidh deontais eile suas go dtí &euro;90,000, nó 80% de na costais bhreise a bhaineann le gnó a bhunú ar oileán, ar fáil faoin scéim de Minimis. Tá sé inmholta go mbeadh aitheantas den saghas sin tugtha do na hoileáin taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a thagann faoi churam na Roinne Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta. Le tamall anuas tá mo Roinn-se ag breathnú ar na féidearthachtaí atá ann ciste fiontair a bhunú do na hoileáin seo i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta.</P>
    <P>Is cuid dílis d'oidhreacht an Stáit iad ár n-oileain mhara agus cé go bhfuil go leor déanta le blianta beaga anuas, aithním an gá atá ann le feabhsúcháin bhreise ar rochtain, seirbhísí agus bonneagar chun caighdean maireachtála na n-oileanach a chothú agus a fheabhsú. Tá sé mar aidhm agam a chinntiú go leanfar ar aghaidh le hinfheistíocht fhiúntach i bhforbairt na n-oileán sna blianta amach rómhainn.</P>
    <P>Beidh Uachtarántacht an Aontais Eorpaigh ag Éirinn sa chéad sé mhí de 2004. Is cúis mhór sásaimh dom a chur in iúl go mbeidh comhdháil á heagrú ag mo Roinn-se, mar chuid den Uachtarántacht, i gContae na Gaillimhe ón 19 &ndash; 21 Bealtaine 2004 a mbeidh toscaireacht ó bhallstáit an Aontais mhéadaithe ann. Beidh na riachtanais eacnamaíochta agus sóisialta d'oileáin an Aontais Eorpaigh, go háirithe i gcomhthéacs struchtúir agus maoinithe tar éis 2006, mar théama lárnach den chomhdháil thábhachtach seo.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom anois aghaidh a thabhairt ar an reachtaíocht atá ós ár gcomhair inniu ag miniú na n-aidhmeanna ar dtús agus an téacs, de reir ailt, ina dhiaidh sin.</P>
    <P>Bille gairid, sé alt, atá ann a bhfuil trí aidhm aige: foráil a dhéanamh i leith cumhachtaí nua i ndáil le seirbhísí paisinéirí bus a chur ar fáil mar chuid de chonarthaí farantóireachta nó aeir áirithe; foráil a dhéanamh i leith cumhachtaí breise a bhaineann le haerstráicí a chur ar bun ar na hoileáin; agus daingniú a dhéanamh ar na cumhachtaí reachtúla reatha atá ag an Aire i ndáil le seirbhísí iompair go dti na hoileáin.</P>
    <P>Tá an chumhacht maidir le seirbhísí paisinéiri bus ag teastáil ar bhonn siarghabhálach chun fadhb <i>ultra vires </i>a d'aimsigh Oifig an Phríomh-Aturnae Stáit a leigheas agus a rinneadh plé air le gairid ag an gCoiste um Chuntais Phoiblí.</P>
    <P>Tá i gceist díriú ar an ghné seo i gcomhthéacs Bhille an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) (Leasu) 2001, nár achtaíodh. Go bunúsach tá an cumhacht seo ag teastáil sna cuinsí go bhfuil riachtanas ann paisinéirí a thabhairt ar aghaidh idir an phointe tuirlingthe-fágála ar an mórthír agus an t-ionad daonra is giorra.</P>
    <P>Sampla den chineál riachtanas seo is ea an conradh farantóireachta ó Inis Bó Finne. Tagann an bád i dtír ag céibh an Chloiginn agus bíonn seirbhís bus ceangailte leis an gconradh chun na gasúir scoile ón oileán a thabhairt ar aghaidh go dtí an scoil i dTuam nó i Mainistir na Coille Móire. Sampla eile is ea an tseirbhís bus go Gail<Col N="1419" /> limh a cuirtear ar fáil do phobail Oileáin Árann nuair a thagann siad i dtír ag Ros an Mhíl. I láthair na huaire tá riachtanas mar seo i gcás ceithre cinn as 14 conradh farantóireachta chomh maith le conradh aeir amháin.</P>
    <P>Feidhmeoidh an dara cumhacht maidir le haerstráicí ar na hoileáin mar chreatlach reachtúil faoina bhféadfaí forbairt a dhéanamh ar sheirbhísí iompar aeir go dtí na hoileáin amach anseo, ach cead an Aire Airgeadais agus an Aire lompair a fháil. Bhí an chumhacht cuimsithe seo san áireamh chomh maith i mBille an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) (Leasú) 2001, nár achtaíodh sa deireadh agus tá sé á lorg anois i gcomhthéacs gealltanas i gclár aontaithe an Rialtais maidir le haersheirbhísí a chur ar fáil go dtí na hoileáin.</P>
    <P>I gcomhthéacs na reachtaíochta atá molta, ceaptar go bhfuil sé iomchuí daingniú a dhéanamh ar na cumhachtaí reachtúla reatha. Faoi láthair, tá cumhacht ag an Aire foirdheontais a íoc i leith seirbhísí farantóireachta faoin Acht lompair Oileáin Árann 1946 agus Acht an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 1998. Tá i gceist na forálacha seo a aisghairm agus iad a thabhairt isteach arís sa reachtaíocht nua.</P>
    <P>Ag díriú isteach ar théacs an Bhille anois, is foráil chaighdeánach í an fhoráil léiritheach atá in alt 1. Leagtar amach ann na sainmhínithe atá in úsáid sa reachtaíocht. Mar shampla, ciallaíonn &ldquo;oileán&rdquo; oileán árithe de chuid an Stáit. Maidir le &ldquo;comhsheirbhís paisinéirí bus agus oileáin&rdquo;, a leagtar síos an bhrí in alt 2, go bunusach séard atá i gceist ná seirbhís bus do phaisinéirí a cuirtear ar fáil mar chuid de chonradh farantóireachta nó aeir idir oileáin áirithe agus an mhórthír.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 2 le cumhachtaí an Aire i ndáil le seirbhísí iompair a sholáthar le haghaidh oileán. Féadfaidh an tAire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, foirdheontais a íoc le haghaidh oibriú seirbhísí farantóireachta, mar a foráladh cheana faoi Acht Iompair Oileán Árann 1946 agus Acht an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 1998.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin, féadfaidh an tAire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais agus an Aire Iompair foirdheontais a íoc i ndáil le seirbhísí paisinéirí bus agus oileáin mar chuid de chonarthaí farantóireachta/aeir áirithe. Déanfar na cinn scríbe dóibh siúd a leagan amach i rialacháin. Tá an chumhacht á bronnadh gan dochar do bhailíocht foirdheontais a íocadh roimhe i ndáil leis seo. Tugann alt 3 cumhachtaí don Aire i ndáil le haeradróim a sholáthar i dtaca le haerseirbhísí a chur ar fáil idir na hoileáin agus an mhórthír. Sa chomhthéacs sin, féadfaidh an tAire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais agus an Aire Iompair, talamh a fháil, trí aontú nó go héigeantach, chun aeradróim agus saoráidi gaolmhara a thógail, a fheabhsú, a leathnú nó a fhorbairt ar na hoileáin nó ar an mórthír mar amhlaidh. Áirítear chun na críocha seo aon aeradróm atá ann cheana. Tá for<Col N="1420" /> áil ann freisin i leith maoiniú a dhéanamh ar na gnéithe seo.</P>
    <P>Leagtar amach in alt 3 na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint sa chás gur gá ceannach éigeantach, lena n-áirítear forálacha caighdeánacha maidir le fógra roimh ré, pleananna a thaispeáint, fógra chuig daoine leasmhara, fiosrúchán poiblí, cúiteamh, eadráin agus mar sin de. Tá foráil san alt seo freisin maidir le cumhacht an Aire i ndáil le bainistiú agus oibriú aeradróm den sort sin nó, má úsáidtear é le hordú arna dhéanamh ag an Aire le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais agus an Aire Iompair, i ndáil leis an bhfeidhm sin a bhronnadh ar eagras reachtúil, mar shampla, chuig údarás áitiúil nó chuig cuideachta a fhaigheann maoiniú nó cuidiú ón Státchiste.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 4 maidir le haisghairm Acht Iompair Oileán Arann 1946 agus alt 4 d'Acht an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta; Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 1998, gan dochar do chonarthaí a bhí nó atá i bhfeidhm agus a rinneadh faoin reachtaíocht sin. Leagtar amach in alt 5 go n-íocfar caiteachas a bhaineann le riaradh an Achta ó thaobh an Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta nó an Aire Lompair nó an Aire Airgeadais as an Státchiste ach cead an Aire Airgeadais a fháil mar is cuí. Is foráil chaighdeánach eile atá in alt 6 ina leagtar amach gearrtheideal an Bhille.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Is rud maith é go bhuil an díospóireacht seo ag tosnú anocht. Tuigim a bhfuil ráite ag an Aire ach beidh ceisteanna á gcur agam air i rith an díospóireachta. Is rud tábhachtach é go mbeadh caighdeán maith maireachtála ag na daoine atá ag maireachtaint ar oileáin na hÉireann, a mhórmhór in iarthar na hÉireann, agus go bhféadfaidís teacht amach go dtí an mórthír am ar bith a theastaíonn sin uathu. Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil an dualgas glactha ag an Aire agus ag an Stát seirbhísí a sholáthar dos na daoine sin.</P>
      <P>Cuideoidh an Bille chun seirbhísí níos fearr a chur ar fáil. Dúirt an tAire gurb í bunaidhm pholasí na Roinne iarracht a dhéanamh leibhéal sásúil seirbhíse a sholáthar dos na hoileánaigh. Tá sin mar bhunús ag an Bhille.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states: &ldquo;the purpose of the Bill is to consolidate the existing legislative powers of the Minister&rdquo;, but the Bill is not called a consolidation Bill. If its sole purpose is to consolidate legislation why does it not say so? I understand there is a retrospective part in this Bill but it is not clearly referred to in the explanatory memorandum, or maybe I am missing it if it is. It says that there are no direct financial implications arising from the legislation. Will the Minister clarify that? If one makes legislation retrospective surely it is because the State may be exposed to an action or a process. The Minister has indicated that is not the case, and I have to accept that. Perhaps he will explain why it has to <Col N="1421" /> be retrospective if there are no financial or legal issues involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play in his speech about how good a Minister he is and how wonderful are all the organisations he has set up, and there is no doubt about that. Nevertheless, under the Government there has been an inefficient and expensive service to the islands, particularly the Aran Islands. The Minister may shake his head at me but he cannot shake his head at the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the State subsidised transport services to the Aran Islands. One of the major criticisms of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the services to the islands refers particularly to the services to the city of Galway and the islands. The report states that at the initiation stage of a particular contract, following detailed evaluation of ten tenders submitted, the consultants recommended that one tender was head and shoulders above the rest. The Government approved the contract for the provision of an approved ferry service to the islands at a cost of &euro;600,000.</P>
    <P>As an acknowledgement of the considerable investment in the new service required from the operator, the Department agreed to the insertion of a clause in the contract, allowing for an extension of the contract for the main shipping service for a further five years after August 1997, provided that agreement could be reached between the parties to this contract. It is not evident from departmental papers whether further Government or Department of Finance approval of the inclusion of this clause in the contract was received. That is what the Comptroller and Auditor General stated. I ask the Minister to respond to this issue. He indicated that there was no problem but, clearly, there was a very serious one when this was the subject of a published report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not the Minister responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ó Cuív may not have been the Minister directly responsible but the Government of which he is a membe was in office for most or all of the relevant period. As the Minister who has introduced the Bill, I ask him to explain the reason his Department does not have the records in question. If he does not know, will he please find out before the debate concludes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question which arises relates to the request for additional funding under the extended contract. In early 2000 the operator applied for an increase in the subsidy due to severe financial difficulties. At this point I am paraphrasing rather than quoting in full. In April 2000, the Department made an advance payment to the operator on condition it would come back to the Department, within four weeks, with a restructuring plan in order that the business would not continue to incur losses. Subsequent to this payment, it transpired that the advance pay<Col N="1422" /> ment contravened a 1994 agreement between the Department and the Bank of Scotland, whereby subsidy payments to the operator were to be paid directly to the bank. The bank demanded payment of the subsidy for the months of May and June. The Department paid an amount of &euro;85,000 to the bank. Efforts to recoup the money from the operator were rebuffed. That does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>The report continues as follows, at the bottom of page 116: &ldquo;Enquiries made in the marine survey office&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Early 2000, according to the reference from which I am reading, at page 116. The report reads:</P>
      <P>Enquiries made in the marine survey office indicate that the stand-by vessel nominated for the Galway city service does not have a load line certificate for the carriage of cargo. Accordingly, it would appear that this vessel has not been operating in full compliance with the terms of the contract. It is understood that an application for a load line certificate has been made recently by the operator in respect of this vessel.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to raise other issues about the tender competition. It refers to the absence of a contract for a bus service. It states that, with the approval of GCC, a letter of intent was issued to the operator, awarding the contract, but there is no record of approval from the Department of Finance. A signed contract does not exist in respect of the service provided following this negotiated agreement in relation to the provision of a daily return service in winter and twice daily return services in summer, using two boats to Innishmaan and Innisheer. In September 1998 the Government was advised that the Minister could be acting <i>ultra vires </i>by including in the contract the requirement to provide a bus service between Rossaveel and Galway. Is that the subject matter of the retrospective legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Therefore, that is the core issue with regard to retrospection. The report goes on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Rossaveel service has been funded since mid-1997 by the Department without having a contract in place. The Department has failed to ensure that the operator formally accepts its condition of service. Although the letter of offer states the number of sailings to be under<Col N="1423" /> taken, as no contract is in place, the Department is not in a position to reduce the subsidy, should there be a shortfall in the sailings agreed to. In fact, the Department does not monitor the frequency of the service actually provided before making payments.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that this points to very serious inadequacies in the operation of the service to the islands. It is a matter which he must address. These issues cannot be avoided in the debate on the Bill &ndash; they cannot be hidden or swept under the carpet.</P>
    <P>On the question of compensation, the report states, at page 119:</P>
    <P>The contract does not include a requirement to provide a bus service to Galway city. Legal advice was not sought by the Department with regard to this as the Minister's power in regard to essential bus connecting services is being followed up in relation to Rossaveel.</P>
    <P>It goes on and on.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the actual use of the service, specifically from the city of Galway, which is costing the taxpayer a very significant amount of money, in terms of the number of sailings contracted for and the number of sailings which actually took place. One of the key issues relates to the number of passangers who travel on the services. In the summer months a very significant number, including islanders and tourists, travel between the city of Galway and the Aran Islands.</P>

However, he will not divert me from the point with which I am about to charge him. The issue in this situation relates to one of mismanagement of the service by the Government. There is complete frustration in Galway and the Aran Islands with regard to the quality of the boat service, which reduced over those years when people were not using the service while the State was paying a fortune for it. The report states:</P>
      <P>The Department is unable to provide statistics on the amount of cargo which was carried on that service. In the absence of such statistics, and given the very low level of passenger usage for ten months of the year, it is impossible to evaluate the justification for the level of services contracted so far.</P>
      <P>The report is very constructive with regard to services out of Rossaveel. It also&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is part of my question to him. Will he reply to it? The report goes on to <Col N="1426" /> comment on the activities of Údarás na Gaeltachta. One of the proposals we think is important relates to more usage of air travel in the winter months when fewer people are in a position to travel on ferries. I do not know whether I should compliment the Minister now but it is good and constructive that he has given himself power in the Bill to improve the provision of aerodromes for the delivery of air services between the islands and the mainland. If the subsidy continues, people will use the aerodromes, if they can. The issues regarding O'Brien Shipping have been mentioned in the debate and I will await the Minister's response.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General's report of 2001 &ndash; 2002 raises concerns about financial contracts between the State and public operators subsidised in the provision of transport services to the islands. This goes to the heart of the matter, namely, transparency which people want to see in Government expenditure. They are critical of what has happened. I assume the Bill seeks to address such issues in order that the services become more efficient and an effective transport system.</P>
      <P>There was a difficulty in regard to a bus service from Rossaveel to Galway city, which few people use and the State continues to subsidise. There are also issues in regard to under-used subsidised ferry services to the Aran Islands with which I have dealt. The services carried 1,047 people in 2002.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The ferry service carried 1,047 passengers in 2002, down from 25,123 in 1999. It carried 19,000 passengers in 2000 and 11,000 in 2001. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report drew attention to serious flaws in the contract. It complained that the 1992 contract with O'Brien Ship<Col N="1427" /> ping had been renewed for seven years without public competition, even though the then Department of Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands knew of the problems. The State subsidy is worth &euro;4.2 million for the seven year period to the end of 2004. However, the State renewed the contract in 1997 without carrying out an evaluation of the performance of O'Brien Shipping or the use of its services.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General criticised the management and monitoring of Government subsidised contracts, stating it was unlikely best value for money was obtained for the State. He also noted a piecemeal approach to co-ordination with a lack of analysis and monitoring of subsidised transport operations to the islands:</P>
    <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs does not monitor the frequency of the service actually provided before making payments. It cannot provide detailed or summary annual statistics regarding passenger services between Rossaveel and the islands as sailing logs are not generally reviewed.</P>
    <P>A recent summary of the service discovered that, with the exception of the summer months, the company had not provided the number of sailings contracted for during 2001 and that little use was made of the passenger service outside the summer months. Of the passengers carried, just 5% were islanders. The Department is unable to provide statistics for the amount of cargo carried. Thus, it is impossible to evaluate the justification for the levels of service contracted for.</P>
    <P>Air services are becoming more popular with islanders. The use of such services is high and increasing compared with the use of ferry services between Galway and the islands. However, air services also need to be monitored as formal checks are not made to ensure the service provided is according to the conditions attached to the agreements. There is also no requirement on the operator to forward logs of trips undertaken or details of the number of passengers carried.</P>
    <P>The problems identified with State services to the islands included the fact that the Galway city island service often did not run as scheduled. There were problems with the transportation of cargo. There are often delays on the Rossaveel bus service while there has been dissatisfaction with the standard of the vessels used. A 1995 report on passenger ferry service to the islands found that the subsidy paid to ferry operators might also have been subsidising summer tourist traffic to the islands. It recommended that the subsidy paid to ferry operators to operate a winter service out of Rossaveel to the two small islands should be transferred to the air service operator. Perhaps that is where the extra power in regard to aerodromes to which the Minister referred could come from.</P>
    <P>A more co-ordinated approach is needed to ensure a better delivery of travel services to the <Col N="1428" /> Aran Islands if value for money is to be guaranteed. There is a need for greater scrutiny of information on the use of such services to the islands which should include better monitoring of services and inform decision-making, particularly in the awarding of State contracts. The continued need for a subsidised passenger service also needs to be re-evaluated, particularly given the extremely low level of usage in the off-peak season.</P>
    <P>These are the issues which have been brought to my attention in my discussions on the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's response to the questions I have raised.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm labhairt ar an Dára Chéim den Bhille seo, Bille an Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 2003. Bille gairid agus teicniúil atá ann agus i bprionsobal níl mé ina choinne. Tá rudaí anseo agus ansiúd ar mhaith liom go mhíneodh an tAire iad agus beidh mé ag fanacht ar fhreagaí uaidh ag deireadh na díospóireachta.</P>
      <P>Fuair mé na figiúirí ón daonáireamh a rinneadh i 2002 agus chuir mé i gcomparáid leis na figiúirí a bhí sa daonáireamh i 1996 iad agus bhí laghdú de 502 ar dhaonra na n-oileáin idir an dá linn. Tá cuid mhaith déanta ag an Aire chun saol na n-oileáin a dhéanamh níos fearr do dhaoine ann ach tá daoine ag imeacht nó ag fáil báis gan clann. Tá an scéal ag dul i laige agus ní maith an rud sin.</P>
      <P>Fadó bhí iascaireacht ann mar shlí bheatha. Má tá daoine le fanacht ar na hoileáin, caithfidh slí maireachtála a bheith acu atá inchurtha le slí bheatha in aon chuid eile na tíre. Ní fhanfaidh na cailíní ar na hoileáin muna mbeidh na háiseanna acu atá ar fáil ar an mhórthír. Caithfimid cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt do mhuintir na n-oileáin agus tá sin mar bhunús don reachtaíocht seo.</P>
      <P>This Bill is short and technical in nature and I have no problem with it. I am, however, wary when retrospective legislation is introduced when it has been discovered that functions were discharged that were <i>ultra vires.</i> Often, though, it is on a minor point of law that such issues arise and it is correct that such loopholes are closed.</P>
      <P>The provision of airstrips on the islands is important. Transport to the islands should always be as safe and secure as possible. Many people from the islands have died working in the fishing industry and while travelling to the mainland, so safety is paramount.</P>
      <P>We do not consolidate enough legislation and the Minister is to be complimented for introducing this Bill. If we can get all the necessary information in one document it makes everyone's life easier and is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is about communication and transport. I read in the Department's strategy statement that Údarás na Gaeltachta is to provide broadband access to Gaeltacht areas outside the western corridor and to the Gaeltacht islands. This is welcome because broadband access gives the opportunity to establish a business anywhere. Instead of broadband being an aspiration for the <Col N="1429" /> Gaeltacht and the islands, there is a need for its early provision so projects can be established to create well-paid employment. The islands depend on tourism but that is seasonal and we need year-round employment with high standards of pay and conditions. There are also other modern methods of communication which could provide employment on the islands.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in establishing businesses on Gaeltacht islands because of the in-built disadvantage of having to cross seas that can be hostile, particularly in winter. We can talk in broad terms about industrial provision on the islands but there are many disadvantages to be overcome. We need funding along the lines of the EU cohesion funds to make good the transport deficit that exists for the islands in the movement of goods to our major markets on the European mainland and in Britain.</P>
    <P>I was confused when I read the explanatory memoranda of the Bill and compared them to the Bill itself. The explanatory memorandum on staffing states that there are no staffing implications arising from the legislation. However, section 5(1) of the Bill dealing with the expenses of Ministers states, &ldquo;expenses incurred by the Minister or the Minister for Transport in the administration of this Act shall, to such an extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;. How can administration expenses be incurred if no staff are involved? The two passages are incompatible and I await the Minister's explanation for this with interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd raised the vexed area of the service to the Aran Islands and provided documentation to illustrate his point. Do the service and the problems that arose from it expose the Minister to action? Is that a closed book now?</P>
    <P>This legislation contains three major provisions and I have no problem with it. The Minister has described his Department as an enabling Department and this legislation follows that pattern. I do not believe, however, that we will see many airstrips in future because many of the islands have very small populations with only a few supporting a substantial population. On the other hand, the provision of safe, regular transport, particularly in the winter, from the islands to the mainland remains an important issue. The Minister has referred to transport for children attending secondary schools for instance. On one hand, there is the matter of scale, while on the other, there is the matter of safety.</P>
    <P>It will not be an easy agenda to address. When we are coming from a point where there has been a reduction of 500 in island populations between the 1996 and 2002 censuses we must ask what can really be achieved? We must ask what populations are viable and what islands can provide a way of life and a standard of living that measures up to the world we live in. The Minister referred to the trend of populations gravitating towards main centres of populations a number of times in different contexts. It remains an issue, not just for <Col N="1430" /> the islands, but for many parts of rural Ireland and is a substantial problem. The other part of his brief will see him devising more and more means to hold the population and strengthen settlements in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that as part of the EU Presidency, a comhdháil will be held in Connemara next May. It is important that we are linked into the mainstream of European thought in terms of our inhabited islands. Without going into too much description, the islands contain much heritage, history and traditional ways of life. Our islands have an extraordinary record for producing some of the finest literature that is part of the cultural treasure trove of this country. There are important social and cultural aspects of our islands that are important to maintain and develop.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with the outcome of this legislation. It will not make a dramatic difference to what he can and cannot do, as it is essentially a tidying-up exercise. The Minister used this debate to outline what he achieved in office in the previous Administration and since coming to this office. He also put the six sections of the Bill into context. I have no intention of tabling amendments on Committee Stage, as ensuring the early passage of this Bill is the proper thing to do. While the Bill does not have a huge policy impact, it is important that this legislation is passed into law.</P>

      <P>While the purpose of this Bill is largely technical, the fact that it is entitled the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill 2003 offers the opportunity on Second Stage to discuss the wider functions of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. We can broach this topic later, but I will begin by examining the elements for which the Minister is seeking additional powers through this Bill. I am not in disagreement with those functions being allocated to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak with some experience on the need for such services and provisions to be made available on many of our islands. Being a technical Bill, it is lacking criteria as to how certain types of transport should be provided, to which of our islands and why. Deputy O'Shea spoke about the unfortunate shrinking population base of many of our islands. However, there is also the question of accessibility. There should be some standard criteria that measures whether an island is accessible 50%, 70% or 90% of the time. Irish islands, as a rule, are largely accessible. Tory Island may be less accessible than most and there are islands off Counties Mayo and Galway that have difficulties <Col N="1431" /> with boat transport throughout the year. We need to think about air access, either through air strips or heliports. The Minister has certainly made steps in this regard. I presume the recent announcement he made on two air strips are contingent on the passing of this legislation. The whole point of the Minister acting <i>ultra vires</i> in this area depends on this legislation going through. That said, those islands will appreciate those extra facilities.</P>
    <P>It is from personal experience that I believe that air access is essential to islands, particularly the better populated ones. My father died on 28 August 2000 on his native island of Arranmore. Because the island's ambulance was being serviced at the time of his fatal attack, my father was transported on a tractor and trailer. Subsequent transport to the mainland was by the island lifeboat. I took the issue up with the Minister for Health and Children and the North-Eastern Health Board. However, my family and I fully accept that the transport facilities were not a contributing factor to his death. I believe he went to the island with full knowledge of his mortality because it was the home of his heart.</P>
    <P>This experience indicated to me, as the son of an islander, the real difficulties that people face day by day, week by week, in accessing services and responding to crises. There have been improvements since. On Arranmore, the terrain does not allow for an airstrip. There is a small heliport facility on the Leabgarrow side of the island, but for some reason it was not functioning at the time of my father's death. I accept that support has been given to the island comharcumann for bus transport since. There is an excellent bus service now operating on the island.</P>
    <P>However, there is a difficulty with co-ordinated transport, a function sought by the Minister in this Bill. There is frustration among the people on Arranmore about having a co-ordinated service on the island, such as a boat service interconnecting with other services on the mainland with varying degrees of reliability. It could be a private service or subsidised service. While I realise the Minister has the experience of the Rossaveel to Galway route, there seems to be a lack of co-ordination of transport for many of the islands and major population centres. The people of Arranmore regularly need to get to Dungloe, Letterkenny or the local Donegal airport, and for Cape Clear, it is Skibbereen and Cork. I want to see consistency in this area, given that the Minister has so clearly identified the success of the Rossaveel-Galway link and the Aran Islands.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd spoke of the ongoing difficulties of subsidising ferry services to the islands. As a member of the Public Account Committee, I can vouch for much of what he said. At a recent Public Accounts Committee meeting on this issue, I questioned Department officials on the matter. I fully accept they were aware of the difficulties that exist. There was a certain degree of contriteness and a promise that for future meet<Col N="1432" /> ings of the Committee of Public Accounts these difficulties would be ironed out. I will be interested to see whether they can be ironed out. The O'Brien situation cannot be justified in terms of ongoing public expenditure or the management of public funds.</P>
    <P>At that meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, I suggested that we should also consider the experience of other countries that are island nations, archipelagos or have a large number of offshore islands. They all have similar transport difficulties in how they operate their ferry services and deciding on the extent to which they have air and boat links. I cited the examples of Scotland &ndash; as a nearest neighbour &ndash; and Denmark. Even though Scotland is not an independent nation, these are countries with similar populations, spatial strategies, and urban and rural divides. There are lessons for us as to how we can extend our services from the way in which they are addressing this.</P>
    <P>I relate another family experience in the more distant past. My grandfather was taking advantage of the more liberal licensing laws that existed at the time and was a missing passenger from the Arranmore boat disaster, which killed 29 people. This indicated &ndash; far too slowly in terms of a State response &ndash; the problems with transport between the island and the mainland. Even as a young person travelling on a regular basis to Arranmore Island on holidays in the 1970s and even up to the mid-1980s, the standard form of transport was the 15-foot fishing boat whose only form of buoyancy aid was represented by the tyres around the side. We have been very late in realising that people who live on islands require safe and reliable means of transport. If this Bill helps the Minister to do this, my party and I will not stand in its way.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the references in the Minister's speech to money and infrastructure that has been provided. However, a new rolling programme for quays and piers is required. The Minister referred to the pier in Leabgarrow, Arranmore. There is also a pier on the Aphort side. While much effort has been put in to the boat facilities on the islands, there may not be similar work on many of the mainland ports. I admit that some work has been done. However very often there are other options for those travelling to and from these islands as to the ports used both on the mainland and on the island. This is why I mentioned the Aphort example on Arranmore Island.</P>
    <P>There is another access point on that island which is not used due to the inadequacy of the pier facilities and I suspect the same would also be found on mainland piers. This has an impact on people living on islands for their interaction with the mainland and on tourism development for many of these facilities. As part of a co-ordi<Col N="1433" /> nated cohesive programme, it might help stem the population loss from many of these islands.</P>
    <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was created on the formation of this Government in June 2002. As spokespersons, we have not really had the opportunity to discuss the wider powers and functions of the Department. Now, 18 months later, we have some experience of how the various elements of the Department &ndash; community, rural development and Gaeltacht affairs &ndash; are interacting with each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a member of the relevant committee and those of us in smaller parties have to juggle between different committees.</P>
      <P>Whereas I accept the Minister's interest in rural and Gaeltacht affairs, as one who represents an urban and suburban constituency &ndash; despite my island background &ndash; I am concerned that what is seen as the urban development section is suffering. I accept this is an area for which the Minister of State takes greater responsibility. However, when I hear the Minister say to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that one of the main causes of urban deprivation is rural depopulation, I wonder what are his focus and priorities. It is not my experience in an urban area that people coming from the country are causing problems leading to urban deprivation. I am trying to concentrate on that lack of focus. It is a broad Department covering areas that conflict in many respects. It demands a coherent response.</P>
      <P>We will give the Minister the opportunity and time to get things right. However, after 18 months I am expressing my reservations about the work of the Department. It is important to have a Department with responsibility for the community, as was suggested by my party. It is not exactly in the form that we suggested and there are elements that could make it a more important Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Question Time today, I suggested some of the areas in which the Department could and should be leading to educate and direct other Departments to meet the needs of the disadvantaged and marginalised in our society. We are largely talking about those who are isolated on islands, in rural communities or even in areas of large urban population who are isolated in economic and psychological terms. In this regard I would value the opportunity for a more wide-ranging debate, possibly at the next Estimates. However, I thought that a Bill that deals with the <Col N="1434" /> powers and functions of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was also a good opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Through this Bill the Minister seeks certain transport powers and functions. When responding at the end of this debate the Minister should outline how he sees the services being provided by other transport agencies. It is important that he has a clear policy. Does he envisage private companies providing these services? Will there be greater State co-ordination? If the Minister is unclear about this in terms of a wider State policy, many of the people who do not have a viable transport system will be further neglected. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response as to how the people in the islands can look to a better future when travelling around and accessing their islands. It is important that the island culture, which is very much part of what we are &ndash; and very much part of what my family is &ndash; can be maintained.</P>

      <P>Táim an-bhuíoch don seans a labhair ar an mBille tabhachtach seo. Tá an-suim agam ins an oileáin ós rud é go raibh mé ag obair ar oileán mar dochtúir teaghlach agus bhí orm dul chuig na hoileáin gach seachtain ar feadh na blianta fada. Chonaic mé go raibh sé an tábhachtach go mbeadh cabhair le fáil ag daoine nuair a bhí sé ag teastáil uathu, go mórmhór i gcás práinne cosúil le timpist bóthair, galair agus mar sin de. Bhéadh sé an-tábhachtach go mbéadh siad in ann dochtúir a fháil. Cheap mé nach raibh an cabhair cheart le fáil ar feadh na blianta do na daoine ar na hoileáin. Ba thrua mhór sin dóibh. Bhí a lán scéala acu faoi na rudaí uafásach a tharla ar feadh na blianta, mar shampla, athair nó máthair nó duine de na páistí a fuair bhás nuair nach raibh gá toisc nach raibh cabhair le fáil. Níl sin ceart nó cothrom ar chor ar bith.</P>
      <P>Táim an-bhuíoch labhairt ar an ábhar seo mar tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbéadh rud éigin déanta. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil suim mhór ag an Aire, an Teachta Ó Cuív, sna hoileáin. Sin an post atá aige. Tuigim go bhfuil sé ar bharr an phoist sin agus ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil a lán rudaí ar fáil sna hoileáin nach raibh ann riamh. An rud is tábhachtaí ná access.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this issue as someone who has experience of the islands as a general practitioner to a number of Mayo islanders for several years. I do not do that any more, but I practised for many years on Clare Island and Inishturk. I enjoyed the experience but what was impressed upon me was how little there was on the islands. Some of them had resident doctors but do not now. That service is provided now from the mainland and depends on the expertise of district nurses who would be resident on islands. That said, there have been cases where there has not even been a nurse on some islands. One can imagine the deprivation suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" />What was impressed upon me most of all was that everyone had terrible stories of how, for example, a child had died of a burst appendix because he or she could not be sent to hospital. Access to the islands was and still is a problem where weather is concerned. Some islands do not even have a proper pier to allow a trawler or currach to land in bad weather which means the island is cut off. If the infrastructure is in place, much more is possible. I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, for the work he has done in improving access. That is his job. He is on top of his job and is trying his best to put the important infrastructure in place for the islands. This must be built because there has been terrible neglect of the islands over the years.</P>
    <P>There has also been terrible neglect of the areas in the west where people live, and the western islands are an extension of that. There is deprivation on the mainland, but it is even greater on the islands. Good piers are being constructed and they are badly needed. To say they are essential is an understatement. Some islands have a helicopter service while others may have had but no longer have it. Shannon Search and Rescue provided a service to the Aran islands and the Air Corps continues to provide an emergency service to the islands. It is ironic that some could receive assistance more quickly on an island than on the mainland.</P>
    <P>It was while I was a doctor for the islands that I saw how effective helicopters could be in servicing the needs of islanders. It was wonderful to see the Air Corps providing the service when the weather was suitable, which it was most of the time. When it was not, a trawler did the job. It always impressed me how useful a helicopter could be in reaching a person within an hour, allowing him or her to be treated and brought to the appropriate centre.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that the service in place, good as it is, is not dedicated because no doctor is on board. Often a doctor is picked up &ndash; I would be picked up from Mulrany. A helicopter would land in a field which would create great excitement in the village, although not anymore I am sure. I would be whisked out to an island in a short time to treat a patient. It was very important for him or her to be seen by a doctor and then brought to hospital. One can imagine the contrast with what happened before there were helicopters when people had to wait for a certain period and make a terrible journey on a trawler in very bad weather to the nearest pier on the mainland where they could be seen. That has improved, but it could be better with a dedicated helicopter service with a doctor on board which would be available at all times.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the helicopter is not always available. The trouble with the Air Corps is that it is not always available because it <Col N="1436" /> has many other jobs. It is no fault of the service but it spends half the time flying Ministers here and there rather than engaging in mercy missions. It is also involved in other activities such as monitoring foreign trawlers and policing our fishing areas. This means it is not always available for mercy missions to the islands.</P>
    <P>The islands often have a better emergency service than the mainland and it is something I would like to see extended to the mainland. We await the joint report commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland into the feasibility of a helicopter mercy medical service. We have still not received that report. The great need for proper access to islands is the main issue and its importance is something anyone who has worked on islands or lived in the west will understand. I admire the advances that have been made but they are not a reason to stop because more needs to be done. However, credit must be given where it is due and there has been progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>I wish this progress could be extended. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, was the only member of Cabinet to visit Pollathomas. He made promises and gave people great courage. They are waiting for assistance. I know announcements were made regarding Red Cross aid similar to what Dublin received, because I tabled questions on this, but the people need ongoing compensation. Proper incentives should be provided for people living on islands or in the west in places such as Pollathomas. The figures last week showed that it is the worst unemployment blackspot in Ireland with 40% unemployment. The area is dying and it did not need this landslide. An area that was bleeding is now mortally wounded. A tax incentive scheme should be put in place for the area and perhaps the Minister will adopt this idea and promote it. I was in Pollathomas today and made the point that it is necessary and the Government should support it. Perhaps the Minister will refer to it when summing up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boyle referred to the statement by the Minister about the east and west and populated areas versus rural areas. If all the people in Dublin who have to go there to find jobs &ndash; more than half the graduates from Mayo must do so &ndash; could stay in the west, they would be much happier. This would result in fewer people in Dublin, fewer people using the services and fewer cars on the road. Developing the roads in the west makes great sense because more people would move there from the populated areas and bring life back to rural areas, the west in particular. If we do not have our people, what do we have? If the Minister wants proof of this, the census shows it. It has been well highlighted that if a line is drawn from Killala to Newport, virtually <Col N="1437" /> every electoral district west of that line has shown a decline in population, except for Mulrany which has shown a significant increase and the district beside it which has shown a marginal increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A great deal of suffering and hardship has been inflicted on both rural and urban communities throughout the country as a result of the activities of criminals engaged in the importation, distribution and sale of drugs. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 was introduced to provide for the civil forfeiture of the proceeds of crime. It is an excellent Act which has been used extensively and successfully against criminals. Despite the large sums of money seized from these criminals in recent years the money or assets must be held for seven years and must then go directly to the central Exchequer, which means that neither of these has been directly applied to redressing the problems created by those engaged in the massive drugs problem.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to redress some difficulties regarding the retention and expenditure of the proceeds of crime which accrue under the 1996 Act. It is to be effected by making three minor textual amendments to that Act. The Bill proposes to insert a new definition into the section of the Act of 1996 to introduce a definition of drug-related initiatives. The insertion of this definition enables the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the proceeds of crime seized by CAB are applied to appropriate organisations and initiatives which are focused on redressing the damage caused by those engaged in drug-related activities.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to amend section 4(1) of the Act by reducing the waiting period from seven years to three years, but only if the orders of the courts allow it to happen. The funds would be transferred after three years to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Those who work full-time in the disadvantaged areas of Dublin city dealing with the drugs problem recommended to me that Fine Gael take the initiative in this matter to ensure that the proceeds of crime are spent in the areas most affected by the criminal gangs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are precedents regarding the ring-fencing of moneys. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has ring-fenced the moneys raised by the plastic bag levy to be <Col N="1438" /> used for environmental purposes. There are proposals for a tax on ATM receipts, chewing gum and fast food packaging, ensuring that these moneys do not go to the Exchequer but rather into an environmental fund.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael argues that the proceeds of crime must be used to tackle crime rather than being used to fund administrative costs no matter how worthy or small. Theoretically moneys from the proceeds of crime could end up filling potholes in west Cork or County Louth. Fine Gael proposes that the money be spent in the communities where the damage has been done. The State has also ring-fenced moneys from the dormant funds account for use in voluntary and community projects. The Spanish government has published a new law which enables the assets from trafficking and other drug-related crimes to be held in a public fund which feeds a variety of organisations working in the drugs field.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 19 October contained a significant article which concerned me greatly. It stated, &ldquo;New waves of criminals get trigger-happy&rdquo;. The article stated that the Garda Síochána believes a new wave of younger, undisciplined and brutal criminals is struggling for control of the capital's drugs trade and supplying lethal firearms free on the streets. When I telephoned the Garda press office today, I was informed that the number of people who have died as a result of violence this year is 47. The article in <i>The Sunday Tribune </i>stated that 19 people have died this year in the State as a result of shotgun or bullet wounds. A serious and significant problem exists. Fine Gael proposes that the communities should be supported in their fight and disadvantage in those areas should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I praise CAB for its work. This year it has seized assets worth over &euro;44 million. It has been very successful and efficient in its operation and its staff are committed to the task. Next year will be the first year in which the moneys collected by CAB will be made available to the communities concerned. The equestrian centre in County Kildare owned by Mr. John Gilligan will be sold next year and it is valued at between &euro;3 million and &euro;4 million. That money would make a significant difference to the communities in Dublin that have suffered most at his hands.</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to the amount of drugs seized in the State in the last year give some idea of the scale of the problem, the money being made by the criminals and the problems suffered by young people who are drug users. Cannabis and cannabis resin worth over &euro;31 million were seized. Over &euro;5.6 million worth of heroin was seized. There were 469,862 tablets of ecstasy seized with a value of over &euro;7.1 million. Over &euro;0.5 million worth of cocaine was seized. It is a serious and significant problem which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Over 50% of Irish prisoners are drug users. <Col N="1439" /> This compares with England and Wales where the rate of drug use among prisoners is between 15% and 30%. In addition to the problems of drugs misuse in Irish prisons, the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C among prisoners is also a worrying feature. It is estimated that upwards of 90% of prisoners in Ireland are sufferers compared to between 30% and 40% of that population in Britain.</P>
    <P>A sociological and criminological profile of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison carried out in 1997 found that the majority of prisoners from Dublin came from areas characterised by a high proportion of corporation housing and by the prevalence of opiate drug abuse and high levels of long-term unemployment. Of the 99 Dublin-based prisoners questioned, only six came from mixed housing or middle class areas. The greatest concentration by far was in two areas of the inner city, Dublin 1, from Sheriff Street to Summerhill and Dublin 8, from Oliver Bond flats complex to Fatima Mansions. Further areas were also identified such as Dublin 7, Clondalkin, Coolock and Finglas. In Mountjoy Prison, 86% of the prisoners left school before the age of 16 years; 33% had not been educated beyond primary level; only 25% had sat a State examination; 88% had been unemployed before imprisonment; 30% claimed never to have had a job.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes the national drugs strategy has not been adequately funded. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has debated the issue in the House and Fine Gael has pointed out the inadequacies in the strategy. There are 15,000 heroin addicts in Dublin of whom half are in treatment. The problem is the numbers who are in treatment are all on methadone. More investment is required in an effort to wean them off methadone and place them back in the community and into worthwhile activities so that they can be reintegrated. At present it is almost as if the State is subsidising methadone use and it is rare for the users to come off it. The money from CAB seizures should be particularly directed at people such as these. Money should be used to deal with people who are likely to end up in Mountjoy Prison. We should invest heavily in the six areas of Dublin which have been identified. I accept that the Government is putting money in these areas but we need to put in a great deal more. It makes sense to ring-fence the money that the drug barons are making.</P>
    <P>Health board cutbacks of between 7% and 9% have been implemented and no money is in place for new services. Community and voluntary groups are crying out for more investment as they require additional funding to run their programmes. They do not have any problem getting people to work on these programmes but funding is not there to pay for the full-time workers who are needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" />Investment is required in many other areas such as that of educational disadvantage. The Minister for Education and Science said in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 March that some 800 children a year do not attend schools beyond primary level and some 19% of secondary school children do not go on to complete the leaving certificate. In spite of that, one of the first actions of the Government on re-election was to cut Department of Education and Science expenditure by &euro;36 million. Over &euro;6 million was cut from initiatives designed to reduce the school drop-out rate, while &euro;5 million was cut from programmes which helped disadvantaged school leavers access third level education. The problem needs to be addressed in a more focused way.</P>
    <P>We have to seek out those in communities who are yet unconvicted of involvement in the criminal area and encourage them to stay longer in school. When my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, was Fine Gael spokesman on education he called for income support to keep young people in school. His proposal was that the families of such young people should receive a payment to support and keep them out of trouble. This money could be spent on such an initiative.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill. It is not coming out of the air but from the plain people of Dublin who have told us that we must do something about the problem. It is right and proper that the proceeds of crime do not go into the Exchequer and get washed away but are specifically ring-fenced for those communities who have suffered most at the hands of the drug barons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Dowd for introducing this Bill and for agreeing to share time. The Bill is timely and gives us an opportunity to address an important issue. The proposals to reduce the timescale for the release of funds from seven to three years and to ring-fence the expenditure of the funds so raised in areas of great need commend themselves to the House.</P>
      <P>Five areas in Dublin have been identified as suffering greatly, not just in regard to the drugs problem, but generally as areas that are greatly disadvantaged. I do not see why, when we raise funds from people who have preyed on those communities, these funds should then be generally available to people in Foxrock or anywhere else. There is a case to be made for ring-fencing the funds and spending them in the areas in which they were collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard on the radio this morning that the French Government has added 20 cent to a packet of cigarettes. It has decided to ring-fence this money and add another 20 cent on 1 January next year which will also be ring-fenced. The intention is that the money will be spent specifically on health. There is a trend in this regard in Ireland and Europe. While I do not think all taxes should be ring-fenced, a specific case can be made <Col N="1441" /> here. There is a direct relationship between the areas which are most preyed upon and those in most need. If resources are taken back from criminals who have preyed on particular communities, these are the areas in which the funding should be invested.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd referred to a recent visit he made to a part of my constituency in Dublin 8. From what he witnessed and from what I hear on the ground, I fear we are on the verge of a major cocaine epidemic. I suspect that cocaine is being sold at a low price in order to get a market and then the price will be increased. In an effort to convince me of what is happening, a man in the inner city insisted that he could secure a line of cocaine for me in an hour.</P>
    <P>I understand that pubs and nightclubs in the city now put grease or oil on top of toilet cisterns to stop people snorting cocaine. Incidentally, not all of the people involved in this practice come from deprived areas. In many cases people who indulge in this habit are well-tanked up on alcohol. Evil people are deliberately creating a market for this drug and the problem will hit us in a short time in the same way as the heroin epidemic appeared to come from nowhere in the early 1980s. We should brace ourselves and put in place specific plans to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The State is incapable of dealing with these problems on its own. We have a problem with alcohol and our level of drug abuse is at least on a par with that in Europe. The report that came out today queries the UN report which placed levels of drug abuse here as being ahead of the rest of Europe. As an island people we should be able to prevent drugs reaching the market here in such quantity.</P>
    <P>Why are young people in particular turning to alcohol and drugs? Why are they turning to cocaine? Why is the suicide rate so high in Ireland? Why have despair and consumerism become so prevalent? I believe the declining influence of the church is a factor. The State should put its hands up and say it cannot handle this problem on its own and that it needs the assistance of others. There is a golden opportunity for the State to approach the church, which is currently looking for renewal and rebirth. Many priests and nuns are working in the inner city and the most difficult parts of my constituency, often without any decent holidays, on little or no income and for little or no recognition. They are playing an important role in the community. In many cases, they are keeping communities together and encouraging organisations. They feel they are no longer wanted as there is little encouragement for them. We still need them. Man does not live by bread alone.</P>
    <P>Many people who turn to drugs and alcohol do so because they have lost all sense of spiritual leadership. The State does not need to get involved in the business of running churches or <Col N="1442" /> anything of that kind. I do not speak of any particular church either. I agree that a separation should exist, but being separate does not mean that the church and State cannot co-operate. There is a need for greater co-operation in communities between church and State. The State should reach out to the churches and ask what they can do together to turn this around because both are concerned about the same problem.</P>
    <P>The lack of facilities for young people in their communities is a problem. Everything starts or ends with a drink. People have to go for a drink before going to a party. After a football match everyone goes for a drink. We have a drink culture where inebriation is acceptable. There is a perceived need for escape. That the hard man or woman is someone who can hold his or her liquor and, increasingly, his or her drugs is an issue which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently to a taxi driver from Dublin's inner city who had returned from Australia. His 23 year old son had just gone back there because he was interested in sport. While he liked a drink like anyone else &ndash; and anyone who has been to Australia knows people there take a drink &ndash; he found that everything here started and ended with alcohol.</P>
    <P>The communities under discussion are ones in which very few people can afford to join a golf club, which in Dublin can cost from &euro;15,000 if you can find a club that will take you. They cannot afford to participate in skiing holidays but depend on community facilities which are not in place. If funds were ring-fenced to be spent in the areas of greatest need, as suggested in Deputy O'Dowd's Bill, we might be able to provide high quality facilities which would divert people's energies from the bad influences to which many fall victim.</P>
    <P>Of Mountjoy Prison's inmates, 75% come from five identifiable areas of Dublin. Deputy O'Dowd has already sketched for the House the educational and family backgrounds of many of them. While we should not be easy on crime or criminals, we should be hard on the causes of crime. According to the 2003 report of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, there are an estimated 14,450 heroin users, of whom 12,456 reside in the Dublin area. I guarantee the House that the vast majority of that 12,456 come from the same five identifiable areas as that prison population. Given that correlation, we must begin to think about what we need to invest in these areas to divert people's energies in terms of money, time and thought. We must find out what partnerships we have to make, what networks we need to operate and what church and State can achieve together in these communities. If we are to renew our thinking in this area, we must consider the two proposals put forward in the Bill presented by Deputy O'Dowd and Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I am probably in a small minority of Members in my belief that it is time to consider giving <Col N="1443" /> votes to prisoners. Members of this House are supposed to present and exchange ideas for debate, criticism and examination but there is far too much consensus at the moment. It appears to be considered strange if a Member expresses a view that no one else has thought of, yet that is what this House is about. It might not be possible to give all prisoners the vote. While I would find it difficult to provide it to some of those who recently received long sentences, it should be possible to give the vote to prisoners approaching the last few years of their terms.</P>
    <P>By putting people in prison we are creating a subculture which continues when they are released. High rates of recidivism mean that prisoners are being recycled. In effect, we have told prisoners that they do not even have a vote and are therefore no longer members of society. That tells them they have rights but no responsibilities whereas we should tell them that while they are part of the problem, we want to make them part of the solution. If they contribute to the solution they should be part of society. We should allow and expect prisoners to vote.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we should cross the floor of the Chamber to write laws to suit prisoners. I agree absolutely that our sympathy must be with the victims. We should, however, take an interest in what is happening in prisons and ask why they have become factories which recycle criminals. When they are released more victims are created. By relieving prisoners of any requirement to contribute to the rebuilding of society, we have taken from them a civic duty. We should require of them to exercise that duty where they can, which is what electronic and postal voting provide us with an opportunity to do. Prisoners need not vote in the constituency of the prison but in their last place of residence. We must think of something different to put prison reform on the agenda. I hope that by putting forward this idea, I have stimulated somebody somewhere to oppose or support it or to explain what we need to do to stop simply recycling prisoners who continue to victimise innocent people.</P>

      <P>On the pitch. Though Deputies may mock me for visiting Australia, there is a great deal we can learn from that country as I found out. The approach to alcohol and drugs is much more controlled there. While one can have a pint of beer at a match there, that is not the reason one goes. We can also learn from the Australian laws on opening hours. The root of the problem with drink and drugs is often excess <Col N="1444" /> energy which is a problem the Australians do not have. They do not have time to spare as there is always something to do, a state of affairs we do not have here. Perhaps we have not done enough over the last few years. Prior to that ours was a growing country. We must realise that money should be spent to provide other activities to which people can devote their energies.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House represents the most common-sense legislation which will come before Members during this session and, as such, it should be supported. The best legislation is rooted in common sense but much of the work of this House ceased long ago to make any sense to anybody, especially me. Though the Government's paranoid control of power and the use of a three-line Whip will ensure that this Bill will fall like so many Private Members' Bills before it, I live in hope. Many fine Bills have come before the House, including that brought forward on balances and securities by my constituency colleague, former Deputy Farrelly, in 1999 but they failed to receive support. The legislation is then repackaged and returned to the House three years later. The Bill before the House tonight will probably be put aside only to come back in a year or two when it is too late. I ask that the Bill be supported on its merits rather than on the basis of which party proposed it. What could possibly be wrong with the Government supporting the Opposition for a change? We have done it in the past, which is why Government Members should consider voting in support of this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is often remarked by the people in the street that when it comes to voting here Deputies are like sheep or goats who are corralled by people with large sticks to benefit their parties. This Bill represents an opportunity to show we are not like that. We can think and vote for something that is right. If this House worked properly and efficiently, bright Deputies like my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, who worked tirelessly on this legislation, could go about the business of drafting more such Bills happy in the knowledge that they stood some chance. Change is needed and I hope it happens sooner rather than later. The people want it. If we are to see the benefit on the ground, we must change the way we vote in many cases to speed things up.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to see that Deputy Noel Ahern, the Minister of State with responsibility for the national drug strategy, supports the idea of ring-fencing CAB moneys, as he stated in a speech to Senators. It is difficult to convince the Minister for Finance and others to adopt this approach to such funds. As the Minister of State says he will accept any help offered to convince the Minister, I will be watching to see how he and his backbench colleagues vote on this Bill before us. The victims of crime should reap the benefits, if that word can be used in relation to the proceeds of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" />Even if this Bill is passed, Members should not think they have done a good day's work. Using this money to address the drugs problem would only be a start. Drugs are being peddled on the streets of our towns and villages, huge sums of money are being generated and total misery is being visited on families and society. This can be seen on a daily basis on the streets of all our cities and towns as well as in rural areas. The miserable few euro the State gets its hands on will not solve the problem but it is worth establishing as a right the principle that the victim of a crime should be the one to benefit. This money must be used to address the drugs problem. There is no case for using it elsewhere because if there was no drugs problem, there would be no money in the first instance.</P>
    <P>For far too long there has been a perception among the public that as long as they are of benefit to the State through taxes or windfalls, the law of this country looks slightly differently at issues such as under age drinking, cigarette sales to the young and flouting of the licensing laws. This perception must change for the good of society and the law of this country. While it is not directly related to the Bill, people who are able to avail of the poor box option in court are still guilty of something, but it is perceived as if their crime is somewhat less serious. That crime could be simply done away with or forgotten about because of a monetary contribution. This is another area which must change.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes a long way towards clearly indicating that the State itself should not benefit from the proceeds of drugs or crime, despite the fact that the justice system costs a fortune. It was not the intention of the original Bill, but do Members not find it somewhat perverse that this money which is stained by misery and blood could be used to shore up the Exchequer for the day-to-day running of the country? I am aware it is a small amount in percentage terms, which hardly registers when it comes to overall day-to-day expenditure. The point is, however, that crime money is bad money and should not be used to correct the problem.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the Bill in order that the drugs problem can be tackled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy O'Dowd for introducing this extremely timely Bill in a week in which two reports were published, which indicated that there is a crisis regarding drugs. The United Nations report was particularly alarming. It stated that we are world leaders in the usage of illegal drugs and the later Government-backed report was not much more comforting. I am pleased the Minister is present and I hope he will go back to Cabinet and impress on his colleagues that there is a major drugs crisis in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us who have young children are very worried. The culture of drugs misuse is absolutely <Col N="1446" /> frightening and the Government has done very little about it. Through its actions and inaction, the Government has made matters worse. Housing estates consisting of hundreds of houses have been built but no facilities have been provided. Developers have been making millions of euro on these estates but have provided no community centres, playing fields or youth clubs. What are teenagers and young people to do? They will just hang around the streets where they are preyed on by drug pushers and people who make a fortune from them. The CAB must be commended for the work it is doing and for getting its hands on this illegal money and we are calling on the Government to use this money in a positive way to combat the drugs issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight one area in which I am interested, namely, youth work and the youth service. I contend that we have no youth service in this country. Earlier this year, a number of experts in this area attended the Joint Committee on Education and Science. A representative from the Department said that the Minister for State with responsibility for youth affairs was anxious to have funding provided in the 2003 Estimates for the implementation of the youth work plan but, unfortunately, this did not happen. The chairman of the NYWA committee said the committee is aware of the ongoing efforts of the Minister to secure funding for the further roll-out of the provisions of the Youth Work Act. The chairman of the IVEA said that a meaningful resourcing plan for vocational education committees is required from the Department. Without that there can be little progress towards real local development youth work, as envisaged in the Act. No funding has been provided in either case.</P>
    <P>A representative from the National Youth Council said that there is a growing sense of disillusion, frustration and anxiety within NYCI and its member organisations and that the Youth Work Act 2001 heralded yet another false dawn for youth work. The reasons for that are clear. We anticipated additional funding to develop youth work at local level. Instead, youth affairs has received a 1% increase for 2003. This represents a decrease in current funding of approximately 4%. Without the allocation of additional funding there will be cuts in existing levels of services to more than 500,000 young people involved in youth organisations and thousands of disadvantaged young people in targeted initiatives, supported by 40,000 voluntary youth leaders and more than 1,000 youth workers. The inaction of the Government has made matters worse where youth services are concerned because people have become disillusioned and have lost heart. The Government has failed and abandoned the young people of Ireland and it is time it made available resources to youth services and youth work instead of cutting back.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" />The vocational education committees requested &euro;2.71 million this year to enable them to carry out their statutory functions under the Youth Work Act. They received &euro;12,000. I have great sympathy for the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera. She is trying to implement the Act's provisions but her Cabinet colleagues cannot see beyond their noses. They cannot see past their mercs and are failing the youth of this country, which is a disgrace. The Minister opposite is pragmatic and I call on him tonight to go back to his Cabinet colleagues and impress on them the importance of making money available to youth services and youth work, money which is available because of the CAB. I ask the Minister to accept this Bill which will do a lot of good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, on introducing this Bill. It is a thoughtful response to one of the issues which has affected our society for a considerable time. Given that the amount of money being made by those involved in illicit peddling of drugs is ever increasing and that the Criminal Assets Bureau is becoming more and more successful, it is time to try to redirect the ill-gotten gains of these drug barons back into the communities they have decimated. It is time the Members of this House, and society in general, recognised the wisdom of what was intended to try to address the issue at the most local level possible. We must try to pinpoint the areas that have suffered most, where drug barons have been running amuck for years. It appears that there are 17 organised crime gangs in the greater Dublin area. Imagine the damage done to the communities at large by these gangs.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about tackling the problem, there is no point just throwing up our hands and saying something should be done about it. Deputy O'Dowd's Bill is an attempt to address the issue. It proposes to redirect the forces of evil to make recompense to the societies they have decimated &ndash; it is as simple as that. It should and must work. If it does not, this problem will become more and more serious. There is no better way to punish those who are doing this damage to society than to take the money from them, including interest and penalties, as the Criminal Assets Bureau is doing, and hand it back directly to the societies that have been worse affected by the atrocities perpetrated against them by the drug barons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we cannot arrange for this to happen, then we cannot win. Once the Criminal Assets Bureau's confiscations go into the greater taxation pot and disappear into oblivion, it will be impossible to say to local communities affected by the activities of these drug barons that this is how they were offended and this is what the recompense will be. The degree to which Deputy <Col N="1448" /> O'Dowd has examined and analysed the issue is to be commended. For far too long in this House, there have been ready reckoner responses to serious issues. This is not a ready reckoner or a packaged solution, it is a well thought-out solution. I strongly urge the Minister and his colleagues to consider it carefully in an effort to throw a lifeline to those in society who have been worst affected by the atrocities committed by those involved in drug peddling who make large amounts of money from their activities.</P>
    <P>It irritates those who try to turn the tide when they see these guys on far-off sun-soaked beaches enjoying themselves and playing hard to get throughout the EU. It would help tremendously if the Government were to take this matter on board and do something specific about it. It would be good for society and particularly for those who are directly affected by the people concerned.</P>

Cé nach n-aontaíonn an Rialtas le gach atá ráite aige, tá sé oiriúnach go mbeadh seans ag an Teach seo díospóireacht a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí a bhaineann le drugaí.</P>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to debate the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2003. Deputies will understand that events elsewhere today require his presence.</P>
      <P>The Government opposes the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2003. In saying so I do not wish to imply criticism of the motivations behind the proposals contained in it &ndash; far from it. Apart from the fact that much of the proceeds of crime may not be related primarily to the drugs area, there is probably a much more fundamental matter relating to why funds raised in particular areas are not dedicated specifically to the purpose of dealing with that precise area.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy for Deputy O'Dowd and his colleagues, Deputies Stanton, English and Gay Mitchell in tabling the Bill and the earnestness with which they pursued it. However, they will appreciate, for example, that old age pensions, education, health and so on are provided by the State and have to be funded by resources raised from taxation and other ways. If one were to designate specifically funds raised in a particular area there is a host of services which would have no way of competing, some of which I have just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is determined to fight the evils of drug dealing and drug misuse and to reduce the harm which these activities inflict on individuals, families and entire communities. The Government aims to do this by addressing the <Col N="1449" /> areas of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research as set out in the national drug strategy about which I will speak later.</P>
    <P>Further evidence, if it were needed, of the need for continued efforts in this fight is contained in the results of the study released yesterday on the prevalence of drug use on this island. This study, the first of its nature carried out on an all-island basis, was commissioned jointly by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs in this jurisdiction and the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit in Northern Ireland. While it placed Ireland, relative to other European states, somewhere in the middle of the table in relation to drug use, it reminded us all, as the chairperson of the NACD said, that we need to continue our work to target drug users and encourage them away from drug misuse.</P>
    <P>The Government opposes this Bill primarily on the grounds that there is a Bill currently before the House, the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999, which is at a more advanced stage and which would be a more appropriate context in which to submit and debate proposed amendments to the main Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. To remind Deputies of progress on the 1999 Bill, the Government had approved the drafting of the Bill to amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 in a number of technical respects, arising from the experience of the Criminal Assets Bureau in operating the Act.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill as published include provision to enable the Criminal Assets Bureau to make applications under the Act in its own name, as opposed to a member of the Garda Síochána of at least chief superintendent rank or an authorised official of the Revenue Commissioners, as at present, and for any document issued by the bureau to be accepted as authentic, unless the contrary is shown; clarification that the details of property and income, as well as the sources of that income, which a respondent is required to reveal to a court may not be used in evidence in any criminal proceedings against either the respondent or a spouse; removal of any doubt there may be over when a person may be said to be in possession or control of property for the purposes of the Act, even when it has been seized from the person by the Garda Síochána; and changes to the 1996 Act regarding such matters as the submission of evidence under the Act, and the variation of freezing orders for certain purposes, such as the enforcement of taxes or court orders for the recovery of money.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage of the Bill was concluded in October 2000 but the Bill was not progressed further pending the outcome of a number of court challenges to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. Following those court cases and recent consultations with the Criminal Assets Bureau, a number of additional proposals for inclusion in the Bill are now being proposed as official amend<Col N="1450" /> ments to the Bill on Committee Stage. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has obtained the approval of the Government to draft amendments for inclusion in the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999, currently on Committee Stage in the Dáil, and to move the amendments after they have been drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
    <P>I would like, on behalf of the Minister, to inform the House of these proposed amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999. On Committee Stage, these proposals can be debated fully and, as I have stated earlier, the opportunity for further proposals for amendments can be afforded to the House.</P>
    <P>There are 18 proposed amendments in total in two Parts. The amendments in the first Part, some of which give statutory effect to decisions of the courts, deal with the enhancment of provisions of the 1996 Act. The amendments in the second Part arise following publication of the Second Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, the Flood report, in September 2002. At that time, consideration was given to setting up a separate corruption assets bureau, along the lines of the Criminal Assets Bureau. However, after further consideration of this proposal and following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, it is considered that a separate corruption bureau is not required and that the existing activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau in the fight against corruption could best be bolstered by the inclusion of additional amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Bill.</P>
    <P>Head 1 of the proposed amendments is to provide that the definition of &ldquo;proceeds of crime&rdquo; in section 1 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 be amended to include any property obtained or received at any time through criminal conduct of one of a number of kinds, each of which would be an offence, rather than just by or as a result of or in connection with the commission of one particular offence. &ldquo;Proceeds of crime&rdquo; is defined in the original Act as &ldquo;any property obtained or received at any time (whether before or after the passing of this Act) by or as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau seeks an amendment to this definition to indicate that it is not necessary to show that the conduct was of a particular kind of criminality if it is shown that the property was obtained through conduct of one of a number of kinds, each of which would be an offence. For example, where it is impossible to say funds are derived from a particular kind of criminality, say, drug-dealing, money-laundering, extortion or prostitution, when on the balance of probabilities it is from one or some or all of these, it would suffice to show that the property was obtained through conduct of one of a number of kinds, each of which is an offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" />The wording of the amendment is based on provisions contained in the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Part 5 of that Act enables recovery in civil proceedings of property which is or represents &ldquo;property obtained through unlawful conduct&rdquo; for which the Act goes on to provide that it is sufficient if it is shown that the property was obtained through conduct of one of a number of kinds, each of which would have been unlawful conduct.</P>
    <P>Head 2 inserts, into the definition of &ldquo;the respondent&rdquo; in section 1 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the phrase &ldquo;wherever domiciled, resident or present&rdquo; in regard to a person in respect of whom an application for an interim order has been made or in respect of whom such an order has been made and includes any person who, but for the Act, would become entitled, on the death of the first mentioned person, to any property to which such an order relates, being an order that is in force and is in respect of that person. This amendment is based on the decision in McKenna <i>v.</i> EH, High Court, 18 July 2001, in which Finnegan J. held that it was the duty of the court to give effect to the intention of the Oireachtas. In this case the judge was satisfied that that intention was that persons outside the jurisdiction with assets inside the jurisdiction which represent the proceeds of crime should be subject to the procedures of the Act. Accordingly, he refused to set aside the order giving liberty to the plaintiff to serve notice of the plenary summons outside the jurisdiction. This issue was also referred to in McKenna <i>v.</i> M. &amp; ors, High Court, 12 February 2003. The addition to the definition is based on wording used in section 243 of the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.</P>
    <P>Head 3 deals with the issue of extraterritoriality and provides that the following section be inserted in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996:</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Act shall have effect (i) to pursue proceeds of crime in the State where the person concerned is in another state [or territory] or (ii) to pursue proceeds of crime in another state [or territory] where the individual is in the State, regardless of where the crime has been committed.</P>
    <P>The issue of extraterritoriality has been considered in a number of cases. In DPP <i>v.</i> Hollmann, High Court, 29 July 1999, O'Higgins J. held that the Act could be applied to pursue the proceeds of crime in this jurisdiction where the offence was committed abroad. This was upheld by Finnegan J. in McKenna <i>v.</i> EH, High Court, 18 July 2001, and McKenna <i>v.</i> M &amp; ors, High Court, 12 February 2003. Following these decisions this provision ensures Irish courts (i) have jurisdiction over cases where the person and or the proceeds are within the jurisdiction, even if the crimes or some of them are committed <Col N="1452" /> abroad, and (ii) can appoint a receiver over assets abroad.</P>
    <P>Heads 4 and 5 amend section 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 to enable a section 3, interlocutory, order to be obtained in a summary manner and ensure rules of court may be applied. The purpose of providing that section 3, interlocutory, orders are obtained &ldquo;in a summary manner&rdquo; is to ensure a special summons procedure and that, as a result, defendants will be obliged to respond to proceedings on affidavit and so avoid the need for particulars and discovery at an early stage in the process. The need for this amendment was highlighted in the Supreme Court case, FK <i>v</i> AF and JF, 102/01, 30 January 2002, which decided that in the absence of any legislative provision to the contrary proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act must be commenced by plenary summons.</P>
    <P>Head 6 introduces the concept of a &ldquo;Consent disposal order&rdquo; whereby the court may make an order, on application to it by consent of all of the parties, directing that the whole or, if appropriate, a specified part of the property be transferred, subject to such terms and conditions as the court may specify, to the Minister for Finance or such other person as the court may determine. The subsequent provisions in relation to a disposal order granted in the normal way would also apply to such consent disposal orders. For example, the respondent is deprived of his or her rights in or to the property, the Minister for Finance may sell or otherwise dispose of the property etc.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 provides that where property has been the subject of an interlocutory order for a period of seven years, an application may be made to the High Court by the Criminal Assets Bureau for a disposal order whereby the property is transferred to the Minister for Finance. As proposed in the Private Member's Bill under debate, the CAB has sought a proposal whereby the seven year period might be reduced in situations where there is consent by the parties involved and the court is satisfied that no injustice is caused. However, the CAB says that in some cases the individuals concerned want to see final closure on the proceedings and the CAB is of the view that a provision of this type is beneficial for those situations.</P>
    <P>Head 7 provides that in any proceedings taken under the 1996 Act, the provisions of section 11(7) of the Statute of Limitations shall not apply. Confusion has arisen in a number of court cases where it has been assumed, incorrectly, that proceeds of crime applications come within the class of action that must be made within two years under section 11(7) of the Statute of Limitations 1957 relating to certain forms of statutory forfeiture. In McK <i>v.</i> H, High Court, 12 April 2002, No. 10531P / 2001, and McKenna <i>v.</i> M &amp; ors, High Court, 12 February 2003, Finnegan J. held that <Col N="1453" /> this is not so and this amendment inserts a clarifying section.</P>
    <P>Head 8 clarifies section 6(<i>b</i>) of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999, as published, with the insertion of the phrase &ldquo;under this Act&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; to make it clear that it is proceedings under the 1996 Proceeds of Crime Act to which reference is made.</P>
    <P>As I outlined, Part II of the proposed amendments deals with corruption and the extension of the existing activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau to the fight against corruption. Head 9 provides for the insertion of a new section 13A into the 1996 Act to allow for orders to be made to make material available for civil Proceeds of Crime Act purposes. This section is modelled on section 63 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and allows a member of the Garda to apply to the court for an order to make material available for the purposes of an investigation into whether a person has benefited from, is in receipt of, or controls proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>The terms &ldquo;member&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; are defined in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. Member means a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent and authorised officer means an officer of the Revenue Commissioners authorised in writing by the Revenue Commissioners to perform the functions conferred by the Act on authorised officers.</P>
    <P>Head 10 makes provision for powers of search in relation to computers and computerised information while head 11 provides for the insertion of a new section to the 1996 Act dealing with property held in trust. This is a provision to enable a CAB official to apply to the High Court to establish the identity of persons for whom property is held in trust where there is an investigation in relation to whether that person is in receipt of, or controls or has benefited from the proceeds of crime. Heads 12 and 13 are modelled on sections 38 and 39, respectively, of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and provide for the seizure of bribes by a member of the Garda Síochána and the forfeiture of that bribe by order of a judge of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Head 14 applies the provisions of sections 40 &ndash; appeal, 41 &ndash; interest, 42 &ndash; procedure and 45 &ndash; disposal, of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to the new heads 10 and 11 relating to seizure and forfeiture of a bribe. Head 15 amends section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to allow for seizure and detention of money imported or exported in cash which is suspected to directly or indirectly represent proceeds of any criminal conduct, not just drug trafficking. Head 16 provides for an amendment to section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, consequent to the proposed amendment to section 38, to include forfeiture of money imported or exported in cash which is the subject of a section 38, as amended, order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" />Head 17 extends the definition of &ldquo;cash&rdquo; in section 43 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to include notes and coins in any currency, postal orders, cheques of any kind, including travellers' cheques, bankers drafts, bearer bonds and bearer shares. Head 18 proposes the replacement of the reference to &ldquo;criminal activity&rdquo; in section 4(<i>a</i>) of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 with &ldquo;criminal conduct&rdquo; bringing it into line with a similar amendment in the money-laundering provision, section 31, of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, as amended by section 21 of the Criminal Justice (Theft &amp; Fraud Offences) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to introduce this Bill, with the amendments outlined on Committee Stage, within the next few months and he is of the opinion that it would be more appropriate to table amendments to the Act in the context of the debate on this Bill. However, without prejudice to any further debate which may happen in that context, I would offer some views on the substantive proposals contained in the Bill under debate tonight which include the reduction of the waiting time which must be observed before the courts may make an order directing the transfer of property, subject to an interlocutory order under the Act, to the Minister for Finance; and the use of the proceeds accruing from the disposition of the property transferred to drug-related initiatives identified by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>On the first proposal, which I presume is being put forward to facilitate the early implementation of a second on the channelling of funds to drugs initiatives, careful examination of its consequences is required. Such an examination should take place in the context of debate on the full range of amendments proposed in the Government Bill, especially those which I have outlined under Head 6. That head proposes a provision whereby the seven year period might be reduced in situations where there is consent by the parties involved and the court is satisfied that no injustice is caused.</P>
    <P>The second proposal deals with what one could call the &ldquo;ring-fencing&rdquo; of the proceeds accruing from the disposition of the property transferred to the Minister for Finance for drug-related initiatives. This is not a new idea and has been examined in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance before. A number of points need to be made about this proposal.</P>
    <P>First, a policy of ring-fencing moneys obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of same for a specific for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process and could have far-reaching implications. The Constitution requires, and Government accounting principles provide, that public moneys be spent only as <Col N="1455" /> voted or approved by Dáil Éireann unless otherwise provided by statute. The so-called ear-marking of Government revenues for specific expenditure purposes is generally avoided.</P>
    <P>In addition, such a process would add additional layers of bureaucracy to the allocation of funds and would not be justified unless significant and quantifiable added value, in excess of the additional administrative costs, could be shown. Ring-fencing would add nothing to the sums realised for the Exchequer but would absorb resources. It is a fundamental principle that it is a matter for Government, with Oireachtas approval, to determine the optimum allocation of Exchequer receipts in accordance with broadly agreed socio-economic priorities.</P>
    <P>To agree to use the revenues generated from the disposition of property transferred to the Minister for Finance under the provisions of the 1996 Act would mean that the treatment of drug victims would be financed, in part at least, by uncertain and variable revenue sources. This would not facilitate the proper planning of treatment provision and programmes by those organisations the funding is proposed to support.</P>
    <P>Also, the majority of assets frozen to date under the Act did not derive from the activities of drug dealers and there is no logical link between those assets and drug prevention and treatment programmes. To channel all of those funds to drug initiatives could deprive other areas such as hospitals and schools of resources. One could argue for ring-fencing of receipts if it were seen to be a motivating factor in the generation of higher receipts but there is absolutely no indication that the Criminal Assets Bureau needs any further motivation in carrying out its work. The CAB continues to enjoy considerable success in depriving persons engaged in criminal activity from retaining the proceeds of their nefarious activities.</P>
    <P>The figures speak for themselves. In 2002, the bureau obtained interim orders to the value of more than &euro;34 million and interlocutory orders &ndash; final restraint orders &ndash; to the value of more than &euro;10 million; taxes and interest demanded came to more than &euro;12.8 million, with more than &euro;10 million collected; and, social welfare savings amounted to more than &euro;155,000.</P>
    <P>Since its statutory inception in October 1996 to 31 December 2002, the CAB has obtained interim and final restraint orders to the value of more than &euro;48 million and &euro;21 million respectively. In the same period, taxes and interest demanded were in excess of &euro;71 million, with more than &euro;46 million collected. In addition, social welfare savings amounted to more than &euro;1.4 million.</P>
    <P>Finally, on this issue of ring-fencing, it is implied in the proposal that drug prevention and treatment initiatives in this State are not being adequately funded and that such a measure is <Col N="1456" /> required to source a channel of funds. Nothing could be further from the truth. This Government has a strong and ongoing commitment to tackling social exclusion through the many programmes and initiatives it operates in disadvantaged areas in which tackling drug misuse remains one of the key priorities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs co-ordinates the implementation of the national drugs strategy which was launched in May 2001. The strategy brings together all elements of drugs policy in Ireland into a single framework with responsibilities clearly assigned. It contains 100 separate actions across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research to be carried out by a range of Departments and agencies. Under each of the four pillars, a series of objectives and key performance indicators is set.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the strategy is continuing. Progress is monitored on an ongoing basis through regular meetings of the interdepartmental group on drugs chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, as well as through six monthly progress reports to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion.</P>
    <P>The work being done by the local drugs task forces is another vital element in the ongoing fight against drugs. As many Deputies will be aware, there are 14 local drugs task forces in Dublin, Cork and Bray. The task forces were established in 1997 and include representatives of the statutory, community and voluntary sectors as well as local public representatives, including many Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>These Deputies will be aware of the ongoing valuable work the task forces carry out. The purpose of the task force is, through partnership, to address the service gaps in the area and to co-ordinate existing services. They have made an enormous impact over recent years by means of preparing a local action plan, which includes a range of measures on treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task forces have been an effective way of delivering services and engaging local communities. They are an excellent example of how Departments, State agencies, front-line workers, communities and politicians can work together in partnership and I commend the commitment and hard work of the many individuals and agencies involved in this process. Most task forces are currently implementing their second round action plans. To date, the two plans have funded approximately 500 local projects.</P>
    <P>In monetary terms, since 1997, more than &euro;130 million has been either spent on or allocated to projects in the local drugs task force areas through the two local action plans. Of a total of &euro;65 million, &euro;11.5 million has been spent on the premises initiative for drugs projects and &euro;54 <Col N="1457" /> million on the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.</P>
    <P>In 2003, the allocation for the drugs subhead has increased by approximately 16% over 2002. This subhead funds the work of the local drugs task forces, the premises initiative for drugs projects and the National Advisory Committee on Drugs. This shows clearly that the drugs issue remains a priority for this Government and rather than starving the drugs strategy of funding, it has, in fact increased the level available in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. Its overall objective is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund is the 10-21 year old cohort whose members are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, involvement in crime and or drugs, etc.</P>
    <P>While the main focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas, funding has also been allocated to a number of urban areas where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The target areas selected were Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow.</P>
    <P>A separate allocation was made to seven voluntary organisations to deliver drug prevention education programmes &ndash; including peer education programmes &ndash; on a national basis. Since 1998, an amount of &euro;68.2 million has been allocated under the fund and the bulk of this &ndash; approximately &euro;54 million &ndash; has been allocated to local drugs task force areas. The overall amount allocated also includes funding of &euro;9.1 million for the springboard initiative which is managed by the Department of Health and Children. In addition to these initiatives, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform supports and develops evidence-based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending. These measures include the Garda youth diversion projects of which there are 64. These projects represent a community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved or further involved in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" />The first Garda youth diversion projects were established in major urban areas but projects are now in operation in both urban and rural areas throughout the State. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of Garda youth diversion projects from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The allocation of funding for the 64 Garda youth diversion projects, together with the seven local drugs task force projects, for 2003 is &euro;5.577 million compared to just over IR£400,000 when the Opposition was last in office in 1997, an increase of over 1000%. These figures underline this Government's commitment to fighting the harm to communities from the impact of drug misuse, an aim which is of course shared by Deputies on all sides of this House and which is, I am sure, the motivation behind this proposed Private Member's Bill. However, for the reasons I have outlined, I must oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset of the discussion of the merits of the two substantive proposals contained in the Bill that such discussion was without prejudice to any further debate and these matters can be further considered on Committee Stage of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Shea. I congratulate Deputy O'Dowd on presenting this legislation which has my full support, especially the sentiment expressed in section 3, which &ldquo;enables the Minister for Justice to ensure that the proceeds of crime seized by the State are applied to appropriate organisations and initiatives who are focussed on redressing the damage caused by those engaged in drug related activities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I disagreed entirely with the Minister's long and detailed presentation. He said he opposed the legislation primarily because we already have the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999 before us and went on to outline large sections of heads that would be introduced. I have the feeling that once again the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce a set of amendments that will be larger than the Bill in question, which seems to be the model the Minister is using.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999 is still on Committee Stage four years later, with no effort or sense of purpose in processing it through the Dáil. The Minister said there would be no need for a separate corruption bureau, which was the main tenet of that Bill. Since 1999 I and others have been telling the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and his predecessor, that there is no need for separate legislation to deal with white collar crime. That could be done under the existing Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, as the Mini<Col N="1459" /> ster is admitting. When the former Commissioner of the Garda Síochána appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights he conceded that there was no need for extra legislation on this matter. Why do we have to wait for this legislation?</P>
    <P>The Minister's second point was to reject the ring-fencing of the funds that would be forthcoming from the Criminal Assets Bureau. There is little hope of support from the Government for this legislation. The Minister's grounds for rejecting the ring-fencing seem spurious because the Government has already accepted the principle and the practice. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has already imposed a levy on plastic bags which is ring-fenced to deal with environmental issues. That is not going directly into the Exchequer. The Minister might also remember that one of the principal recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts following the DIRT inquiry was that the funding extracted from the financial institutions should be ring-fenced and used for valuable community purposes. The Government accepted the findings of that committee, yet the Minister is not prepared to accept the principle of ring-fencing which is desirable on many issues, particularly this one.</P>
    <P>The two most valuable crime-fighting Acts produced in modern times were the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 introduced by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance, which is now being amended, and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 which was introduced by Nora Owen, then Minister for Justice. They were introduced to pursue the ill-gotten gains of the drug barons who flourished in the 1990s and murdered Veronica Guerin, the eminent journalist who reported on that murky underworld of drug trafficking and gangland killings. Since its establishment in July 1996 the Criminal Assets Bureau has seized tens of millions of euro. The law states that any ill-gotten money and property seized by the CAB must remain unused for a seven year period which has now elapsed. Under no circumstances should the money when released disappear into the Department of Finance. It should be ring-fenced for redistribution in the communities from which it was misappropriated through criminal acts, as this legislation proposes.</P>
    <P>The money would help to undo the damage caused by criminal activities and should be used to help finance projects and activities that would address the causes of crime. Community employment schemes, children's playgrounds, after-school services, young people's services and particularly drug-related initiatives could benefit greatly from such a rolling fund. It would be a novel sight to observe a community minibus funded from seized criminal assets with the slo<Col N="1460" /> gan emblazoned on its side: &ldquo;This bus has been funded by the local drug dealer now out of business.&rdquo; The proceeds of crime seized from criminals who prey on disadvantaged communities should be ploughed back into the communities from which they have been extracted.</P>
    <P>Community policing is an important concept. It involves gardaí liaising with the local authority and community representatives in drafting strategies to respond to crime and anti-social behaviour. The redistribution of the proceeds of crime for the benefit of the community should be an integral part of a new community policing model.</P>
    <P>There are three streams of money involved, one from interlocutory orders, accumulated since the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau and amounting to about &euro;21 million when the dollars and sterling are included. Another is a result of action by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, approximately &euro;1.5 million. The largest results from the tax action conducted by the Revenue Commissioners which is in the region of &euro;46 million. The legislation refers specifically to the first stream, the interlocutory orders, comprising the direct proceeds of crime, including property that has been seized and laundered money. The other two streams are indirect proceeds of crime. The total amount collected in the last seven years is approximately &euro;70 million. That could be a regular stream of funding which could be used annually, not as a substitute for existing State funding but as a supplement to boost and extend the activities of community initiatives and projects. Communities would be very glad to have this money directed for that purpose. A slogan of the type I mentioned would do wonders for a community.</P>
    <P>Let me return briefly to the issue of community policing which I believe would tie in well with the proposals from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of the Garda Síochána Bill. I have no doubt he will accept amendments in that regard. The situation involves the Garda, local authorities and the community. By distributing the proceeds of crime for useful projects within a community, it would re-establish the link which has been broken in many areas between the community and the police. That could be an integral part of good quality community policing.</P>
    <P>The Bill is meritorious and I am glad it has been presented in the House. However, I am very disappointed the Minister did not have a single good word to say about it, in terms of a willingness to accept any of its proposals. He just waffled on, for the entire duration of his speech of 30 minutes, about the heads of legislation totally extraneous to this debate. I hope he will have a more positive approach to the Bill in any later comments he may make.</P>

I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy O'Dowd and the Fine Gael Party on bringing it before the House.</P>
      <P>Seven years is certainly an excessive waiting period for holding money seized before it goes to the Exchequer. The principle of paying the money to drug-related initiatives identified by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is sound and equitable. This is obviously the most effective disbursement of the proceeds of crime towards undoing the damage delivered on communities by drug barons and drug dealers.</P>
      <P>A review of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008 will be carried out next year to determine its overall effectiveness in achieving key strategic goals. The strategy contains 100 separate actions across the pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research to be carried out by the relevant Departments such as the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Education and Science. The urgent need for further qualitative research is highlighted by the discrepancies in two recently published reports.</P>
      <P>The global survey from the United Nations office on drugs and crime found that levels of abuse of amphetamines, or &ldquo;speed&rdquo;, were more than five times higher in Ireland than in most other European countries. The report also showed that Irish people were the world's second biggest abusers of ecstasy after Australia. Such was the extent of drug use in Ireland, as identified by the United Nations, that the director of the office on drugs and crime warned Irish people that they were &ldquo;playing a dangerous game of Russian roulette.&rdquo;  On the other hand, a report referred to in the media today suggests that drug use among young people in this country is not as high as that reported by the UN office on drugs and crime. The joint report from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs in the Republic and the Drugs and Alcohol Information and Research Unit in Northern Ireland stated the UN figures covered the period 1995 to 1999 and, therefore, in their view, out of date.</P>
      <P>What these contradictory reports highlight is the urgent need for informed debate on the extent of drug abuse, based on the most up-to-date information and statistics. In the context of distributing money to communities ravaged by drugs, it is vital that we are fully informed about the extent of drug abuse and the location of the pockets of the country worst affected in order that the funding can be targeted directly to where it is needed most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to ensure the best use is made of the proceeds of crime, as envisaged in Deputy O'Dowd's Bill, the situation on the ground in <Col N="1462" /> terms of drug abuse must be closely monitored at all times. That said, I am concerned that, in practice, the income derived from the proceeds of crime could be quite erratic and drug-related initiatives should not have to rely on it for their operation. No doubt, the Government would say the money acquired from the Criminal Assets Bureau would be supplementary to Government investment but, in practice, it could simply become a substitute for contributions otherwise coming from the budgets of the Government and health boards.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt as to the major success of the Criminal Assets Bureau since its inception in 1996. Up to the end of last year, the bureau has obtained interim and final restraint orders to the value of over &euro;48 million and &euro;21 million, respectively. However, in the nature of things, the amount and value of property, the subject of High Court injunction by the CAB, vary from year to year, to the extent that it must be doubted whether it would constitute a reliable income stream for the sort of activity promoted by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Drugs present enormous problems. For instance, it has been alleged that paramilitaries have part of the action in the supply of drugs. There is a major problem of alcohol abuse which, in many ways, is just as harmful as the drug culture. There are serious problems of public disorder in towns and villages and our cities every weekend. There is a frightening rise in the level of violence in a couple of our cities. Murder has become too commonplace in the context of competition between those who want to control this evil activity. Young people at risk need to be identified at an early stage in order that measures can be put in place to deal with their situation before it becomes a real problem in terms of exposure to drug peddlers.</P>
    <P>There is also a culture with regard to the recreational use of drugs, perhaps at weekends, on the part of people who would be regarded as otherwise law-abiding. It must always be kept in mind that, whether drugs emanate from Afghanistan, Colombia or Amsterdam, they come from criminal sources. Anybody who buys drugs, for whatever reason and however minimal their use may be, is funding crime &ndash; that is the net effect. Huge fortunes are being accumulated by those involved in the drugs trade at top level.</P>
    <P>We have to take account of problems in our society, including what I believe to be a big deficit in parenting skills. We need to help and support young people at risk at the earliest possible stage. Sadly, respect for authority has declined. Politicians and others must seek to re-establish this respect while those in authority must endeavour to earn it. One of our biggest difficulties is that there is now a spiritual vacuum, not in a narrow religious sense but in the finer points about human beings. We seem to have lost our strong <Col N="1463" /> community spirit, the meitheal concept, which was so much a part of the community in which we grew up.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the important issue of the condition of St. Ailbe's vocational school in Tipperary town. The school has 490 students, down from 680 in 1997. As in many others towns, the school is competing with others in the area, namely, the convent and the Christian Brothers school. It deals with children of unemployed parents, of whom there are many, particularly in Tipperary town which, as the Minister knows, has suffered numerous job losses in recent years, hence its inclusion in the RAPID programme. In that context, the Government has been helpful to the people of the town and the programme is making an impact where it is important. However, Tipperary is still the second poorest town in the country.</P>
      <P>Anyone who visits St. Ailbe's vocational school recently, as I did two weeks ago, will see at first hand the deplorable state in which it is. When it was built in the 1970s, the builder got into financial difficulties which led to problems with workmanship on the building, wherein lies the real problem. I understand the school authorities have requested assistance from the Department of Education and Science in order to carry out top-class refurbishment of the school. I cannot overstate the importance of the repair works which need to be carried out. A recent report showed that many areas needed to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable to expect staff to sit in the cramped, airless conditions in the school's staff room. The Minister knows the importance of creating the right conditions in order that teachers can do their work. The administration area must be enlarged as it is too small. The reception area &ndash; just inside the door &ndash; is too confined while the woodwork, metalwork and other rooms all need refurbishment. The project has been submitted to the Department of Education and Science and I hope for good news from the Minister tonight or, if not, in the near future, when his Cabinet colleague can let the authorities know when they can expect it.</P>
      <P>South Tipperary has benefited hugely from the Government's making finance available in recent years, particularly in Cashel, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir. However, Tipperary town feels left out, particularly in regard to its vocational school. I hope we will have good news in the near future.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf and that of the Minister for Education and Science, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the current position on an application for refurbishment works at St. Ailbe's school in Tipperary town.</P>
      <P>St. Ailbe's is a co-educational second level school with an enrolment of 388 pupils. It is one of three post-primary schools operating in Tipperary town, the others being St. Anne's secondary school and the Abbey School. County Tipperary South Riding Vocational Education Committee, the management authority of St. Ailbe's, has submitted an application for additional accommodation and refurbishment works. This application is under consideration in the school planning section of the Department of Education and Science. In advance of making any major capital investment at the school and consistent with standard practice in the Department, the long-term viability of the school must be assessed. This assessment is being undertaken by the school planning section. Pending its completion, substantial capital investment cannot be made at the school. The Minister for Education and Science wishes to confirm also that the Department has recently received a revised health and safety report and a revised report on proposed remedial works at the school from the VEC. Both reports are being examined in school planning section in the context of the overall assessment to which I referred. In the meantime, any urgent minor works required to be undertaken at the school will be considered as part of the 2004 capital programme.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that over the last five years the Department has provided almost &euro;170,000 in capital funding for St. Ailbe's. This money was expended on perimeter fencing, replacement ceilings, floors and heating.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise the matter of the proposed closure of St. Catherine's College of Home Economics, Sion Hill, Blackrock, County Dublin and the Minister for Health and Children for coming before the House to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks the management of St. Catherine's College of Home Economics received a letter from the Department of Education and Science stating the college was to be closed; that, from next year, no new first year students would be enrolled in the college, and that it was intended to consolidate teacher education for home economics in St. Angela's College, Sligo. There had been no consultation with the board of management, president or staff of the college, although I understand there had been discussions with the trustees concerning their future plans for <Col N="1465" /> the college premises. St. Catherine's College of Home Economics, which is located in my constituency, has produced generations of home economics teachers for the nation's schools. It is a high quality college whose four year course results in a teaching degree from Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The decision to close the college is a bad one and should be reversed. The State has recently invested &euro;1.5 million in upgrading the teaching facilities and kitchens which will be wasted if the college is now to be closed. Furthermore, its closure will leave the eastern part of the country without a home economics teacher facility. While St. Angela's in Sligo is a fine college, it is located more than four miles from Sligo town and may not attract students who would otherwise attend St. Catherine's. While prospective students may be relocated to Sligo, it will not be so easy to relocate staff, many of whom have roots in the Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire areas. Therefore, there will be real job losses arising from the decision to close the college.</P>
    <P>Is it such a good idea to simply consolidate the two colleges with a combined annual output of 50 teachers per annum? Schools already find it difficult to recruit home economics teachers and there is a case for increasing the number of such teachers; home economics should be taught more widely in the school system, justifying a larger number of teachers and a larger requirement for teacher education facilities.</P>
    <P>In advance of making this decision, the Department of Education and Science commissioned a report on the options facing St. Catherine's College. That report, referred to as the O'Brien report, should be published in order that we can see the options examined and how they were evaluated.</P>
    <P>If the trustees are no longer prepared to house the college, there were other options that could have been examined. The Dominican Sisters have given many years of committed service to education in Blackrock and I hope they will continue to do so. The Department of Education and Science could rent the premises from the trustees or enter into an arrangement with them to maintain the college on this site. Was that option considered? Were other options that would have allowed St. Catherine's to continue to operate in its present location examined? Could it not have been made part of the education department of Trinity College Dublin, which provides its degrees, or of the education department of UCD, which has a facility on the nearby Carysfort campus? A meeting should be held as soon as possible between the Minister and the board of management of the college because it has not had an opportunity to discuss the issue with him, even though it has requested such a meeting.</P>
    <P>The college should be kept open. It is not good for teacher education in general and home econ<Col N="1466" /> omics teacher education specifically to proceed with the amalgamation of St. Catherine's College and St. Angela's College. There is a strong case for the retention of St. Catherine's College. We all accept that things may have to change but options other than the complete closure of the college and removal of its facilities could be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science to respond to the issue raised by Deputy Gilmore and I thank him for raising it.</P>
      <P>St. Catherine's College of Education for Home Economics, Sion Hill, Blackrock, County Dublin, is a private institution owned by the Dominican Order. It is one of two colleges recognised by the Department of Education and Science as providing a home economics teacher training course, St. Angela's College, Lough Gill, County Sligo, owned by the Ursuline Order, being the other.</P>
      <P>The course is of four years' duration and leads to the award of a B.Ed degree in home economics and each of the two colleges has 100 full-time students on the course. The Department of Education and Science provides an annual grant to St. Catherine's to cover approved B.Ed training course expenditure not met by the college's own income.</P>
      <P>The future of both of the home economics colleges, and the question of closing one or both having regard to the demand for home economics teachers, has been an issue since the 1980s. It had been planned to consider the question of their future in the context of the outcome of the review of the steering committee on the future development of higher education. The then president of St. Angela's, Sr. Marianne O' Connor, was a member of that committee representing the specialist colleges. When the committee issued its report in June 1995, it had not completed its examination of specialist teacher requirements, such as home economics, art and music, which had been part of its remit. It recommended, however, that the necessary review and analysis should be pursued further jointly between the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>In May 1996, the then Minister for Education requested the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the advisory group on the supply of and demand for second level teachers with revised terms of reference focusing, <i>inter alia,</i> on the determination of specialist teacher needs outside the HDip programme. The terms of reference also sought recommendations on required intake by subject type. The review was concluded in June 1998 and recommended that the intake to St. Catherine's and St. Angela's Colleges remain at the then combined level of 53 students per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" />In the context of a fundamental appraisal by the Dominican congregation of their future role as trustees of educational institutions generally, the Dominican trustees of St. Catherine's College have decided that, for personnel and financial reasons, they are no longer in a position to fulfil the role of trustees of the college. We pay tribute to the Dominican congregation for its contribution to education, particularly in the context of St. Catherine's. Having reached this decision, however, the trustees began discussions with the Department of Education and Science with a view to transferring the trustee role and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Arising from this, the Department of Education and Science examined options for the future of the college. Having carefully considered all of these, and having also taken into account the national spatial strategy; relevant costs in a time of financial constraint; a Government decision to restrict public service numbers; and, the need to secure value for money and a better allocation of resources, the Minister for Education and Science decided that these considerations will be best served by the closure of St. Catherine's and the designation of St. Angela's College, Sligo, as the sole centre for the training of home economics teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science wishes to assure the Deputy that he did not take this decision lightly or without a consciousness of the impact it will have on the staff of St. Catherine's. The Department of Education and Science has already met with the trustees of St. Catherine's to make the necessary practical arrangements, including those concerning the position of the staff of the college. The Minister for Education and Science has also indicated that it is intended that the closure of St. Catherine's will be phased over the next four years to facilitate students currently enrolled in completing their course of training in the college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Liam Twomey. We are not looking for a radiotherapy centre for every town and village in Ireland, as has been implied, but are simply trying to ensure people have proper access to one. It is obvious that Dublin has a surplus of radiotherapy centres but the plan is to site even more in the city. That does not make sense and represents centralisation, the enemy of ordinary people. It would make more sense to sell the site at St. Luke's and develop centres beside the universities because of the need that exists on the peripheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that proximity to a centre will not be a deciding factor in the siting of the units but he misses the point. Proximity to a cen<Col N="1468" /> tre is not sought for personal convenience but because many cancer patients are too unwell to travel and consultants will not send people to centres where the distances are too great. Half of those who require radiotherapy need it for palliative reasons to reduce pain and relieve suffering. They cannot travel now and the proposed system will make matters even worse.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group used the findings of a patient study to highlight that distance to travel for treatment was ranked 13 in order of importance. The Minister stated that this is significant because it challenges the notion of the three most important aspects to the organisation of services from the users' perspective &ndash; location, location, location.</P>
    <P>Shamefully, only 19 counties were represented in the sample for the report with 44% of patients travelling less than ten miles one way and fewer than 3% travelling more than 100 miles one way. Only 13% spent two or more hours on the journey and, significantly, some consultants in St. Luke's refused to participate because they disagreed with the study format. That data should be thrown out.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that geography will not be a barrier to equal access but he has ignored the findings of the small areas health research unit study in Trinity College that state the inclusion of Limerick and Waterford would increase the population within 60 minutes travel time by up to 15%.</P>
    <P>There is no significant advantage in terms of maximising catchment population by including three Dublin hospitals instead of one. The additional two Dublin hospitals increase the catchment population by under 1% in each travel time band of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. In the initial phase until 2014, each health board will experience a doubling of elderly and cancer patients. What, then, is the rationale in further centralising the service doing the work? It is already too centralised and the proposal to further centralise it makes no sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND" hpid="Dr. Twomey Dr. Twomey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Health and Children for attending on this important issue. Many of the arguments we make have been made before, but we will keep reiterating the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The south-east region will have an increased population with more elderly patients and expected increases in cancer care by 2010, as outlined in the report to justify a full accelerator unit for the region, which has again been rejected by the review group. The Minister spoke recently of regional centres of excellence for certain speciality care, a proposal contained in the Hanly report. The south-east region has regionalised its cancer services because everyone understands the concept of critical mass <Col N="1469" /> and quality care and we are only awaiting radiotherapy services.</P>
    <P>We should question the Government's commitment to the development of these regional centres of excellence. One cannot say that the regional hospitals in many areas are on a par with many of the Dublin hospitals. Unless there are plans to put an embargo on consultant appointments to the teaching hospitals, it is unlikely that the regional centres, never mind the local hospitals, will be on a par with some of the Dublin hospitals.</P>
    <P>What is the timeframe for improving the radiotherapy services? That it has taken ten years to get as far as producing a report on the European Working Time Directive does not bode well for the implementation of these reports' provisions. The report on radiotherapy services states that restricted numbers of treatment centres require the development of innovative transport solutions. This has not happened in recent years. The Hanly report stated that when acute services, be they accident and emergency or maternity, are closed, the workload should be carried by GPs. As someone who works at the front line, although not as much as I used to, I cannot understand how this workload can be passed on to general practice in view of the problems I see developing over the next five years. I cannot see that anything innovative can be done to the ambulance services without the provision of massive amounts of money. What will be the outcome for the local and regional hospital set-up? If the consultants' contracts are not re-negotiated quickly and radically, it is unlikely that many of the proposals in the Hanly report will work out. All we are seeking in this matter is that irrespective of where one lives in the country, one has equal access to the same quality of care in an equitable manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's position on the future development of radiation oncology services nationally and thank the Deputies for raising the issue.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, I recently launched a report on the development of radiation oncology services. The report is a most authoritative analysis of radiation oncology and provides a detailed plan for the future development of radiation oncology services in this country. It represents a milestone in the development of radiation oncology services in the country. The Government has accepted the report's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject what has been said by Deputies Cowley and Twomey. I am disappointed that both Deputies, who are general practitioners, would be so critical of the conclusions of the expert group on how radiation oncology services should be developed across the country. How can one argue <Col N="1470" /> that developing first class centres in Galway and Cork is akin to the centralisation of all services in Dublin? We are currently faced with an historical deficit of radiation oncology services. This means that we have one centre of excellence in St. Luke's, which is the only cancer care centre in the State, and two machines in a developing centre in Cork. The report was basically saying that we need a backbone before we can move forward. We need to walk before we run and be practical and realistic about what is achievable in the short to medium term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND" hpid="Dr. Twomey Dr. Twomey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no timeframes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government also agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first step of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. I agree with the report's conclusion that this is the best model to provide a radiation oncology service to the highest standards. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the backbone of future service expansion. The development of radiation oncology services, along the lines recommended in this report, is my single most important priority in cancer services in the acute setting.</P>
      <P>In the short term, I have approved the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the Cork centre and the necessary capital investment amounting to &euro;4 million to commission this service as rapidly as possible. I have also approved the appointment of a project team to prepare a brief for the rapid expansion of current capacity from four to eight linear accelerators.</P>
      <P>I also intend to prioritise the necessary resources to ensure that the radiation oncology centre in Galway is in a position to treat patients from spring 2005. I have also requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate the expansion from three to six linear accelerators in the medium term. I will give early approval to the establishment of a project team to plan this expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recommends that two treatment centres should be located in the eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas, and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas. I propose to discuss the implications of the report with the St. Luke's Hospital board shortly. I have asked the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children to advise on the optimum location of radiation treatment facilities in Dublin. The chief medical officer will <Col N="1471" /> apply the guidelines established by the group. Based on the advice from the chief medical officer, who will be supported by my Department's hospital planning office and external assistance, I will decide on the location of the services.</P>
    <P>Radiation oncology centres will be required to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. The radiation oncology centres will provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions. This is currently the case and as more radiation oncologists are appointed, it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that in a patient survey, carried out on behalf of the expert group, distance to travel for treatment was ranked 13th in order of importance. The highest level of patient care was considered to be the most important aspect of service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an independent survey of patients' views. Having spoken to patients, the bottom line is that people want to go where they will have the best chances of survival.</P>
      <P>I fully endorse the report's findings that equity of access to the highest quality radiation oncology facilities is a right of all cancer patients. The Government has also decided that in the further development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and in the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access, regardless of location, and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a co-ordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report. A national radiation oncology co-ordinating group has been established which will, <i>inter alia ,</i> facilitate improved access to existing and planned services. The group will comprise clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland marks a significant milestone in radiation oncology services <Col N="1472" /> nationally and its guidelines and recommendations are essential in the development of these services for cancer patients over the next number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy James Breen. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important issue and welcome the Minister for Health and Children to the House to listen to my concerns and those of Deputy James Breen.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years, there has been a huge erosion in funding of health services in County Clare. At Ennis General Hospital, this has resulted in the loss of 30 bed numbers, maternity services, funding for vital equipment in the general hospital, such as cat scanners and ultra sound machines. There have also been cutbacks that have affected ward upgrades, general infrastructure upgrades and, above all else, accident and emergency facilities, where much life-saving work was carried out by a dedicated team of doctors and nurses. Many promises were made by the Government before and after the last general election regarding the provision of &euro;15 million to upgrade these facilities.</P>
      <P>Last week, I put down a parliamentary question on the same issue. The reply stated that a briefing document was approved and endorsed by the Mid-Western Health Board and a request for approval to appoint a select and design team was under review by the Department of Health and Children. It also stated that it was expected that the review would be completed shortly. That reply, together with many announcements by local Oireachtas Members to the media, led many to believe that the work was going ahead.</P>
      <P>Was the decision on the upgrading put off to await the publication of the Hanly report? Will the Government use the Hanly report as a justification for not proceeding with the above promised improvements to the general hospital?</P>
      <P>The Hanly report is a dangerous experiment. The pilot project proposed for the Mid-Western Health Board region will result in the deaths of many Clare people if accident and emergency services are downgraded in Ennis General Hospital. This has been confirmed by an experienced consultant working in the accident and emergency unit. Some 90% of admissions come through this unit with 4,500 admissions each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent the Kilrush electoral area on Clare County Council. Many of my constituents have to travel to Ennis General Hospital and the journey can take one and a half hours. There are villages like Cross and Kilbaha and towns like Kilkee with a population of up to 25,000 in the summer and Carrigaholt where there was a tragedy last weekend. If the Hanly report was to be implemented, <Col N="1473" /> emergency cases would have to pass Ennis General Hospital and make a journey of up to two and a half hours to Limerick Regional Hospital to get accident and emergency assistance.</P>
    <P>Since the Hanly report was published, my constituency office has been inundated with callers relating their experience of Ennis General Hospital stating that, were it not for the accident and emergency unit there, they would not be alive today. How many of the consultants who contributed to the report ever stood in Ennis General Hospital? How many have worked in the accident and emergency unit of a rural hospital? The report has been prepared by consultants in an urban centre of excellence environment. It will not work in a county like Clare. I, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider the proposals. This is the 148th report and its findings cannot be delivered. I suggest the Minister should leave it on the shelf to gather dust like the others before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen" hpid="Mr. J. Breen Mr. J. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon I asked the Tánaiste how she would get rid of the Hanly report &ndash; by recycling, incineration or sending it to a landfill site, as that is all it is good for. When I entered Clare County Council 18 years ago, a former Minister for Health from the Labour Party decided that the hospitals at Ennis and Nenagh should close down. There was an outcry from my party at the time, which is still the Minister's party. Then along came a new Minister &ndash; the present Ceann Comhairle. A march was due to be held to protest at the downgrading of Ennis General Hospital. We were advised to stay away and everything would subsequently be rosy in the garden for the hospital. There were 120 beds, which were reduced to 80.</P>
      <P>The present Minister for Health and Children visited the county three years ago. I visited Ennis General Hospital two days before him and was afraid to stand still for fear of being painted. He announced the provision of £15 million for upgrading the hospital but has reneged on his promise and has no intention of spending this money. He said consultants would be employed but then sat back. Fianna Fáil thought it had three handy seats in Clare and that it could con the people of the county and win them back. However, they gave Fianna Fáil its answer and returned me to watch the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister now has the Hanly report recommending that Ennis General Hospital become a local hospital with the loss of our accident and emergency unit. This will mean Clare people going to Limerick and having to wait five or six hours to be seen in its accident and emergency unit. What about people in places in west Clare like Loop Head, Carrigaholt, Miltown Malbay and Spanish Point who might have heart attacks? Must they choose their time for getting a heart attack? Must we choose the time when chemicals pass through the town of Ennis? The Roche <Col N="1474" /> chemical plant is located in Clarecastle and there are others in Shannon. What would happen if there was a major accident in those plants or at the international airport? Where would the casualties be catered for?</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to bring forward a proper package of reform for the health service. He is now hiding behind the Hanly report which should be marked in red and placed in the dustbin where it belongs. I call on the Minister to provide for proper health reform or else I will ask the Taoiseach to have him removed to the backbenches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the concerns raised by the Deputies. I established the national task force on medical staffing in February 2002. I asked it, among other tasks, to devise an implementation plan for reducing average working hours of junior doctors in line with the European working time directive. At present, most front-line medical care in our hospitals is delivered by junior doctors, most of whom work excessively long hours. The task force set out to answer a key question. How do we safely provide hospital services, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as the working hours of our junior doctors reduce in line with EU law?</P>
      <P>The task force responded by setting out a new way of organising hospital services. Its proposals mean that no hospitals will close. Instead of supposedly &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo; hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital, the report proposes to bring services closer to patients while ensuring services are both safe and sustainable. The task force has recommended that a full range of acute hospital services be available in each region, including the mid-west, in order that patients should not have to travel beyond it other than for services best provided at supra-regional or national level. It also recommends investment in local hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital in order to provide more services for patients, including elective medical and surgical procedures, out-patient services, pre and post-natal maternity services and better access to diagnostic facilities.</P>
      <P>Contrary to some claims, hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital will not lose their ability to treat all patients presenting with illness or injury. Instead, the task force report recommends that emergency or life-threatening conditions should be treated in multi-specialist hospitals which have all of the staff and expertise required.</P>

      <P>This policy offers the best outcome for patients. The report recommends that all minor injuries and illnesses which do not require complex or multi-specialist support services should continue to be treated in hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital. This means that local <Col N="1475" /> hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital will continue to treat around 70% of all the patients they currently see in accident and emergency departments.</P>

The concern is not over taking the patient to the nearest hospital but over providing on-the-scene treatment speedily and then bringing the patient to the hospital best equipped for his or her condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key step in the forthcoming reform process is capital development of facilities at hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital. A briefing docu<Col N="1476" /> ment has been prepared by the project team for the hospital. This followed my announcement some time ago. While it has taken some time, it must be remembered it was a two way process. It sets out the broad scope of proposed future development and will be considered in the preparation of an outline development control plan for the hospital.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has endorsed the briefing document and identified a number of elements, including ward upgrade, radiology, out-patients and a general infrastructure upgrade as priority areas for development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 94, 95, 100, 141, 386, 388, 393 and 394 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. As pointed out in the national spatial strategy, in many rural areas the combination of a high dependency on a changing agricultural base, a scarcity of employment opportunities and resultant out-migration, has weakened their demographic, economic, social and physical structure.</P>
      <P>In my statement welcoming the publication of the national spatial strategy last November, I said the strategy sets down clear markers for the way ahead in rural development. The strategy addresses many of my concerns in relation to such issues as rural housing, services and cultural identity. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities, while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies, ensuring that key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and ensuring also that rural settlement policies are responsive to the differing local circumstances in different areas.</P>
      <P>In my address at the recent Irish Rural Dwellers Association conference in Caherciveen, I reiterated the statement in the White Paper on Rural Development that</P>
      <P>To achieve the aim of a balanced rural population, planning policy should, as far as possible, facilitate people willing to settle in rural areas, especially those wishing to remain in their own areas of origin. At the same time as respecting the aspirations of the rural community, planning policy must be sensitive to the conservation of the rural environment, including preservation of natural beauty spots and natural habitats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is currently at an <Col N="1479" /> advanced stage in preparing rural housing guidelines which I will shortly be consulted on. The intention is to issue them as a public consultation document before the end of the year. The guidelines will also be aimed, through the operation of the planning system, at securing greater public awareness of the issues involved in rural settlement policies and greater consensus on the practical implementation of those policies. I have not been in contact with An Taisce in relation to planning applications.</P>
    <P>Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in 1999. The policy agenda is a broad one, involving the remit of many of my colleagues in Government and their related agencies. It covers such issues as agriculture, infrastructure, transport, environment, health and education and the challenge is to ensure coherence in pursuing our rural development objectives.</P>
    <P>For example, in the recent CAP reform negotiations, my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, generally achieved Ireland's objectives. We have a balanced outcome that will reshape the Common Agriculture Policy and secure its future in making it more relevant to modern society. The reform of CAP will help safeguard the rural economy and environment.</P>
    <P>In the case of my own Department, the LEADER+ programme is an EU initiative designed to encourage the implementation of integrated, high-quality and innovative strategies in rural communities. The initiative is delivered by 22 local action groups. The allocation for LEADER+ for the period 2000-2006 is &euro;73.6 million and the initiative is co-funded by the EU.</P>
    <P>The national rural development programme closely complements the Leader+ initiative but focuses more on mainstream activities, primarily rural/agri-tourism. It is operated by 13 local groups. Again an element of innovation is required for all activities funded. The allocation for 2000-06 is &euro;75.7 million, again co-funded by the EU.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier in my reply, factors such as a high dependency on a changing agricultural base and a scarcity of employment opportunities have contributed towards a decline in rural population. In response, I introduced the CLÁR programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. Areas in 18 counties have been selected under this programme. This number includes areas I announced last January in honouring the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to review the areas in light of the 2002 population census results. These areas suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 2002 with an average population loss of 50%. The exception is the Cooley Peninsula, which was included based on the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced under the pro<Col N="1480" /> gramme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the outset. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health broadband and sports projects. They are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments or public utilities, as appropriate, thus ensuring efficiency and effectiveness as well as meeting the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in assessing the effects of placing development workers in rural communities as a method of expediting rural development and reducing poverty. For this purpose, I announced funding for four pilot projects in May 2002, aimed at testing the success of development workers in regenerating particularly disadvantaged rural areas. These projects are operating through a variety of community-based initiatives. They are intended to help reduce rural deprivation in the long-term by creating sustainable development. The initiative is being supported from the rural development fund of my Department. The purpose of the fund is to finance research, evaluation and pilot actions to provide information and advice for policy makers on important rural development issues.</P>
    <P>Last month I announced that Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, have been appointed to carry out a review of enterprise support in rural areas. This review will analyse official enterprise support (including tourism enterprise) already available in rural areas. The greater Dublin area, gateways, hubs and their areas of influence will be excluded from the analysis. This will ensure that the focus remains on regions that have not benefited from urban-generated economic growth. The way in which existing supports are delivered will be examined, particularly with regard to EU state aid law, the national spatial strategy and Exchequer financial constraints. Also to be reviewed is the number and role of agencies needed to optimise enterprise development in rural areas and yet avoid unnecessary duplication.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department funds the Western Development Commission, whose functions include promoting, fostering and encouraging economic and social development in the western region and the operation of the western investment fund. Activities include policy analysis and review which feed in turn into policy development and planning in my Department. At my request, the commission is now developing a strategy for towns on radial routes in its region to maximise the benefits of the national spatial strategy, major roads investment, the strategic rail review and decentralisation.</P>
    <P>My Department also supports the Gaeltacht areas through a range of measures. All of these are aimed at the promotion of sustainable and culturally vibrant communities and the maintenance and strengthening of the use of the Irish lan<Col N="1481" /> guage. Last year for example capital grants exceeding &euro;16.5 million from my Department were approved for the improvement of Gaeltacht infrastructure, including roads, marine works, village renewal and various recreational facilities such as community centres, playing fields and other such amenities. A further &euro;4.7 million was expended by my Department in 2002 under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts in order to further improve the housing stock in the Gaeltacht. My Department continues to support Gaeltacht households who provide suitable accommodation for learners of Irish who attend Irish language summer colleges. My Department also provided &euro;1.5 million last year for various organisations working in the Gaeltacht to maintain and strengthen the Irish language and culture there.</P>
    <P>Údaras na Gaeltachta, which, as the Deputies are aware, discharges its responsibilities through a range of socio-economic activities in the Gaeltacht, received a total of &euro;42.9 million from my Department last year to allow it to continue with the development of the Gaeltacht economy and the preservation of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The budget for islands in 2003 is &euro;80.479 million, and will continue the work of ensuring the provision of services and infrastructure on the islands. In terms of advancing rural development generally at both EU and national level, the Deputy can be assured that I and my Department are availing of a range of opportunities, to meet this challenge agenda.</P>
    <P>The next meeting of the National Rural Development Forum on 7 November will consider principles and challenges of rural development. Given the lapse of time and other significant developments since its publication a review of the White Paper on Rural Development is also in prospect.</P>
    <P>In summary, my Department is unstinting in seeking to advance measures to support rural development through the provision of community focused schemes which deliver tangible benefits to thousands across our towns, villages and countryside, policy research and related measures, and critical innovations in support of enterprise and infrastructure across rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department plans to host a high-level conference at official level during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union. It will be held in County Galway from 19 to 21 May 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conference will address issues in regard to future economic and social cohesion policies for specific areas of the European Union that have <Col N="1482" /> recognised territorial handicaps, namely, islands, mountainous areas and sparsely populated areas.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will understand, a detailed programme for the conference has yet to be finalised. It is envisaged that, in addition to civil servants from the various EU member states, representatives from the EU institutions and other relevant EU organisations will participate in the conference deliberations.</P>
    <P>The role of people from the areas in question in the conference is also being examined. In order to advance preparations for the conference, my officials have already met with officials in the directorate-general for regional policy in the European Commission and a further meeting is due to take place shortly.</P>
    <P>The timing of this event for May 2004 means that it will take place after the formal enlargement of the EU on 1 May 2004. In addition, therefore, to the overall objective of making a contribution to furthering strategic consideration by the EU in this important policy area, this conference should provide an occasion on which to celebrate with, and welcome, new members to the European family.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>The fifth meeting of the National Rural Development Forum will take place on 7 November 2003 in Cashel, County Tipperary. The programme for the forum has been finalised. It will include workshops to deal separately with the issues of principles and challenges of rural development. There will also be a presentation on disability issues in a rural context by the Disability Federation of Ireland and a progress report on the study of supports for enterprise in rural areas, the CLÁR programme and on the Leader mid-term review. The forum will conclude with a questions and answers session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum was first convened in May 2000 and the last meeting was held in January 2003. Issues discussed at previous meetings included progress on the implementation of the White Paper on Rural Development, farm incomes, the national spatial strategy, rural transport, rural tourism, <Col N="1483" /> rural planning, and financial services in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The forum was established to debate current issues, review existing programmes and suitable policy responses to rural problems. Its membership is broadly representative, from Departments and State agencies to the social partners and the wider voluntary and community sector.</P>
    <P>The forum therefore provides an opportunity for various actors involved in rural development to voice their ideas about the way forward.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my Department's strategy statement that the sectors-associated goals of the Department may be categorised under four headings: supporting community and local development by facilitating communities, with a special focus on areas of disadvantage, to pursue social and economic progress in their areas; tackling drug misuse by securing a more integrated and co-ordinated response by State agencies to tackling drug misuse; promoting rural, Gaeltacht and islands development by supporting living and working populations in these areas and fostering sustainable and culturally vibrant communities; and supporting the use of the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas and promoting the use of the language throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as the statement of strategy covers a three-year period, my Department's priorities will adjust over time. This will happen as various objectives are achieved, or when intervening developments argue for sensible refocusing.</P>
      <P>Within the broad headings listed, priorities at this time include:</P>
      <P>1. Community and Local Development: ensuring sustained and enhanced targeting of resources towards disadvantaged communities; achieving improved coherence across local and community development structures; and reform of the law relating to charities.</P>
      <P>2. Drugs Misuse: continuing the implementation of the national drugs strategy including implementing the plans of the local drugs task forces, overseeing the development of the regional drugs task forces and completing the research programme of the NACD. In this context, the drugs strategy will be reviewed in 2004, which will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" />3. Rural, Gaeltacht and Islands: advancing the development agenda in these areas and initiating a range of initiatives at EU and national level designed to improve infrastructure, services and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>4. Irish Language: implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003 and the recommendations of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the context of Irelands Presidency of the EU during 2004, my Department will particularly focus on three areas of our remit concerning drugs, EU co-ordination issues, islands and rural Europe. The hosting of these eventsconferences offers key opportunities for promoting our agenda in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I attended and gave an address at the recent 3rd annual European Small Islands Network conference which was held on Inis Oírr on 11 to 13 September 2003.</P>
      <P>While the official report of the conference will not be available from the organisers until later this week, I can confirm to the Deputy that the holding of this conference has proved to be a most fruitful exercise as it provided a forum for communities from small islands all across Europe to share information with a view to progressing issues of common and specific interest to them. The European Small Islands Network (ESIN) represents over 1,130 islands with permanent populations of between one and 5,000 comprising a total population of almost 99,500 people and it provides a voice to these communities which otherwise would not be heard.</P>
      <P>A number of issues were agreed by ESIN members at the recent conference including that the European Commission and the European Parliament be urged to: give special consideration to the needs of the small islands of Europe; recognise the distinctiveness of small islands, particularly in the context of framing cohesion policy and Structural Funds for the period post 2006; and acknowledge that, because small islands have special needs, ESIN should have a role in representing the interests of these islands direct to European institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Running in parallel with the conference was a youth networking seminar which brought together young islanders from six European countries to discuss common problems faced by young people on the islands of Europe. This initiative, in my view, is to be greatly welcomed as island communities will continue to dwindle if efforts are not made to provide island youth with <Col N="1485" /> opportunities comparable to those available on the mainland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that ESIN now proposes to incorporate the young islanders ideas and proposals into its future work programme and to develop this initiative in future years with a view to increasing opportunities for the exchange of young people between islands of different countries. ESIN members also welcomed the announcement that Ireland will be the first EU state to host a major conference on island affairs during our Presidency of the EU in 2004.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to have a copy of my conference address forwarded to the Deputy and I will also forward the official report of the conference when it becomes available.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, tá Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla ina dhlí ó mhí Iúil 2003. Is é príomhchuspóir an Achta ná soláthar níos mó de sheirbhísí i nGaeilge a chur ar fáil ón seirbhís phoiblí ar chaighdeán níos airde.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gceist faoi chomharthaíocht, tugtar cumhacht don Aire faoin Acht rialacháin a dhéanamh maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge, nó na Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla, ar chomharthaí, ar fhógairtí béil, ar stáiseanóireacht agus ar fhógraí. Tá sé i gceist agam na rialacháin cuí a dhéanamh san athbhliain agus cinnte beidh mé ag súil leis go mbeidh feabhas suntasach le teacht sar i bhfad ar an méid Gaeilge agus ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge a bheidh le feiscint ar chomharthaíocht bóithre agus a leithéid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le cur i bhfeidhm an Achta go ginearálta, tá réamhobair nach beag déanta nó idir lámha cheana féin ag mo Roinn. Ó ritheadh an tAcht i mí Iúil seo caite, scríobh mo Roinn go dtí na comhlachtaí poiblí atá i gceist &ndash; thart ar 650 ina iomlán &ndash; le cóip den Acht agus achoimre ar <Col N="1486" /> na príomhfhorálacha. Tá próiseas idir lámha freisin faoina dtugann oifigigh de chuid mo Roinne-se cur-i-láthair do chomhlachtaí poiblí maidir le himpleachtaí an Achta dóibh, tráth a bhíonn deis chun tuilleadh eolais a thabhairt agus saincheisteanna a phlé.</P>
    <P>Agus an tAcht á chur i bhfeidhm ag comhlachtaí poiblí, is féidir bheith ag súil leis go gcruthófar postanna i gcúrsaí traenála, aistriúcháin agus mar sin de san earnáil phríobháideach ach, ar ndóigh, ní cheist domsa mar Aire meastachán a thabhairt ar an méid postanna a d'fhéadfadh a bheith i gceist thar tréimhse ama. Is cinnte, áfach, go mbeidh gá tarraingt ar inniúlacht teanga ó go leor daoine sna hearnálacha poiblí agus príobháideach araon chun go gcuirfear an tAcht seo i bhfeidhm ina iomláine.</P>
    <P>Bunófar oifig choimisinéir na dteangacha oifigiúla chun faireacháin a dhéanamh ar chomhlíonadh an Achta ag comhlachtaí poiblí agus chun féachaint chuige go gcuirfear é i bhfeidhm.

      <P>As required by legislation, the board presented its disbursement plan for approval this summer and following detailed consideration, the plan was approved subject to a number of amendments.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board is currently advancing its consideration of the practical arrangements necessary to enable commencement of the implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>The current value of the fund is in the order of &euro;180 million. However, consistent with advice from the Department of Finance, the board has agreed that not more than &euro;30 million will be disbursed annually.</P>

      <P>Following consultation with the Department of Transport, and with the approval of the Department of Finance, the funding towards the development of Knock International Airport, Charlestown, County Mayo, is being made available by my Department under the CLÁR programme for disadvantaged rural areas. This is the only regional airport in a CLÁR area. Expenditure under CLÁR is met from subhead O3 in my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>Supporting regional airport development was identified as a potential investment measure for the development of the areas included in the CLÁR programme. Further investment in airport development in CLÁR areas is not proposed at this time.</P>
      <P>As regards RAPID, the Deputy will appreciate that it is the responsibility of each Department to fund proposals from RAPID plans that fall within funding measures in their Department. Airport development was not identified as a priority for local areas in the RAPID plans.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 142 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 is that regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, be established throughout the country.

      <P>I am happy to say that virtually all of the task forces are now up and running and are meeting regularly.

      <P>The situation regarding drug use patterns in the Drogheda area will be considered by the RDTF established in the North-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>I expect that the action plans for the RDTFs will be developed during the course of 2004 as the work referred to above is completed. They will then be submitted to the national drugs strategy team for consideration and ultimately to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion for approval.</P>

      <P>The priorities which my Department has proposed in respect of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in 2004 are: islands conference in Galway, 19-21 May 2004; <Col N="1489" /> rural development conference in Mayo, 30 and 31 May and 1 June 2004; drugs strategy meeting of national drugs strategy coordinators in Dublin, 15 and 16 June 2004.</P>
      <P>All three events would be high-level meetings at official level. They have been included in the calendar of such meetings for the forthcoming Irish Presidency, which was deposited very recently in the Oireachtas Library by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I would plan to open the two conferences, and the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Noel Ahern, would open the national coordinators meeting.</P>
      <P>The timing of the events for May and June 2004 means that they would take place after the formal enlargement of the EU on 1 May 2004. In addition, therefore, to their overall objective of making a contribution to furthering strategic consideration by the EU in three important policy areas, they should provide occasions on which to celebrate with, and welcome, ten new members to the European family.</P>

      <P>In the social policy agenda adopted in June 2000, the European Commission prioritised corporate social responsibility as part of its strategic goal to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.</P>
      <P>While the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment enjoys lead responsibility for co-ordinating EU policy in relation to CSR at national level, my Department maintains regular contact with that Department on developments, given the commitment in the programme for Government to support initiatives to expand CSR.</P>

This is an integral element of my Department's strategic objective of assisting communities, especially those suffering disadvantage and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>In September I approved a grant of &euro;105,000 over the next three years to Business in the Community which is a leading organisation in Ireland promoting CSR activity. The grant will assist the organisation in helping the community and voluntary sector enhance its capacity to engage with the corporate sector by assisting it in identifying its needs and communicating them to business. The funding will help create an important conduit in facilitating skills transfer from businesses to the community and voluntary sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 390 together.</P>
      <P>I launched the CLÁR programme, Ceantair Laga Árd-Riachtanais, for disadvantaged rural areas on 5 October 2001. CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources. The 2003 allocation of &euro;9.517 million is continuing this leverage and delivering an effective and comprehensive work programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas selected are those which have suf<Col N="1492" /> fered the greatest depopulation since 1926, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula, which was included based on the serious difficulties caused for that area by foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>Arising from the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, on 17 January last I announced the extension of the CLÁR areas to include an additional 189 DEDs, bringing the total to 890 in 18 counties. The total population in the extended CLÁR areas has increased from 284,000 to 362,000.</P>
    <P>CLÁR funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, broadband and sports projects. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the outset. However, no formal plan was developed for each CLÁR area as it was felt that such an approach would lead to delays and frustrations and dissipate funds on planning rather than action. Instead, as far as is practicable, the selection of individual projects is carried out at local level such as county council, Leader group or local community level. The measures were agreed with the lead Departments or State agencies, as appropriate. Other measures may be introduced, depending on needs identified.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to send a list of all measures, approvals and related expenditure to Deputies Sherlock and Durkan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 111, 122, 138 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to earlier parliamentary questions on the review of local and community development structures that I initiated with my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, in particular my reply to Question No. 79 on 3 June 2003, my reply on 26 March 2003 and my reply to Priority Question No. 76 earlier today. Deputies will be aware that the review process includes an independent review of Area Development Management (ADM) Limited.</P>
      <P>The review has taken account of the work of the Task Force on the Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems. I should point out that the current phase of the review has concentrated on local and community development structures and could not be said to be an audit of the supports available to support community services across agencies and Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in these replies, following a com<Col N="1494" /> prehensive consultation process, which was advanced at a national seminar held in June, I am developing proposals that I intend, with my colleagues the Ministers for Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to bring to Government before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The implementation of any proposed changes to structures, including Partnerships or to ADM, and the timing of any such changes, will depend on the outcome of Government's deliberations in this regard.</P>

      <P>I can confirm for the record of the House that my private office wrote to Foras na Gaeilge immediately after I replied to the previous question to ask that the requested information be made available directly to the Deputy. I am very disappointed to hear from the Deputy that Foras na Gaeilge has failed to supply that information within a reasonable timescale.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the chief executive of Foras na Gaeilge that this failure resulted from an administrative oversight. I have also been informed by him that the particulars have now been forwarded to the Deputy together with an apology. He advises that measures are being taken to avoid such a recurrence. The chief executive further assures me that he is deeply aware of his obligations in relation to accountability and respect to this House.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102, 103, 106, 108, 127 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware it is the role of my Department, supported by ADM, to coordinate the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, therefore, a matter for each of the other Departments to report on progress on the implementation of the programme in relation to proposals that fall within the remit of their own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" />Plans have been prepared for each of the 45 RAPID areas and proposals from these plans have been forwarded by ADM Limited to relevant Departments for consideration. Proposals from 32 RAPID areas were relevant to my Department and the estimated cost of these proposals is in the region of &euro;65 million.</P>
    <P>Proposals from RAPID plans relevant to my Department fall to be considered under the community development programme, CDP, funding for local drugs task forces and the young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF.</P>
    <P>Allocations of funding to six new community development projects in RAPID areas were announced earlier this year. Projects in Bluebell, Dolphin House, Inchicore, Merchants QuayUshers Quay, Longford town and Tipperary each received a renewable one-year contract for funding of &euro;60,000. In addition, in 2001, core funding was provided under the CDP to St. Munchin's CDP &ndash; £100,000 (&euro;127,000) was provided to the building project and &euro;25,000 was paid to St. Munchin's in 2002 towards equipping the centre.</P>
    <P>An amount of &euro;1 million was also allocated under the premises initiative to a local drugs task force project in Tallaght. In addition, the Deputy should note that since the establishment of the RAPID programme, my Department has provided approximately &euro;3 million by way of support to the local areas in the preparation and implementation of their plans and administration costs associated with the support team in ADM.</P>
    <P>Proposals for funding under the YPFSF will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in the light of the overall funding position for 2004. I continue to be committed to the implementation of the RAPID programme and I believe that RAPID can contribute significantly towards tackling urban-large town disadvantage. However, as I have said in the past, I am unhappy with certain aspects of the programme. In particular, I consider that a large number of proposals have been submitted unnecessarily to Departments for consideration. Many of the small, localised actions from the plans could be dealt with more efficiently at local level.</P>
    <P>To this end, I propose that funding will be made available to RAPID areas for these small localised actions in 2004. This funding will be used as leverage money to enable local bargaining, negotiation and co-funding to take place. RAPID area implementation teams will be involved in this process. The actual amount of funding that will be available will be determined in the context of the ongoing estimates process. Officials in my Department are making the necessary arrangements with relevant parties to enable this approach to be operational from 1 January 2004.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards CLÁR, the measures introduced under the programme were decided after consultation with the communities in the areas concerned. Furthermore, they are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Depart<Col N="1497" /> ments or agencies, as appropriate, thus ensuring coherence and effectiveness by public bodies in delivery of such measures in CLÁR areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 132 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. The strategy contains 100 individual actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, which will be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. Since it was launched in May 2001, considerable progress has been made in implementing the actions set out in the strategy. In this context the interdepartmental group, IDG, which I chair, receives regular reports from the relevant Departments and agencies on progress, as well as reports on the work of the national drugs strategy team, the young people's facilities and services fund and the national advisory committee on drugs. In addition, the group debates policy issues relevant to the strategy and has invited speakers to make presentations on various drugs related topics, such as homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six monthly progress reports on the strategy are provided for the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, the most recent of which was submitted to the October meeting of the committee. It is intended to submit a further progress report on the strategy to the committee early in 2004. In terms of progress to date, it should be noted that the number of methadone treatment places has increased significantly in recent years. The number of places at the end of June 2003, the latest date for which confirmed figures are available, was 6,704. The equivalent figure at the end of 2000 was 5,032. The first phase of a national awareness campaign was launched last May. The campaign featured television and radio advertising supported by an information brochure and website, all designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland. The second phase, which is due to be <Col N="1501" /> rolled out in the coming months, will specifically target parents.</P>
    <P>The majority of the regional drugs task forces are now up and running and meeting regularly. They are currently working on mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas as well as the range of existing services with a view to addressing gaps in service provision. A coastal watch programme has been launched and a number of measures to enhance drugs detection capability at points of entry are being implemented. Guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drugs policy have been developed and were issued to all primary and post-primary schools in May 2002. Extra support staff have been recruited to enable the delivery of substance misuse prevention programme in all schools from the start of this academic year. More than 1,120 recovering drug misusers are now participating in the special FÁS community employment programme. The strategy also provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by the end of 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving its overall key strategic goals and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy, if necessary.</P>
    <P>My Department also has responsibility for the work of the local drug task forces which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. Mores than &euro;14.5 million has been allocated to the task forces to implement their second round of action plans. A further &euro;11.5 million has been allocated to capital projects under the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects. In addition, more than &euro;59 million has been allocated under the young people's facilities and services fund. The main aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>As regards the national alcohol policy, the Deputies will be aware that this is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who is pursuing a number of initiatives in this area. The national drugs strategy calls for increased links between both policies in terms of cross-representation on the relevant committees and working groups to ensure complementarity between the different measures being taken and this is being done. I am not aware of any plans at present to merge these two areas which may be partly due to the different policy responses required for legal and illegal substances. As regards the task forces, they were set up to address the issue of illicit drug use in their areas and I do not consider it appropriate at this stage to dilute the focus of their work.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date in regard to the implementation of the Irish Language Act 2003; the role his Department will play in regard to monitoring the implementation of the provisions; if an assessment has been undertaken of the staffing implications for the public service generally of the provisions of the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the enactment of the Official Languages Act in July last, my Department has written to the approximately 650 public bodies covered by its provisions to provide them with a copy of the Act and a summary of its main provisions. The Department is also providing briefing sessions for public bodies which so request to further inform them of the implications of the Act and to discuss its specific implications for them. In addition, preliminary work has commenced on the preparation of regulations in relation to the use of official languages on stationery, signage, advertising and in oral announcements. I expect to be in a position to commence Part 5 of the Act which deals with place names in the near future and to make the first orders under that Part this year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Act includes provision for the establishment of the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga. The coimisinéir will be independent in the functions of his or her duties. Those functions will include monitoring and ensuring compliance with the Act. It is my intention that the office of the coimisinéir will be in put in place early in 2004. My Department is currently engaged in necessary preparatory work in that regard. My Department is also responsible for agreeing statutory schemes with the head of each public body in accordance with the Act. This will involve negotiation with and provision of advice to public bodies. Each scheme will run for three years and thereafter fall to be renewed. I am already on record as saying that I intend to use the renewal process to secure further real improvements over time in the availability and quality of public services through the Irish language.</P>
      <P>It is not expected that the implementation of the Act will have any overall effect on total public service numbers. Full implementation of the Act will require us to draw on the language competences of significant numbers of people across both the public and private sectors. It is more appropriate, therefore, to focus on the Irish language capability requirements arising from the Act. In that context, I have made reference to up to 2,000 such persons being affected. Significant competence is already in place. However, developing additional capability will challenge public bodies in the areas of human resources management and recruitment policy as implementation of the Act progresses over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of the Irish language needs of individual public bodies is a matter for management in each public body concerned. However, <Col N="1503" /> given my Department's role under the Act, I anticipate that we will also be working closely with such bodies in supporting implementation by them of the Act in this regard. It may be anticipated that employment will also be created outside of public bodies in training, translating, etc.</P>

      <P>My Department recognises the need to co-ordinate its service delivery approaches with those of other Departments and bodies. Management of cross-cutting issues is vital to the effective performance of the Department because many key functions are performed in tandem with a wide range of other State agencies. The Deputy will be aware that one of the mechanisms for advancing progress on these cross-cutting issues is the interdepartmental committee on community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs. This provides a forum for agreeing joint actions with other Departments and agencies on issues of material interest to my Department.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment, the committee has played an important role in the co-ordination of the provision of State services for communities, including urban, rural, Gaeltacht and island communities, as well as in relation to matters concerning the Irish language. Arising from the work of the committee, mainly through a series of bilateral meetings, a number of improvements have been made to schemes operated by other Departments. It is my intention to continue to pursue specific issues of importance to my Department's remit through this forum, particularly on a bilateral basis with the Departments and agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>There is a linkage between the drift of people from the countryside towards larger centres and urban disadvantage. People from rural areas have moved to towns and cities in significant numbers over the years. Frequently the urban areas to which such people move do not have the social supports, context or the facilities to handle a burgeoning population. Urban disadvantage, or at least increased pressure on existing social infrastructure, is an unfortunate inevitable consequence. The maintenance of viable rural communities, therefore, in addition to being an intrinsic good, can have beneficial alleviating effects on urban disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is timely given that the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, for which my Department has responsibility, yesterday published the results of a national population survey of drug use. This is the first occasion that a comprehensive survey has been carried out on an all-island basis on the extent of drug misuse. The survey shows that cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug with one in five or 18% of the population having ever used the drug. This rate is higher among young people between the ages of 15 to 24 with almost 24% having reported using cannabis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident, however, that through the implementation of the 100 actions in the national drugs strategy 2001-2008 and through projects and initiatives operated under the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and ser<Col N="1506" /> vices fund the problem of cannabis use is being addressed. In this context, the Deputy should note that more than &euro;14.5 million has been allocated to the task forces to implement their second round of action plans. In addition, more than &euro;59 million has been allocated under the young people's facilities and services fund. The main aim of the fund is to attract at-risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.</P>
    <P>Regional drug task forces, RDTFs, are also being established in each of the health board areas throughout the country and many of these are now up and running. As a first step in the process of developing action plans, the task forces are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas and the level and range of existing services. Where cannabis use is found to be a problem, this can be reflected in the measures proposed in their actions plans. Funding decisions for 2004 will be taken in the context of Government deliberations on next year's Estimates.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund which operate in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. Through these initiatives a wide range of projects and services are being supported, some of which involve the employment of outreach workers. These people play a vital role in tackling the drugs problem in their areas and many of them work with at-risk young people trying to divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. Information as to the current numbers of such workers is not available to my Department. However, I regard them as committed people whose ongoing work and support is vital to the continued implementation of the national drugs strategy in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In July 2001 the Government, following an independent assessment of the applications, selected 35 local action groups and three collective bodies to deliver the Leader+ programme and the national rural development programme. All local action groups delivering the programmes in the period 2000-06 were awarded a specific allocation for the duration of the programmes. All groups were initially awarded an advance of 10% of their total allocation. Groups must submit monthly financial returns to the Department outlining their monthly expenditure. Further advances may be requested by individual groups once they have spent at least 50% of funds previously advanced to them. If the Department is satisfied with their returns and with the day-to-day delivery of the programmes they are delivering, then the advance will be authorised.</P>
      <P>Under the current programmes a total of &euro;63,233,000 has been allocated to the BMW region, while &euro;74,237,000 has been allocated to the south and east region. In percentage terms, the BMW region has been allocated 46% of the total funds, while 54% has been allocated to the south and east region. I am satisfied that both regions are getting an appropriate share of the overall funding available taking into account the relative size of population in each area. I am confident that all funding allocated will be drawn down by the groups.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for Government policy on social inclusion lies primarily with my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. However, there are a number of ways in which the community and voluntary sector is facilitated by my Department to feed into Government policy on social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In furtherance of the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector, my Department co-chairs the implementation and advisory group which was established to oversee the implementation of the White Paper's recom<Col N="1508" /> mendations as part of the Government's long-term strategy to develop and support the community and voluntary sector. In this regard, I announced in September last the successful applicants on two major White Paper funding initiatives &ndash; the scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector and the scheme for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector. Together these schemes will direct &euro;7.4 million in funding to support 58 organisations in the community and voluntary sector over the coming three years. These arrangements and funding constitute significant mechanisms to assist the sector to contribute to policy on social inclusion.</P>
    <P>In addition, the voluntary and community sector have opportunities to express their views both formally and informally through their ongoing contacts with my Department. Given the scale of input by my Department to various Government fora on social inclusion &ndash; for example, I am a member of, and report to, the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion &ndash; there is also regular communication between my Department and the national office of social inclusion. My Department is also involved in a variety of fora, such as the national anti-poverty strategy, which have an important input into social policy. In accordance with established practice, my Department is also asked to comment on matters for Cabinet decision, including those matters relating to social inclusion. The sector can avail of significant opportunity through the Department to contribute to social inclusion policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 389 and 391 together.</P>
      <P>My Department administers a number of grant schemes to assist voluntary groups to continue providing valuable services for the community. The community development support programme, CDSP, primarily funds community projects to employ co-ordinators, community support workers and administrators. The funding made available to individual projects through the CDSP is designed to cover the core administrative operation of the projects and to provide the catalyst for community development activity in the catchment areas. Earlier this year, I announced the inclusion of an additional 15 groups into the CDSP with effect from September 2003. In all, &euro;21.3 million will be provided for groups funded under the CDSP in 2003.</P>
      <P>My Department also administers the scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations. This scheme provides funding for voluntary organisations for such activities as the purchase of equipment or the running of training courses. I have provided &euro;2.356 million for this scheme in 2003. My Department also administers the scheme of community support for older people, CSOP, that provides funding for the provision of security alarms for elderly people living alone. I have provided funding of &euro;3.44 million for this scheme in 2003.</P>
      <P>In September I announced the successful applicants on two major White Paper funding initiatives &ndash; the scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector and the scheme for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector. Together these schemes will direct &euro;7.4 million in funding to support 58 organisations in the community and voluntary sector over the coming three years. Funding provided by my Department does not cover the type of project work funded through community employment schemes. As the Deputy will be aware, the operation of the community employment programme is a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>Two CÁIT programmes were launched to enable those excluded from the benefits of information and communication technologies to engage in a meaningful way with the new technologies. Funding of &euro;7,44,516 was committed to 121 projects since December 2000. The CÁIT programme has enabled organisations to purchase IT hardware and software according to the individual, specific needs of their communities. Although the programme has come to an end, this equipment remains a fully accessible resource within communities. It will continue to minimise the burden of equipment and infrastructure costs, one of the key barriers preventing access to information technology. The CÁIT programme has directly led to the development of a pool of highly skilled volunteer tutors who have an in-depth understanding of the psychological and tangible barriers late adopters face in engaging with information technologies. A multiplier effect has been generated, as computer literacy skills continue to transfer throughout communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the CÁIT initiative has now closed, the Government's information society strategy, NEW <Col N="1511" /> CONNECTIONS, sets out a commitment to capacity building and to the development of supports to enhance ICT capacity among community and voluntary organisations. I have taken the view that an effective way to deliver access to IT to those who had previously benefited from the CÁIT programme is through existing community development organisations, including partnerships. Within this framework, the work previously carried out by CÁIT can be further advanced.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the reform of charities legislation has been under consideration for a long time. The examination and research on the reform which has been undertaken during the past 13 years have given rise, in particular, to the Costello, 1990, Burton, 1996, and Law Society, 2002, reports, as well as to the review of existing law in certain common law jurisdictions, for which Arthur Cox was the lead consultant, 2002. For that reason, priority was given in An Agreed Programme for Government to move from examination and research into the action phase, with a commitment to enact a comprehensive reform of the law relating to charities in order to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.</P>
      <P>A charities regulation unit was set up in my Department in February 2003. A draft consultation paper on establishing a modern statutory framework for charities is being prepared and I hope to be in a position to secure Government agreement to its publication shortly.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the role of my Department is to co-ordinate the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. Arising from discussions which my Department held with a range of Departments and agencies involved in tackling drugs, it was agreed that the early warning sub-committee of the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, will fulfil the role outlined in the programme for Government. As a first step, the issue of heroin use will be examined. In this context, the sub-committee will draw on the recent NACD capture-recapture study of the prevalence of opiate use, the upcoming general population study, the statistics available to the Health Research Board concerning demand for treatment nationally and Garda seizures. The NACD will present a report based on this information to the interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair, and I will then bring the report to the attention of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. Due to the timing of the preparation of the relevant statistics, it is unlikely that it will be possible to compile this report until early 2004.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 157 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited Pollathomas, County Mayo, the Tuesday following the landslide to hear the views of the local community. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has said that he intends to provide the maximum assistance for the people affected by the landslide and to Mayo County Council in their ongoing efforts to restore the infrastructure of the area. In this regard, his Department will recoup Mayo County Council 90% of the cost necessarily incurred in providing emergency accommodation for the families who were displaced from their homes. I understand that initially 16 families were housed in emergency accommodation and this number has now been reduced to seven. I understand that Mayo County Council has carried out interim repairs on <Col N="1514" /> the damaged roads and bridges to the extent that most roads in the area are now accessible.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, indicated on 15 October, he is acutely aware of the distress caused to people arising from damage to their homes by the recent landslides. Engineers from the Office of Public Works have already been assisting in the initial clean up together with Mayo County Council. In addition, the Office of Public Works will make funds available for humanitarian assistance to those whose lives have been affected. Officials from the Office of Public Works have made contact with the Irish Red Cross to initiate a scheme of humanitarian aid over the coming days. I understand that the criteria for determining eligibility for assistance will be similar to previous schemes, namely, death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to home or extreme hardship. The Minister of State has emphasised that the purpose of the scheme is to provide humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship, not compensation.</P>
    <P>I am considering to what extent I may be able to assist from programmes operated by my Department. My Department has already indicated to Mayo County Council that within the parameters of existing programmes, funding could be provided towards the reinstatement of the local graveyards and the provision of a protecting wall. Detailed proposals are awaited from the council which will be evaluated when received. I intend visiting the Pollathomas area again on 24 October 2003, as promised during my earlier visit.</P>

      <P>As outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 105 on 27 May 2003, my Department is continuing in partnership with Údarás na Gaeltachta to actively examine and implement recommendations of the working group on the creation of employment in the Gaeltacht to determine how they can be most effectively implemented. Arising from the working group's report, Údarás na Gaeltachta has formulated an action plan to tackle the significant unemployment problem in the north west Donegal Gaeltacht. A key objective of the plan is to approve 200 jobs per annum for the Gaoth Dobhair area, with the aim of achieving peak employment again in five years time. Extra staff resources in Údarás have been assigned to the Donegal Gaeltacht and a committee, under the <Col N="1515" /> chairmanship of Peter Quinn, has been formed to assist in the implementation of this action plan.</P>
      <P>The initiatives being pursued by Údarás na Gaeltachta include targeting new sectors of the economy; upgrading building and telecommunications infrastructure; and placing greater emphasis on high skills and on the resources of the Gaeltacht itself, including the Irish language. In this regard, Údarás na Gaeltachta's new scheme, Fiontraíocht Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, was launched this year and it supports the recommendations of the working group. Support is being given to a number of third level educational courses through the medium of Irish that are being provided by the National University of Ireland, Galway, in Gaoth Dobhair. This is a positive development and is also in line with the recommendations of the working group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the statement issued on 1 July last by the Western Development Commission, WDC. The WDC expressed concern at the underspend in the Border, midlands and west regional operational programme. It stressed that the allocated budget for the programme should be spent in the BMW region and called for expenditure to increase rapidly in the second half of the programme. The BMW Regional Assembly points out that the &euro;644 million shortfall was based on expenditure to date relative to the original indicative forecasts set out in the regional operational programme in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to set this figure in context to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding. I under<Col N="1516" /> stand that much of the underspent money relates to projects which have been approved and are in progress across various measures, but for which no funding had been paid out at the end of December 2002. There were a number of unavoidable delays in getting some measures up and running. These included the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 followed by severe weather conditions which restricted progress in the on-farm investment schemes and delays in State aid approvals affected tourism measures, waste management and some on-farm investment schemes. The broadband measure was hampered by the slowdown in the IT sector. It is still expected that these measures will spend their full allocation by 2006.</P>
    <P>Several measures are performing well, for example, local authority expenditure on non-national roads is ahead of target. Other measures performing well are county enterprise boards, fisheries harbours infrastructure, Teagasc advisory services and the local development programmes. Expenditure on national roads, however, is well behind target. I have expressed my concern to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, in that regard. I will keep the issue under review during the remaining period of the NDP.</P>

      <P>In October 2001, the air transport group at Cranfield University produced a report on the proposed development and day-to-day management of island airstrips and associated air services. One of the recommendations contained in this report is that new airstrips be constructed at Clifden and Inishbofin, County Galway and Tory Island, County Donegal. Although the report has not been formally published, copies have been sent to interested parties, including the relevant island co-operatives and development associations, and are available on request from my Department. I have also arranged for a copy to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report, the following steps have been taken: Department of Finance sanction has been obtained to proceed with the development of an airstrip on Inishbofin &ndash; I have accordingly authorised Galway County Council to purchase the land required for the project at the earliest opportunity to facilitate the commencement of construction prior to the <Col N="1518" /> expiry of planning permission for the project in December 2004; Údarás na Gaeltachta is, at the request of my Department, proceeding with the planning and design of an airstrip on Tory Island; a public service obligation has been introduced on the air route between Inis Mór, Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr and Aerfort na Minna, Indreabhán; and I have asked Údarás na Gaeltachta to bring forward plans to rectify deficiencies identified in the airstrips on the three Aran Islands. Planning permission has been obtained for the construction of an airstrip in Clifden.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector states the Government's long-term strategy to develop and support the community and voluntary sector. It sets out the rationale for developing the relationship between the State and this sector and the principles which should underpin this relationship.</P>
      <P>In September I announced the successful applicants for two major White Paper funding initiatives: the funding scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector, and the funding scheme for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector. Together these schemes will direct some &euro;7.4 million in funding to 58 organisations in the community and voluntary sector over the coming three years. Substantive matters considered to date by the implementation and advisory group, which was established to oversee the implementation of the White Paper's recommendations, include the multiplicity of funding sources through which the community and voluntary sector must operate; the designation of voluntary activity units in relevant Departments; accreditation of training in the community and voluntary sector; support for volunteering; the establishment of best practice standards in both the community and voluntary sector and the statutory sector; and the introduction of a more modern legal framework for the charities sector.</P>

      <P>The review of financial and audit requirements to which the Deputy refers is one of the outputs specified in my Department's statement of strategy 2003-05. This underpins a strategic approach to achieving greater coherence across the range of structures, processes and schemes supporting local and community development. Effective decision making and proper financial control are critical to advancing this agenda.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the review which is scheduled for completion this autumn, has involved a survey by my Department's corporate development division of the criteria and processes used across the range of schemes operated by my Department, including schemes supporting the local and community development sector. The purpose of this review has been not only to determine convergences and differences in managing schemes and programmes, but also to identify possible models of best practice. This review has been largely completed. It will feed into a number of wider processes with a view to providing best practice templates appropriate to the diverse programmes operated or funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>Since early this year my Department has strengthened its financial management control through more frequent reporting and regular reviews of expenditure within and across the schemes and programmes funded. In addition, an evaluation is currently under way of the internal financial controls of my Department in line with the recommendations of the working group on the accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers. My Department is also advancing a management information framework project in line with the strategic management initiative in the public service. This will involve the installation of a new financial management system to facilitate better financial and general management across the Department. A contract for the installation is likely to be placed in the coming weeks. Progress will be in phases, with full completion due in November 2004.</P>
      <P>To deepen the ethos of financial control and value for money, a systems audit of the community development support programme is getting under way. A review of expenditure on the local drugs task forces is also due to commence in the coming months. In the light of progress to date I believe that the work under way will lead to improved practices across the Department and deliver on the agenda for change as set out in the strategy statement.</P>

      <P>The national advisory committee on drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, published a study on the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland last May which estimated that there are 14,452 opiate users in Ireland. This estimate was based on statistics provided by three data sources for 2001: the central drug treatment list, Garda data and hospital in-patient data. This was the first formal estimate of the number of opiate users undertaken since 1996. However, it should be noted that the 1996 study which arrived at an estimate of 13,461 estimated prevalence for Dublin only.</P>
      <P>The latest study estimates that there are 12,456 opiate users in Dublin and a further 2,225 users outside the capital. The Deputy should note that the figures for Dublin and outside Dublin do not add up to the national total as all three figures are the result of separate statistical calculations and are performed independently of each other. The drop in prevalence figures in Dublin since 1996 is encouraging. Equally encouraging is the finding that the number of users in the 15-24 age bracket has reduced substantially which may point to a lower rate of initiation into heroin misuse. Since 1996 the availability of treatment for opiate dependence has increased significantly and this may be a factor in explaining the latest estimates. For example, there were 1,350 places available on the central methadone treatment list at the start of 1996, whereas currently there are approximately 6,800.</P>
      <P>Although many of the study's findings are encouraging, we cannot afford any degree of complacency. The Government remains committed to working in partnership with the communities most affected by drug misuse and the continued implementation of the 100 actions set out in the national drugs strategy remains a priority. I do not feel that any change in direction is warranted as a result of this report. The strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by the end of 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy if necessary.</P>

      <P>Despite the global economic turndown, the level of foreign direct investment, FDI, in Ireland relative to the size of the economy remains one of the highest in the world. Ireland continues to win a significant proportion of the projects available, despite the generally strong performance of many eastern European countries and the overall decline in the number of FDI projects in Europe as a whole. The recent world investment report from UNCTAD shows that worldwide investment flows declined from a peak of $1.4 trillion in 2000 to $651 million in 2002, a drop of 54%, and that flows into Europe declined by 45%. In contrast, it shows that FDI in Ireland, having declined from $26 billion in 2000 to $16 billion in 2001, a drop of 38%, recovered in 2002 to $19 billion, an increase of 19%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA has informed me that for a number of reasons, the recent Ernst &amp; Young report does not accurately reflect Ireland's performance in the FDI market. For example, the report includes a large number of projects in the automotive sector and the petrochemical sector, in which, for the most part, Ireland does not compete; Ireland is a small country and consequently has a very <Col N="1524" /> focused FDI strategy which targets a discrete number of sectors suited to Ireland's characteristics and strengths; and the report measures announcements of projects, many of which inevitably do not proceed, as opposed to actual start-ups.</P>
    <P>Because only a limited number of sectors are of relevance to Ireland, the IDA commissions its own market share report, an annual survey of FDI trends in Europe. This survey is carried out by Buck Consultants International of the Netherlands and shows that Ireland's performance and market share is holding up well in the sectors in which it competes. According to the 2002 report, during the period 2000 to 2002, Ireland increased its share of inward manufacturing investment to 9%, an increase of 3%, retained the same share of investment in software, 42%, increased market share in customer contact centres to 25%, an increase of 1%, and registered a similar gain in shared services to 34%, an increase of 1%. In a new investment category included this year &ndash; research and development centres &ndash; Ireland won an initial market share of 8%. The report also states that overall, the market share statistics point to a very good performance by Ireland when one considers the reduced number of inward investment projects available in the European marketplace and increased competition from lower-cost countries in central Europe.</P>
    <P>However, there is no room for complacency. Ireland is becoming increasingly uncompetitive for many basic manufacturing companies and we are putting policies in place to meet the challenge of moving companies here into higher value activities and attracting projects to replace those that are lost. If we are to benefit fully from an upturn in the world economy we need to ensure that pay increases here are in line with those in competitor countries and do not run ahead of increases in productivity; aggressively promote Ireland, particularly the regions, as an attractive location for high quality investment projects; continue the build-up in investment in research, technology and innovation that has commenced in recent years &ndash; this involves not just increased funding for third level research and development but also greatly increased support for innovation by indigenous companies and encouragement for these companies to link up with local third level colleges; deliver on critical infrastructure, particularly in transport, broadband and water and sewerage; and promote greater competition in the non-traded sector of the economy.</P>

      <P>The management and processing of work permit applications has been reviewed regularly by my Department and continues be monitored in detail. The priority is to facilitate employers needing key workers from outside the EU while at the same time ensuring that no Irish or other EU workers are being deprived of employment as a result. The problems that have arisen have been as a result of the very rapid increase in applications over the past three years. The figures given below are for permits granted and do not show total numbers of applications. Currently, new applications are being processed in less than four weeks and renewals more quickly again. Detailed statistics on work permits issued are available on the work permits page of my Department's website at <i>www.entemp.ie</i></P>

      <P>The CE programme is currently under review. An overall appraisal of active labour market programmes is being carried out under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market which is chaired by my Department. Publication of this report is a matter for consideration by the standing committee in due course. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. Future participation levels in the CE and JI schemes will be considered in the context of the Estimates provision for 2004, having regard to the outcome of the current review process which is nearing completion.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment her views on the meeting which took place in June 2003 between officials from her Department and representatives of the Comerama workforce, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny; if options put forward on the payment of enhanced redundancies to the workforce have been examined; if so, her views on these; if minutes of the meeting are available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two officials of my Department travelled to Castlecomer to meet union officials, worker' representatives and Mr. Martin Carroll, county councillor, at the Comerama factory on 23 June 2003. The manager of the company attended as an observer for a short while. The union officials and the workers' representatives made the case that the workers who had already been made redundant up to January 2003 before the new enhanced rates came into force in May 2003 should be retrospectively paid these enhanced rates. However, these workers were paid about 3.2 times the then statutory rate by the company on a voluntary basis. The company had also applied for and been paid by my Department its entitlement to a 60% rebate from the social insurance fund, SIF.</P>
      <P>The legal advice to my Department when issues such as this were considered during the drafting stage of the Bill to give statutory effect to the new enhanced rates was that retrospective effect could not be given as to do so would be placing a legal onus on employers retrospectively which the Oireachtas is not allowed to do in these circumstances. Unfortunately for the workers concerned, my Department is precluded from paying the enhanced rates of redundancy with retrospective effect. The case was also made on behalf of these workers that if it was not legally possible to meet their claim for payment of the enhanced rates, the Government should consider introducing a scheme to enable them to be paid the enhanced rates from the SIF as a special case. I have also considered this proposal and I believe it would be impractical. It would mean making a special case for the workers concerned on the basis that they had missed out by being made redundant quite a while before the new enhanced rates were passed into law. Many thousands of other workers are in a similar position and could also make a case for special treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also mentioned at the meeting that during negotiations with the employer the workers had intimated that they were at the time prepared <Col N="1529" /> to accept, in final settlement of their claim for extra statutory redundancy payments, the employer's passing on to them the 60% rebate he was entitled to receive from the SIF. I have also considered this, and it is quite clear that I have no say in what the employer does with the 60% refund, which he was legally entitled to be paid from the SIF.</P>

      <P>My Department intends to establish a single payment entitlement for each farmer based on the average number of animals &ndash; or hectares in the case of arable aid &ndash; eligible for payment of premium during the three year reference period 2000 to 2002. Details of the single payment entitlement will be notified to individual farmers during 2004. The EU Council regulation provides that a farmer whose production was adversely affected during the reference period by a case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances shall be entitled to request that the reference amount be calculated on the basis of the calendar year or years in the reference period not affected by these circumstances. Farmers will be given a specific deadline by which to notify my Department of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances. Each case will be examined on its merits. The arrangements to cover appeals under the single payment scheme will also be examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 to 173, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to Question No. 106 of 2 October 2003, my Department has received conflicting claims from the person named and another person for payment on a particular land parcel. Neither claimant has supplied proof of ownership of the land in question in accordance with the REP scheme specifications, which list the requirements for land to be deemed eligible for payment. While the person named has submitted documentation in support of her claim, it does not satisfy the REPS requirements. It is not the function of the Department to adjudicate on conflicting claims to land ownership.</P>
      <P>Both parties have been notified of the fact that there are conflicting claims and that no further payments can be made on the land until the conflict is resolved. They were also advised that if neither could provide evidence of title in accordance with REPS specifications, a joint affidavit could be submitted which, if acceptable, would enable payment to be made on the land. Their REPS planners will be in a position to advise them in this regard. A previous decision of the independent agriculture appeals office is currently being reviewed by its director.</P>

      <P>Following a process of consultation with the social partners and other interested groups, I have decided that from 1 January 2005 all direct payments for cattle, sheep and arable crops as well as the dairy cow premium will be fully decoupled from production. Discussions will take place between my officials and the European <Col N="1532" /> Commission on the detailed rules for implementing the mid-term review agreement.</P>
      <P>While it may be some time yet before the position is clear, my officials have already raised and will continue to raise a number of issues about farmers who have retired under the early retirement schemes and the implications for them of the decoupling and single payment proposals. By definition, retired farmers cannot activate entitlements earned during the reference period and the Commission's position is that entitlements should not be linked to land but should go to farmers who were active during that period. However, it has also indicated that it favours arrangements that family members who were not farming during the reference period but subsequently take over a holding will have access to the national reserve. My officials will continue working to secure as favourable an outcome as possible, having regard to the legitimate aspirations of all stakeholders.</P>

      <P>My officials will take into account the effects of the landslide in County Mayo when carrying out farm inspections for the REP <Col N="1533" /> scheme. Sympathetic cognisance will be taken of the disruption caused to farming activities by the unfortunate occurrence and the impact it has had on the ability of the farmer to comply with the specific REPS measures. For the on-farm investment and installation aid schemes, cases such as those referred to by the Deputy would be examined by my Department on an individual basis within the context of relevant <i>force majeure</i> provisions.</P>
      <P>Under EU regulations governing the livestock premium schemes, a farmer may be excused from the requirement to retain animals for the retention period if failure to retain such animals arose from circumstances outside of the farmer's control. Farmers are obliged to notify my Department of any such circumstances within ten days of any loss being incurred. No such notifications have been received in my Department's local office. The Department is not yet aware of any farmer affected by the landslide who is currently restricted under the TB or brucellosis eradication schemes. Any farmer who has such concerns is advised to contact his or her district veterinary office.</P>

      <P>Based on information from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, there were approximately 6,000 dairy farmers participating in the milk recording scheme in 2002, out of a total of 26,500. This amounts to approximately 23% of all dairy farmers in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am committed to encouraging and assisting the Irish dairy industry to achieve the greatest possible genetic improvement in the national cattle herd for the benefit of both the Irish farmers and the industry generally. There is evidence that greater value can be added to Irish milk by increasing the protein content of raw milk, and in so far as milk recording facilitates this, it is well worthwhile.</P>

      <P>The current tax relief for waste service charges is provided by granting a relief to taxpayers based on the charges they have paid to local authorities and private operators in the previous year, provided they have paid the relevant amount and on time. Where an annual charge applies, the full payment is subject to tax relief at the standard rate.</P>
      <P>In the case of payments made to local authorities, before 1 November in the year, the local authorities send the Revenue Commissioners an electronic list of the relevant persons who have paid the charges on time and have signalled that they wish to claim the relief. Revenue then incorporates the relevant tax credit &ndash; amount of charge allowed at the standard rate &ndash; into each person's tax certificate. However, where the refuse collection system is operated by private companies, the taxpayer must make a vouched claim direct to his or her tax inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" />Some areas operate a tag system where tags are purchased and attached to bins rather than paying an annual charge for collecting refuse. Currently, tax relief at the standard rate applies on an assumed charge for tags of &euro;195 per annum. Where the tag system is in place, a taxpayer using the tags must contact his or her tax inspector in order to claim the relief.</P>

      <P>Following the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in its report dated 25 September 2000, the Government decided to replace the then existing scheme in the Civil Service with a new scheme of performance-related awards. The new scheme applies to Civil Service posts at the levels of Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary with effect from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>Decisions on performance-related awards for individual posts are made by the Committee for Performance Awards based on recommendations from Secretaries General in the case of the Civil Service posts. The committee also decides on awards for Deputy Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners in the Garda Síochána, based on recommendations from the Garda Commissioner, and on awards for Brigadier Generals and Major Generals in the Defence Forces based on recommendations from the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. The schemes for the relevant ranks in the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces were introduced with effect from 1 May 2002.</P>
      <P>The Committee for Performance Awards comprises the Secretary General, Public Service Management and Development, Department of Finance, the Secretary General to the Government and three members from the private sector. Decisions on awards are based on an assessment of performance against pre-set objectives. The individual objectives vary from area to area but go beyond the normal requirements of the jobs and are derived from the strategy statements for the organisations.</P>
      <P>The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.</P>
      <P>The first awards under the new scheme of performance-related awards were approved by the Committee for Performance Awards earlier this year in respect of 2002. A total of 190 persons in the Civil Service, or in organisations under the aegis of a Government Department, participated in the scheme and received awards. In addition, awards were approved for 12 persons in the Garda Síochána and 11 persons in the Defence Forces. The total cost of the awards made in respect of 2002 was approximately &euro;2 million. This amount comprised approximately &euro;1.9 million for the Civil Service posts, approximately &euro;79,000 for the ranks in the Garda Síochána and approximately &euro;57,000 for the ranks in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>In its annual report for 2002, the Committee for Performance Awards indicated that the proportions of the groups concerned which received different ranges of awards were as set out below. This information relates to the 213 persons for whom awards were approved by the committee i.e. 190 in the Civil Service, 12 in the Garda Síochána and 11 in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>The Government has considered the impact and extent of the damage caused by the landslides and has initiated an <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme of humanitarian assistance to relieve individual hardship caused by the landslides. The scheme is being administered through the Office of Public Works with aid distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
      <P>The aim of the scheme is to provide humanitarian assistance and not to compensate for losses.

      <P>The Irish Red Cross Society has considerable experience and an excellent record in implementing similar humanitarian aid schemes and I am confident that all applications for aid will be assessed and dealt with speedily confidentially and sympathetically.</P>

      <P>The demand of the Illois-Chagossian natives to return to the Chagossian archipelago is a complex issue which also involves competing sovereignty claims. At present, the matter of the Chagos Islanders' right of return and claim for compensation is the subject of legal proceedings in both the UK and US. I understand that, while the Chagossian islanders' claims for compensation and immediate return were dismissed recently in the High Court in Britain, this verdict may be appealed.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to monitor the situation of the Chagossian archipelago and the claims of the Chagos islanders, and would wish to see the issue resolved in agreement by all concerned parties.</P>

      <P>Ireland is not a producer of armaments and is only a small producer of other defence equipment.</P>
      <P>The European defence equipment sector has been undergoing change and restructuring since the end of the Cold War. A number of factors have influenced this change and restructuring, including a general decrease in defence budgets, the lessening of state financial involvement in national defence sectors, the impact of rapid technological change on manufacturing and development costs, as well as the nature of modern military equipment. These have given impetus to a shift in the sector towards efforts to share costs and reduce the current patterns of wasteful expenditure in the defence sector.</P>
      <P>Proposals for EU activity in the field of armaments co-operation, including by means of an &ldquo;armaments agency&rdquo;, have arisen intermittently over the past number of decades. The Amsterdam and Nice treaties provide that co-operation in the armaments area should be &ldquo;as member states consider appropriate&rdquo;. This enables Ireland to takes our own decisions on these matters, in so far as they affect our concerns.</P>
      <P>Most recently, in June 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council tasked &ldquo;the appropriate bodies of the EU to undertake necessary actions towards creating, in the course of 2004, an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments&rdquo;. This initiative has been influenced in part by a desire to improve the cost-effectiveness of defence procurement expenditure, partially by achieving economies of scale in purchasing. The agency is also projected to play a role in advancing the harmonisation and inter-operability of defence equipment in support of European security and defence policy, which is aimed at giving the EU the capability to undertake crisis management and humanitarian tasks.</P>
      <P>Co-operation in the area of military capabilities and armaments is seen as an integral part of the EU's efforts to address shortfalls so as to properly equip the EU rapid reaction force to carry out humanitarian and crisis management missions, not least from the perspective of protecting the forces themselves, as well as those they may be trying to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One example of such humanitarian and crisis management mission was the short-duration military stabilisation operation undertaken in Bunia in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which aimed at ameliorating a situation of serious violence and great humanitarian distress and concluded in September. Another example is the separate military monitoring operation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which <Col N="1541" /> contributed to defusing a potential crisis situation from escalating out of control and is expected to conclude shortly.</P>

      <P>The first published analysis by my Department of school retention in Ireland was released in August of this year.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that of those who commenced the junior cycle programme in September 1994, approximately 3,600 &ndash; 5.7% &ndash; left school before completing the junior certificate three years later; approximately 8,900 of those who sat the junior certificate did not sit the leaving certificate; and approximately 12,500 &ndash; 18.2% &ndash; young people leave school annually without the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of <Col N="1542" /> dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The focus of the school completion programme is on young people between the ages of four and 18 years and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</P>
    <P>The school completion programme necessitates the establishment of local management groups to oversee the project at local level, involving both post-primary and primary schools together with relevant local statutory, voluntary and community bodies, the local drugs task forces and county-city development boards. The local management groups are required to assess the needs of marginalised educationally disadvantaged young people at local level and devise integrated costed focused targeted retention plans that support these young people in their school, home and community life.</P>
    <P>Sites for participation in the programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. Based on this analysis and having regard to the funding available, 82 project sites were selected. The project sites consist of one or more second-level schools and their major feeder primary schools. At present, 400 schools have been included in the SCP &ndash; 112 post-primary and 288 primary &ndash; and total funding of &euro;23 million has been provided for the programme in 2003. Significant additional funding was made available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 with the assistance from the ESF fund for the expansion of this initiative.</P>
    <P>A total of 53 SSRI schools, which were not selected for inclusion in the project strand of the school completion programme, will continue to be funded under the stay in school retention strand of the programme up to 31 August 2005.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 to 198, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The principal officer of the social inclusion unit was appointed as the high level official to co-ordinate my Department's response to the educational needs of Travellers in February 2003, in accordance with the recommendation under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The remit of the social inclusion unit now encompasses the co-ordination of all Traveller education provision within my Department and includes policy, co-ordination and development in relation to Traveller education. A more efficient and co-ordinated service in Traveller education is expected and a range of issues will be progressed in conjunction with the continued work of the Advisory Committee on Traveller Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is committed to the development of a five year Traveller education strategy, including an evaluation of existing initiatives in this area. Work has commenced in developing a framework for the strategy and it is expected that <Col N="1544" /> the scope and organisational structure for the strategy exercise will be agreed shortly. An external expert has been appointed to lead the process and he will work closely with a joint working group drawn from both the Advisory Committee on Traveller Education, ACTE, and the Educational Disadvantage Committee, EDC.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the Traveller education strategy exercise will be to review-evaluate existing activities, the wide range of inputs, the quality of outcomes and the experience of Traveller learners within the education system, to make recommendations on the future development of the service and recommend a phased implementation plan. Clear objectives will be set and it is envisaged that any baseline data required to support implementation of the strategy will be identified and the required arrangements to benchmark performance against this baseline data during the five year implementation period will be outlined.</P>
    <P>The Department's inspectorate intends to evaluate the provision made for education of Travellers in both primary and post-primary schools, with priority being given to the primary evaluation initially. It is hoped that the planning and consultation stage for this evaluation will be completed before the end of 2003 and that the evaluation work will commence in 2004 and be linked with the overall Traveller education strategy exercise.</P>
    <P>Under the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, in relation to child literacy, my Department is committed to halving the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties by 2006. Child literacy is also a key focus of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which includes a special initiative to tackle educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure progress is made towards the NAPS target, my Department undertook the first fully representative survey of reading literacy in disadvantaged schools, which was conducted this year in order to establish much needed baseline data on current reading standards in such schools. This survey will be followed in 2004 by a national assessment of reading in first and fifth classes.</P>
    <P>Literacy levels among Travellers will also be among the issues examined as part of the Traveller education strategy exercise.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of post-primary education provision, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre. These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme. The catchment boundaries were determined following consultation with local educational interests and the intention was that certain primary schools would feed exclusively into each centre. A relatively small number of primary schools are shared between two or more centres.</P>
      <P>The revision of catchment areas is addressed by my Department as the need arises. It is the practice in my Department to consult with local educational interests, where any such adjustments are being contemplated. My Department is not carrying out a review of the catchment areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under the rules for the post-primary school transport scheme, pupils eligible for transport may be transported to the post-primary centre which caters for the catchment area in which they live. Where eligible pupils attend school at a centre other than the post-primary centre which caters for the catchment area in which they live, they may be allowed the concession of transport from the catchment boundary of the centre attended, provided there is room for them on a bus serving that centre.</P>

      <P>A project for a one classroom extension and conversions at Loughanure national school in County Donegal had reached planning stage when the board of management requested a change in the original accommodation brief. A re-assessment of the long-term accommodation needs of the school was subsequently carried out by the planning section of my Department and a revised accommodation brief to cater for a principal and three mainstream assistants plus a remedial teacher was recommended.</P>
      <P>A member of the technical staff of the building unit of my Department visited Loughanure national school in County Donegal in September 2001. The purpose of the visit was to carry out an architectural assessment of the school in order to determine the suitability of the existing site and school premises to facilitate the long-term accommodation needs of the school, based on the recommended brief at the time. A formal plan for the proposed project at Loughanure national school has not been drawn up.</P>
      <P>In order to determine the appropriate level of accommodation which should be provided at the school, factors such as current and projected enrolments, staffing and the demographic trends in the area must be thoroughly examined. In addition, there are technical issues which must be resolved before further progress can be made. A technical examination indicates that the building is structurally sound.</P>
      <P>The timing of when individual projects can progress to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary provision for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress with existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. In the meantime, individual schools should, as appropriate, use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works.</P>

      <P>At post-primary level, education concerning substance misuse and prevention is addressed in schools in the context of the social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; curriculum. A 2002 survey of implementation of SPHE in post-primary schools indicated that two-thirds of post-primary schools were implementing the programme. The implementation of the <Col N="1548" /> SPHE curriculum at junior cycle has been supported by the post-primary SPHE support service since September 2000.</P>
      <P>This support service consists of a national co-ordinator and 11 regional development officers working in partnership with the health promotion officers and drug education officers of the health boards. The support service is being jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Health and Children, together with the health boards.</P>
      <P>With effect from September 2003, all post-primary schools must implement the SPHE programme. To date, the recruitment costs to my Department associated with this programme have been in excess of &euro;1.2 million.</P>
      <P>An SPHE syllabus for use at senior cycle level is in preparation by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>

      <P>Retired teachers whose pensions are paid directly by my Department, i.e. those who served in primary, secondary, community and comprehensive schools, have already, in August 2003, received the benefit of the first phase of the benchmarking award in their pensions. Their pensions have been increased and they have also received arrears of pension due with effect from 1 December 2001, the effective date of the benchmarking award.</P>
      <P>Teachers who have retired on pension since August 2003 have also received the benefit of the benchmarking increase in their retirement lump sums. Those who retired between 1 December 2001 and August 2003 are due to have their retirement lump sums revised. This work has commenced and is expected to be completed by the end of November.</P>
      <P>With regard to vocational teachers, the position is that vocational education committees are responsible for determining the pension entitlements of such teachers and for calculating revisions of the pension rates in accordance with increases in rates of salary which have been sanctioned by my Department. The pensioners' payroll is operated by the appropriate county council or corporation which issues payments following receipt of the approved rates of pension from the VEC.</P>
      <P>In regard to the benchmarking increase, the position is that my Department notified vocational education committees on 31 July 2003 of the revised rates of salary and allowances and conveyed sanction for their application in the revision of the pensions of former teachers.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to provide the pensions unit of my Department with details of any particular instance of delay in payment of the benchmarking increase to a pensioner, my Department will examine the matter and correspond directly with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the 2002 school building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 2002, my predecessor published on the Department's website a list of school building projects which were to be progressed as part of the 2002 school building programme. One of the crucial aspects of managing a multi-million euro annual capital programme is the <Col N="1550" /> timing of allowing projects to proceed to tender and construction. Some projects were scheduled to proceed to tender and construction in early 2002 and others were scheduled for later in the year.</P>
    <P>For projects to proceed to construction in 2002 the architectural planning stages would have needed to be very advanced. The projects shown in lists 3, 4, and 5 of the draft programme were &ldquo;ready for tender&rdquo;, &ldquo;would be ready for tender&rdquo; and &ldquo;expected to be ready for tender&rdquo; respectively in 2002, and accordingly were at an advanced stage. Some of the projects included in list 2 of the draft programme did not progress through the final stages of architectural planning as quickly as was anticipated, and therefore could not proceed to construction at that time.</P>
    <P>It became clear in late 2002 that the funding allocation for 2003 might be less than anticipated. On this basis, it was prudent therefore not to proceed in late 2002 with all projects intended to go to tender and construction and to defer consideration of these projects until funding for 2003 was certain. Ultimately, the level of funding available was the critical limiting factor for progressing all projects.</P>
    <P>The 2003 school building programme detailed the criteria being used now for large scale building projects at both primary and post-primary level. This initiative, to publish the factors which are taken into account when determining band ratings for projects, was designed to reassure all interested parties that the projects are selected on the basis of objective criteria and has been broadly welcomed by the education partners.</P>

      <P>The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 imposes a statutory duty on the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children to make resources available to schools for the provision of adequate and appropriate education to children with special educational needs. These resources are voted to the individual Departments by the Oireachtas which is the normal procedure governing public finances and expenditure by Departments. In making policy determinations, the general principal applying is that there is equitable treatment of all children in resource decision allocations. It is the objective of the Bill that it will lead to the creation of an education system which gives to children with disabilities the same opportunity for development through education as is given to children who do not have disabilities.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. There is provision in the agreed staffing arrangements for schools, which are classified as &ldquo;developing schools&rdquo;, to be granted additional teachers on a provisional basis. The requirements for the allocation of such posts are outlined in primary circular 9/03, a copy of which issued to the board of management of each school.</P>
      <P>The enrolment in the school referred to by the Deputy was 336 pupils on 30 September 2002. This enrolment entitles the school to a staffing of a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2003-04 school year. The enrolment required on 30 September 2003 for the purpose of the allocation of an additional post as a &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; was 366. The board of management had projected that this enrolment figure would be achieved and, on this basis, provisional sanction for the thirteenth mainstream class teacher was given in a letter to the board of management dated 12 May 2003.</P>
      <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment in the school concerned on 30 September 2003 was 354 pupils. As the required enrolment figure of 366 was not achieved, the school is not entitled to the post which was sanctioned provisionally in May. Accordingly, sanction for the post has been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>To ensure transparency and openness in the system, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing as outlined in Department circular 19/02. The board of management has submitted an appeal to the staffing appeals board. The appeal will be considered by the appeals board at its next meeting, which is scheduled to take place on 22 October 2003, and the board of management will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 provided for the establishment of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Further and Higher Education and Training Awards Councils for the accreditation of non-university education and training awards at further and higher levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council is to establish policies and criteria for the making of higher education and training awards and the validation of programmes, to determine the standards of knowledge, skills and competences to be acquired by learners for an award, to make or recognise awards and to monitor the quality of programmes <Col N="1558" /> ensuring that providers have procedures for assessment of learners which are fair and consistent.</P>
    <P>As a national awarding body, the primary concern that HETAC must have in relation to validating a programme leading to one of its awards is whether the programme meets the appropriate outcomes for an award and the associated quality assurance arrangements for the programme. The awarding service of HETAC is open to all public and private providers as is required under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999. There is no legal limit on the fields of learning in which HETAC may make awards.</P>
    <P>Certain publicly funded providers such as institutes of technology, FÁS, Fáilte Ireland and Teagasc are generally required to submit programmes to HETAC for validation. The process whereby my Department approves for funding the running of a programme validated by HETAC in an institute of technology, for example, is separate from the HETAC validation process in that my Department does not approve for funding all programmes which have HETAC validation. There are no plans for immediate changes in my Department's policy approach in this regard.</P>

      <P>On 24 September 2003, together with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I announced details of the membership and terms of reference for a working group on undergraduate medical education and training which has been jointly established to make recommendations on the organisation and delivery of high quality training for doctors in Ireland. The membership of the working group draws on a broad representation from medical <Col N="1561" /> academia, university, hospital and health board management and Department officials.</P>
      <P>The working group will examine and make recommendations on a range of aspects of medical education and training in Ireland. This will include the areas of course curriculum, teaching methods, inter-disciplinary working and other issues relating to the organisation and delivery of undergraduate medical education and training.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the working group has been asked to consider and provide advice on issues arising from the recent Higher Education Authority report that recommended a move to all graduate entry for medicine and other health science disciplines. I have already signalled my support for the broad thrust of that report which was commissioned by the Higher Education Authority at my request on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government to address the issue of the distortionary impact of these high points courses on the points system.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that students should undertake an undergraduate programme of their choice in any area before taking a decision to enter medicine or one of the other health science disciplines. The other programmes in question are physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy and radiography, all of which currently require extremely high points for entry.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority report contends that removal of entry selection to these high points programmes from the CAO system will have positive benefits for individual students in terms of reduced pressure and enhanced educational experience at senior cycle in second level. It can also enable second level students to select undergraduate programmes on the basis of their aptitudes and preferences before deciding to embark on a specific career oriented choice at postgraduate level. Arguably, the determination of career choice at a later stage should have a positive impact on morale and retention in the professions concerned and ensure a wider variety of entrants with a greater range of background experiences and skills.</P>
      <P>The initial consideration by the recently established working group of the detailed implementation issues that arise for medical education will also inform my approach to the later implementation of the proposed changes for the other health disciplines.</P>

      <P>An application for grant-aid towards <Col N="1562" /> improvement works has been received from the management authorities of Wandesforde national school, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. The 2003 capital programme has been published and my Department does not intend to allow further large-scale projects into architectural planning during 2003.</P>
      <P>The timing of when individual projects can progress to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary provision for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress with existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. In the meantime, individual schools should, as appropriate, use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the indemnity agreement between the State and 18 religious congregations, the State party agreed to grant an indemnity to the religious congregations in respect of cases which were eligible to be dealt with by the Residential Institutions Redress Board where the applicant opted to pursue the matter through the courts. The indemnity will operate for a period of six years from the date of the indemnity agreement &ndash; 5 June 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" />It is expected that the majority of cases will be processed through the Residential Institutions Redress Board rather than the courts. Therefore, it is expected that the indemnity will apply in relatively few cases. To date the indemnity has been applied in one case where an out of court settlement was reached. A confidentiality clause was stipulated in the offer of the settlement. Therefore, I am not in a position to state the amount involved. However, I can state that the settlement was within the parameters of the redress bands used by the redress board.</P>

      <P>Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching time table and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support.</P>
      <P>In addition, an independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities which wish to appeal the adequacy of any such allocations from my Department. The school in question applied for a curricular concession allocation and was granted 2.36 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. The school was notified of this allocation in April 2003 and advised that in the event of its not being satisfied with this allocation, it could appeal in writing before 6 May 2003 to the independent appeals committee. The school did not avail of the independent appeals mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" />The total staffing allocation to the school for the current school year is 14.42 whole-time equivalent teacher posts and three special needs assistants. This allocation includes one disadvantaged area post and 0.5 of a whole-time equivalent teacher post in respect of home-school-community-liaison. This level of allocation leaves the school with an actual pupil teacher ratio of 7.8:1. Having regard to the number of pupils enrolled at the school, I am satisfied that the level of teaching resources made available represents an adequate response which is fully in line with allocations generally in the second level system.</P>
    <P>All available teaching resources are being deployed in the second level system for the 2003-04 school year. While the level of allocation to individual schools will vary from year to year, having regard to changes in pupil numbers and programme delivery, the overall number of whole-time equivalent teacher posts being made available to the second level system for the current school year represents an increase of approximately 300 posts on the 2002-03 position.</P>

      <P>The RAPID programme is designed to harness the opportunities and resources of the national development plan, NDP, through the frontloading and prioritisation of investment to the 45 most deprived communities in the country &ndash; 25 urban areas and 20 provincial towns. This does not involve additional funding to that being provided under the NDP.</P>
      <P>The RAPID programme is managed within the Department of Education and Science by the social inclusion unit. RAPID proposals are submitted, in the first instance, to the social inclusion unit through Area Development Management Limited. The social inclusion unit is responsible for examining the proposals and determining whether or not they lie within the responsibility of the Department. Relevant proposals are then disseminated to the appropriate line section within the Department for action. It is the responsibility of the line sections to evaluate proposals in the light of their remit, priorities and objectives. The relevant line section is also responsible for responding directly to the project sponsor. The social inclusion unit follows up where necessary to ensure that all proposals receive a timely response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social inclusion unit is also responsible for the following tasks as part of its co-ordinating role in relation to the RAPID programme: compilation of reporting templates for the national <Col N="1567" /> monitoring committee; acting as the point of contact for RAPID co-ordinators and project sponsors with queries about specific proposals; and responsible for briefing line sections within the Department on the RAPID programme and the necessity of engaging with it.</P>
    <P>The procedures which have been put in place as a means of co-ordinating this Department's response to the RAPID programme have proved effective. All of the RAPID proposals submitted to the Department have received an official response and any queries from RAPID co-ordinators or project sponsors are dealt with by the social inclusion unit in a timely manner.</P>

      <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, the national sustainable energy authority, implements Government policy in regard to the sustainable use of energy across the economy through support for the increased use of energy efficiency technologies and the further deployment of our renewable energy resources. Sustainable Energy Ireland administers a number of programmes in these areas, which are financed under the national development plan with fund<Col N="1570" /> ing provided from a combination of EU and Exchequer sources.</P>
      <P>A renewable energy research development and demonstration programme was launched by SEI in July 2002. It has a total budget of &euro;16.25 million available to fund the deployment of renewable energy technologies which are close to market and to assess and develop technologies which have prospects for the future. To date, a total of &euro;4.640 million has been committed to projects from the fund. The funding support is broken down under the following renewable areas: biomass &ndash;&euro;2,707,000; wind, both on-shore and offshore &ndash;&euro;1,046,000; hydro &ndash;&euro;378,000; and others &ndash;&euro;509,000.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of renewable energy projects have been successful under the EU's research programme, the 6th framework programme, which was launched in 2002 by DG research, European Commission. However, I understand that no funding has been disbursed to these projects to date.</P>

      <P>Consultants, retained by my Department to conduct a study of the Irish Coast Guard, made over 100 recommendations for the future development of the service having regard to international best practice and value for money.</P>
      <P>Reflecting modern communications technologies, one of the main recommendations was that the Coast Guard should operate two control centres as opposed to the three centres that exist at present. Communications technology today also means that the geographical location of the centres is less important now than in the past. A decision was taken to close the Dublin centre rather than Malin or Valentia. This approach will have the effect of achieving significant cost savings, thus enabling other elements of the Coast Guard service to be developed and this in turn will lead to further improvements in our marine emergency response services nationally.</P>

    <P>My objective is that the remaining two centres at Malin and Valentia will be developed to handle all emergencies around our coast, on inland waters and in relation to mountain, cliff and cave rescue.

Implementation of the strategy over the period to 2030 was costed at &euro;3.96 billion at 1996 values. The funding allocation for forestry for 2004 will be determined in the context of the Estimates process for that year. In the latter context, I can assure the Deputy that the Government will make fully informed decisions on all allocations of public moneys, including in relation to forestry, in the context of the Estimates process. However, it is not appropriate at this point to speculate, in advance of <Col N="1575" /> Government consideration, on matters relating to the funding allocations for particular programmes in 2004.</P>
      <P>I would also inform the Deputy that as it is seven years since the launch of the strategy Growing for the Future, I have directed that it should now be reviewed. This review will reflect the significant changes in the sector as a whole since 1996 and will address, <i>inter alia,</i> the cost and benefits of forestry together with the interaction between forestry and more traditional agricultural land use supports and policies.</P>
      <P>I would add that the House should be made aware of the historic and future cost of forestry. Some &euro;613 million has been invested by the Government and the EU in forestry since 1997 representing an annual average of about &euro;88 million and, if existing policies were to continue, annual average costs, assuming respectively planting of 10,000 hectares and 20,000 hectares per annum, would be &euro;100 million or &euro;130 million over the next three years. Under the Rural Development Programme 2000-2006 the EU funds 50% of these costs. By the year 2020 the gross annual cost of meeting the targets outlined in the Government strategy for the sector could be over &euro;210 million.</P>

This meant that the funding available for the other schemes including the native woodland scheme in 2003 was limited <Col N="1576" /> and allowed only for supporting the development of pilot projects under that scheme.</P>
      <P>With respect to 2004 funding allocation for forestry in general and the native woodland scheme in particular will be determined by the Estimates process for that year.</P>

      <Quest> if approval has been granted by the Irish marine authorities to allow for the passage through Irish waters and international waters adjacent to Ireland, of a number of US military ships, some of which may be contaminated with nuclear radiation, for passage to Britain where they are to be decommissioned; if the Irish authorities have evaluated the environment risk posed by such a passage; if consultation has taken place between the US naval and British naval and marine authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as I became aware of the intention of the US authorities to tow 13 derelict naval ships to Britain I instructed the Coast Guard to establish all relevant facts regarding the proposed operation and to assess the risks to this country in the event of an accident. I am aware of concerns expressed about the dangers that an accident might pose, and I was also very concerned that it was intended to tow these old vessels across the Atlantic in winter. The first tow commenced on Monday, 6 October and is expected to take 28 days to berth. The second departed on Thursday, 16 October.</P>
      <P>The planned route will take the tows some 210 miles south of the Fasnet Rock. This route does not enter Irish territorial waters, the Ireland search and rescue region or the Irish pollution responsibility zone. It passes approximately 35 miles south of the south-west tip of the pollution zone.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard has maintained direct contact with the relevant authorities in both the US and the UK and it has been provided with all the information it has requested. This includes specific details of planned departure times and routes in each case, details of the risk assessments carried out in respect of each vessel, information on the emergency preparedness and response as well as details of tug manning arrangements and fitness to tow. The Coast Guard has also received the findings of three separate surveys into the vessels, including one undertaken by a UK Maritime and Coast Guard Agency surveyor, in relation to the seaworthiness, watertight integrity and stability of the vessels. The coast guard receives daily updates on the status of the tows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The risk assessments in respect of the vessels do not show that a nuclear radiation hazard <Col N="1577" /> exists. Furthermore, the US Coast Guard has issued each vessel with the necessary load line exemption certificate for the trip in accordance with international maritime law.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the information supplied to it, the Coast Guard is satisfied with the towing arrangements, including contingency plans in the event of an incident, and it will continue to monitor the tow very closely.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country in respect of the provision of sport and recreational facilities. The programme is run on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>The 2003 sports capital programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 25 April, before which a total of 1,337 applications were received. However, rather than being ineligible for a grant as suggested by the Deputy, no application was received from the West Clare Carer's Support Group under the 2003 programme.</P>
      <P>All allocations under the 2003 sports capital programme have now been made. It is open to the organisation in question, should it wish to do so and should it have a project which satisfies the terms and conditions of the programme, to submit an application to the 2004 sports capital programme when that scheme is publicly advertised. It must be stressed that under the programme, projects must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature, which for the purpose of the programme is defined as: expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process; and purchase of permanently based sports equipment, that is, it is securely housed, and will remain in use for five years or more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I announced the national extension of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme on 27 March 2003. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary S.R. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will be at University College Hospital, Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary N.R.</P>
      <P>Under the extension, approximately 150,000 women in the target population 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 510 cancers per annum among this population.</P>
      <P>Under the business plan submitted by BreastCheck to the Department, the national expansion of the programme to the west and the south is costed at &euro;27 million, including &euro;13 million capital costs. It is anticipated that additional costs will be incurred by the host hospitals and these are being assessed at present.</P>
      <P>Approval has issued for the establishment of two capital project teams to develop a brief for the capital infrastructure needed for the static units in the south and west. This approval will allow for the immediate commencement of the detailed planning for the national roll-out. In relation to funding requirements, I do not anticipate additional revenue requirements for this programme this year.

      <P>Having considered the report compiled by the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children entitled Report on Three Clinical Trials Involving Babies and Children in Institutional Settings 1960-1961, 1970 and 1973, the Government decided, in June 2001, to approve the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2001 (Additional Functions) Order 2001 (S.I. No. 280 of 1981) which empowered the commission to inquire, through its investigation committee, into the circumstances, legality, conduct, ethical propriety and effects on the subjects of the three vaccine trials referred to in the chief medical officer's report and to conduct similar inquiries into any other trials that took place in an institution during the period 1 January 1940 to 31 December 1987.</P>
      <P>For this purpose, the investigation committee was empowered to make determinations in regard to the above issues and to report to the commission which, in turn, was empowered to prepare and publish a report in writing specifying the determinations made by the investigation committee.</P>
      <P>This statutory instrument was made following consultation with the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and with the approval of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's policy in regard to the introduction of legislation on EU funded schemes that involve the deliberate destruction of human embryos at any stage of development here or in other countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23919/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans to introduce legislation that <Col N="1584" /> involves the destruction of human embryos. Currently, it is the position that there is no legislation governing research on embryos. Medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These state that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of concerns about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate assisted human reproduction, including the area of research on embryos. With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, and following a Government decision on the matter, I established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.&rdquo; I understand that the commission will complete its report in the next few months. Its recommendations will then provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position in relation to EU initiatives in this general area is to hold the line that we retain the right to decide what is legal and ethical in this country. Ireland has been successful to date in safeguarding our position in this respect. Similarly, Ireland accepts that it is a matter for each other member state to decide what is legal and ethical in its jurisdiction and that we would not see it as our function to seek to restrict activities that meet these criteria in any member state.</P>
      <P>In relation to the matter of EU aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries, the position is that a new EU regulation on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries was adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, on 16 June 2003. The previous regulation expired on 31 December last, having been in force since July 1997. The purpose of both the new and previous regulation is to allow the Commission to continue to support programmes in developing countries in the area of reproductive and sexual health and rights. The Commissions role in relation to development co-operation is laid down in Articles 177-181 of the treaty establishing the European Community.</P>
      <P>The regulation forms an important part of the EUs development policy. In particular, the legislation addresses the specific UN millennium development goal relating to maternal health which calls for the reduction of maternal mortality by three quarters over the period 1990 to 2015. Throughout the developing world, and particularly in the poorest countries, hundreds of thousands of women continue to die in childbirth because health systems cannot afford proper medical care and appropriate services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulation, like the previous 1997 &ndash; 2002 instrument, is based on the programme of action <Col N="1585" /> agreed at the Cairo international conference on population and development in 1994 and the &ldquo;Cairo+Five&rdquo; follow-up conference of 1999. Ireland's position in the Council negotiations on both the draft regulation and its predecessor has been that they must be in strict conformity with the Cairo programme of action which provides that abortion is not to be promoted as a family planning method and that regulations regarding abortion are solely for individual countries to decide. We are satisfied that the regulation meets this requirement and that it represents a substantial contribution by the Union towards implementation of the millennium development goals, to which the international community is committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services in the South Eastern Health Board, SEHB, is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of that board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the SEHB area and on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards &ndash; including three from the SEHB &ndash; for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists &ndash; including one from the SEHB &ndash; who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided for both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor will take up duty in December. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a <Col N="1586" /> large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided for the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</P>
    <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund for health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The SEHB was allocated an additional &euro;554,000 from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</P>
    <P>The number of patients awaiting orthodontic and other dental treatment by county is not routinely collected by my Department. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the board to provide the information requested directly to the Deputy. The chief executive officer of the SEHB has informed me that at the end of the June 2003 quarter, there were 2,210 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the board.</P>

      <P>In August 2000, the Northern Area Health Board, in partnership with the Irish Family Planning Association, initiated a family planning-womens health service at the Irish Family Planning Association's premises in Cathal Brugha Street. The services provided are complementary to those available to medical card holders through their own general practitioner and they are intended to provide an element of choice for medical card holders in the area of reproductive health.</P>
      <P>In 2003, a budget of &euro;140,000 was made available to the Irish Family Planning Association for the provision of services for medical card holders. This represented an increase of 10% on the previous years allocation. The Irish Family Planning Association was asked to take appropriate steps to manage the delivery of services within its allocation, but failed to do so, and has suspended services to medical card holders with effect from 13 October 2003. The Northern Area Health Board will seek to facilitate the IFPA with further funding in 2003. Medical card holders in the area are still entitled to access reproductive health services through their general practitioners.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received a report from Crumlin hospital on the needs of this hospital for redevelopment; if the Government has accepted the validity of this case; and the present stage of the development by the Eastern Regional Health Authority of a funded development plan to address the needs of this hospital.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, on foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin hospital, I approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. The team includes representatives from the hospital, the ERHA, and the Department of Health and Children. Many of the buildings within the hospital are approximately 50 years old, and have not been upgraded in any significant way over that period. As a result, they do not now generally meet contemporary standards for paediatric hospital facilities.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of a development control plan which will set the context for future capital developments on the site. Work on the preparation of the development brief has commenced, and it is expected to be completed by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>It is intended that a phased approach to new development and the upgrade of facilities will be taken. The plans will allow for the prioritisation of developments according to the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA. A phased approach will ensure that services continue to be provided at the hospital during the redevelopment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of additional major developments, funded by the Exchequer, are currently being put in place at the hospital. These include a &euro;30 million investment in the new operating department which will provide two additional theatres, increasing the capacity of the hospital to five <Col N="1590" /> major theatres and two minor theatres. Included in this development are new recovery beds, a day surgery unit and a modern central sterile supplies department. This development is expected to increase the capacity of the hospital to meet the additional surgery demands at both in-patient and out-patient level.</P>
    <P>In addition, on the basis of the volume and complexity of cases being dealt with at the hospital, I approved the provision of an MRI facility at Crumlin which will significantly enhance the level of diagnostic services provided for children. A brief for the project has now been agreed by the MRI project team endorsed by the ERHA and submitted to my Department for approval. It is hoped to initiate the detailed planning process in the near future.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department and I have met representatives of the New Crumlin Hospital Group on a number of occasions The New Crumlin Hospital Group is composed of parents of children who regularly attend Our Lady's Hospital for treatment. It was this group which commissioned the Pollock report into facilities at the hospital. As already stated, the deficiencies in facilities at the hospital are well known and accepted. I am committed to the redevelopment programme at Crumlin and have given the New Crumlin Hospital Group my assurance in this regard.</P>

      <P>The provision of hospital services at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Phase one of the development at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel which is now complete, provides the infrastructure to facilitate the transfer of surgical and ancillary services from Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel. These services include the following: accident and emergency department, C,S,S,D unit, 39 bed surgical ward, three operating theatres, intensive care unit, day care unit, including dedicated endoscopy suite.</P>
      <P>Last week I officially opened a number of new facilities at St. Joseph's Hospital. These included: cardiac rehabilitation unit, CT unit, medical 111 ward, coronary step-down unit, medical assessment unit, library and education centre.</P>
      <P>To date &euro;30 million has been spent on phase one of the developments at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. When completed, the overall investment in the development of acute hospital services in south Tipperary will be in the region of &euro;40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has sought significant resources to <Col N="1591" /> complete the transfer from Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. It will be necessary to obtain resources in the context of 2004 Estimates discussions.

      <P>The position is that a common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme, GMS, and the drug payment scheme, DPS. This list ensures equity between the GMS and DPS in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly <Col N="1592" /> basis, as new products become available and deletions are notified.</P>
      <P>For any item to be included in the common list, it must comply with a published list of criteria. These include authorisation status where appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.</P>
      <P>A medical card holder who experiences financial difficulty in obtaining items not covered on the common list should approach the relevant health board for assistance.

    <P>Individual health boards and hospitals are in the process of developing their radiology services with the procurement of picture archiving and communication systems, PACS, and integrated image management systems, IIMS. These developments will undoubtedly have benefits for patients and result in the more efficient operation of radiology departments. The development of systems such as PACS and IIMS will have a cost factor as there is a need to employ additional staff <Col N="1593" /> to run the systems, and the associated cost of the service contract on the systems will need to be met.</P>

Instead, the task force has pointed to the need to bring services closer to patients, while ensuring that patients are treated in the hospital most capable of providing them with the type of care they require.</P>
    <P>The next phase of work will involve the preparation of a plan for the configuration of acute hospital services throughout the country. I am currently establishing a small expert group to work with my Department and, when established, the national hospitals office, to develop such a plan in accordance with the principles of the task force report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently launched the report of the expert working group on the development of radiation oncology services in <Col N="1597" /> Ireland. The report provides a detailed plan for the further development of radiation oncology services in this country. The Government has accepted the recommendations of this report.</P>
      <P>The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first step of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. This is the best model to provide a radiation oncology service to the highest standards. The development of radiation oncology services along the lines recommended in this report is the single most important priority of my Department in cancer services in the acute setting.</P>
      <P>In the short-term, I have issued approval for the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the Cork centre and the necessary capital investment amounting to &euro;4 million to commission this service as rapidly as possible. I have now approved the appointment of a project team to prepare a brief for the rapid expansion of current capacity from four to eight linear accelerators. I also intend to prioritise the necessary resources to ensure that the radiation oncology centre in Galway, which is currently being commissioned is in a position to treat patients, starting in spring 2005. I have also requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate the expansion from three to six linear accelerators in the medium term. I will also give early approval to the establishment of a project team to plan this expansion.</P>
      <P>I will require radiation oncology centres to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. I will also require radiation oncology centres to provide outreach services for hospitals in adjoining regions. This is currently the case, and as more radiation oncologists are appointed it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services. This has particular relevance for patients in the MidWestern Region.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government has also decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a co-ordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report. I have now established a national radiation oncology co-ordinating group. The group will, <i>inter alia,</i> facilitate improved access to existing and planned services. The group will comprise <Col N="1598" /> clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions.</P>
    <P>My office will be in touch with the MidWestern Health Board about the request for a meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission White Paper on transport, published in September 2001, envisages that, in the context of sustainable development, EU financing should be directed towards giving greater priority to more sustainable forms of transport and, in particular, to rail, sea and inland waterway transport.</P>
      <P>The rail freight option in Ireland has been assessed in the context of the strategic rail review, SRR, published in April 2003. The review recognised that the geography and industrial base of Ireland limit the potential of rail freight somewhat. However, the review found that there remains an opportunity to reverse the decline of recent years in some freight sectors and envisaged that freight services will operate where they can be cost effective and can contribute to the economic development of the country in an environmentally sustainable manner.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I believe that every effort should be made by Iarnród Éireann to develop its rail freight business. Since the publication of the strategic rail review my Department has held a number of meetings with Iarnród Éireann at which the company has reported on its progress in improving the performance of its freight business. Iarnród Éireann informs me that the fortunes of its freight operations have improved considerably. It has secured two major contracts and is in the process of consolidating those markets which are financially sustainable. The company has stated that it is confident that the outlook for its freight business is good in the short to medium term.</P>

The proposed European railway agency will be a technical body, and its primary role will be to advise the European Union on issues relating to safety and interoperability on the EU's railways. The work of the proposed agency should make a positive contribution to the achievement of a more integrated European railway system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320, 322, 323, 328, 329, 331 and 334 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Airline Pilots Association, the European Cockpit Association and the European Committee on Aircrew Scheduling and Safety, ECASS. However, as I have stated in replies to previous questions on this subject, the day-to-day oversight of aviation safety falls under the responsibility of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. The IAA is examining the proposals and will give its view on the completion of its analysis.</P>
      <P>This issue has not been discussed in Europe since the tabling of the European Parliament report in July 2002, and it is unclear when discussions on that subject will recommence. I should clarify for the Deputies that, under the system as it currently operates, each member state of the EU has its own flight and duty time rules, based on guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, and the Joint Aviation Authorities, JAA. Those rules differ only slightly from one member state to another. Ireland's rules are drawn up and implemented by the IAA.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the European Commission proposed that there should be formal harmonisation throughout the EU of aircraft operating rules, of which flight duty time is a part. However, for a variety of reasons, that proposal has not progressed very far. In July 2002 the European Parliament, as part of its consultative role in relation to the Commission's proposals, suggested a substantial amendment to the rules on flight duty times. It is that amendment, known as the Simpson report, which has been causing concern among flight crew representatives. Representatives of IALPA met me last February to inform me of their concerns.</P>
      <P>Unless and until there is a further initiative by the European Commission, there will be no further movement in relation to the Simpson proposals and therefore no opportunity, or requirement, for input by me. Until such time as new arrangements are agreed at European level, the IAA's national rules about flight duty times will continue to apply in respect of Irish-registered aircraft. I reiterate that, in so far as that proposal may lead to legislative changes, I always give the highest priority to safety matters.</P>

      <P>I will take decisions regarding the commencement of the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 when the commission for taxi regulation is established and when the commission is in a position to take on the various roles envisaged for it. Section 14 of the Act provides that the commissioner for taxi regulation must be selected by open recruitment competition held by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. The position was advertised earlier this year, and I expect a response from the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission shortly.</P>
      <P>I hope to make an order to establish the advisory council to the commission for taxi regulation under Part 4 of the Act in the near future following completion of my consideration of nominations received from a range of interest groupings. The Act provides for a Council consisting of a chairperson and 17 ordinary members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is already a requirement that applicants for a motorcycle driving licence must have successfully undergone the driving test. I refer the Deputy to <Col N="1604" /> my reply to Priority Question No. 80 on 5 February 2003, which refers, <i>inter alia,</i> to the fact that driver formation has, in accordance with the Government's strategy for road safety 1998-2002, been assisted in a number of ways, including the introduction of a driver theory test for applicants for first provisional licences, support for the voluntary driving instructor register and support for an initiative by the Irish Motorcyclists Action Group to establish a network of motorcycle instructors throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A new road safety strategy to chart government policy for the years ahead is being prepared, and policy in relation to instruction standards, driver training and licensing, including initial basic training for motorcyclists will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>On 8 January 2003, Bus Éireann formally applied for consent to operate services from Monday to Friday at the stop in Cavan at 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. The company had been directed to withdraw those services in December 2002 when Bus Éireann was found to be in breach of section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 which prohibits competition with a licensed private operator without ministerial consent. I agreed on 21 May 2003, after detailed consideration of the matter, to the following in respect of Bus Éireann's early morning services. First, consent was given for the reintroduction of the stop at Cavan at 7 a.m. on the Monday to Friday, Cavan to Dublin route. Secondly, consent was refused for the reintroduction of Bus Éireann services between Cavan and Virginia, Monday to Friday, departing Cavan at 6 a.m. However, that <Col N="1605" /> service continues as normal, serving all stops <i>en route</i> between Virginia and Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is open to Bus Éireann, the existing private operator concerned, and any other bus operator to apply to my Department for approval to provide additional services to cater for any unmet demand on the route. No such applications have been received to date.</P>

      <P>An interim chairman of the proposed commission for taxi regulation was appointed in February 2003 and has carried out a series of detailed consultations over recent months with those involved in the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda Síochána and other interest groups with a view to assessing and addressing issues relating to standards in the industry. The issues arising from those consultations will be considered and addressed by the statutory commissioner for taxi regulation when that appointment is made in accordance with the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003. The new Act provides the legislative basis for the establishment of the commission for taxi regulation and for the development by it of enhanced standards and quality improvements in relation to the services offered by small public service vehicles and their drivers.</P>

The current legislation governing Irish naturalisation is the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended in 1986, 1994 and 2001. The statutory requirements for naturalisation are set out in the legislation, and a residency requirement of five years is normally required for applicants who are not married to an Irish spouse. For applicants married to an Irish spouse, the residency requirement is normally three years.</P>

      <P>I am aware of speculation in the media and elsewhere about the possible closure of Loughan House, and, indeed, other prisons and places of detention, as part of measures to control prison costs generally. The position is that the efforts of the Prison Service to control costs in prisons are currently very much focused on reaching agreement with the Prison Officers Association on a range of measures designed to enhance the operational efficiency of prisons significantly. The Prison Officers Association is due to ballot its members on the proposals very shortly.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the existing cost structure of the Prison Service is not sustainable. In the absence of agreement, the Government will decide urgently on measures which it has recently discussed to reduce costs in the service significantly. I do not believe that it would be helpful or appropriate to outline at this time the measures which will be considered by the Government if agreement cannot be reached with the Prison Officers Association by the end of this month. I very much hope that agreement can be reached very soon and that the necessary progress can be made on the basis of consensus.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are currently four Garda Síochána town centre CCTV systems in operation: O'Connell Street, Dublin city; Temple Bar &ndash; Grafton Street, Dublin city; Tralee; and Cork city. Seventeen locations are set to receive new Garda CCTV systems over the next two years, subject to the availability of funds. Those locations are in alphabetical order: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by an advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and taking into account the following criteria: crime and public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances or needs; the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on the area. The local chief superintendent has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the CCTV system in his or her particular area. The composition of a typical CCTV implementation committee includes representatives of: Garda telecommunications section who will project-manage the technical aspects of the system; <Col N="1611" /> local crime prevention officers; the ESB; the local authority; the Office of Public Works; and local business interests.</P>
    <P>I am further advised that the CCTV advisory committee has not to date received any formal application for the installation of a Garda CCTV system in any County Kildare town. It is understandably not possible for the Garda Síochána to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. Some applications for Garda CCTV systems relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. To that end, a grant aid scheme was launched in 2002 to facilitate community-based groups which wish to press ahead with their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such systems.</P>
    <P>A prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and detailed technical specifications, drawn up by the Garda Síochána, are almost complete. When both those documents have been finalised, copies will be issued to all communities and organisations which expressed an interest in the scheme. Any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed. I am advised that a number of expressions of interest in this scheme have been received from entities such as chambers of commerce, local authorities and various community groups from the following locations throughout County Kildare: Athy, Celbridge, Kill, Maynooth, Naas and Prosperous.</P>

That figure compares with a total of three such releases for the preceding week. Short periods of temporary release are also granted daily to selected prisoners for humanitarian or constructive and rehabilitative reasons such as attending educational and-or training programmes or courses. That type of temporary release may range from a few hours to a number of days. I can tell the Deputy that, during the period about which he <Col N="1612" /> has asked, there were, on average, 35 prisoners per day on such temporary release from the Dóchas Centre.

      <P>Sections 111 to 114 of the Children Act 2001 introduced provisions in relation to the parents or guardians of children found guilty of offences. Section 113 empowers the court to order the parent or guardian of such a child to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of that section. Section 114 allows the court to order a parent or guardian, with his or her consent, which cannot be unreasonably refused, to enter into a recognisance of not more than &euro;317 to exercise proper and adequate control over their child.

    <P>In addition, the national juvenile office has a staff of one superintendent, two inspectors, two sergeants and four civilians. The total number of referrals to the national juvenile office in 2002, was 20,644. This results in an average case load of 243 for each Garda JLO.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 came into law in May 2002. This effectively placed the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a statutory basis for the first time in its 40 year history and has resulted in the introduction of a number of substantial changes in the manner in which the Garda deals with juvenile offenders. The concept of restorative justice and family conferences as envisaged under sections 26 and 29 of the Act will continue to be rolled out. To date, almost 100 such events have taken place and each one has been evaluated. This all forms part of an ongoing development of the juvenile diversion programme.</P>
    <P>In compliance with the provisions of section 44 of the Act, a committee has been established to monitor the effectiveness of the programme, review all aspects of its operation and monitor the ongoing training needs of facilitators. The approximate cost of the provision of this service in 2000, 2001 and 2002 is as follows: 2000, &euro;2.96 million; 2001, &euro;3.17 million; and 2002, &euro;3.29 million.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, a Romanian national, entered the State on 25 July 2001 and claimed asylum under a particular name, purporting to be a Moldovan national. His application was examined by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who found that he had originally sought asylum in France and recommended that, in accordance with the terms of the Dublin Convention, he be transferred there to have his asylum application considered by the French authorities. The person had previously made asylum applications in France under two other names and had also made a subsequent asylum application in the United Kingdom under yet another name.</P>
      <P>The person appealed to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in relation to the determination of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that he should be transferred to France under the Dublin Convention. This appeal failed and a deportation order was signed in respect of him on 24 April 2002. The person evaded the deportation order but was eventually arrested and removed from the State on 14 March 2003 to France under the terms of the Dublin Convention. This person subsequently applied to the Irish Embassy in Bucharest for a visa to come to Ireland. In making this application, he did not declare his previous aliases nor that he was the subject of a deportation order which, in law, requires him to leave the State and remain thereafter outside it. The person was granted a visa by the embassy on which basis he returned to Ireland in June 2003. On foot of the deportation order issued in April 2002, he was arrested on 7 August 2003 and deported for the second time on 11 August 2003.</P>
      <P>This person has now made an application to have his deportation order revoked and to return to Ireland on the basis that he is married to an EU national &ndash; a United Kingdom national he married in Romania in May 2003 &ndash; who is working in Ireland and that he is entitled to exercise his EU treaty rights in coming here. My Department has written to the person's solicitors concerning information required and the procedures to be followed in such applications. When the relevant procedures have been followed, I will make a decision on the application having regard to the facts of the case, the national and international case law and to the need to maintain the integrity of the asylum and immigration system.</P>

These locations are Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford. Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by an advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and take into account the following criteria: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances-needs that exist; and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on the area.</P>

      <P>As of 21 October 2003, there were 298 prisoners serving sentences for sexual offences. This represents approximately 11% of the sentenced prison population. As has been outlined to the House on a number of occasions, there are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. These are: individual counselling from the Irish Prisons Service's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service; the multidisciplinary thinking skills group work programme in Cork Prison, Arbour Hill Prison and the Curragh Place of Detention; the sex offender programme, which has been in operation in Arbour Hill Prison since 1994 and was introduced in the Curragh Place of Detention in 2000; and the psychiatric service which provides some support to prisoners in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. While it is not possible to quantify with absolute accuracy participation in all forms of rehabilitation, many of those in custody for sex <Col N="1618" /> offences have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to above.</P>
    <P>In most years, 16 offenders are recruited to the sex offender programme &ndash; eight in Arbour Hill Prison and eight in the Curragh Place of Detention. An average of 48 offenders are recruited to the thinking skills course in each year &ndash; 16 in Arbour Hill Prison, 16 in Cork Prison and 16 in the Curragh Place of Detention.</P>
    <P>The number of offenders undergoing one-to-one counselling is difficult to define because of the varied nature of individual counselling provided to sex offenders in prison. This counselling can vary from one session addressing a particular problem to intensive ongoing counselling. One of the main aims of individual counselling of sex offenders is to motivate them to address their offending behaviour. In response to such counselling, many offenders, who initially might deny responsibility for their crime or deny any need for treatment, are motivated towards some process of change. For some offenders this results in them undertaking the sex offender treatment programme at Arbour Hill Prison or the Curragh Place of Detention, for others it results in sustained individual therapy around their offending or engagement in some other programme available in the prison system such as, for example, the thinking skills course, group skills programme, etc.</P>

Among the high level strategies designed to achieve the objectives outlined in the Land Registry business plan was the introduction of ITRIS and the imaging of all paper folios and filed plan maps. The system, which involved considerable investment by the Land Registry, was designed to facilitate the introduction of many innovations in the entire registration process. It has facilitated customers and Land Registry staff in preparing, lodging, and processing applications, reducing queries, eliminating repetitive tasks, making necessary documents and information more readily available, all of which have led to increased productivity. The additional staff resources provided to the Land Registry office in 2000-01 have also assisted in increasing production levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to a radon remediation grant scheme, I refer to the reply to Question No. 5 of 16 October 2003 in which I also referred to the initiatives taken by the Government to address the radon problem.</P>
      <P>I assume that the latter part of the question refers to the recent media reports about high radon levels found in a house in Castleisland, County Kerry. The house in question had been measured for radon concentration levels by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, at the request of the householder and was found to have a very high radon concentration level. I understand from the RPII that remediation work is currently being carried out on this house and that, upon completion of this, additional measurements will be carried out to determine whether the work has been effective. Two houses nearby were also measured by the RPII and were found to have radon concentrations below the 200 Bq/m³ reference level. The RPII has also written to householders within the four 10 x 10 km national grid squares adjoining the town of Castleisland informing them of the levels found and advising them to have radon measurements carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" />In July 2002 the RPII published a report which represents the results of a national survey of indoor radon concentrations levels in domestic dwellings carried out by the institute between 1992 and 1999. The results of the survey were used to identify high radon areas and to predict the percentage of houses in each grid square with radon in excess of 200 Bq/m³. The RPII has actively encouraged householders in those areas designated as high radon areas to have their homes measured for radon levels if they have not already done so. The RPII has also advised that householders who have a radon concentration above the 200 Bq/m³ reference level should consider taking remedial action.</P>
    <P>My Department's booklet, Radon in Existing Buildings &ndash; Corrective Options, provides advice, as endorsed by the RPII, on a range of appropriate remediation options. For example, improved ventilation all year round would be an immediate and non-costly action to prevent build up of radon gas in the home.</P>

      <P>Since 1994, my Department has required that central heating be provided during construction in new local authority dwellings and included in the overall cost of the schemes. The management, maintenance and improvement of their existing rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is, in principle, the responsibility of local authorities to be financed from their own resources. Where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for the upgrading of local authority dwellings, the provision of central heating may form part of the work undertaken. Local authorities may also seek my Department's approval to use their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing construction and remedial works programmes for the provision of central heating in their rented housing stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 and 370 together.</P>
      <P>Until recently, turf was cut for domestic use by hand using the traditional turf spade, or sleán, but mechanical extraction has now become prevalent. While traditional hand cutting of turf took generations to produce a significant impact, the use of machinery can have a serious impact on the ecology of the remaining bogs, particularly the raised bogs of the midlands. In this context, raised bogs worthy of conservation have been proposed for designation as special areas of conservation, SACs, under the EU habitats directive and as natural heritage areas, NHAs, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.</P>
      <P>To balance social and economic needs with the requirements of habitat conservation, a ten year derogation for domestic turf cutters in raised bogs in SACs, except in particularly sensitive locations, was introduced in 1999 to allow those with turbary rights some time to make new arrangements. A survey is currently being carried out on designated raised bogs, both SAC and NHA, which will identify the most sensitive areas of these bogs, where cutting cannot be allowed to continue. In the less sensitive areas of the NHA bogs, I expect to be in a position to permit domestic cutting to continue for a number of years. I will announce arrangements in this regard following completion of the current survey, which is due for completion by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Compensation is available for the cessation of turf cutting in SACs and NHAs. My Department will purchase areas of raised bog at the rate of &euro;4,080 per hectare or turbary rights at the rate of &euro;3,451 per hectare.</P>
      <P>In the case of blanket bog SACs, it has generally been possible either to exclude areas of active turf cutting from the SACs, or to allow cutting to continue from existing turf banks. My Department will purchase areas of blanket bog SAC which have been identified as particularly sensitive and where turf cutting cannot be allowed to continue at the rate of &euro;628 per hectare.</P>
      <P>Any holder of turbary rights who is dissatisfied with the level of compensation on offer for either raised or blanket bogs has the right to arbitration as provided for in the legislation concerning SACs and NHAs.</P>

      <P>The procedures for the sale of houses, including cottages, under the current tenant purchase scheme, were notified to local authorities by way of my Department's circular letter HRT 6/95 of May 1995. I am arranging to have a copy of the circular sent to the Deputy. Where a site was transferred to a local authority for a nominal sum, the scheme provides that in calculating the sale price to the tenant purchaser, the applicable discount includes an amount which reflects the difference between the current market value of the site and the nominal sum paid by the local authority.</P>

      <P>This scheme is part of a pilot programme being undertaken by the national rural water monitoring committee to test a range of new, small scale wastewater collection and treatment systems. The pilot programme will be undertaken as two grouped design-build-operate, DBO, contracts, each involving six locations. Five consortia have been shortlisted to submit tender bids for the group of projects that includes Castletown-Geoghegan.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the pilot programme is to explore the potential role for group sewerage schemes in extending domestic wastewater services to households outside the immediate catchments of the new collection systems being provided under the DBO contracts. These collection systems are, accordingly, confined initially to the core areas of each of the population centres involved. Details of the collection system for Castletown-Geoghegan are not available in the Department but may appropriately be sought from Westmeath County Council.</P>

      <P>The Building Control Act 1990 assigns primary responsibility for complying with the building regulations to the designers, builders and owners of the buildings involved. Under the 1990 Act, the role of local building control authorities is to monitor buildings for compliance with the building regulations and to institute enforcement action, where appropriate. The authorities have powers to issue fire safety certificates for the designs of non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks, inspect building works in progress and on completion, serve enforcement notices, seek High Court injunctions to stop construction works posing an imminent danger, and to institute summary prosecutions for certain offences.</P>
      <P>I propose to introduce a building control Bill in the first half of 2004. The Bill will provide for, <i>inter alia,</i> the strengthening of the enforcement powers of building control authorities.</P>

      <P>The protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities to which my Department provides advice in the exercise of their functions in that regard under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority is required, for the purpose of protecting structures or parts of structures which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, to include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I understand Kilcooly Abbey house is included in South Tipperary County Council's record of protected structures. It is, accordingly, a matter for the council, in the first instance, to take whatever action it considers appropriate, consistent with its powers, to protect the architectural integrity of the property, including its interiors. The Act also places a responsibility on the owners and occupiers of protected structures to ensure the structure or any part of it, which contributes to its special interest, is not endangered in any way.</P>
      <P>The use of the Planning and Development Acts and the completion of surveys such as the national inventory of architectural heritage are the main methods of assisting in the protection of the architectural heritage in private ownership. Significant further extension of the existing State-owned portfolio of over 740 national monuments and historic properties that are in the care of my Department cannot realistically be contemplated in current budgetary circumstances. The resource implications of maintaining this portfolio are very significant and therefore innovative alternatives to State acquisition to ensure the protection of landmark heritage properties under threat need to be explored. In light of this, I recently initiated the first steps of an examination into the issue of facilitating the emergence of trust-type organisations which might, independently of Government and without State aid, acquire and manage such heritage properties.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for the administration of the scheme of community support for older people, which provides funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off costs of purchase and/or installation of small-scale physical security equipment and socially monitored alarm systems. Where socially monitored alarms previously installed under this scheme are broken, a limited amount of funding is available towards the cost of replacement. The scheme was advertised in both local and national newspapers the week beginning 4 August with a closing date of 17 September 2003. Some &euro;3.4 million has been allocated to the scheme this year.</P>
      <P>In more general terms, my Department provides a range of supports and structures that assist communities, especially those suffering from disadvantage and social exclusion. Older people would clearly be among the beneficiaries of such assistance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also has responsibility for the <Col N="1633" /> work of the local drugs task forces, which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse.

    <P>The Estimates process for 2004 is currently ongoing and the allocations for my Department have not been finalised. However, I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention that resources will continue to be available in local drugs task force areas to implement plans to tackle drug misuse.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department was established in June 2002; during the period from June to end 2002 a total of &euro;162,776 was spent on IT software licences, mainly necessitated by the transfer into my Department of functions from five other Departments. Some &euro;145,086 was spent on the products referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>My Department does not currently have any open source software installed, nor does it have a role to play in the promotion of open source or any other software. All software required for internal use within the Department is acquired on the basis of such factors as functional fit to the Department's business, value for money, adherence to open standards and availability of skills to support and maintain the software on an on-going basis.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether there is a substantial pension funding shortfall relating to the private sector workforce; the estimated extent of this shortfall; and her proposals in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the exceptional fall in global equities markets over the past two and a half years has had a major impact on <Col N="1635" /> the asset base of pension funds with the major gains of the past severely reduced in recent years.</P>
      <P>Trustees of schemes are required, under the Pensions Acts, to certify at three and a half year intervals that the assets of the scheme would have been sufficient at a specified date to meet the liabilities of the scheme if the scheme had wound up at that date &ndash; this is known as the minimum funding standard, MFS. In July this year I signed into law an amendment to the Pensions Acts which requires that, during the three and a half year interval, actuarial reviews must be undertaken to establish whether a scheme continues to satisfy the MFS and corrective measures taken where a negative assessment arises.</P>
      <P>In deciding whether to commence this additional requirement, at a time when some pension schemes were experiencing difficulty, I took the view that whatever might be done to alleviate the problems in the short-term, it was in everyone's interest that any shortfall in funding is highlighted at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>Where a scheme does not meet the MFS, a funding proposal, designed to show a return to full funding within three and a half years, must be submitted. In view of the difficulties being experienced, and after wide consultation with all stakeholders, I made provision in the Social Welfare Act 2003 to strengthen the powers of the pensions board to allow it to respond to current difficulties, on a case-by-case basis, where schemes find themselves with funding issues which are caused by the problems on the markets.</P>
      <P>The amendment I made gives the board power to consider granting a longer period over which the failure to meet the MFS has to be rectified in response to an application for an extension from the trustees of a scheme. In August of this year, the pensions board published guidelines for trustees as to how this process will operate.</P>
      <P>I understand from the pensions board that an indication as to the extent of the shortfall is that of the 386 actuarial funding certificates which have been received by them this year, 47 have not met the MFS. Of those, 28 have had their funding proposals approved and the balance are currently under consideration by the pensions board. The number of schemes in respect of which trustees have sought an extension of the period for a return to full funding is 12. However, a full picture of the extent of the shortfall in pension funding will only become clear as such applications are received over the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always made it clear that I regard these short-term measures as a stop gap only and that the underlying issue of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the funding standard today must be addressed. An expert working group, established by the Pensions Board, is examining this difficult issue. Its report will form the basis for a consultation process to take place early next year and I expect to receive a report from the pensions board by the end of next year. I hope that, despite the complexity of the issues involved, all stake<Col N="1636" /> holders will engage fully with the process to ensure that any proposals for change are in the best interests of members.</P>

      <P>The Civil Registration Bill 2003, which was published in July 2003, is part of a joint project with the Department of Health and Children aimed at improving the civil registration service in Ireland. Although the responsibility for the civil registration service comes under the auspices of the Minister for Health and Children, I have specific responsibility for the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the re-organisation and modernisation of the system of registration of births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages and deaths. It further provides for the extension of the civil registration service to decrees of divorce and nullity of marriages granted by the courts.</P>
      <P>Section 13(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Civil Registration Bill, provides for the establishment of a register of all adoptions and foreign adoptions under the Adoption Acts 1952 to 1998, to be known as the register of adoptions. Section 53 of the Bill provides for searches in the registers, including the register of adoptions, and for the issue of certified copies of the entries in these registers.</P>
      <P>An tArd-Chláraitheoir maintains an index to make traceable the connection between each entry in the adopted children register established under section 22 of the Adoption Act 1952 and the corresponding entry in the register of births. Section 22(5) of the Act of 1952 provides that this index shall not be open to public inspection and that no information from it shall be given to any person except by order of a court or of the Adoption Board.</P>
      <P>Section 53(3) of the Civil Registration Bill 2003 maintains the provisions of section 22(5) of the Adoption Act 1952 in relation to this particular index.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 399 together.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to an unemployment payment has been the subject of an ongoing investigation since July 2003. He was requested to provide detailed information regarding his financial situation including his bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Having failed to provide the full details as requested by the inspector his unemployment assistance claim was suspended from 22 September 2003. The person concerned was informed of this by letter and advised that his claim could be reopened subject to him providing the documentary evidence requested.</P>
      <P>The person concerned subsequently informed the Department that he would be taking up employment from 22 September 2003. He is, therefore, not currently entitled to an unemployment payment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for back to work allowance on 2 September 2003. When a person in receipt of an unemployment payment is approved for back to work allowance their new rate of payment is based on their previous entitlement. Given that his entitlement to an unemployment payment was under review prior to his application, and that his means could not be determined as he had failed to co-operate with the inspector, his back to work allowance claim could not be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.</P>
      <P>These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined.</P>
      <P>A study published in 2000 under the Department's programme of expenditure reviews concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel.</P>
      <P>The issue of access to public transport is being addressed at present through the rural transport initiative, which is being managed by Area Development Management, ADM, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</P>
      <P>I secured &euro;500,000 in the last budget towards the cost of the initiative to ensure that free travel pass holders have access to these community-based transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very significant improvements have been made to the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the <Col N="1639" /> schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>
