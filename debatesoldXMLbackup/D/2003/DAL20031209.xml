    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 26, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have undertaken a number of visits in recent weeks as part of my ongoing series of meetings with European counterparts in advance of Ireland's Presidency. On 5-6 November, I travelled to Cyprus where I had a productive meeting with President Papadopoulos. Later on 6 November, I travelled to Slovakia for discussions with Prime Minister Dzurinda. I met Prime Minister Medgyessy of Hungary in Budapest on 13 November. My visit coincided with an Irish trade mission to Hungary and the Prime Minister and I addressed a gathering of Irish and Hungarian companies.</P>
      <P>I travelled to Bulgaria and Romania on 19 and 20 November last. In Sofia, I met Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha and later that day I travelled to Bucharest for discussions with the Romanian Prime Minister, Adrian Nastase.</P>
      <P>On 27 November, I travelled to Denmark and Latvia. In Copenhagen, I had talks with Prime Minister Rasmussen and in Riga, I had discussions with Prime Minister Repse. These discussions with my counterparts were both useful and timely and focused on a range of matters of mutual concern in the European context. In particular, the meetings presented a valuable opportunity to outline Ireland's Presidency priorities, to review matters arising in the Intergovernmental Conference and, in the case of the accession states, to discuss preparations by those countries for European Union membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, in Rome on 12 November. I took the opportunity to express, on behalf of the Government and the Irish people, my sincere condolences on the tragic loss of 19 Italian soldiers and civilians in Iraq earlier that day. Our discussions focused on the <Col N="940" />Intergovernmental Conference and Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the EU. On the Intergovernmental Conference, I made a number of points to the Prime Minister regarding the negotiations. As the House knows, Ireland is broadly happy with the Convention draft. However, we have concerns on tax, justice and home affairs, and defence which I outlined to the Prime Minister. I also emphasised our attachment to the principle of equality among member states in the Commission. I indicated our strong support for the Italian Presidency in ensuring that the Intergovernmental Conference is successfully concluded this month.</P>
    <P>I met President Museveni of Uganda on 10 November. Our discussions covered a broad range of issues, including regional security issues in central Africa, Cancun, and the opportunity for joint venture enterprises with Irish companies that could contribute to the economic development of Uganda. In the course of our discussions, we discussed the UN panel of experts' report to the Security Council. The report made serious charges regarding the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, against a number of countries, including Rwanda, Zimbabwe and the DRC itself. In the case of Uganda, it referred to a number of individuals, described as an elite network, which included the army chief of staff and a half brother of the President.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, a further report has appeared. It noted that the panel had significant contact with the Ugandan authorities on this issue, that the independent Porter commission has been established by the Ugandan Government to investigate the allegations and that the army chief of staff has been removed from office. President Museveni assured me that he will act fully on the recommendations of the Porter commission, which has recommended formal investigations and prosecution of a number of senior figures in the Ugandan army and administration. The President expressed his appreciation of Irish support for development projects in Uganda.</P>
    <P>On 19 November, I met the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, during his first official visit to Ireland. We discussed in outline certain ongoing UN considerations and initiatives on asylum and refugee issues, including the funding and operational experience of refugee programmes. We discussed a number of crises that have included high flows of refugees and-or internationally displaced people, including Afghanistan, the Middle East, Iraq and Liberia. Our discussions also included Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the EU, with specific reference to the desirability of common standards and procedures in member states.</P>
    <P>I met the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox MEP, on 26 November. It was the first official visit to Ireland by Mr. Cox in this capacity. We discussed a range of issues, including the priorities for Ireland's Presidency, the Intergovernmental Conference and other issues <Col N="941" />on the EU agenda. Mr. Cox has indicated his intention to attend the &ldquo;Day of Welcomes&rdquo; ceremony in Dublin on 1 May.</P>
    <P>I wrote to my European Council colleagues, including the ten observer member states, on 14 November and set out the approach Ireland intends to take in its EU Presidency towards the spring European Council in March 2004. The text of both my letter and the pre-Presidency priorities paper, Europeans Working Together for Growth and Dynamism in the Enlarged Europe, have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available on my Department's website. My letter contains a clear message to Heads of State or Government about the urgency of progressing the goal agreed at Lisbon in 2000, namely, the Lisbon agenda. The paper addresses the twin priorities of growth and employment. The specific areas that it proposes for attention are promoting growth-oriented economic policies, fostering competitiveness, delivering more and better employment, and ensuring sustainable growth.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with Heads of State or Government during my round of pre-Presidency meetings, their response to my proposed approach has been generally positive. The European Commission has also indicated its broad agreement with our priorities. On 26 November last, the Commission President, Romano Prodi, wrote to the Heads of State or Government outlining the areas he believes need priority action at next year's spring European Council, and noted that the approach and views expressed by the Irish Presidency are in line with his own. Official reactions from member states have likewise been supportive of the Irish approach. I will develop these priority areas further in the light of developments over the coming months, including the European Commission's Synthesis report to the spring European Council. This is the recently published report of the task force on employment and developments regarding the initiative for growth.</P>
    <P>I will attend the European Council in Brussels later this week. While the agenda is still being finalised, it is expected that the meeting will focus on economic growth, freedom, security and justice issues, enlargement, and external relations. We will also attempt to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference successfully. Clearly, a successful outcome to the Intergovernmental Conference that protects Ireland's interests in the key areas where we have concerns will be of the highest priority.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at this time for bilateral meetings with my counterparts in advance of or on the margins of the European Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach and his colleagues well at the forthcoming EU summit. Where does the Government stand on structured co-operation and closer co-operation, as referred to in Articles 40.6 and 40.7 of the draft constitution? I have noticed that the Minister for For<Col N="942" />eign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, often refers to structured co-operation and says the Government does not want to become involved in it. However, he is less vocal on the question of closer co-operation.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend, even at this late stage, to try to seek an amendment to the two articles? I have read that the Finnish Government is seeking such an amendment. Will the Taoiseach support it? What amendments to the Constitution will the Taoiseach recommend to ensure we do not become involved in either structured or closer co-operation without first putting it to the people by way of a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for his best wishes. He knows the matters to which he referred are being discussed today and were discussed yesterday as well. The Convention text establishes the possibility of an inner group of member states establishing a structured co-operation arrangement within the European Union. The Presidency proposals on structured co-operation circulated at the end of the Intergovernmental Conference on 29 November differ significantly from the Convention text. The focus is now primarily on capacity building for Petersberg missions at short notice. Therefore, the proposals have changed quite significantly since they were first made in the summer.</P>
      <P>Membership of the structured co-operation group would be set out at a later stage whereas the criteria for participation would be contained in a protocol to the treaty, which would be agreed by all. The decision to establish structured co-operation would be taken by qualified majority voting. Throughout the discussions at the Intergovernmental Conference on security and defence issues, the Government, together with some other member states, held the position that any new arrangements or arrangements that would alter the existing ones should be based on openness, inclusivity and accountability. We have argued this position since the mini-summit that took place on 29 April at which the Germans, French, Spanish and Belgians came together. The draft article and protocol on structured co-operation is moving in the direction of fulfilling the criteria we have set out, namely, being open, inclusive and accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus on the development of capabilities in the context of Petersberg Tasks operations, as well as on EU support for the United Nations in crisis management, is welcome and in line with what we have argued throughout. Together with other parties we are working to ensure the proposal is sufficiently open, inclusive and accountable, as we believe it is. Further progress was achieved regarding the issues discussed yesterday. Ireland has a good record in peacekeeping and crisis management, most recently demonstrated by our participation in the UN mission to Liberia. It should be possible to agree within the EU on arrangements to facilitate the contribution of all parties that can bring this about. It is on this basis, <Col N="943" />and only on this basis, that the discussions are taking place.</P>

      <P>In terms of the Constitution, at the end we will look at the overall agreed treaty and see what happens. That would arise with any such question. I have outlined how we see structured co-operation within the European Union. As the Deputy knows, there has been an emphasis on enhancing military capabilities within the European Union and our position on this is very clear. If the Deputy has concerns about our position I can bring him through it. Our commitment to enhancing military capabilities is to ensure that the EU can effectively undertake humanitarian crisis management operations. That is the area of co-operation, if the Deputy is concerned about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that series of questions is that obviously I do not know if this will be completed or not. I will give the Deputy my feeling as to what will happen. There seems to be an overwhelming view across member states that we should face this weekend in an attempt to complete matters. Nobody has indicated to me that they would not like to see this concluded. Equally, as with all these issues, nobody has moved much on what have been termed red line issues. We have red line issues, as have others, so the cumulative number of red line issues is fairly substantial. There are some very difficult issues, with which I will deal in a moment, but there is a determination to attempt to deal with the work of the Convention and of the Intergovernmental Conference, which has been going on for almost two years. I would like to tell Members that it will not be a drawn-out affair but the agenda has been set with meetings on Thursday to deal with <Col N="945" />social dialogue and Wim Kok's report. We must attend that meeting as the incoming Presidency and it looks as if those meetings will take up all of Thursday, while on Friday we deal with the normal agenda. There are a substantial number of items and while it should not require substantial discussion, it is in the nature of things for these meetings to turn into substantial discussions.</P>
      <P>It looks like the Intergovernmental Conference will not really commence until Friday evening. If that is the case and the Italian Presidency intends to finish it, we are in for a long weekend. I will be lucky to be back by this time next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely not. There will not be on Sunday either, nor will I have a day off. The Italian Presidency has worked hard since 4 October. There has not only been conclave but Foreign Affairs Ministers have had a number of meetings. There has been substantial engagement with most countries with which I have been in contact. If the Italians try to complete it, it will be a long weekend. That is the intention. Everybody is trying to resolve the matter.</P>
      <P>There is a few difficult issues and there will be resolutions in many areas. There has been no movement on the issue of the weight of votes which pitches France and Germany against Poland and Spain. Their representatives are saying precisely the same as they were in the Convention and in the various discussions throughout 2003. It is difficult to believe discussion is not taking place in the background but I am not sure that there is. Everybody will be aware of the style of Jose Maria Aznar who does not move on issues easily. The Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Miller, was due in Dublin last Friday but he had an accident on Thursday night and I wish him a speedy recovery. He is in a difficult political position on this. It is a potentially difficult area and I do not see a resolution at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach the best as he heads into an important Council meeting. Does he agree with the comment of the Irish EU Commissioner, David Byrne, that many countries, including Ireland, had been squeamish about acceptance of mutual defence obligations? Will he confirm Ireland is one of the four countries that have requested a change in the wording of article 147 in respect of the mutual defence clause? Does he agree with the Commissioner's comment that neutrality is not about sitting on <Col N="946" />one's hands? Has he spoken to the Commissioner since he made this comment? Has the Government changed its view on this? Does the Taoiseach accept that, at the commencement of a structure for mutual and common defence in Europe, Ireland should be involved in the discussions to shape it rather than having it imposed from outside?</P>
      <P>Under the Nice treaty, a proposal from the Council of Ministers must satisfy three criteria. It must be passed and approved by member states, it must have a majority equal to at least 62% of the EU population and it must achieve at least 232 votes out of 321. The double majority proposal by the Germans is simpler, requiring that a proposal must be passed by a majority of states representing at least 60% of the EU population. The four largest countries have 29 votes each while Poland and Spain have 27, even though Germany has double Spain's population. What is the Government's view on the double majority proposal on the voting arrangements for the Council of Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the discussions, we have been prepared to accept a number of alternatives on the voting arrangements. I probably have a preference to maintain the Nice treaty provision because we have been through that process. The other system is simpler and more easily understood. On the basis of our voting position, I do not hold the view that any of the proposed changes is enormously important. There are about four different systems, but they do not make much difference. However, the 60-60 or 50-50 approach is more easily understood and transparent, and far easier to explain. That has been the view at a number of meetings I attended here. People see it as a logistically easier system. However, there would be a different view from the perspective of Spain and Poland, which are in a strong position post-Nice and that has enormous political repercussions.</P>
      <P>On the common defence issue, I have not been speaking to Commissioner Byrne but I am aware of his views. The common defence language proposed by the Presidency would commit member states to come to the aid of a member state in the event of an armed attack, using all means in their power. We have indicated that we could not enter into an obligation of this nature and that we would wish to see the draft article revised to take account of our position. We have submitted amendments accordingly, having taken that position over the last week from the time the last wording emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position was stated clearly at the Intergovernmental Conference yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by his colleagues from Finland, Sweden and Austria. On Friday, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Austria sent a joint letter to the Italian Presidency, proposing an amendment to the draft article which will respect the position of neutral and non-aligned member states. I played a full and active part in the prep<Col N="947" />aration of that position last week in discussions with my colleagues and officials from those countries. We received support from a number of our partners and the Presidency undertook to redraft the article on mutual defence to take account of our concerns. We are now awaiting that and we will have a further opportunity to discuss this important issue at the weekend in the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The Presidency proposal on mutual defence contained in Article 147, to which Deputy Kenny referred, states that if a member state is a victim of armed aggression in its territory, the other member states, &ldquo;shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance&rdquo;. That restricts the issue very tightly for many people, apart from our difficulties on mutual defence. In accordance with Article 51 of the UN charter, the joint proposal as between Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Austria, suggests the following wording for Article 147:</P>
    <P>If a member state is a victim of armed aggression, it may request that other member states give it aid and assistance by all means in their power, military or other, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN charter.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Presidency's proposal on mutual defence, as currently drafted, is totally unacceptable to us and other neutral and non-aligned member states. I believe our position is clearly understood. This country has never been afraid to take a very active and appropriate role under a UN mandate. However, we are not disposed to move into a mutual defence situation on the basis which was proposed. I know the reason for the proposal, which has nothing to do with Ireland but is part of the ongoing arguments and difficulties on NATO issues and the transatlantic issues involving Germany and France versus the UK. It does not really take our view into account, as I believe was understood at yesterday's meeting, as reported to me.</P>

Some of the sections have been quoted but what position will the Government take at the summit on Article 142 of the draft constitution which states that EU defence policies shall not prejudice NATO states and shall be compatible with NATO policy?</P>
      <P>The special rights and responsibilities of militarily neutral states such as Ireland do not have the same explicit acknowledgement anywhere in the document. Should we not have due recognition of the position articulated by this country and other militarily neutral states which have presented a common position on other elements? Will the Government seek a specific article in the draft EU constitution explicitly recognising the rights and duties of neutral states within the Union and their right to require a UN mandate for military operations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights of neutral countries and Ireland's special position are clearly provided for in the existing EU treaties. Article 17.1 states that &ldquo;the policy of the Union in security and defence matters shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;. That article also recognises the specific security and defence policy of those member states that are members of NATO. It is a clear position of what we and NATO members want. The provision has been included in the draft treaty at the request of the Government and other member states. It has been properly dealt with.</P>

Not only will our position be clear but also that of the four other neutral countries. The wording of article 17.1 will not be changed.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach inform the House as to what we have in common with Austria, Finland and Sweden that requires us to take a common position such as this? Each of these three countries is armed to the teeth. The real question is who will defend Ireland if we are attacked? Will the Taoiseach agree that what he proposes with these other three countries is no more than the existing arrangement and is, therefore, untenable? Would it not be better for the neutral and non-aligned four states &ndash; it will be four out of 25 shortly &ndash; to seek an amendment which will permit them to take a part in common defence only after the prior approval of their national Parliaments?</P>
      <P>If the other three non-aligned countries do not want that, we should say that in the case of Ireland this would only take place with the prior approval of Dáil Éireann. Would that not buy us some defence and give us an opportunity to participate in common defence in the European Union on the best of terms? Why are we keeping our heads down and offering unrealistic positions which the EU Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, quite rightly described as sitting on our hands?</P>

He will also recall why we had to amend the treaty and insert a constitutional provision. Perhaps in the future the people will change their position. However, that is not the position of the people now. The matter is in the Constitution and in our laws. It is not a question of the people believing that whenever we debate a UN-mandated posting, the House is not delayed too long. People accept, understand, are prepared for and honoured by the fact that our people participate, sometimes fight and do whatever they have to do under a UN charter. As of now the people are not prepared to be in that position under EU defence arrangements. That is the position at present. The Deputy knows the answer to the question. The other countries take a like-minded neutral position, which is non-NATO, non-aligned, and <Col N="950" />because they are in that position we work with them as we have traditionally done.</P>

      <P>While the question I raised may be defence related, it seeks clarification from the Government on the EURATOM treaty. Does the Taoiseach agree that by attaching this treaty as a protocol to the EU constitution, nuclear power is in effect given special treatment by the EU in terms of energy generation? Is this not clearly at variance with what is happening with wind power here, which is being blocked from the grid due to lack of priority being given to that sector? Does the Government accept it has a mandate to block the EURATOM treaty based on article 3.4 of the EU constitution requiring the integration of a high level of environmental protection?</P>
      <P>Does the Government wish to scrap the protocol? Will the Taoiseach clarify the position given that the many issues dealing with nuclear safety and regulation can be incorporated into the EU constitution with specific measures, framework laws etc.? As we go into the Irish Presidency, ironically the Government will be seen as giving special treatment to the nuclear industry unless we delete this protocol.</P>

Deputy Gormley, Deputy Quinn and others raised this with me when we had a meeting at the end of the Convention and I have pursued it since then. It was not negotiated in any detailed way either in the Presidium or in the Convention, as I understand it. The issue was whether it should be left as it is in its present position or whether it should be separately examined and updated to take account of all that has happened not least in nuclear energy. We have been saying that for now it could just be left unchanged, but there should be a separate in-depth examination of EURATOM. We should agree on the process when that takes place.</P>

      <P>I refer to a related matter which is relevant to the Council meeting which will take place this weekend and to the Irish Presidency. Just over two weeks ago, serious damage was done to the operation of the European Monetary System in general and to the Stability and Growth Pact in particular. Was the Taoiseach consulted by the Minister for Finance before deciding not to support the Commission on that fateful evening? Have concerns on this matter been expressed to the Taoiseach as incoming President? Does the Taoiseach anticipate that it will be on the agenda of the forthcoming Council meeting? As incoming President of the Council, does the Taoiseach propose to request ECOFIN Ministers to review the Stability and Growth Pact with a view to changing the rules rather than pursuing their abandonment, which is the current position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the procedure is that the decision is left to ECOFIN which has the Council's authority to make it. I will give the House my view on the matter. The position of the Stability and Growth Pact must be maintained and its important work must continue. While I have arguments on certain issues pertaining to EUROSTAT which require to be changed, I do not consider the matter significant. I am a strong supporter of the fundamental principles of the Stability and Growth Pact and these should not be breached. We must all take our medicine. We in this country had to take some a few years ago.</P>
      <P>There may be a case for flexibility. I have informed the House previously that, when one has an infrastructural deficit and low public debt, there should be some consideration of the matter. That is all. I support the Stability and Growth Pact. The objective of sound and stable finances is not a luxury but a fundamental requirement for economic growth, business confidence and job creation.</P>

If the pact is used to move things around for people who have difficulties, that will feed in the short-term into the stability of the currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn will recall the debate about the Maastricht guidelines and criteria. These could be undermined. They have stood Europe in good stead and moved us away from the instability of ten years ago.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Kenny knows, Mr. Prodi, President of the European Commission, made a number of statements recently on this matter, as Deputy Kenny is aware. It is clear from the draft of the new treaty that it must be ratified by all member states according to their constitutional requirements. Nobody at the Intergovernmental Conference seriously challenged this requirement. If one or more member states experienced difficulty in ratifying the treaty, we would have to get together to see what could be done. While the Commission attends the Intergovernmental Conference as an observer, it is the Governments of the member states which make the decision to sign the treaty, and that is how it should remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Job announcements of new greenfield and expansion projects are made when negotiations have been completed and the projects have been approved by the relevant State development agency and, where required, the Government. A total of 127 such projects with a job content of 15,168 have been announced since 2000. Three of these projects, Sumicem, Thomson NETg and Quantum Electronics, with a job content of 533, have indicated that they will not proceed. There has always been an unavoidable element of risk that some change in circumstances between approval of the project and the final stages of implementation of the project will occur which will impact on the achievement of all the jobs projected for a particular project. This is not surprising since the time period from approval to the final stage of implementation is usually in the order of several years.</P>
      <P>Examples of the circumstances referred to include an unforeseen change specific to the investing company's business situation or environment or, as witnessed in the past two years or so, a global economic downturn that impacts on the investment plans and strategies of companies in several sectors. In many cases the result of the changed circumstances is a delay, alteration or, in some cases, a total cancellation of a planned investment project. In these circumstances the State development agencies have clauses in the relevant grant agreement designed to ensure that the State does not grant-aid projects that do not materialise or fail to reach agreed levels of employment.</P>
      <P>There is usually a time lag between job announcements and the creation of jobs projected to be achieved over a number of years. There is usually a one to three year time lag between job project announcements and the jobs coming on stream. Therefore, only a small number of jobs announced in a given year will be created within the year of the job announcement. In 2002, companies supported by the development agencies created over 25,000 permanent full-time jobs. This represents a strong performance in the face of the downturn in global economic activity. Data from the Forfás annual employment survey on the performance in 2003 will be available at the beginning of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the fact that announcements are made at sensitive political times, for example, just before the last general election. The Tánaiste, in the company of two Progressive Democrats candidates, made a major announcement of jobs for Thomson NETg in Limerick and Birr on 18 April 2002 and promised 360 jobs for these locations. I am sure she can understand the frustration of workers and communities when these jobs subsequently did not proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even with the best will in the world, surely the rush to make these announcements still involved <Col N="954" />our State agencies' understanding of the financial well-being of the company involved and its medium and short-term strategy regarding its European operations. Will the Tánaiste agree that the headlong rush to make these announcements in advance of the general election, for Macroom, Longford, Birr, Limerick and Galway, led people to believe that the jobs were real and were about to be created? Will she agree that the inordinate number of jobs which failed to proceed or progress leads people to the conclusion that these announcements were for phantom jobs announced for the purposes of electoral gain?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally and utterly reject the Deputy's suggestion. I remind him that my predecessor and I have observed the protocol which is in place in respect of job announcements in the immediate election period. That is the way it should be. Job announcements are to a large extent determined by the companies, when grant approval has been given. Many companies apply for planning permission before job announcements are made. Local information is often available about projects before they are announced. Additional jobs at the Seagate plant in Clonmel, announced during the rainbow coalition's period in office, did not materialise. Nobody suggested that the announcement was partisan in any way and I am not making such a suggestion now. The reality is that circumstances in global economy change&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to put things in perspective. Over 15,500 jobs have been announced since 2000, of which 533 are not proceeding. It was announced in recent weeks that the proposed expansion to the Birr operation of Thomson NETg, which has a major facility at Limerick, will not proceed. The project was approved by the board of IDA Ireland. Is somebody seriously suggesting that an international company and the board of our development agency were involved in a partisan announcement? If Deputy Hogan reflects on the matter, he will appreciate that it is not the case. Many jobs which are created with the benefit of grant aid are not announced because the company in question does not wish to announce them, for whatever reason. I have been involved in many projects in respect of which there has been no public announcement, in deference to the wishes of the company. I do not accept that my colleagues or I were involved in electioneering on the back of job announcements in the instance mentioned by Deputy Hogan or on any other occasion.</P>

      <P>Legislative proposals to repeal and amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 have been developed at departmental level. The Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel is undertaking a process of legal drafting in that regard. Although drafting is at an advanced stage of development, it is a long and complicated process because it involves a detailed revision of the legislative occupational health and safety framework. Consultations between officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="956" />ment and the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel are ongoing. I expect to be in a position to introduce a safety, health and welfare at work Bill in 2004, perhaps in March or April. I intend to consult the social partners before any such Bill is published.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to keep my remarks in line with the Chair's admonition to Deputy Hogan. Those listening to the proceedings of the House will consider it totally unacceptable that the Minister of State has said it has taken two years to bring forward a Bill, which relates to matters of life and death, because it is long and complicated.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State been in contact with representatives of the 3,000 building workers who staged a mass demonstration outside this House almost a year ago to demand this legislation? How many inspectors are in place to enforce the existing legislation? How many inspections have been undertaken this year to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a complicated Bill which will run to several hundred pages. The fact that it is taking so long is a cause of concern to everybody. It is a good Bill, however, as it will provide for a significant number of improved sanctions. There will be increased fines, including on-the-spot fines.</P>
      <P>I regularly meet members of the construction safety partnership, which includes representatives of unions and employers in the construction sector. Not only do we discuss the contents of the new Bill on an ongoing basis, but we also consider health and safety matters. I am glad to say that there have been improvements this year. The number of fatalities is not as high as it was last year. All partners in the construction sector are making a significant effort to try to ensure that there are reductions in the numbers of fatalities and accidents in the workplace. Some 100 health and safety officers are active at present. It is difficult to quantify the exact number of inspections because inspections of various types take place all the time. It is impossible to put a figure on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it alarming that the Minister of State has expressed anything but dismay at the continuing high number of fatalities. Can the Minister confirm that the number of fatalities last year was 61 and that the equivalent figure for the first nine months of this year is 49? There has not been an significant reduction. Does he feel that health and safety, which is a matter of life and death for workers throughout the country, should be his priority? Is it possible for the cross-departmental team, which examines and monitors legislation, to ensure that the Bill is brought before the House before March or April of 2004?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been 11 deaths in the construction industry so far this year. Four county council workers involved in various types of construction, or construction-related activity, have died. Four members of the public have died in the workplace. Last year, 22 people who were directly involved in the construction industry died. The Deputy may recall that there were several fatalities this time last year, but there have been reductions this year. I agree that any fatality is one too many. We have to work to ensure that the significant effort being made by all parties at present is continued.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to bring the proposed safety, health and welfare at work Bill to the House before March or April of next year. The Deputy is aware that the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, which is involved in the process, has a significant workload at present. The legislation is being delayed for that reason.</P>

      <Quest> the research her Department has carried out on the supply chain for food, drinks, fashion and footwear prior to and since Ireland joined the euro; her views on the fact that some prices may be inflated as certain retailers still treat the Irish market as being part of the sterling area with products from the euro economies being inflated by unnecessary currency transaction costs; and if she will request the Competition Authority to investigate whether informal market restrictions may be in place which discourage the direct importation of products from the euro currency area. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Research into price behaviour during the euro changeover period was carried out by Forfás last year, at my request. A report which was published in June 2002 can be accessed on the Forfás website, <i>www.forfas.ie</i> The report concluded that the euro changeover had not been used as an opportunity to introduce excessive price increases, generally speaking. There are grounds for concern, however, as a consequence of price increases in the non-traded sector. This sector consists of businesses that do not face direct foreign competition. Further Forfás research earlier this year highlighted this sector as a significant driver of inflation in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some price pressure may be associated with the rapid pace of economic growth in recent years, it is possible that deeper structural factors, such as informal restrictions inhibiting imports, may exist. I have asked Forfás to focus on a small number of selected product or service areas as <Col N="958" />part of the next phase of its price investigation work. This work will complement the competition enforcement activities of the Competition Authority. My Department has drawn the matter to the attention of the authority. I am not aware of current practice relating to inappropriate currency transaction charges in connection with products imported from other eurozone countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste. This is an important issue. A great deal of attention has been paid to price inflation in the food and drink sectors, as well as the general retail sector, in recent times. The fact that 60% of goods sold in this country are imported from the UK, rather than the eurozone, is startling. I am concerned that this statistic may have contributed to inflation in recent years, particularly when products are imported from Europe, via the UK, into Ireland. A series of currency transactions occurs in the supply chain in such circumstances. We know that businesses making such currency transactions are often very conservative. It is therefore adding to the price quite significantly.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste said she has asked Forfás to examine informal restrictions that may be in place. In the news earlier this week concern was expressed that certain retailers were considering restricting themselves to exclusively Irish suppliers and no longer dealing directly with other retail stores. I was more concerned with instances where an agency or product supplied from Europe could not be sold into the Irish market, except through a UK distributor. Perhaps the Tánaiste could provide more specific details. Is that the type of informal restriction about which she is concerned? What are the exact powers of Forfás in the area? Would it not be more appropriate, if there are such informal restrictions, to have the Competition Authority investigate the matter, given that I assume the companies concerned are in breach of European competition rules? It is less of a problem, since our inflation rate has dropped dramatically following the rise of the euro over sterling. However, it could have very important long-term consequences.</P>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste concerned that Ireland is increasingly seen as part of the British market in consumer goods, and, in particular, part of the Manchester market? Ireland is seen as an add-on to that distribution chain. That Manchester market usually has quite a high mark-up in the UK, and that is worsened by exchange rate differences. Is the Tánaiste concerned that the Irish market is now seen by many UK suppliers in that light?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the rapid price increases in some product categories, particularly in the food sector, which is among the areas which I have asked Forfás to examine. For example, that Lidl and Aldi have gained such a major share of the Irish market so quickly indicates that there is great scope for competition and <Col N="959" />that consumers are voting with their feet. Prices in some of those categories seem to be substantially lower in Northern Ireland than in the Republic. However, those are among the issues I have asked Forfás to examine.</P>
      <P>There are competition rules that apply within the Single Market, but since we have not completed it in many respects, several directives are under discussion regarding sales promotion and unfair trading practices that may have an impact here. Unfair barriers or requirements that people must purchase from a certain importer are among the issues we must examine to ensure they are removed. I hope the change in the value of the currency will be passed on to consumers. It has had a major impact in reducing inflation over the last few months. During the years when the currency was at a different rate, we were constantly told it was the reason for higher prices. I hope we see the benefit now that it is the other way around. I repeat what I have said in many fora: the most effective way to get prices down across all sectors is enhanced competition, and, quite honestly, one cannot have enough of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the informal restrictions that may be in place and the Tánaiste's request that Forfás investigate them, perhaps she might outline where those concerns were raised with her. Was it regarding individual companies, or were certain suppliers coming to her saying they were unable to access specific products owing to such restrictions? Has the Tánaiste asked Forfás to investigate specific examples?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given it quite an open agenda. Obviously they must be category-specific. I do not want them going all over the shop. I want some quite specific hard data that might help us take whatever action we can at domestic level. Some may be on distribution and some, as the Deputy suggests, on import restrictions through certain companies. In some sectors many companies see Ireland and Britain as one market. They certainly see the island of Ireland as one market, but that does not cause the difficulty we are discussing here, because prices in Northern Ireland are substantially lower for many of the same product categories. I do not accept that all differences are accounted for by higher costs here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the findings of the recently published analysis of the Irish food industry, entitled Food Production and Food Prices in Ireland, to which the Deputy refers. The report points to increases in business operating costs in the food manufacturing, distribution and retail sectors as having contributed significantly to food price inflation in Ireland since 1990. Notable among the business operating costs mentioned in the report are payroll, rent and property, transportation, insurance and professional fees. While the report relates primarily to the Irish food industry, the issues it raises extend to the whole national competitiveness agenda.</P>
      <P>The National Competitiveness Council stated in both its recently published reports that Ireland's immediate priority must be to slow the growth of prices and costs. The Government is committed to enhancing Ireland's competitiveness status, and an essential component of that is to provide a business environment with low inflation. Low inflation will stabilise firms' costs and provide them with a solid competitive business environment from which they can successfully compete in both domestic and international markets. Ireland's inflation rate fell to 2.3% during October. However, we cannot afford to be complacent. We will continue to reduce our inflation rate, bringing it into line with our EU partners and other competitors. In that context, the 2004 budget demonstrated that keeping inflation low was a key priority.</P>
      <P>The NCC presented us last week with a set of key priority areas on which we must monitor progress. At its meeting on 25 November, the Government discussed both reports of the National Competitiveness Council. It was agreed at that meeting that the Government should consider Ireland's competitiveness status every six months. That would also include discussing the recommendations of both National Competitiveness Council reports. The Government also agreed to set up a monitoring process to consider and track progress on the implementation of the council's recommendations.</P>

However, ultimately we must enhance competition. As the report suggests, in sectors subject to international competition, prices are much lower than in those sectors that are sheltered here. Among the factors that have been identified as contributing to the higher operating costs is the minimum wage, yet no one is suggesting that we return to &euro;4 an hour. Shortly we will move to &euro;7 an hour. The high cost of insurance is also clearly a factor, and we are tackling that very effectively. A third issue is infrastructure, particularly transport, which is having an impact on businesses operating from this island.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, having said all that, the thing that will drive down prices for business and regular consumers will be as much competition as possible, and we should embrace competition in all its aspects &ndash; not just the rhetoric but the practice. As a small country, we are sometimes not that good at doing so, as we can see from the views expressed by various lobby groups. I understand that the Taoiseach said last week that if we removed the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987, it would substantially reduce prices.</P>

      <P>Independent traders seem to have been taking a hit in this regard. The figures show that their net profit is just 2.13%. In the same context, they have had to deal with inflationary pressures in that period, with light, heat and power going up 36%, insurance 70%, and transport and motor expenses 27.9%. The large increase in foodstuff prices has more to do with the Government's failure to control inflation and stealth taxes in the area. For that reason, a request that the Competition Authority examine the issue, including how the multiples and independent traders operate, is essential so we may see clearly, once and for all, where the differences are.</P>

      <P>As I said in response to the last question, the rapid growth of the discount stores Aldi and Lidl in the Republic shows that there is a place for those charging lower prices. One of the greatest acts of consumerism that I saw last week in the newspaper was the lobby in one of the Meath towns for planning permission to be granted to one such store. If I recall correctly, I <Col N="962" />read that 2,000 signatures had been collected. That is highly unusual. It is probably the most pro-consumer lobby I have seen emerge anywhere. We can have studies and analysis but in Northern Ireland both these stores charge less for their products and are still profitable. Therefore, when competition is enhanced, everyone benefits.</P>
      <P>The most recent advertising campaign produced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, Ms Carmel Foley, is proving very successful. There has been much positive anecdotal feedback, although we do not yet have hard data. People are shopping around and are more vigilant and sensitive to the prices which are being charged. I hope retailers across all sectors will respond to that.</P>

      <P>On 18 April, 2002, I announced that Churchill Insurance Group plc, UK was to create 600 new jobs in Galway over the next five years. This facility, a customer interaction centre, was necessary to support current and future growth of Churchill's insurance business in the UK market, which consists mainly of household and motor insurance. The company currently employs about 130 people in the Galway facility.</P>
      <P>On 18 April 2002, I also announced that Thomson NETg, one of the world's leading providers of learning solutions to the corporate and academic markets, was to expand its e-learning product development and innovation centre operation in Limerick with the creation of 360 new jobs, bringing total employment at Thomson NETg in Ireland to 700 by the end of 2005. As part of the proposed expansion, the company agreed with IDA Ireland that up to 80 of the new jobs announced in April 2002 would be located in Birr, County Offaly. However, the company subsequently decided to postpone its expansion plans and indicated that it would not undertake the establishment of an operation in Birr due to the adverse economic climate, particularly in the e-learning sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 19 November 2003, NETg announced that, as part of an ongoing assessment and reorganis<Col N="963" />ation of its global business operations, a decision had been made to consolidate its global product development activity in Naperville, Illinois, USA. As a result of this decision, the company's product development facility in Limerick will cease operations with the loss of 173 jobs. The plant is expected to close in March 2004.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the Limerick closure decision was only taken after considerable examination of the corporate structure and a review of options. The group is operating in an increasingly challenging IT environment which necessitated taking measures in order to align the cost base with revenue. The availability of the Limerick facility for a new project will be marketed strongly by IDA Ireland in co-operation with NETg. FÁS has already been in contact with the company and offered its range of training, job placement and other services to workers affected by the proposed closure.</P>

      <P>I am taken by the tone of the Tánaiste's response to this question and the previous one from Deputy Hogan. She is positively hurt by the suggestion that electioneering could have been contributory to the timing of these announcements. In that context, why did the Tánaiste attribute the name &ldquo;golden Thursday&rdquo; to this series of job announcements made at the edge of the general election campaign?</P>
      <P>What did she say to her colleague, Deputy Parlon, when he was the Progressive Democrats candidate in Laois-Offaly and announced at the time: &ldquo;I am different, I deliver&rdquo; and campaigned on that basis? If the Minister of State's delivery of decentralisation matches his delivery of jobs to Birr, there is no hope of any civil servants moving out of this town.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Hurt&rdquo; may be too strong a word. I understand politics, therefore to describe me as being hurt would be a gross exaggeration. I refute any suggestion that this State was picked because of the run in to the general election. The IDA, in conjunction with the companies, asked me to announce these company expansions on that day. I did not go after the IDA looking for projects out of the bag to announce in the run up to the election.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, if one wants to survive in this business, one needs to deliver to one's constituents in whatever form that takes. That applies to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon.</P>

      <P>They are not empty promises. I opened a technology centre in Birr a couple of months ago. A great deal is happening in the town as there is elsewhere, about which we should be proud. International companies respond to international circumstances. I could give the Deputy a long list of companies about <Col N="964" />which we made announcements in regard to the creation of 200 or 300 jobs, which subsequently became 500 and 600 jobs. As Deputy Howlin knows, having sat at the Cabinet table, the job approval figure is always substantially higher than the job announcement figure in order that people are not accused of exaggerating the positives.</P>

      <P>The protocol has existed for some time. It was in place during the reign of the previous Government and perhaps the one before that. After an election is called, no job announcements through the IDA or Enterprise Ireland should be made by Departments. People have been asked to respect that protocol and have done so for a number of years.</P>
      <P>Of the 960 jobs I announced, 130 have been created in Churchill in Galway. The Thomson NETg jobs are not proceeding. The Churchill jobs accounted for 600 of the 960.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategy of the industrial development agencies is to focus on supporting the development in Ireland of those elements of a company's operations which best fit Ireland's competitive characteristics. The rapid development of the economy in recent years has resulted in a need to outsource some production activities in order to maintain competitiveness. On the other hand, other competitive factors such as the increasingly well-educated and skilled nature of the labour force makes it feasible for us retain and attract higher value-added activities such as the back office functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of Irish-owned enterprise and its funding support is geared to the expansion of existing companies and the establishment of new high potential companies through innovation and internationalisation. Enterprise Ireland's <Col N="965" />support is provided through a planned, structured development process designed to strengthen all aspects of a client's business which are critical to achieving accelerated profitable growth.</P>
    <P>Considerable attention is focused on developing the areas of marketing, finance, human resources, research and development and business strategy, which usually involve a significant amount of high-value activity and often form the bulk of back-office functions. Many Irish-owned companies have employed or are considering competitive outsourcing as a key part of an internationalisation strategy necessary to enable them to grow and develop and, in some cases, to survive. Enterprise Ireland assists such companies to identify opportunities abroad for outsourcing production, but only in the context of the retention of the higher value-added back-office activities in this country. This often involves maintaining time-sensitive or specialised production here, alongside development, design, marketing, finance and customer service functions.</P>
    <P>In respect of overseas companies, IDA Ireland targets a wide range of activities undertaken by clients, including shared services functions such as sales and accounting, as part of its drive to attract new investment and embed existing client companies more firmly in the Irish economy. This reflects a recognition that such activities can have a cost-skill profile which is better suited to Ireland's circumstances than some manufacturing functions, particularly where its basic manufacture is, by today's standards, of relatively low technology products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for her reply. She stated that the rapid development of Ireland led to the necessity for certain companies to set up manufacturing outside the economy. However, the rapid inflation which came in the last three or five years, particularly of the previous Administration, was the key factor. The lack of competitiveness was the issue rather than excess development.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste supply more detailed specifics as to what exactly Enterprise Ireland can do? I realise it is a difficult job, particularly when an agency, which is responsible for trying to locate manufacturing here, is now recognising the reality that we will lose many of those manufacturing jobs. It is seeking to assist companies in relocating manufacturing, so long as they maintain back-office functions here.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste give some more detail as to where the responsibility lies for this issue? Does it lie exclusively with Enterprise Ireland or does IDA Ireland have a role in the process? Are financial, training or overseas support programmes and systems in place for companies or is advice just being given by Enterprise Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Tánaiste supply specific information regarding the restructuring of Enterprise Ireland and State industrial development agencies to deal with the situation whereby, due to our high <Col N="966" />inflation and lack of competitiveness, we will lose between 80,000 and 100,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector in the next three or four years? The only strategy in terms of retreat in that area is to try to retain some of the associated back office functions. Is it purely the function of Enterprise Ireland to assist in the retention of these functions or does IDA Ireland have a role to play? Is the Tánaiste in a position to refer to specific programmes, rather than merely stating the general advice she has been given?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of it would be by way of identifying contacts for companies. Some companies have done this on their own and have never approached Enterprise Ireland. A number of Irish companies have outsourced manufacturing and I am aware of one successful textile company, which began life six generations ago, that employs more people now than it did when all its production was done here. The latter has outsourced the making of its products and retained the design, finance, logistics and marketing functions in Ireland. The same applies to some of our electronics companies which have done so essentially using the overseas offices and contacts of Enterprise Ireland. Companies are often put in touch with partners that can facilitate them in terms of taking over some or all of the manufacturing aspect. Production-sensitive or time-sensitive manufacturing is usually retained in Ireland.</P>
      <P>We must be flexible in terms of how we assist companies. However, our job is not to help to grow other economies, our job is to help to sustain Irish companies operating out of Ireland. The latter is foremost in the mind of those who run Enterprise Ireland, who have exclusive responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>We recently established a competitiveness fund which contains a small amount of money to help companies overcome particular competitiveness challenges. Sometimes it is merely a question of whether a company will survive. If we can retain brands and all the work associated with developing them in Ireland and move other activities elsewhere, that could be a recipe for success.</P>
      <P>In the event that there is a misunderstanding, this policy is only pursued where there are no alternatives. We still remain extremely competitive but we have the second highest wage level in the eurozone. Where wages are a high cost of production, as is the case in labour-intensive sectors, it makes sense to move labour-intensive activities elsewhere and many companies are doing so. Some software companies are outsourcing software development to, for example, India, where software engineers are paid the equivalent of between &euro;5,000 and &euro;6,000 or $5,000 and $6,000 per year. It is difficult to compete with countries in which those are the wage levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the liquidation is progressing in an orderly and efficient manner and that considerable progress has been made regarding the realisation of the company's assets. However, while the company's principal properties in Arklow and Marino Point have been placed on the market, I am advised that it may take some time to sell them.</P>
      <P>I also understand that most of the company's obligations to secured creditors have been settled, while payments to preferred creditors, which would include some amounts due to former employees, have been or are in the course of being made. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that payments will be made to unsecured creditors until the main property assets are sold, which I understand could take some time. I understand that the liquidator will hold a creditors meeting shortly to outline progress with the liquidation.</P>
      <P>All claims received by my Department under the redundancy payments scheme and the insolvency payments scheme have been processed. Similarly, all applications received from employees for payments from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund of &euro;24.5 million, established by ICI and the State, have been processed. Payments from the fund were made by the trustee thereof in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by him following consultations with employee representatives. A ballot open to all employees endorsed this basis for distribution.</P>
      <P>Based on legal advice received, the liquidator has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements to enhanced redundancy payments. It must be emphasised that the amount to be paid in due course in respect of such claims is a matter solely for the liquidator.</P>
      <P>I understand that the pension schemes covering all employees in the Republic, apart from a scheme covering two former chief executive officers, have sufficient funds to meet all the entitlements provided under the scheme, as well as pension increases of up to 3% per annum. However, there may not be sufficient funds to pay some discretionary benefits, which employees had hoped to receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Belfast pension scheme, I understand that the scheme will only be able to pay active members, that is, employees still working at the time the company ceased operations, less than half their entitlements under the scheme. Existing pensioners are given priority and, as a result, they are largely unaffected by the shortfall in the fund. The shortfall involved arises primarily from a combination of stock market <Col N="968" />losses on investments and the impact of the regulatory regime in the North, which provides that pension schemes fund on a going concern basis. Our regulations require defined benefit schemes to fund on a more rigorous discontinuance basis. This ensures that provision is made for the additional costs of acquiring annuities when a scheme is wound up. I have only very limited information available about the scheme covering former chief executive officers, but I understand that this may be significantly underfunded. At this stage, I do not expect that the State will receive payment in respect of its shareholding in the company.</P>

Will the Tánaiste indicate what she knows about the investigation? Who is carrying out that investigation? On her comment that the State will receive nothing from its 51% shareholding, has Mr. Jackson, the liquidator, indicated that he expects to raise over &euro;100 million?

      <P>I know very little about the article in the newspaper. I did not know anything about that article or its subject matter until it appeared. Responsibility for pension funds rests with the trustees, not the shareholders. The latter have no role in respect of pension funds. As I understand it, the article refers to the scheme I referred to in my reply, namely, that covering two former retired chief executive officers. I place on record that there are no financial irregularities involved and no one has suggested otherwise. However, I understand that the Pensions Board has referred the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am, therefore, unable to say anything more about it. Neither the shareholders nor I had, nor should we have, any hand, act or part in this.</P>

    <P>In terms of the amounts realised from the disposal of the two sites, there are many others, such as, for example, the unsecured creditors to whom I referred in my reply, who will have to be paid <Col N="969" />in the first instance. We have an undertaking to the employees that we would reconsider some of the issues surrounding their concerns in the event that assets are realised. I am not saying that the State would not wish to recoup some money, but it is not our intention to recoup any money from this sad and sorry episode. If there was a surplus of funds, it would be divided on a fair basis between the employees who worked for IFI when it closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>Some 16 investigations into company law matters have been initiated by me since I took office as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In respect of three cases, the High Court appointed, on an application by me, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report which was subsequently published has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Section 8 inquiries into the affairs of National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are continuing. A further interim report was submitted to the High Court in July 2003. An investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998 and the report has been passed to the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 11 investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990 of which six have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two reports have been passed to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while a fourth report was passed to the relevant High <Col N="971" />Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
    <P>Some three investigations under section 19 are ongoing and the authorised officer is working towards completing reports of the investigations by mid-2004. Two investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. An investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989 and a report in this regard has been referred to the DPP and to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation of the company.</P>
    <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to approximately &euro;10.3 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs, which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this &euro;10.3 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8; &euro;5.3 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and &euro;3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
    <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. The issue of recovering costs in the Ansbacher inquiry is now before the courts. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tanáiste accept that ongoing inquiries have, after seven years, become a saga? What prosecutions have ensued and how many individuals have been charged on foot of such prosecutions? Does she believe that expenditure by her Department of &euro;10 million plus the costs incurred by the Civil Service and the significant legal costs which fall to another Department for payment, should result in a clear benefit to the public by way of identified and published results?</P>
      <P>The Tanáiste referred to a few specific investigations and said a number had been referred to the DPP. An investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act completed in 1998 has been passed to the DPP. Are these reports merely lodged with the Attorney General or does the Tanáiste have any dialogue with him in this regard? Are we to expect no result to ensue from these investigations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who have already indicated that substantial moneys have been recouped to the State on foot of the National Irish Investment Bank inquiry and others.</P>
      <P>Under the corporate enforcement mechanism, we introduced legislation establishing a new independent officer to head the properly resourced office before completion of the inquiries as a result of what was coming through from them. He is having considerable success. I am sure the Deputy is aware he is an independent office holder and that he has been involved in a number of high profile prosecutions in recent times.</P>
      <P>On prosecutions concluded during my watch, there were a number of prosecutions following the investigation into Garuda Limited. We do not have any way of knowing the DPP's thinking on matters referred to him. He is very active these days. I know the reports are not gathering dust in his office. I am quite certain that if action can be taken on them, it will be taken. A number of inquiries remain outstanding. I understand a report on the NIB inquiry, one of the more significant ones, is due shortly. The reason such inquiries take so long and cost so much relates to the ongoing legal battles involved. Inquiries under section 19 seem better able to produce the type of preliminary results which will allow the Director of Corporate Enforcement to initiate activity. Responsibility for inquiries has been taken out of the political system and passed to an independent office holder and that is how such matters should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I genuinely believe we have received a great deal of value for money and that there has been a change in corporate behaviour as a result of inquiries in this area. Many changes have resulted from activities in other places, particularly in some of the tribunals of inquiry, such as the Dunne inquiry which dealt with payments to politicians set up by the Government of which the Deputy's party was a member. There are so many inquiries I cannot remember the name. The inquiry dealing with payments to Ben Dunne &ndash; the McCracken inquiry &ndash; led to many inquiries which have borne a lot of fruit and have been very successful.</P>

      <P>I agree with much that the Tanáiste said. How many investigations are currently outstanding and when will they be completed? Can the Tanáiste tell us the number of people who have been successfully prosecuted subsequent to inquiries initiated on her watch?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Prosecutions in terms of inquiries initiated by my Department relate, in the main, to the Garuda investigation. The Director of Corporate Enforcement has since taken over many of the functions and reports in that regard. I can obtain the relevant information for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of inquiries remain outstanding; two relate to National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited. I <Col N="973" />understand a final report in that regard is due shortly. The official in my Department with responsibility for the inquiries at the time the new office was established is currently working on reports relating to three investigations. It is hoped they will be completed by next summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main challenges in the area of employment policy is to increase the overall numbers of those at work, including women. Participation by women in the labour market has, during the past ten years, increased by one third. The employment rate for females in 2002 stood at 55.2%, which compares to the EU average rate of 55.5% for females in employment in the same period.</P>
      <P>I accept the provision of child care facilities is an important factor in encouraging women to take up employment and the Government is committed to meeting the diverse needs of parents and children through supporting the development of accessible, high quality child care services. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has overall responsibility for the formulation of national policy on child care and for the implementation of child care services, established structures to bring the key players together at national and local level to ensure effective development.</P>
      <P>The principal aim of the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-06 is the development of quality child care to meet the needs of parents in employment, training or education. Funding made available under the programme amounts to &euro;436.7 million up to 2006. As of 30 November 2003, &euro;234.6 million has been committed under the programme. It is estimated that the grants to child care providers and community groups to date will create 26,948 new child care places and will also support more than 25,919 existing places.</P>
      <P>Both IDA Ireland and FÁS, which operate under the aegis of my Department, have introduced initiatives designed to facilitate the increased participation of women in the workforce. IDA Ireland has identified six of its existing business parks for the development of child care services. This will benefit both employers and employees and thereby enhance the attractiveness of IDA Ireland parks to international investors. FÁS has operated a pilot child care allowance scheme since 2001 to facilitate primary child carers who wish to seek training to get back into the workforce. A sum of &euro;6.7 million has been allocated to the scheme in 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister of State's reply that the average return to work rates in both Ireland and the EU is decreasing. Will the Minister of State confirm that this is the case? The averages in 1999 were 68% in Ireland and 63% in the EU. The Minister of State referred to a figure of 55.2% in Ireland. If this is the case, is there any prospect that this return to work percentage will ever be met? Are we tackling a mountain with a teaspoon? Are we ever going to lower this barrier for women returning to the workplace?</P>
      <P>Given that IDA Ireland is at last beginning to earmark areas in its parks for child care facilities, would State-run child care facilities speed up this process and ensure that such necessary facilities are put in place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of employment among females in Ireland jumped 15% since 1994 to 55.2% in 2002. The employment rate for women aged 25 to 29, standing at 78%, is much higher than in most OECD countries. All the evidence suggests that there has been a significant increase in the number of women entering the workplace. This is due in no small way to the increased child care provisions that have been made.</P>
      <P>We all accept that there is a need for continuing increases in the number of child care places provided. Since 1992, when hardly any child care facilities were available in this State, there has been significant investment and a large number of places provided. This has been accompanied by a significant increase in the number of women joining the workforce. While I am the first to accept there is a need for further places, I do not accept that State provision of such places is the answer. However, there is a good combination between State and private sector provision under current arrangements. One can see the level of support given by the State in, for example, IDA industrial parks and working class areas where women are returning to the workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the prime motivation for the announcement on decentralisation last week was the political interest of his party to avoid decimation at the local elections next year and that the programme has been heavily influenced by political considerations? Clearly, having a Minister in or adjacent to a constituency has meant more civil servants in the raffle for the public service. Of the eight Departments to be decentralised, five are either in or close to Minister's constituencies and only one quarter of the posts will go to towns mentioned in the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, has openly boasted that this was heavily influenced by political considerations and his involvement was central to the announcement of the transfer of civil servants to his constituency, does the Taoiseach consider that the Minister of State, for one, is clearly in breach of paragraph 1.4 of the Public Office Commission's code of conduct for Ministers and Ministers of State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy. As Minister for Finance, I was actively involved in the decentralisation in the 1990s of approximately 4,500 public servants to various centres throughout the country. This has worked extremely well. In 1999 the Government stated that, due to the population growth in the greater Dublin region &ndash; 2 million inhabitants were enumerated there in the previous census &ndash; we would have a further period of decentralisation. A com<Col N="976" />mittee has worked on this since. We said we would wait until the national spatial strategy was launched before completing the work. We have done so and identified 53 locations in 25 counties for the decentralisation of 10,300 people. This is in keeping with previous decentralisation programmes. The schemes have been set out and the implementation group will hold its first meeting next week.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Kenny said that the locations to which offices are being decentralised are either in or near Minister's constituencies, Ireland is a small country and it is to be expected that locations could be seen as being near certain places. It is not unlikely that they would be. I consider Mayo as being near Dublin. I noted over the weekend that many Opposition Members claimed they had an influence in this as well. We seem to have a great competition in claiming who has the most influence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question. I asked him if the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who has galloped in here from Parlon country, is in breach of paragraph 1.4 of the code of conduct for office holders. This paragraph states clearly that ethical behaviour requires Ministers to take decisions in the national interest over and above personal and parliamentary interests. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, said that no other public representative in the Laoighis-Offaly constituency, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, had done anything for the people of that constituency over the years and that he was the great person to sort out their problems. This reminds me of the words of that great Mayo writer, Paul Durcan. When he wrote about the national spatial strategy, he said the Garden of Eden will be transferred from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism under its new Minister, Condoleezza Rice.</P>
      <P>The criteria and analysis used in this non-political exercise, under the Taoiseach's direction, meant that 53 towns out of 130 were entitled to rejoice somewhat at the initial announcement, which was generally supported throughout the country. However, trust in politics is lost when cynicism such as we have witnessed creeps in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach publish the analysis and criteria used in the selection of the 53 towns so people in Boyle, for instance, can understand why they were not considered suitable for an allocation of some element of the public service? The <Col N="977" />Taoiseach said on the 9 o'clock news that these criteria were based on discussions that had been taking place for three years. Does he consider that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is clearly in breach of paragraph 1.4 of the code of conduct for office holders?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny is mistaken in that he is just thinking in terms of individual locations. The attempt is to have a regional spread and to try to locate Departments and agencies in a cluster. One of the general objections of public servants to decentralisation was that enormous difficulties would arise if it were carried out in a haphazard way, whereby people could not be promoted within a region. In the considerable consultation that took place in recent years, the public servants made this point validly and expressed it at their conferences in the four years since the Government launched its decentralisation programme. A serious point that must be made is that there is now regional balance, and it has been achieved in a proper manner.</P>

      <P>Why was there no consultation in line with the Minister for Finance's commitment to the Dáil in this reply to a parliamentary question?</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach help me reconcile the Tánaiste's statement of 2 January 2002 on previous decentralisation by three Ministers? She insisted that the exercise should not generate a repeat of the earlier behaviour of three Fianna Fáil Ministers who had transferred sections of their Departments to their constituencies. Adding to the tensions between the coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, criticised it as &ldquo;the worst kind of bogman politics&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste insisted that decentralisation would have to be achieved in a meaningful and efficient way rather than by using a scatter-gun approach around the country. Does the Taoiseach agree with her? Does he recall when she objected to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, inviting his colleagues to bid for the civil servants for their constituencies? What does the Taoiseach think of the Progressive Democrats Minister, Deputy Parlon, the first at the hireling fair who gives the impression he will drive the tractor up to Dublin and help the civil servants with the removals himself? If this is the role of the Progressive Democrats, why does it not decentralise to Mount Street and be done with it?</P>

      <P>On Deputy Rabbitte's question, I do not believe the efficiency of Government will suffer. I remember the arguments made when the then Department of Social Welfare was to move to Sligo and the Revenue Commissioners to Tipperary. There are many arguments to show that these moves have been effective. Given that multinational companies in the west can deal with their parent companies in various continents, we should have no difficulty if the decentralised bodies are in close proximity. My experience indicates that people who are stuck in offices in the city centre &ndash; some of which are not very appropriate &ndash; and who are on top of each other all the time might be much better off and much better tempered if they were based in regional locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Taoiseach means by all those civil servants on top of each other. Clearly more fun goes on in the Civil Service than I was aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the quality of governance will not be affected? Does he genuinely believe the business of Government can be done by e-mail? Is it the case, as has been suggested by a former Taoiseach, that, for example, civil servants participate in no less than 300 interdepartmental committees on behalf of their Ministers? Is the Taoiseach saying he intends to stick with the budget day commitment to the implementation of this package, as it has been rolled out, within three years? Would it not have been more rational and reasonable to have truly engaged in the consultation promised by the Minister for Finance and to have compiled a league table of locations in the country consistent with the national spatial strategy? That table could have been consistent with a range of socio-economic factors, such as the availability of infra<Col N="981" />structure, and self-contained, autonomous units of Government might be transferred to those areas.</P>
    <P>This is the scatter-gun approach the Tánaiste claimed to fear and the hireling fair which repulsed her before the election. Is the Taoiseach saying now, on mature reflection and having got what he can to deflect from what was otherwise a very bad budget, that he will persist in implementing this against the public interest? </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The efficiency of governance will not be affected in any way. Moving a large core of Departments out to regional locations is good for them and it will be better for the staff in terms of quality of life and opportunities. It will make for better balanced development in the country. With modern technology I do not see problems arising &ndash; we are not just talking about e-mails. Meetings can take place in locations all over the world without everyone having to be in the one room. If those days were ever relevant they are long out of date. There are no difficulties with these issues.</P>
      <P>The consultation and examination carried out by the Minister and the committee which dealt with this were long enough. As Deputy Rabbitte knows, people will go on forever about these issues. Everyone wanted decentralisation in their areas, but it is not possible to cover all 130 or 140 locations seeking decentralisation. That would be a scatter-gun approach. Only one third of those locations will be involved but they will be good locations.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte on some of the better issues in the budget were overlooked but perhaps they will be brought to light. The entry point to taxation for a single PAYE worker was &euro;97 per week a few years ago but after this budget it is now &euro;247 per week, an increase of over 150%. Unfortunately, some of these matters have been hidden. The proportion of income tax yield from those with earnings at and under the average industrial wage is projected to be about 6%. The equivalent figure was only 14%. Some of these matters should be in the public domain.</P>

      <P>I do not want to ask the Taoiseach questions about the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, because that matter is before the courts, but I want to focus on the Taoiseach's track record. After all, he castigated the Opposition for hounding an honourable man out of office so it is important that he go back to last week in the Dáil when we asked him about a meeting he had with the head of Royal Dutch Shell. He told us, very interestingly, that he has had &ldquo;a fair few meetings over the years that might border on the unethical, but I am not guilty of it in this case.&rdquo; The interesting question, which we did not have an opportunity to ask at the time, is what exactly does the Taoiseach regard as unethical. He told <Col N="982" />us that the code of ethics here is that once you are elected to Dáil Éireann you stay in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Beyond that, has he attended any other meetings that might be considered unethical? Did any of them involve, for example, Mr. Gilmartin? Did any of them involve the Sweepstakes? We saw a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on the Sweepstakes which went back to the 1970s and 1980s. Is it not strange that any candidate could call to the offices of the Sweepstakes in Ballsbridge and ask for his or her election deposit? I know times have changed, but the Taoiseach was a Deputy for nine years before the Sweepstakes ended and he received the annual report year after year, as did every Deputy. Did he ever suspect at the time that there was anything unethical about its operation? Can the Taoiseach look me in the eye and tell me that after he became Minister in 1987 there was no procurement project in which he was involved that was not clean and above board? It is important we know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me a question and I want to tell him not just about that meeting but others. I would always take an interest in these matters and meet people. The best Governments all over the world, with the highest ethical standards, do that.</P>
      <P>As regards the issues I referred to which bordered on the unethical, in my involvement in Northern Ireland I sometimes felt less than comfortable meeting people who had been involved at first hand in acts which make me feel uncomfortable. However, in the interests of the peace process I continued. That is what I meant that day. If the Deputy wants me to spell that out I can do so, but I would rather not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I got a limited answer so I take it that if the Taoiseach had more time he would have told me more about the 1970s and 1980s, during his time as Minister for Labour and so on. It is important we have a clear understanding of the Taoiseach's approach to corruption. We had an exchange in the Dáil in which the Taoiseach tried to put us in a league &ndash; he said there are cases involving trillions and that we are not in that league, that there is a way to deal with this and that it cannot go on forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be clear on where the Taoiseach stands on this issue. The Berlin-based Transparency International group has said that Ireland <Col N="983" />is more corrupt than 17 other countries. Of course, most other countries that are corrupt are poorer countries in the developing world. That league was compiled before the tribunals report so we do not know what the future holds in that regard.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that clear political leadership is given to the ending of corruption, not just in terms of statements but of removing rezoning windfall profits, reforming the planning Acts, giving more resources to the EPA, given the amount of illegal dumping, and allocating more resources to the Garda, given the promise of an extra 2,000 gardaí? Are these not matters that must be seen in action rather than in words?</P>

I have raised repeatedly with the Taoiseach that adequate and careful scrutiny of measures that will have a significant impact on the civil and legal rights of ordinary citizens is not accommodated.

      <P>I do not want to get into an argument about this but I do not see another way of proceeding. If there is, perhaps the Whips can discuss it. This is a genuine way of bringing the issues forward and having debate, with Ministers and committees involved. I know it involves a great deal of time for Members of the House in attending various committee meetings, for which they do not always receive as much public credit as they should, in my view. They report back to the House.</P>

      <P>There is another answer which I could give to Deputy Ó Caoláin. Quite frankly, having looked back over the reports after the Deputy raised the matter last week &ndash; perhaps Members may not wish me to say this &ndash; there are often more people at committee meetings than is the case at Second Stage debates. The reality, irrespective of whether this pleases the House, is that there is far greater involvement and debate in committees than on various stages of Bills in the House. I would like to hear about the great system to which the Deputy referred. I do not believe it is there.</P>

      <P>A division was challenged last Friday on the question that the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003 be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, pursuant to Standing Order 120(1) and paragraph 1(<i>a</i>)(i) of the committee's Orders of Reference. In accordance with an order of the Dáil of 4 December 2003, that division must be taken now.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding with the division, it has been drawn to my attention that there was a breakdown in administrative procedures in the publication of the text of the European Arrest Warrant Bill, which led to two versions being published. First, the printer omitted to include the Schedule from the text that had been supplied to him and, second, a change to the text of section 9 was made when the Bill was republished to rectify the original error.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I rule that the version as published on the first occasion and which was circulated to members is the valid document, as presented under Standing Orders, and any amendments should be addressed to that version. Accordingly if the Minister wishes to have the Schedule and the change to section 9 included, it must be done by way of amendment. I also rule that since Second Stage procedure relates to the general principles and not the detail of the Bill, which is appropriate for Committee Stage, the proceedings of last Friday are not affected by the difficulties that I have outlined.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed procedures, especially in view of the pressures that are experienced at the end of each session, and I have decided that the normal 48-hour rule for publication will be operated except in very exceptional cases for specific operational reasons.</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, is it not expedient that you should rule thus? The Minister was speaking to one Bill last Friday and the Opposition was speaking to a different Bill. We can hardly blame the printer, to whom you advert in your ruling. It was a matter for the Minister to come to the House with the Bill he intended to enact. Are you satisfied in these circumstances how an action would lie if this were tested in court since this House thought it was enacting one Bill and ended up enacting a different Bill?</P>
      <P>I am surprised that one of the greatest legal minds on the Government benches ought to have fallen into this trap. It is highly unusual. I do not recall any set of circumstances where the Minister proceeded with one kind of Bill in the one hand and a different version of the Bill in the other hand and the House was supposed to address it in those terms.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is a precedent for this. I hope, Sir, you are satisfied there is no infirmity in your ruling that we now proceed as if it were a minor and not substantial difference in the Bill, when the entire Schedule of approximately 50 pages was omitted. I do not know where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is. He is probably making a speech on the economy somewhere.</P>

      <P>Given that we are dealing with a Bill that had a truncated Second Stage and given that the Green Party opposed the guillotining of that stage, it is appropriate that we should re-open Second Stage and have the matter dealt with in the full knowledge of what has happened. <Col N="994" />Otherwise it would not be fair and it would not be correct to say we had a valid Second Stage.</P>

      <P>Sinn Féin also takes this view. The debate on Second Stage was guillotined, which we opposed. We believe Second Stage should be re-opened. When we consider what has already taken place here this afternoon in terms of scrutiny of EU motions and legislation, this is a very embarrassing incident concerning domestic legislation. There is a clear dichotomy between the documentation presented on two different occasions.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that we re-open the Second Stage debate, allow the opportunity for each Member to address the same text and those Members who were not accommodated on the first opportunity should also have the chance to participate directly.

      <P>On Friday we debated the very serious matter of the European Arrest Warrant Bill, which abolishes all extradition arrangements we have with all other countries in the European Union and introduces a warrant mechanism. This has a fundamental impact and if we do not get it right, there could be legal and constitutional challenges and we could end up in a constitutional quagmire over this.</P>
      <P>The Bill that I debated was the larger 84-page one, which has now been withdrawn. The Bill now in circulation is the 34-page one. I was not debating the Bill that has now been placed in my pigeonhole, as the version that you have said will go on to Committee Stage. It is inappropriate that those of us who debated the Bill did so on the basis of a version of the Bill that we will not now address on Committee Stage. It is a very serious matter and the only way to rectify it transparently is to take Second Stage again.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce this legislation, the first two Bills intended to implement the &euro;630 million social welfare package announced last week in budget 2004. This sum represents a &euro;100 million increase on the 2003 package of &euro;530 million and brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure in 2004 to over &euro;11.26 billion, a 7% increase in the allocation for 2003. This level of expenditure is indicative of the Government's priority to protect the living standards of social welfare recipients at a time when difficult decisions have to be made with regard to the management of the public finances. It is a clear demonstration of this Government's commitment to addressing the needs of the elderly, widowed persons, carers, the unemployed and the disadvantaged. It represents year-on-year increases under this Government in social welfare spending. For example, in 2001 the social welfare budget totalled &euro;7.8 billion and in 2004 it will be in excess of &euro;11.26 billion.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have secured an increase in the social welfare budget this year which underlines the Government's commitment to those for whom the support of the State is vital. The budget at my disposal means that for every &euro;3 to be spent by the Government in 2004 almost &euro;1, or almost one third of the total, will go to social welfare recipients. Increases in the past three years have largely been directed at improving rates of payment in line with Government commitments.</P>

      <P>Ireland has changed dramatically for the better since the Government took up office. For example, the number of people at work has increased to almost 1.8 million. The rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to 4.3%. The number of low paid persons removed from the tax net has increased &ndash; 35% of all those on the tax record will pay no tax in 2004. Social welfare spending has increased from &euro;5.74 billion in 1997 to a projected &euro;11.26 billion in 2004.</P>

      <P>This social welfare package has been assessed in line with the poverty proofing guidelines set out in the national anti-poverty strategy. I am satisfied that the level of spending at my Department's disposal in 2004 will have a meaningful impact on poverty rates by further reducing consistent poverty. The Government is anxious to continue to protect and support the weak and vulnerable in society and to safeguard the progress made in building social inclusion.</P>
      <P>This social welfare package aims to increase and maintain the value of all rates of payment in real terms. There will be a minimum increase of &euro;10 in all weekly social welfare payments to that end. The package will provide increases to those aged 66 and over and meet the commitment to increase payments to widowed persons who have attained pension age. The Government is continuing to address the commitments in Sustaining Progress and An Agreed Programme for Government to increase the State pension to &euro;200 by 2007. The real value of all qualified adult rates of payment will increase. We will ensure that they do not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate. This social welfare package aims to continue to make progress in the Government's programme of increases in the level of child benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's commitment to pensioners is reaffirmed in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill. An increase of &euro;10 in the personal rates of old age contributory and non-contributory pensions, as well as retirement and invalidity pensions, is provided for in sections 2 and 3 and in the Schedules to the Bill. This will bring the rate of the old age contributory pension to &euro;167.30 per week and the rate of the old age non-contributory pension to &euro;150 per week. These changes represent a substantial real increase on the basis of the projected annual inflation rate of 2.5% in 2004. Special provision is being made for an increase of &euro;11.50 in the personal rate of widow's or widower's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit for those aged 66 and over. This fulfils the commitment announced in the 2001 budget to increasing the level of these payments to that of the old age contributory pension. The increase of 7.4% on current rates represents a real increase for more than 62,000 widows, widowers and deserted wives on full rates. There will be proportionate increases for 10,600 persons on reduced rates. The increase of &euro;10 for those in receipt of widow's and widower's non-contributory pension will bring the maximum personal weekly rates for such pensioners to &euro;154 for those aged 66 and over and to &euro;134.80 for those aged under 66.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to increasing the level of qualified adult allowance for pensioner spouses in the coming years to the full old age non-contributory pension rate. This will benefit women in the home who do not qualify for the contributory pension in their own right. Section 2 of the Bill provides for increases in social insurance-based payments and for increases in respect of qualified adults. The qualified adult payments applicable to old age contributory and retirement pensions will increase by &euro;7.70 per week, where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over, and by &euro;6.70 per week, where he or she is aged under 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The combined increases in personal and qualified adult rates will mean that a couple in receipt of full old age contributory pension will receive a substantial increase of &euro;17.70 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Qualified adults aged 66 or over will receive a significant increase of &euro;16.10 per week in invalidity pension. This increase will <Col N="1002" />bring the rate to &euro;129.20 per week. The qualified adult rates for those over 66 in the case of invalidity pension will be brought into line with those paid to qualified adults in the cases of old age contributory and retirement pensions. An increase of &euro;7.10 per week is being provided for qualified adults on invalidity pension who are under 66.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill, which provides for increases in social assistance payments, also contains the rates increases for qualified adults on such payments. An increase of &euro;6.60 is provided for qualified adults of old age non-contributory pension recipients and for qualified adults aged over 66 whose spouses or partners are receiving the blind pension. All other qualified adult rates are being increased by &euro;6.60 per week. Proportionate increases will be applied where persons are in receipt of reduced rate qualified adult allowance payments. As a result of these increases, the qualified adult allowance rate for a person over 66 will rise to over 77% of the old age contributory pension in 2004.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the needs of other vulnerable groups in society. I refer in particular to those who are unemployed, disadvantaged or ill, as well as those who provide caring support for the elderly and the ill. Accordingly, a weekly increase of &euro;10 in the personal rates of the relevant payments is being provided. This will bring the standard weekly personal rate of carer's allowance to &euro;139.60. The standard unemployment benefit and assistance and disability benefit will increase to &euro;134.80. The Government is committed to protecting the value of social welfare payments such as one-parent family payment, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist. General social welfare payments have increased well ahead of inflation since 1997. In this budget, the Government is maintaining the value of these payments ahead of inflation by providing an increase of &euro;10, or 8% per week, in the personal weekly rate.</P>
      <P>The social welfare budget increases included in this Bill will be payable from the first pay day in January 2004. People receiving short-term payments such as unemployment payments will receive their increases in the first week in January. Some 160,000 customers who receive long-term payments by means of electronic payment through a post office or a bank will receive their increases on the first pay day in January.</P>
      <P>The payable order book is the payment mechanism for 224,000 persons, predominantly those who receive widow's and widower's pensions, one-parent family payment, invalidity pension and carer's allowance. The production of the new order books will entail a minimal delay. The new books will be issued to all customers in mid-February 2004. Such customers will receive a lump sum arrears payment of six weeks in their first payable order of the new book. The weekly increases will be included in the weekly payable orders thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" />A further 261,000 customers, mainly recipients of old age and retirement pensions and disability allowance, who also receive payments via the payable order book, will receive their new order books in April. They will receive a special payment in mid-February, however, to minimise inconvenience. This will comprise six weeks' arrears of the budget increase and seven weeks' advance payment. For example, a pensioner couple aged over 66 will receive a lump sum payment of &euro;230.10 in mid-February. The lump sum payment will cover the increases from the first pay day in January and will include an advance of the increase to the book renewal date in April. The increases will be incorporated into the normal weekly payment thereafter.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for an increase of &euro;28 in the weekly income thresholds applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement, expanding the thresholds from &euro;407 in the case of a family with one child, to &euro;584 in the case of a family with eight or more children. That will result in a weekly increase of &euro;16.80, with effect from January 2004, for most eligible families. I have also increased the minimum level of family income supplement payment from &euro;13 to &euro;20 per week to ensure that even those pushing at the edges of the increased thresholds will increase their return from employment.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide for changes in PRSI. The earnings ceilings for employees' social insurance contributions and the income ceiling for the payment of optional contributions are being increased by &euro;1,740 from &euro;40,420 to &euro;42,160 per year, with effect from January 2004. Section 7 of the Bill provides for a &euro;200 increase in the widowed parent's grant, bringing it up to &euro;2,700. That increase will be applied with effect from budget day last week.</P>
    <P>I have, on previous occasions, referred to my commitment to the prudent management of the social welfare budget. My personal objectives include taking the steps necessary to ensure value for money in the provision of income supports and maximising resources to address poverty and disadvantage. One of the mechanisms used to achieve those objectives is the ongoing review of support systems and schemes administered by my Department. The purpose of such reviews is to ascertain whether individual schemes have attained optimal effectiveness or require adjustment to afford maximum benefit to social welfare customers.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Bill contains several additional measures which provide for amendments to certain social welfare schemes and reform of the social welfare code. Section 8 of the Bill provides for the linking period between unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims to be increased from 13 to 26 weeks. The principal advantage of claim linking for the recipient is that he or she may retain some or all of the entitlements associated with the initial claim, for example, continued entitlement to rel<Col N="1004" />evant secondary benefits. That provision is effective from 19 January 2004.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for an increase, from 39 to 52, in the number of paid social insurance contributions required to satisfy the conditions for entitlement to disability benefit, unemployment benefit and health and safety benefit. That is designed to ensure that entitlement to such benefits reflects a reasonable degree of attachment to the workforce. That measure, which will apply to all new cases with effect from April 2004, will mean that people with fewer than 52 paid contributions from the time of their entry into the workforce will no longer be entitled to those insurance-based schemes. They will, however, be entitled to apply for supplementary welfare allowance or unemployment assistance, as appropriate, the maximum rates of which match disability benefit and unemployment benefit payments.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides that, with effect from 19 January 2004, an increase in respect of a qualified child will not be payable where the income of the spouse or partner of a recipient of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, injury benefit or health and safety benefit, exceeds &euro;300 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing claimants, while they remain in continuous receipt of their benefit payment, or those with spouses or partners earning less than &euro;300 weekly, will not be affected by that provision. It is estimated that the majority of claimants affected by the measure will be those whose spouse's or partner's earnings are considerably in excess of &euro;300 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That measure will facilitate a refocusing of resources on low-income families.</P>
      <P>Section 11 provides for a reduction in the maximum duration of unemployment benefit from 390 days, or 15 months, to 312 days, or one year, where the claimant has fewer than 260, or five years', PRSI contributions. That measure acknowledges a sustained connection with the social insurance fund by ensuring that a substantial and continuous contribution is reflected in the duration of entitlement to benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That measure also mirrors the qualifying conditions applicable to disability benefit. The section comes into operation for new claims with effect from 19 January 2004. The purpose of supplementary welfare allowance, or SWA, is to provide a safety net for people unable to provide for their own needs. At present, SWA is not payable to people in full-time employment. That exclusion is set out in social welfare legis<Col N="1005" />lation and has been a feature of the scheme since its inception in 1977. In addition to the other qualifying conditions for the scheme, the employment status of the head of the household is a determining factor in establishing entitlement to SWA. In future, if one of a couple is in full-time employment, both will be excluded from claiming rent or mortgage supplement. That measure gives effect to the original intention that SWA should not be paid in cases where there is full-time employment in the household.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly, section 12 of the Bill provides that, where one of a couple is in full-time employment, SWA rent or mortgage supplement will not be payable. The measure comes into effect from January 2004. It will also facilitate more appropriate decisions and responses in the assessment of accommodation requirements. Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, provide for a technical amendment to existing legislation which allows for PRSI, health contributions and national training fund levies to be charged on benefits in kind, as announced in last year's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the course of the past year, several spending items have been reviewed and areas of potential savings identified to ensure sound management of public funds. I stress once again that savings found have been recycled back into the total allocation to my Department, which will spend a record &euro;11.26 billion in 2004. I emphasise that any changes to SWA schemes will only affect new applicants. I will shortly sign the regulations giving effect to the changes and make the following points.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements were never intended to meet a person's long-term housing needs. The scheme is not a housing programme, but in practice, over the years, has become such. Rent supplement will continue to be available to people with housing needs whose safety or well-being is at risk, such as people with disabilities, the elderly or those experiencing severe social problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about violent households?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures will not affect people on local authority waiting lists, even if renting for less than six months, those who are homeless, as defined by the local authority under the Housing Acts, people who have already been tenants for six months, or those currently receiving rent supplements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will an exception be made for violent households?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1006" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy should wait a moment. Full and sympathetic consideration will be given to the needs of people in implementing the new rent arrangements with the involvement of the housing authorities.</P>
      <P>Crèche supplement was designed to provide assistance to parents who, in the absence of such a service, would not otherwise be able to avail of particular supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes. Officials in my Department, which provides that short-term payment, are in discussion with the health boards and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that appropriate long-term measures are put in place to address crèches which rely on that SWA payment. I emphasise that no crèche will close as a result of the measure.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the diet supplement is being restructured to take account of changes in the level of social welfare payments generally. The current basis for calculating the amount of supplement payable in individual cases was put in place in 1996. Since then costings have not been updated, the assessment of means has not been adjusted and, effectively, the amounts paid have not changed. Over time, the gap that the diet supplement was intended to address has narrowed. In future, diet supplements will be based on the current cost of special diets, the current income of claimants and the premise that one should not have to pay more than one third of one's income towards food costs. Existing recipients will continue to receive their current payments until such time as there is a change in circumstances which would warrant a review of entitlement.</P>

The Fianna Fáil slogan was, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and, of course, &ldquo;Everybody done&rdquo;. That is what I want to add. The 2004 budget was a missed opportunity to tackle child poverty in Ireland. Child benefit, despite the availability of resources, was increased by less than half of what was required to keep pace with the commitments made in Sustaining Progress. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government gave a commitment in the 2001 budget that they would implement a three-year programme of increases in child benefit.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance stated that at the end of this process an additional £1 billion would have been invested directly in our children's well-being and that the child benefit monthly payment would stand at £117.50 and £146, well beyond the PPF commitments. I ask the Minister to come before the Dáil at the first available opportunity to apologise to us for misleading the House in that statement. This promise was broken by the Government. It has not honoured the commitments it made last year or this year. The budget in 2002 promised &euro;25 for the first two children and &euro;30 for the third and subsequent children. However, in the 2003 budget, child benefit increases were just &euro;8 and &euro;10. Beneficiaries were owed &euro;17 and &euro;20 for that year. We expected great things this year but all we received was &euro;6 and &euro;8, which equates to &euro;1.40 per week or 20 cent per day. These increases will do nothing to alleviate child poverty in Ireland.</P>
      <P>More than 70,000 householders are living in constant poverty according to the Combat Poverty Agency. This means they are not guaranteed a hot meal every day and do not have basic necessities such as food, clothing and heating. It is hard to believe that, for the ninth year in a row, the Government has not increased the child dependant allowance &ndash; it has not been increased since 1994. The three rates of payment of child dependant allowance are &euro;16.80 per week, &euro;19.30 per week and &euro;21.60 per week. The difference between the top rate of &euro;21.60 and the lowest of &euro;16.80 is almost &euro;250 per annum. This is a great deal of money for people who receive social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Constitution, all children are to be treated equally. Why do we therefore have different rates for different children? Serious expert reports have consistently indicated that the best way in which to end child poverty is through the child dependant allowance. As it has failed to make adequate child benefit, this throws into serious doubt the Government's ability to make good on its commitments to end child poverty and reach the targets established in the national <Col N="1008" />anti-poverty strategy. It demonstrates that the Government is not committed to children or the family in spite of the Minister's allocation of &euro;1 million for celebrations on 15 May 2004 to mark the tenth anniversary of the International Year of the Family.</P>
    <P>This budget is sending out an anti-family message. The Social Welfare Bill 2003 includes a provision where, if a spouse or partner of the claimant for child dependant allowance earns more than &euro;300 per week, the claimant will no longer be entitled to the child dependant allowance. This is another cutback rather than a reform. It effectively gets rid of half of the payments of child dependant allowance to families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the back to school and clothing and footwear allowances were not increased for 2004. With the increased cost of living and daily price rises, it is disappointing that an opportunity to try to help the less well-off has been missed again by the Minister, particularly when it has become very costly to send children back to school. The Minister could do much more for families by tackling the qualifying income guidelines for this scheme. The guidelines mean that the scheme is being denied to hundreds of families who are badly in need of assistance in order to send their children back to school.</P>
    <P>The PRSI changes have also affected the benefits scheme, which I will refer to on Committee Stage. The changes mean we will pay the same rate of PRSI but will get less value for money. The duration for unemployment and disability benefits has been shortened from 15 to 12 months. The number of contributions required for qualification for disability, unemployment, health and safety benefits has been increased from 39 to 52. Entitlement to the half rate child dependant allowance in respect of unemployment and disability benefit claims will be discontinued where the claimant's spouse or partner has a gross weekly income of &euro;300.</P>
    <P>The greatest scandal of all is in regard to rent supplement, the conditions for eligibility of which will have a major effect on many people. How can the Minister expect someone in receipt of social welfare to find six months' rent? If a person has to pay &euro;650 per month in rent, how is he or she expected to find an additional &euro;3,900 six months' rent &ndash; a total of &euro;4,550 &ndash; on a social welfare payment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unreasonable, it will not work, it is not right and it must be changed. I urge the Minister not to sign the regulation into law. If she does, she will put thousands of people in a homeless situation. A programme will be broadcast on TV3 tonight, one of the main stories of which will be about homeless people in this city and others. Yesterday, we saw a family which had to live in a chicken house. It is outrageous. The reason for the change to six months is to stop people claiming rent allowance. However, the decision should <Col N="1009" />be left with the community welfare officers who should have discretion in these matters. Community welfare officers have always acted in a compassionate manner and they understand what is happening on the ground. This change withdraws support from people who need it most and those who need a home. The Government must provide housing and when it is provided, the Government can make changes to rent supplement. This measure attacked a soft target and there will be serious consequences.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the provisions in regard to the carer's allowance, particularly because the means test was not abolished for the 149,000 people who get no recognition for their work looking after elderly people. The increase in the carer's allowance is insufficient reward for people who have devoted their lives to caring for someone in the home. The increased weekly income disregard of &euro;40 for single people and &euro;80 for couples will only bring a small number of people into the carer's allowance scheme. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recently furnished a report to the Minister in regard to the position of full-time carers and I hope she will deal with many of the recommendations made in the report in the near future.</P>
      <P>Last week in her budget debate speech, the Minister suggested the Opposition was in the baby infant class because its figures were wrong but at least we went to baby infants. The people in the Minister's Department must not have gone to school at all. For example, in 2000 the Department calculated that the pre-1953 pension scheme would cost &euro;8.9 million for the year but that year the full cost of the scheme was &euro;26.1 million and in 2002 it came to a staggering &euro;113 million &ndash; 13 times the original cost. Those people did not go to baby infants &ndash; they did not go to school at all. They got it wrong and the Minister got it wrong too, as did the smart alec the Minister has in the press office who is costing us &euro;200,000 a year. As if that was not bad enough, we had to raise a Supplementary Estimate for the Minister last week when she missed out on 28,000 children she did not know were in the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>If we went to baby infants, I would like to know what class the Minister's colleagues went to. They are like the boys I met coming home from school who left their houses in the morning but did not go to school. The staff in the Minister's Department did not go to their arithmetic class because they cannot add. We have an annual birth rate of 62,000 and last year there were 28,000 children for whom the Minister could not provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the issue of the family income supplement every year. It should be paid through the tax credit system because people who are working do not want to receive a social welfare payment. This money should be paid directly to them <Col N="1010" />through their tax credits. They should not have to apply to the Department for it. Will the Minister do something about this on Committee Stage? The Minister gave increases in FIS last year but the guidelines are too low and not enough people who need to be in receipt of the FIS are in receipt of it. Will the Minister examine this issue again?</P>
    <P>Of the 16 cutbacks, the meanest of all is the cutback in the diet allowance. This is a very small payment to people and I ask the Minister not to sign the regulation into law. The &euro;10 benefit is not enough because of inflation, although it is a step in the right direction. Bread, milk, sugar and electricity increase in price every week. Since the budget, the cost of postage stamps has risen and the television licence fee will also increase. Other companies, such as the ESB, have also made applications to the Government for price increases. The local authorities will also eat into these people's social welfare payments through rent. The &euro;10 benefit is gone which is wrong.</P>
    <P>The back to work scheme threshold was 15 months, then the Minister changed it to five years and she has now brought it back to three years. The Minister should restore this back to 15 months. She knows that a mistake was made and she has gone half way towards rectifying it on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I do not know who advises the Minister. However, those responsible for doing so are giving her bad advice. Her advisers are not protecting her interests because she has been let down by her colleagues in Government. She has attacked the weak, the poor and those who need support and help in our society. Organisations such as CORI and the St. Vincent de Paul have informed the Minister, her Department, the Government and me that people on social welfare are falling behind. That should not be the case. It is wrong that people on social welfare are not being protected by the Government. It is the Minister's responsibility to protect these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, found &euro;15 million for Punchestown and today's announcement that Mr. Magnier and his associates have spent millions buying shares in Manchester United makes my blood boil. These people have horses which are making them millions of euro in stud fees and the State is not charging them a cent in tax. Is that equality? Is it fair?</P>

      <P>The Minister was obliged to engage in much trimming and endure a great deal of bad press and now the Government has given more money to the horseracing industry. That is remarkable and it shows where the Government's focus lies.</P>
      <P>The Government is certainly not focused on the poor or the less well-off. The latter is evidenced by one figure. For each of the past three years the Government, in the form of tax changes, has given &euro;7,000 back to a single person earning &euro;100,000. The Government believes, therefore, that it should give this extra amount to single people with no responsibilities and no families to look after who earn approximately &euro;2,000 per week. What has it done for social welfare recipients in the same period? People on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance do not even receive &euro;7,000 for a full year and are obliged to survive on less.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and will promise to put things right.</P>
      <P>I will now refer to the various cutbacks and to social insurance payments. The social insurance fund is in surplus. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, robbed taxpayers of &euro;600 million when he raided that fund a couple of years ago. That fund currently has a surplus of &euro;1.1 billion. What is the Minister for Social and Family Affairs doing? She cut back on unemployment benefit paid from insurance based schemes to which people contributed.</P>
      <P>The Minister must explain why disability benefit is cut. I do not think she has an explanation for that decision, which is extremely mean. One must now have 52 contributions in the relevant tax year to be eligible for unemployment and disability benefits. Next April the relevant tax year will be 2002. The Minister is saying that a person who missed a contribution in 2002 will not be eligible for unemployment or disability benefit in 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>People in need of such payments do not become ill suddenly, they usually suffer illnesses that occur over time. It is likely that a person who is currently seriously ill was absent from work for a week or two in 2002. The Minister is saying such people will not now be entitled to unemployment benefit even though he or she paid into an insurance based scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person pays car insurance based on terms and conditions. I am sure Deputy Penrose could give a legal view on this. People paid contributions in 2002 in respect of entitlements in 2004. However, when that time arrives, the rules will have been changed. Instead of needing 39 stamps one will be required to have paid 52 stamps. Is <Col N="1015" />that fair? I do not think it is and the Minister should amend that provision.</P>
    <P>Where a person's spouse or partner earns more than &euro;300 only half benefit will be paid for their children. The same argument applies in this regard. This payment is made from the social insurance fund, a scheme into which people paid and from which they are entitled to receive benefits. The Minister is not entitled to change the rules, but they will be changed. We may make the rules but one has a moral right to ensure people receive their entitlements. To change the scheme in that way is mean and the Minister should do something about it.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit for a person who has less than five years' contributions is to be cut back from 15 months to 12 months. I know that the Minister has come across people in her constituency who have had to scrape together the 260 stamps required for entitlement to disability benefit. People often have major difficulties getting that amount of stamps together. The Minister is pulling the rug from under those who have recently returned to work. She is reducing unemployment benefit from 15 months to 12 months, and that is unjustifiable. I do not think she is in a position to do that given that people paid into these schemes on the basis of certain benefits being available to them. If they are to receive unemployment benefit they must have made 52 contributions in the qualifying year. A person with less than 260 stamps will have the rug pulled from under him or her. That is mean and unfair.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues arise in terms of social welfare. Why do estimates in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners illustrate that only half of those entitled to FIS actually take it up? My colleague, Deputy Ring, referred to this matter. What is the Minister doing about that? Why not change the system so that the Revenue Commissioners pay FIS through the tax system to those entitled to it? Surely that makes more sense. I am sure the Minister is worried that everybody would then be in receipt of payment at great cost to her Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows are the forgotten sector of our society. They get a raw deal and have to survive in very difficult circumstances. I have met, as have many other Deputies, widows who are unable to survive on low incomes. What is the Minister doing in <Col N="1016" />this area? She is changing the rules so that new claimants will receive only half payment in respect of unemployment or disability benefit if already in receipt of the widow's or widower's pension. She is taking away the few miserly euro that might have given them a little dignity, something which many widows and widowers want to hold on to. They want to keep their self-esteem and do not want to have to beg from anybody. The Minister is taking away the little amount of money that might have prevented them from begging and I ask her to consider that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1: To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann noting that while the Bill provides for increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget, it also provides for the implementation of many of the social welfare cutbacks announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on 13 November which, if implemented, would create severe hardship for people on the lowest incomes and which have been strongly condemned by a range of organisations representing single parents, the homeless and the poor, and therefore declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I move this motion in the context of something Deputy Ring quoted from CORI, &ldquo;the overall conclusion as we review this Government's seven budgets is that they have missed a unique opportunity to build a fairer and more inclusive society where everyone has sufficient and where all are respected&rdquo;. While Ireland's poorest people have again been told to wait, they have waited too long. Ireland already has the widest rich-poor gap of any EU country. If the Minister for Finance's policies are followed in the years ahead, Ireland will be an even more deeply divided two-tier society &ndash; Deputy Ring referred to it as three-tier. This is unjust, unfair, unacceptable and unsustainable. These are not my words, nor am I making a political point, it is a point raised by an organisation.</P>
      <P>The general increases fall short of the amount needed to meet the commitments to income adequacy as set out in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. If the Government is as committed as it says to the plan for combating poverty and removing secondary benefit poverty and unemployment traps, these increases are insufficient to achieve these desirable objectives. The increases in personal rates of payment are below the level that would have been needed to keep in line with the commitment to have a personal rate of payment to the lowest social welfare recipient of &euro;150 in 2002 terms by 2007. The figure would need to have been approximately &euro;12 to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with the increase in personal rates, the plan also includes a commitment to have rates of child benefit and child dependant allowance at 33% to 35% of the lowest rate of <Col N="1017" />social welfare payment by 2007. An increase of &euro;6 and &euro;8 per week in child benefit, and a freezing of child dependant allowance, belittles the Minister's commitment and she needs to put her money where her mouth is. I was worth half a crown as the eldest of a family of ten and the second child was worth five shillings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is worth more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worth much more now. Children's allowance has certainly not met the target that was set. This was a solemn promise given by the Minister in this House. The thrust of pre-budget submissions made to the Minister focused on tackling and alleviating child poverty. While this was a priority, the budget singly failed to tackle it and this did not surprise me. The Taoiseach was dismissive of the Government's figures of the extent of child poverty. He dismissed claims made by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that 300,000 children live in relative poverty. That shows that the Taoiseach and his colleagues are out of touch.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was apparently unaware of Government research on the continuing extent of poverty in the country. There are 300,000 children living in relative poverty and this figure was not simply conjured up by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, it is the official result of research undertaken by the Government's agency with responsibility for poverty, namely, the Combat Poverty Agency. This agency published its pre-budget submission in October and, unless I read it incorrectly, it said that 300,000 children were living in relative poverty. This is defined as children living in a house where the income is less than 60% of the average industrial wage. A further 70,000 children experience consistent poverty, defined as not having basics such as a warm coat or a hot meal each day. This is not political propaganda, these are facts stated by organisations. I take umbrage at the comment about using political playthings. As a child growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, I knew how important it was to have basic items, which were not always available. I knew how important it was to get an additional two or three pints of milk when another child was born.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has described the budget as being one of hope. While it is full of hope for the wealthy, it offers little hope for those depending on social welfare payments. If there is any threat of a downturn in economic activity, it is astonishing that social welfare should be the first area where cutbacks are sought. Of course, it is not astonishing as it come from the Minister for Finance, the author of the dirty dozen, and we will never forget him for it. It indicates that the Government is, in the Tánaiste's infamous phrase, closer to Boston than Berlin. The Government gives the impression that social welfare payments are a form of charity rather than an entitlement to be given to a rigorously monitored group of deserving poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" />The Minister has repeatedly told us that &euro;11.26 billion is being spent on social welfare. She says it as if this impressive sounding figure should be enough to end all debate on this matter. The Minister is a capable woman and she knows that our spending <i>per capita</i> is one of the lowest in Europe and most benefits are not sufficient to keep people out of poverty. The facts are contained in those independent reports.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has contemptuously referred to what he terms &ldquo;the poverty industry&rdquo;. I think the Labour Party was once referred to as a wing of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul &ndash; at least Deputy Stagg was. Whenever anyone raises the issue of the large number of people who, through no fault of their own, find themselves living on inadequate incomes, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste must feel proud that they have introduced in Ireland that vibrant American phenomenon of the working poor. The failure to index tax bands and increases in the prices of many goods and services, including increases in the cost of public services outlined by Deputy Ring, means many employed people, including those in white collar jobs, find themselves turning to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can look at the Society of St. Vincent de Paul figures for October and correct me if I am telling an untruth. The number of people seeking help doubled in 12 months. The astonishing increase in spending by society at a time of rapid economic growth is a shocking indictment of the Government's failure to exclude those on low incomes from the tax net. The Government is allowing exorbitant increases in charges for many vital goods and services.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the social welfare changes in the budget. I welcome the increases in benefits and know they will be welcomed in some places. The increases will, however, barely compensate many recipients for the increase in the cost of living. Is the Minister aware that people on low incomes suffer a higher rate of inflation than those on high incomes? People on low incomes lack adequate transport. I accept that the Minister is trying to deal with this through the rural transport initiative scheme. It is a good scheme and I applaud the Minister for it. As those on low incomes lack adequate transport and access to low cost credit, they pay more for many items than do those on higher incomes. While those who have little need to budget often tell us that the poor must spend their money unwisely, their options are limited in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, it is deplorable that the Minister has decided to end funding for the money advice bureau. This service has rescued many people from the clutches of moneylenders, who do thriving business in the poorest areas of the country. While the money spent on this scheme is small, it does tremendous good. It would stand up to the most intense scrutiny on any cost-bene<Col N="1019" />fit analysis. I was astonished to hear some people describing it as a subsidy to banks and other lending institutions. Many of the rescue deals were organised through credit unions, which are non-profit making.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attempted to defend changes to the rent supplement scheme as measures that will help people find more permanent accommodation. The Minister has said that her Department is not a housing authority. I understand this as I served on a local authority for many years. All applicants for rent supplements must now be assessed in terms of their need for local authority housing. The Minister said anybody on a local authority housing list will not be refused. Single people comprise one of the main groups on welfare supplement. One could nearly win the Lotto more quickly than a single person can get on to a local authority housing list.</P>
    <P>I will tackle the Government on its failure to have joined-up or integrated government. This is a British Labour Party concept, although I do not support everything that party does. The Minister made the changes and perhaps she could rationalise them in the House after an all-party review involving all concerned, including the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, local authorities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of crèches and schools. They should all make a fair assessment of the matter and ensure that nobody falls between stools. The Minister was pre-emptive in dealing with some of the cuts.</P>
    <P>The extra people in need of local authority housing will be added to the 60,000 on the waiting list, which the Government has done little to reduce. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government cravenly capitulated to the building industry by abandoning his proposals for a 20% social housing element in all private schemes. Last week, the Committee on Social and Family Affairs was told by the One Parent Exchange Network that more than 1,000 lone parent families could be made homeless by proposed changes to the rent allowance system. The Minister claimed today that the rent supplement was introduced as an emergency measure for a small number of people, namely, single people. However because of the high cost of houses it has become a last resort for a significant number of people.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister said nobody would become homeless as a result of the proposals. However, the thrust of the submissions made to the committee was that there is significant fear that people will become homeless. Dublin has one of the highest rates of homelessness in Europe. There are more people homeless in Dublin than in Birmingham, Manchester and Bradford combined.</P>
    <P>I have always said I favour a regime of higher taxation, especially in the capital taxation area. I differ fundamentally from the Minister, Deputy <Col N="1020" />McCreevy, in this regard. He has a right to his view but I have a different philosophy and do not mind saying so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tax the greedy, not the needy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. Inequality in the education sector begins at pre-school level. The Minister struck another blow for inequality by cutting the crèche allowance for some of the most vulnerable children. Ireland has the poorest provision for pre-school education in the EU. While well-off parents can pay for such education, those on low incomes, whose children need it most, are to be deprived of the limited crèche facilities available to them. There is a wealth of evidence that good pre-school education for children from low-income families is the best way to ensure such children remain in the education system up to third level. In France, every child is guaranteed a place in pre-school and payment is according to means. In Ireland, we guarantee the rich that they will pay low tax and we cannot even guarantee our children primary school places.</P>
      <P>A few days before the Minister announced the restriction on the supplement, we learned that money was spent on food and drink, including champagne. I am not one to make such arguments but the response of the Government was akin to that of the famous Marie Antoinette who said: &ldquo;Let them eat cake&rdquo;. It seems as if the Government, in seeking ways to save money, deliberately introduced cuts in the schemes that benefit the weakest and most needy in society while leaving intact all the tax avoidance loopholes that benefit the wealthiest, including tax exiles who fly here periodically to bend the ear of the Minister for Finance regarding some new scheme for minimising the tax they pay in the country where they make their money.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the crunch, even if the Minister for Finance boldly and solemnly believed he had to find another &euro;58 million, why did he not provide the Minister for Social and Family Affairs with some of the extra moneys that became available? We on this side of the House are of the view that she did not want us to see this. That is a concession.</P>

      <P>He never forgave us for fighting tooth and nail over the dirty dozen social welfare cuts. We will fight him over the savage 16 in the same way. If he wanted to save the &euro;58 million, why did he not give the Minister, a decent person, one tenth of the extra money received in capital gains tax, which amounted to &euro;500 million odd? <Col N="1021" />A sum of &euro;58 million or &euro;56 million of this revenue would have spared Deputy Coughlan's blushes&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and made sure she would not have had to fight or give out to those of us who made relevant points on this issue. Such a provision would have obviated the need for the panoply of cuts that affect the poor. Those who are most in need were hit. There is no political justification for singling out the poorest sections of society and asking them to carry the burden. Many other sections of society are well cosseted by the general range of tax reliefs and allowances provided by the Government. These sections could certainly have borne it if the extra &euro;58 million required was extracted from them.</P>
      <P>The cuts are mean-spirited and petty and are part of the philosophy that drives the economic policy of the Government. This philosophy is echoed in a Tory viewpoint that existed in Britain in the 1980s, namely, the belief that the poor would not be poor if only they tried a little harder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. I remember it well. The thinking of the Progressive Democrats can be seen to be at work in this regard. In 1997, it targeted single mothers and promised to introduce measures to encourage single mothers to remain with their families rather than to establish one-parent households. This provoked an outburst of fury from everybody, including, I would say, the current Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I imagine she was furious about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>The McCreevy-Harney axis is blatantly right of centre and proudly espouses itself as such. It has dressed up, dusted down and reformulated the proposal. It is included as one of the savage 16. There is no social or economic justification for the cuts, and this is the problem. I wrote a note this evening which asks whether it is a case of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, the author of the dirty dozen cuts, wanting to act as if he were still Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only parents who subsist on social welfare income receive the crèche supplement. They have to be verified by health professionals as having a range of special needs. Children are on waiting lists for speech therapy and other services. Such children may be prone to leaving school early and their parents are being paid, even after the budget, a mere &euro;16.80 per week. This sum is supposed to be sufficient to maintain a child and it has not changed in many years. We are often told about what the rainbow Government did in 1997, but nobody ever mentions that this provision has been in place since then. This matter will be <Col N="1022" />hurled back at the Minister until she does something about it.</P>
    <P>Am I correct in suggesting that the cost of crèche payments amounts to &euro;1.5 million? Perhaps it is that I cannot add and have done the Government a disservice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be seen clearly that the return on that investment is immense. I urge the Minister to think again. It is not correct to suggest that we are dealing exclusively with a Dublin phenomenon. It is also evident down the country. In fairness to the Minister, I thank her for her assistance with a resource centre in my area. I am from an area which had to qualify for&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>Half the crèche supplement payments pertain to Dublin, but this is not unreasonable given its population. What measures will be in place to ensure that no crèche closes? A significant investment is being made in the future which is to be focused on children. It might be only &euro;50 or &euro;60 per month but it helps to ensure social inclusion rather than exclusion.</P>
      <P>The review of the one parent family payment issued by the Department in 2000 includes, in paragraph 28, an argument that employment is the best route out of poverty for lone parents. The report also noted that three quarters of lone parents have progressed no further in school than the junior or intermediate certificate, while almost half have left school before even reaching the junior certificate level. Realistically, if these mothers are to make a better life for themselves and their children through employment, they need to be encouraged in the first instance to improve their skills and education levels to get out of the poverty trap and earn enough to support themselves and their children. In the long run, this saves the State significant amounts of money as more lone parents become self-supporting and their children grow up and get out of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why the Minister's proposal to abolish the crèche grant for those on the vocational training opportunities scheme and other training schemes is short-sighted, as is the abolition of the transition payment that eases mothers over the &euro;15,200 earnings barrier and restricting access to the third level back to education allowance. Deputy Finian McGrath will know that programmes like TAP, the Trinity Access Programme and BIHE, Ballymun Into Higher Education, offered a second chance to those who lost out on education first time around to lift them<Col N="1023" />selves out of poverty. These are essential programmes from which benefits permeate right down. We obtain a tremendous return on the small amount of money invested. Was this subject to poverty proofing or was it hurled out to meet the Minister for Finance's diktat?</P>
    <P>The effect of the restrictions will be to leave more children and their parents stuck in a poverty trap for the sake of short-term savings. Taken together with the reduction in community employment, which impacts on the provision of community crèches and on work opportunities for lone parents, the effect is to limit the opportunities and incentives for lone parents to escape from poverty.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to rent allowance and said she did not believe the Department of Social and Family Affairs should be in the business of subsidising housing as it is not a housing authority. That flies in the face of reality. For every two households that rent from local authorities, one depends on the supplementary welfare rent allowance scheme. Like it or not, rent allowance has become a mainstream housing support for many thousands of low income households. Soaring waiting lists for council housing have left them with no alternative. Between 1999 and 2002, the number of families on local authority waiting lists, according to the official estimate of housing needs, grew from 39,000 to 48,000. Almost all that increase was accounted for by the increasing numbers unable to afford existing accommodation, that is, predominantly low income tenants in the private rented sector. If the shortage in provision of local authority houses causes waiting lists to surge, much of that has had to be accommodated in the private rented sector under the SWA rent allowance provision the Minister plans to reform rather than cut.</P>
    <P>We all know that families who accommodate a daughter and her new family in the parental home, often at the expense of gross overcrowding, can experience tensions. When a second son or daughter starts a family, there is no alternative but for one family to move into private rented accommodation because most homes of a modest size cannot accommodate three families. Will these people be denied a rent allowance? Will those moving from the parental home to private rented housing be eligible for rent supplement if they have not rented for six months? How is a young single parent on an income of &euro;144 &ndash; or &euro;154 after the budget increase &ndash; be expected to pay the costs of rent, heating and ESB if no subsidies are available?</P>
    <P>Single people make up another group which will be affected by this mean-spirited move. Traditionally local authorities have never catered for them until they became senior citizens. I am especially concerned about vulnerable single men, who may have come out of homes. The regulations will have to be amended to ensure these people are not at risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" />If the Minister wants to reform rent allowance and encourage opportunity, why did she not examine the &euro;317 ceiling on earnings for receipt of rent allowance? That has remained unchanged since it was set at £250 in 1996. I am beginning to find items that have not changed in the past seven years. That figure was originally set at the then level of average earnings but it is now just more than half of average earnings. For example, a lone parent with two children in private rented housing on a CE scheme would break the income limit and forfeit the rent allowance. This traps approximately 11,000 lone parents on rent allowance in poverty by denying them the chance to increase their incomes through part-time work without forfeiting their rent allowance. A dry accountant's approach might see this as a saving, but a more dynamic approach would encourage people to improve their circumstances by taking up work.</P>
    <P>On sections 9. 10 and 11, there is no justification for the increase from 39 to 52 in the number of paid social insurance contributions required for entitlement to unemployment benefit, disability benefit and health and safety benefit. Neither is there justification for removing child dependant payments from people whose partners earn more than &euro;300 per week. Removing three months of unemployment benefit from people who have paid PRSI for fewer than five years is especially harsh. These benefits are paid for by employees and employers. The Government does not contribute a red cent to the social insurance fund but it raided the fund, as Deputy McGrath said, in 2002 to pay for its re-election. In spite of this raid, there is a surplus in the fund. The Government has no moral right to change the rules and restrict the owners of the fund from availing of their entitlements and receiving their fair share from it. This is effectively another smash and grab raid on a fund which does not belong to the Government. There might be some justification for these cuts if the rates of PRSI were reduced for low income workers, but there is no change there either. The traps which exist at the &euro;287 per week income level will continue and will be felt more extensively when the minimum wage is increased in February.</P>
    <P>If two parents are working, they each pay their PRSI, yet if one becomes unemployed, he or she does not receive a payment for children because suddenly they are dependent on the other parent. Parents in this situation can legitimately ask why they pay PRSI on each income. Why is there an individual contribution system and a couple-based benefit system? Have the Minister and the Department made progress in deciding how the system should develop in future?</P>
    <P>Why do we lurch from year to year making cuts here and there, almost no structural improvements and having no view of where the system should be in the future? I invite the Minister to bring forward a blueprint for the social welfare system over the next ten to 15 years which will show how she intends to deal with the anomalies, <Col N="1025" />make this an inclusive system and ensure that, in ten years' time, we are not still pointing out further traps and exclusions while giving our constituents a history lesson to explain why they do not qualify for payments.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the supplementary welfare cut, which is the unkindest cut of all, although the Minister referred to it. It does not spell out how many people will find themselves homeless because of this measure. No matter how often the Minister denies it, that will be the inevitable result of the decisions which have been made. There has been much talk in recent days of the diversionary tactic of decentralisation, but the rent supplement arrangements have always been decentralised in their implementation, although the major decisions are made nationally. Moving the Minister's Department to Drogheda will not change the central decision-making process and, even worse, it will not change the fact that the numbers of homeless people will increase and that new lone parents will be unable to establish separate homes for themselves and their children. It will not change the sadly disconnected nature of these Government decisions on which I wish to focus.</P>
    <P>We produced a good report on carers and, apart from including the income disregards, not a whit was done about it. We said that abolishing the means test was a long-term goal, as was the move to home-based subvention. However, we recommended those with social welfare payments, such as widows, should receive 50% of the carer's allowance. Why was that not introduced? The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, may produce a package.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Gormley, Boyle, Twomey and Connolly.</P>
      <P>I introduce the Bill in the hope that we can have an open debate during which Government and Opposition Members can feel free to express their opinions on this important matter of public interest, namely, children's advertising. My intent is to drum up political support for new measures restricting advertising to children and I do not intend to score political points against the Government parties or the Minister. I hope, therefore, we can have an open and free debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out in a press release earlier that I might be pre-empting the review being carried out by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and making up policy on the <Col N="1026" />hoof. I assure him that nothing could be further from the truth. In all discussions and correspondence my party has had on this issue, we have encouraged people to contact the BCI, participate in its consultation process, visit its website, <i>www.bci.ie</i> and make submissions on the issue if they feel strongly about it. The Green Party will make a detailed submission prior to the closing date, 21 December 2003.</P>
    <P>While the BCI is the correct body to carry out the review and engage in the consultation process, that does not mean we, as legislators, must be silent on the issue. When political decisions must be made, we are required to become involved. I take the Minister's point, which he has made on many occasions, that he does not want to get involved in day-to-day decision-making within his Department and he wants to concentrate on more strategic issues. That is correct because too many Ministers have been willing to get involved in detailed day-to-day activity and decisions. However, the restrictions on advertising sought in the legislation will not be easily arrived at by the commission. Ultimately, when difficult political decisions must be made it behoves us, as politicians, to say we believe in this.</P>
    <P>I refer, in a spirit of goodwill, to three examples where difficult political decisions had to be taken by Governments to support what civil servants and other experts were saying. The three decisions were championed initially by the Green Party, and credit should be given where it is due. The first was the ban on bituminous coal, which was taken by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in a former guise. The second decision related to the ban on plastic bags, which was a significantly populist measure, but it was difficult to introduce politically. The best example, however, is the ban on smoking in the workplace. It would not have been possible to introduce such a ban had it not been supported by the Minister and the House. No matter which commission or civil servant had carried out an investigation into the matter, it would have been almost impossible to achieve acceptance of that decision by society if agreement had not been reached at political level.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses difficult decisions. While the BCI can weigh them up and assess the arguments, it will take political leadership to outline to the commission the direction in which we wish to go to change our society and to point out that it is fundamentally important that vested interests are taken on in this area and changes introduced. This issue involves significant money and powerful companies which will no doubt say there is no need to restrict advertising, including toy advertising, and that children's advertising does not affect their diets. However, there is such a need.</P>
    <P>People may say the approach set out in the legislation is further evidence of the nanny State, where the State is involved too closely in the market, the advertising world and the everyday activities of children and parents. However, I reflect on this issue as a father rather than a nanny. Nothing <Col N="1027" />has convinced me more of the need for the provisions specified in the legislation than my own experience with my children. I am typical of many parents. I recognise this issue involves parental responsibility and I do not want my child propped in front of a television all day. However, occasionally, as a parent, one must do that to get the house clean or get work done. When my child is watching television I do not want a company selling to him the worst and most unhealthy products because the following day when I am in a shop my four year old son is screaming at me, &ldquo;Daddy, I have to have that product.&rdquo; That is my experience day in, day out of the effect of advertising on my child and that has convinced me that the amendments set out in the legislation must be made.</P>
    <P>The primary intent of the legislation is to amend the Broadcasting Act 2001 by providing further specific detail, but not to amend it dramatically. However, if difficult and radical decisions to restrict advertising are to be made, it is correct for legislators to support the BCI by outlining the possibilities and providing more detail in the legislation about what could be included in the advertising code. We do not seek to finalise a code or to do the BCI's job. However, we are setting out options that will be difficult to get through politically. We favour a ban on such advertising but the Bill does not provide for it. However, it provides for the possibility of making a difficult political decision.</P>
    <P>I outlined my experience as a father of young children and it would be interesting to hear about the experience and view of other Members. Are all Members happy about the advertising directed at children in Ireland? The debate is an opportunity for Members to outline what they believe should occur. Are they happy with the food advertising directed at children? Are they happy that many young families in difficult economic circumstances are under massive pressure at Christmas to purchase the right toys, which are often merchandised extensions of the television programmes viewed by their children? Are they happy that intensive targeting and marketing of young children, who do not know the difference between advertising and programming, is allowed? I hope this question will be addressed by other Members. Do they believe such advertising is correct? Do they believe the BCI should introduce a strict or lenient advertising code? I hope the debate will concentrate on what Members think of the current position and what changes they would encourage.</P>
    <P>I refer to the content of the legislation. Section 1 amends section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2001, which relates to the advertising code and rules in respect of programme material. This is the most important section as it provides that advertising aimed at children can be regulated in terms of products that have a high sugar, salt or fat content. Deputy Gormley will address the health considerations behind this provision. We <Col N="1028" />should also be willing to examine the possibility of restricting children's toy advertising. The detail should be left to the BCI but it is valid for us to raise the issue and outline within the parameters of the legislation that we are concerned about this issue and want the commission to address it. The section also provides for the possibility of restricting advertising to children below a certain age. Other countries, such as Sweden and Canada, have done so. This will involve a difficult decision. It is important for politicians to demonstrate that is a valid position to take. The legislation is a vehicle for proper debate on that issue.</P>
    <P>In the next section, the main change is to require the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to take into account the physical health of children. Several of our amendments relate the health issue to that of advertising and propose that the Minister for Health and Children have a part in the decision-making process. That is the type of joined-up thinking required to tackle some of the issues affecting the health of our young children nowadays. In subsection (<i>d</i>) of our amendment to section 19, we propose that the Department of Health and Children be brought in to discuss issues. I should add that, in subsection (<i>b</i>), we call for support for media literacy tools to help children understand and combat the advertising which is directed at them.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the original Act deals mainly with the RTE authority. In this regard, we have taken the opportunity, where appropriate, to give the authority a role in looking at its own advertising, as well as its programming, in the context of the existing public service obligations. The key amendment in respect of subsection (<i>a</i>)(i) is the inclusion of the term &ldquo;advertising schedules&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;programming schedules&rdquo;, to broaden the scope of the authority's activities. Later in the Bill we provide for the physical health of children to be taken into account in the authority's public remit. In subsection (<i>c</i>), we propose that the RTE authority must take into account the code as set out in section 19(1) so that the authority will work with the Broadcasting Commission in implementing the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept the Bill in the spirit in which it is intended. It provides an opportunity for the House to debate this very important issue. It represents recognition that it is valid for legislators to set out further provisions in greater detail as to what is possible under the code. I hope the Minister will support the Bill and implement some of the measures we are proposing.</P>

      <P>This Bill is timely, in the approach to Christmas, when there is a substantial increase in the advertising of toys. I thank the <Col N="1029" />other Opposition parties for their support for the Bill. I appeal to the Government to put aside political pettiness and view this Bill on its merits. It is important legislation and it makes sense, and it is on that basis I ask the Minister to support it.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a measure which parents will particularly welcome. Many of us who are parents of young children are concerned by the cynical exploitation of children through television advertising. The fundamental principle of children's advertising is pester power, in terms of putting parents under enormous pressure from their children. As young consumers, children are being targeted at a very young age. The approach is on the basis that they want a particular product &ndash; and they want it now. Parents are subjected to enormous pressure, especially those from disadvantaged areas. In the run-up to Christmas, that pressure is often so intense that parents will do without other requirements and go into hock to get their children the very latest gadget or toy.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Eamon Ryan has said, it is often the case, as shown by research from Scandinavian countries, that children cannot distinguish between advertising and television programmes as such. There is cynical and exploitative advertising. In my capacity as party spokesperson on health issues, I wish to comment specifically on the issue of junk food. This is not a new issue for my party &ndash; we have been speaking about it for some time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan recently carried out a survey on the types of advertising which take place during children's programmes. Much of it relates to junk food and cereals with a very high sugar content, which amount to nothing more than confectionery, in the view of some people. Another survey published today showed that Irish people are getting fatter, in that 12.9% are now categorised as obese. That is very worrying because of the consequences later in life. Many surveys show that if obesity can be tackled in childhood, that is a very important step. If one leaves it until adulthood, it cannot be done. The consequences include the development of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other ailments which impose additional demands on the Exchequer as well as trying to deal with an already overburdened health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to say we are experiencing a global epidemic of obesity. According to Dr. Edna Roche of the department of diabetes growth and endocrinology at Trinity College, in a paper delivered last year, obesity now represents the single biggest public health issue on a worldwide scale. I suggest that such an expert must be taken at her word. It is of particular concern that obesity is now occurring early in childhood and adolescence. It is because of our concern in that regard that we have introduced this Bill. It makes sense to put a stop to advertising of the type of junk food which will give rise to health problems, with consequent financial cost. Figures from the United States show that the estimated cost of obesity in that country in the year 2000 was $117 billion. Much of that cost arises from treating the <Col N="1030" />complications of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis and heart disease.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consult the Department of Health and Children with a view to dealing with the issue, rather than kicking it to touch. He can deal with it by supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, media advertising is a powerful tool. At its best, it can inform and entertain, at its worst, it can mislead, distort and even pervert. At the heart of this Bill is an attempt by the Green Party to challenge the distortions, misleading attitudes and perversions of much of the advertising placed in front of children on a daily basis. My colleague, Deputy Gormley, has outlined the health aspects. It is particularly poignant that this Bill is being discussed in the run-up to the time of year during which consumer expenditure is highest. Very often, consumers are young children under the age of ten or 12 years and, in many cases, as young as six or eight years.</P>
      <P>The concept of young people as consumers is only about 50 years old. It began in the United States with the invention of the teenager and rock and roll. As we become more affluent in western societies, buying power is, increasingly, in the hands of eight to 12 year olds. Marketing messages are being specifically targeted at people who have yet to come to terms with many aspects of life. Advertising can by cynical, not only in terms of product placement. Very often, television programmes are little more than elongated advertisements for toys. Perusal of programmes on any television station from mid-morning to 6 p.m. will show cartoon-type programmes which are nothing more than advertisements for widely stocked products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are putting forward this Bill on behalf of many Irish parents who have been affected by the reality of pester power, particularly through television, but also through radio. It offers a challenge to the Government to accept what we are saying. This Bill would constitute good legislation if it made its way successfully through the various Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas. For many young children who are led by this type of advertisement, the products involved are very often to their detriment, not to their benefit. As has been said in another context, we do not wish to see the Government pursuing its intent of following the Boston model rather than the Berlin one. Perhaps we should speak of the Stockholm, rather than the Sacramento model of approach to advertising in terms of its dangers for young children. In the United States for instance, advertising is present in schools through television programmes broadcast into schools and product placement. Without the type of controls the Green Party suggests, we are not too far from that scenario, especially considering the ethos of some in Government. We put the challenge to the Minister that this legislation will find general acceptance with many on this side of the House supportive of it. The <Col N="1031" />Government will add to how the House is perceived if it is prepared to accept this type of Private Members' motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation from the Green Party and its author, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in particular.</P>
      <P>The issue of advertisers directly targeting children is one that has become more serious in recent years, as the growing scale and sophistication of that form of advertising makes clear. These days many television programmes for children are just advertising for action figures, collectable cards and computer games. Earlier this year at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis, a motion was passed calling for a ban on all advertising directed at children under the age of 12 years, similar to that in Sweden. It is one matter to call for this to be done and quite another to implement it.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is conducting a consultation process on the matter and has produced a good deal of informative material on the subject. A breakdown of the amount of time spent watching television indicates an average of more than two hours a day. Children aged from four to six years average three hours of television, only slightly more than children aged 11 years to 14 years who, despite attending school and having homework, spend a great deal of time watching television. The BCI's consultation process, which is going through its second stage, deserves to be congratulated in seeking submissions from children on advertising.</P>
      <P>I understand that, from the Government's viewpoint, this matter is being dealt with by the BCI consultation. However, this issue has not received its deserved attention. The opportunity given to us tonight by the Green Party to debate the issue is a welcome one and I hope other Deputies will join us in supporting the Bill, especially given its focus on children's health and well-being.</P>
      <P>The definition of the terms &ldquo;children&rdquo; and &ldquo;children's television&rdquo; needs to be debated. As Deputy Eamon Ryan will be aware, the consultation process put in place by the BCI specifically addressed the need to define the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; in an appropriate fashion. Following the first phase of the consultation process, the BCI has, in principle, defined a child as anyone under the age of 18 years. The definition of a child in other EU states varies from 12 years and under to 18 years and under. The Education Welfare Act 2000 defines a child as being between the ages of six years and sixteen years. RTE defines a child as a person under the age of 15 years, with a separate category for young persons from ages 16 years to 17 years. Neither the Broadcasting Act 2001 nor the legislation proposed by the Green Party makes the effort to define the term &ldquo;child&rdquo;. I would welcome clarification from the Green Party as to whether it accepts the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; as decided on by the BCI or other suggestions for a different definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" />We must also be aware that the definition of children's programming is at best, an inexact science. While it is easy to point to the section of the schedules that broadcasters set aside for children's programming, many television programmes designed for adults are popular with children. Programmes like &ldquo;Friends&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo; are watched by a significant number of children but are not necessarily characterised as children's programming. This explains children's high familiarity with television alcohol advertising, despite guidelines to keep such advertisements off air during children's television.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by Patrick Horan at DCU on children and advertising &ndash; admittedly on a small sample &ndash; found that 43.5% of children's favourite advertisements were for alcohol products while 32.5% were for food and drink. The vast majority of the latter, 97%, were for snack foods and cereals. While I agree that obesity is certainly a cause for concern, these figures are more disturbing when one wonders why, when cigarettes are banned from television advertising, alcohol advertisements are not.</P>
    <P>I welcome the specific reference to the issue of healthy foods in the legislation. Last weekend, Dr. Patrick Wall, formerly a director of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and now a professor at UCD, criticised advertising directed at children which encouraged them to eat products high in saturated fats, salts and sugars. Population obesity levels in the State rose 1% per year between 1998 and 2000. According to a SLÁN survey in 1999, 10% of the adult population was obese. By 2002, the survey saw an increase to 13%, with men slightly more likely to suffer from obesity. The survey also found that reported fruit consumption had declined sharply, by almost 50%, among schoolchildren. Not only is the amount of unhealthy food being consumed increasing, the amount of healthy food being consumed is simultaneously decreasing.</P>
    <P>Respondents from what the survey describes as the lower social classes show the highest levels of obesity. Obesity has been linked to a range of serious conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and a range of other illnesses. More than 30 medical conditions have been linked to obesity, and scientific evidence has established a strong relationship with at least 15 of those conditions. The prevalence of obesity has increased by about 10% to 40% in European countries in the past ten years according to the American Obesity Association.</P>
    <P>In Britain, the House of Commons select committee on health is conducting an inquiry into obesity and charges that big fast-food chains and junk food manufacturers have targeted children to make profits from products that damage their health. This investigation has seen representatives from McDonald's, Pepsi, Cadbury's and other companies called to give evidence. I look forward to its final report. A report published last month by the UK Food Standards Agency found <Col N="1033" />that food promotion is having an effect, especially on children's preferences, purchase behaviour and consumption. I suggest that the Government and the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, consider conducting a similar inquiry. Considering the amount of British television watched by Irish children, contact with the House of Commons committee could be useful. Its inquiry is considering a ban on junk food advertising during children's broadcasting and there may be a great deal for us to learn from its work.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider the negative implications a ban like this might have for broadcasting in Ireland. Last year, just under &euro;100 million was raised by RTE through commercial advertising and sponsorship. This represented approximately 36% of RTE's total revenue in 2002. I am not aware what proportion of this &euro;100 million relates to children's advertising but it must be a substantial amount. The sudden loss of that revenue stream could cause severe problems for a broadcaster that already has financial difficulties. To make up that shortfall, other sources of revenue would have to be found, including a possible application for a licence fee increase. The loss of children's advertising revenue would be even more acute for the State's commercial broadcaster, TV3, which does not, as it takes every opportunity to remind us, receive any licence fee income.</P>
    <P>Mr. Horan's thesis, to which I referred earlier, monitored Network Two children's programming over a five day period, during which 123 advertisements selling 43 distinct products, services or events were shown. Food and drink was the most common product advertised with 53.7% of total share, with McDonald's providing the most common advertisements. Any such ban will have major implications for RTE's ability to raise money. I am not saying this should prevent a ban or severe restrictions, rather we must ensure our public service broadcaster is cushioned against serious financial damage.</P>
    <P>While I have concentrated on the issue of obesity, junk food and related matters, it is worth pointing out, especially at this time of year, one of the other key effects of children's advertising. In the run-up to Christmas, the number of advertisements for toys, dolls and games on television increases to a great extent. The pressure this can place on families, especially those already struggling to get by, is intense. So-called pester power is a well-known marketing phenomenon, where advertising is used to convert children into mini-salespeople, harassing their parents to buy a certain product.</P>
    <P>Recently, an advertisement was held to account in the UK where the slogan for a well-known crisp company was: &ldquo;I am going to pester mum for them when I get home&rdquo;. It is hardly the most subtle form of advertising, but some companies have a better way of doing it. By marketing some of its products as &ldquo;Happy Meals&rdquo; and through aggressive use of movie and cartoon tie-ins, <Col N="1034" />McDonald's has found that, by playing on every child's natural love of toys and collectibles, it can, through using the child, place even more pressure on parents to buy its products. Marketing experts in the US estimate that children of 14 years of age and younger influence spending in the region of $600 billion ever year.</P>
    <P>The president of the American company Kids &ldquo;R&rdquo; Us advised advertisers: &ldquo;If you own this child at an early age, you can own this child for years to come.&rdquo; I am sure other Deputies would share my disgust with such a sentiment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND" hpid="Dr. Twomey Dr. Twomey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey:</NameTxt>
      <P>We live in a consumer society in which advertising is a very important feature. Advertising has been a key factor in the success of fast food outlets as measured by their profits. The supermarkets are full of canned food, much of which is sold as convenience food. Obesity is a problem in Ireland as it is in all developed societies. The wealthier a country becomes the more serious is the problem of obesity.</P>
      <P>We should consider why people buy convenience food. They do not always buy such food because of its advertising but for its convenience. Preparing fresh food such as vegetables and getting access to fresh fruit can be time-consuming for many people, especially with the busy lives of today. It is easy to fall back on the use of convenience food such as pizzas and the canned food we see in supermarkets. When we approach an issue such as this we need to consider whether we can modify society's behaviour easily, especially when many habits have become ingrained over time.</P>
      <P>While I am not suggesting that the smoking ban will fail, it will be interesting to see whether it succeeds. It will form an interesting parallel in determining whether trying to modify people's eating behaviour could work in similar circumstances. I do not know whether banning anything can work. It is difficult to introduce such rigid regulation in a society like ours. There would be too great an upheaval against it for it to work.</P>
      <P>We need to consider society's behaviour in other ways. In recent years we have seen an increase in the number of children who get no exercise. Silly reasons have been offered for this such as children not being allowed to do what they want in playgrounds because of the cost of insurance or getting supervision for them. Some children have very poor diets often because mothers, many of whom are single, are out working during the day and find it hard to get the time to prepare food. Some children have irregular meals, may leave home without breakfast and not eat until late in the evening when their parents return home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Eamon Ryan pointed out that as a parent he finds it difficult to keep children away from television. If there is a problem with television advertising, even though it is a very difficult issue to tackle we all have parental responsibility in this regard. While Governments cannot change society, they can influ<Col N="1035" />ence how society works. The Government has a considerable role to play in the issues raised in this Bill. The fundamental issue is to get to these children when they are very young and bring in a regime that allows them to take exercise in primary school and ensures participation in PE is more rigidly enforced. Through civic classes, children should be taught the importance of maintaining good health throughout life. Such issues would have a longer lasting and more beneficial effect on our society. However we have always ignored preventive medicine carried out through the educational system, which would be successful.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House as it will help to highlight the importance of this issue &ndash; it might get some coverage outside the House. We as legislators should make serious inroads in tackling this long-term problem for Irish society, which could have a tremendous effect in years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this timely and imaginative Bill. The thrust of the Bill is to restrict the broadcast of advertising targeted at children. I presume the positive action to protect public health referred to in section 2 of the Bill would consist principally of health warnings about foods high in salt, sugar and fat. An obesity time bomb continues to tick away even as the Teletubbies are enlisted to promote particular brands of burgers. I have heard a description of a doughnut as a &ldquo;heart attack with a hole in the middle&rdquo;. Exploitative advertising aimed at children influences a multi-million euro market every year. Advertising targeted at children is enhanced by technology honed by child psychologists &ndash; I sometimes wonder about the ethics of psychologists doing such work for money &ndash; and brought to children through the expenditure of millions of corporate euro each week.</P>
      <P>Schemes advertised heavily in schools, which reward schools with sports equipment or books for consuming more of a company's product, should be scrutinised. There is something morally wrong with this. Many junk foods contain more fat, sugar and salt than is recommended. The level of obesity is rising and constitutes a major health time bomb, which could lead to an epidemic of diabetes in children. It is predicted that in parts of Great Britain there will be a tenfold risk in diabetic-related problems.</P>
      <P>In Britain a study in 2001 found that half of the advertisements during television programmes were from food companies, which compares with one fifth during adult programming. Many advertisements promoted soft drinks, savoury snacks, confectionery and fast food. While we are concentrating on the food aspect, we often overlook soft drinks, which are targeted at children and do considerable damage to teeth. We need an educational programme about soft drinks and the damage they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" />In Britain when there was an outcry about the level of teenage smoking, the tobacco firms voluntarily agreed to stop advertising around schools and above newsagents before the Government finally banned cigarette advertising. Perhaps television companies should introduce some cigarette-type protocols to limit the effects of advertisements.</P>
    <P>While children are impressed by what they see on television, parents are also often impressed by what they see. When they want to give their child a special treat, they reach for a branded chocolate bar or the famous doughnut, or they take them out to the fast food chain advertised by the Teletubbies. We should consider that parents are also influenced.</P>
    <P>As we approach Christmas, children's advertising reaches its peak. Intolerable pressure is placed on parents at this time of year. Mothers and fathers are locked in an intense and increasingly unfair competition with advertisers and marketers. The advertising of all sorts of toys that are generally expensive is pumped at children, which is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>In Sweden all television advertising to children below 12 has been banned since 1991. Sweden also outlaws all advertising during television programmes that last 30 minutes or less. They even ban musical jingles if the country's consumer ombudsman deems them to be subliminal or stealth advertising or surreptitious promotion for the sponsors, generally leading toy companies. There are different ways to send a message and advertisers and television companies need to be more aware of this. There is a ban on advertising within five minutes of children's television programmes in Belgium, Denmark and Greece, and Norway, Italy and Poland are considering similar restrictions.</P>
    <P>Broadcasters argue that the revenue generated in the EU each year by television advertisements for children's products amounts to between &euro;670 million and &euro;1 billion, which they say is essential for the creation of quality children's programmes.</P>
    <P>Trans-national advertisements also entice children to purchase replica football kits and scarves of other countries' football teams as well as their own local ones. The porosity of national borders when it comes to broadcast signals is a major problem for various programmes. Even if there were restrictions on advertising here, we are inundated by broadcasts from Sky Television and other broadcasters in Northern Ireland and Britain. Even if the entire EU were to outlaw children's advertising, satellite broadcasts and Internet web casts from outside the EU would ensure that these borders would be breached, as is happening. Television influences children leading to desire and purchase intent in most cases. Television is only one of the media through which children receive advertising messages and influences. This Bill seeks to ensure that broadcasting media adopt a responsible attitude to advertising aimed at children. I am happy to support it unreservedly.</P>

Physical health and pester power issues are arguably a small part of the broader and necessary public policy debate on the values children acquire from the media as a whole and from broadcasters in particular.</P>

      <P>The Green Party Bill also disappoints by failing to address the need for effective policy solutions in this area. Like adults, children are exposed to increasing amounts of advertising in all forms of media and in the ambient environment. Much of that advertisement pushes products which it can be argued do not serve the long-term interests of the individual child or of society. Equally, advertising in adult broadcast <Col N="1039" />media generates values and messages of doubtful long-term value.</P>
      <P>The assumption that regulation of children's advertising is the only or even the principal public policy issue raised by children's broadcasting is arguable. The content of children's programming is doing as much if not more damage to children as advertising. Many children's programmes reflect the deeply materialistic world in which many of the protections traditionally available to children are neither respected nor adhered to by many programme makers. Much programming features astonishing amounts of violence and an unhealthy consumer ethic.</P>
      <P>Children's programming is a clear reflection of the mores of adult entertainment in a broadcasting sector driven increasingly by the bottom line. It is increasingly the case that children's programming is as much a part of the advertising hard sell as the advertisements themselves. We should ask how many costume changes feature before the end of the opening sequence of credits for &ldquo;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&rdquo;. What does &ldquo;Cribs&rdquo; on MTV say about the values of the society to which it asks young people to aspire? Does pop culture worship youth to the point at which it is arguably leading to the early sexualisation of pre-teens?</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these programming considerations, addressing advertising aimed at children presents major challenges. Legislators attempting to deal with the issue face a wall of money, an industry built around that and an increasingly globalised broadcasting sector in which the power of national regulation is being minimised. In the USA, $2 billion is spent annually on advertising to children. More significantly, advertising spending aimed at children has increased by 2,000% over the past ten years. This trend is a function of children's influence on family spending which is estimated to have grown in the USA from $5 billion in 1960 to $290 billion in 2001.</P>
      <P>A wealth of research has highlighted the relationship between the advertising of unhealthy products and the view of young people as potential consumers of them. We should not be surprised that the US experience has increasingly become the benchmark for other OECD countries. The social issue is whether young people have the linguistic and cognitive competence to evaluate advertisements. While adults usually understand when they are confronted with a persuasive act, younger children often cannot distinguish between programmes and advertising. Generally, children do not understand the purpose of advertising. They do not interpret language used by advertisers in the same way as adults.</P>
      <P>The view of the Swedish Government on this matter is quite clear. Its spokesman has said that television advertising aimed at children does not stand the most fundamental rule of advertising ethics. According to this rule, advertising should be easily recognisable as such by those who form its target audience.</P>

      <P>We must do more than assume restrictions on children's advertisements will be effective in and of themselves. This is an especially difficult area for the European Union.</P>
      <P>Through the Broadcasting Act 2001, the Houses of the Oireachtas determined that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland should have responsibility for drawing up new codes and rules on advertising and tastes and decency in programme material. In November 2002, I wrote to the commission in accordance with section 19(1) of the Act and directed it to prepare codes specifying standards to be complied with and rules and practices to be observed. These standards, rules and practices were to be applied to the taste and decency of programme material, the subject of a broadcasting service or sound broadcasting service, advertising, teleshopping material, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion employed in any visual or sound broadcasting service. They were also to be applied to advertising, teleshopping material, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion employed in any broadcasting service which relate to matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children. In accordance with section 19(2) of the Act, I specified that the commission should give priority to the preparation of these codes under section 19(1)(<i>c</i>) which relates to advertising directed at children. The commission has acted swiftly.</P>
      <P>Reference was made earlier to consultation on health issues. Section 19(7) of the Broadcasting Act requires the BCI to take account of research and guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Children, which is a body with vested functions in respect of children, and other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with my direction, the commission has commenced work to prepare the new <Col N="1041" />codes and rules and has given precedence to the matter of children's advertising. It would be useful to the House to outline the steps the commission has taken.</P>
    <P>The commission has outlined three phases for the drawing up of the new children's advertising code. In phase one, the commission undertook a number of activities. It provided information and raised public awareness of the legislative requirement to develop a children's advertising code and began quantitative research into children's viewing patterns. It also engaged in the first phase of an extensive public consultation process and asked for views on the its proposal to use a phased approach to developing the code. It sought a definition of key terms including the terms &ldquo;child&rdquo; and &ldquo;children's advertising&rdquo; and asked for views on the framework for the code or the headings that would be used to develop it. The commission provided 12 headings for consideration and asked whether the headings identified were appropriate. It also asked whether there were other headings that should be included. This first phase of the development of the code ended in July of this year.</P>
    <P>The decisions reached by the commission took into account the 20 submissions received in addition to discussion and debate at the commission's board meetings in June and July of this year. A summary of the outcomes from the first phase of consultation are available on the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland website.</P>
    <P>The development of the children's advertising code is in its second phase and is due to be completed early next year. In this phase, the commission will again raise public awareness of its work in developing the children's advertising code. It will gather views on the content of the code using a second public consultation document. It will consult with children using a children's consultation document and a children's consultation event, proposed to take place in January of next year. It will publish quantitative research into children's viewing patterns and may also undertake qualitative research should this be deemed necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>In the third and final phase, the commission will produce a draft version of the children's advertising code. This will be based on the views expressed in the consultation process and its own decisions arising from this process. It will publish and circulate this document in the first quarter of next year. The public will be asked for its views and following this, the code will be finalised in the summer of next year.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined in my replies to parliamentary questions, I will not make a submission to the commission. It is clear that the commission has approached its task in a systematic and comprehensive fashion and I congratulate it on its work.</P>
    <P>It is proper that the House continues to have an input into the important and complex matter of advertising rules. Having legislated on the matter, the House should continue to have the oppor<Col N="1042" />tunity to consider how this matter is progressed. While I always welcome debate, I do not consider that the Bill is necessary to provide such an opportunity. The 2001 Act places an obligation on the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to report to me on the performance of its functions in drawing up new codes and rules on children's advertising. I expect to receive the report of the commission later this week. In accordance with the Act I will lay copies of the report before this House and the Seanad. If the Houses wish to discuss the report, they are free to do so.</P>
    <P>The commission has consulted widely and undertaken some preliminary research. The extensive public consultation has ensured that there is more than an adequate opportunity for organisations and agencies representing the interests of children to have an input in the process.</P>
    <P>The Bill also seeks to amend RTE's mandate as the national public service broadcaster. The addition of a new and specific obligation to the definition of the public service character of the RTE national broadcasting service is unnecessary given the wide-ranging nature of the existing definition. This includes an over-arching obligation to &ldquo;entertain, inform and educate&rdquo; as well as to provide programmes of &ldquo;news and current affairs&rdquo;. The extension of the legislative characterisation of public service broadcasting in a piecemeal fashion is undesirable because of the range of equally laudable public policy objectives which will inevitably be ignored by this process.</P>
    <P>I will bring forward proposals for legislation next year relating to the establishment of the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the restructuring of RTE. This will allow for a broader consideration of what should be encompassed by the definition of public service broadcasting. It is appropriate, in terms of quality of programming, that the bar for RTE is raised high.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill suggest, however, that RTE should also be required to adhere to higher standards regarding measures addressed at protecting children. The implication is that less would be expected of other broadcasters. I cannot accept this. Whatever rules the commission decides upon will apply equally to all broadcasters licensed in Ireland. Anything else would be indefensible. Where measures are introduced to protect children, they must be implemented.</P>
    <P>There is also real tension between the current independent mandate of the public service broadcaster and the need or desirability that the broadcaster reflect public policy objectives in its programming. The proposals in the legislation ignore the fundamental long-term challenge for Irish policymakers seeking to influence advertising regulation in the EU.</P>
    <P>Cross-border services such as satellite broadcasters are regulated from their country of origin, the United Kingdom in the case of Sky. It is therefore a matter under European law for the United Kingdom regulator, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, to determine appropri<Col N="1043" />ate standards with respect to advertising issues within broad guidelines set out in the directive at EU level. Increasingly, the Irish broadcasting market is being driven by cross-border services. The Nickelodeon service for children is a relevant example in this respect.</P>
    <P>Unless the framework rules governing EU broadcasting legislation are changed, there is no way that individual member states, acting alone, can regulate incoming cross-border broadcasting services. National regulation alone would leave domestic broadcasters at a significant disadvantage in an increasingly competitive marketplace. An increase in the drift of viewers to cross-border services would, in these circumstances, wholly undermine the purpose of stricter regulations on domestic broadcasters. The Television Without Frontiers directive, under review at EU level, contains the framework rules for regulation of EU broadcasting activities.</P>
    <P>I am pressing strongly, as part of that review, to allow a modification in the rules governing content regulation to allow the country of destination of service to regulate content where programming is intended solely for that market or where insert advertising facilities, designed specifically for that market, are used by the cross-border broadcaster. It is expected that the larger member states will strongly resist any attempt to depart from or modify the existing country of origin rule for regulation of content in the EU marketplace. Ireland has support from countries like Sweden, Belgium and Austria on its position.</P>
    <P>I cannot support the Bill. Its contents might form a useful submission to the Broadcasting Commission in the context of the public consultation in which it is engaged. The Bill, which is in effect a submission, would not strengthen the existing legislative provisions in this area. It is cynical, short-sighted and, as a policy move, obtuse and self-serving. Clearly, it is policy on the hoof.</P>

      <P>I have always had time for Deputy Gormley and I have respect for Deputy Eamon Ryan and work well with him in the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, he has missed the boat with this Bill because a new children's advertising code being drawn up by the BCI will be <Col N="1044" />available in the new year. As part of a broadcasting contract issued to all broadcasters by the BCI, all Irish broadcasters will have to abide by this code or face the prospect of going off air. The BCI can include whatever measures it sees fit to protect children in the code, including an outright ban of children's advertising. While the BCI is finalising the code, the Green Party is trying to anticipate the process, and I agree with my colleague the Minister that this smacks of knee-jerk politics.</P>
      <P>The new children's advertising code will be an important blueprint and the draft will allow for an input by the public before finalisation in the summer. It is important that we reiterate what the Minister said in his speech and outline again the process the BCI will take. I am aware of the BCI outline from its reports on the Internet, as is Deputy Ryan. The commission has outlined three phases for the drawing up of the new children's advertising code. In phase one the commission undertook research into children's viewing habits and outlined broad headings to be covered by the code.</P>
      <P>The development of the code is in the second phase which is due to be completed early next year. As the Minister has said, the commission will raise public awareness of its work in developing the children's advertising code. It will gather views on the content of the code using a second public consultation document. It will consult children by means of a children's consultation document and a children's consultation event, proposed to take place in January of next year. The Minister said that it will publish quantitative research into children's viewing patterns. The commission may also undertake qualitative research if it is deemed necessary or desirable. A draft version of the children's advertising code, based on the views expressed in the consultation process and the BCI's decisions arising from the process, will be published in the first quarter of 2004.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that young girls should be a target for perfume sales. The images portrayed in the advertisements are extremely damaging. The anxiety experienced by girls who feel they are unattractive is arguably one of the most pervasive and damaging consequences of advertising. One body type &ndash; that of a very tall, thin woman &ndash; is almost always presented in the media and in advertisements. Such a woman would meet the criteria for anorexia, as she would be 15% below the normal weight. In reality, this unhealthy body shape is unattainable for 99% of women. This is the reason for the incredible proliferation of the weight loss, fashion and cosmetics industries, which are among the largest and most profitable consumer industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent study conducted by the school of medicine at Stanford University showed that watching less television may curb children's appetites for new toys. The small study indicated that reducing television viewing may help to reduce the influence of advertising on children's behaviour. Children see approximately 40,000 commercials a year, which is twice the number seen by children in the 1970s. Half the commercials in question are toys advertisements, according to the study.</P>
      <P>According to the Canadian Toy Testing Council, exaggeration is the greatest area of concern in respect of toy advertisements in Canada. Young children often think toys can do more than they can because of the way they are portrayed in advertisements. These concerns have led some jurisdictions to ban all advertising aimed at children. Print and broadcast advertising aimed at children under 13 has been banned in Quebec. Sweden, which has banned advertisements aimed at children under 12, is lobbying EU member states to adopt similar policies. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has expressed similar views tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents should be concerned about the effect of excessive materialism on the development of children's self-image and values. Although children's identities should not be defined by their <Col N="1047" />consumer habits, they see themselves reflected in the media as consumers. Advertisers are targeting younger and younger children with this message. The marketing of merchandise based on the popular pre-school television programmes &ldquo;Barney&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teletubbies&rdquo; marked the beginning of identifying toddlers as a consumer market. I must confess that I have never seen the programmes in question, as I do not have a child under the age of 17. A healthy society raises children to be responsible citizens rather than mere consumers.</P>

      <P>The creation of healthy and happy families involves spending time together rather than spending money.</P>
      <P>During one of the good contributions from the Opposition side earlier, we heard that fast food chains spend significant amounts of money each year on advertising, much of which is aimed at children. The fast food industry uses methods other than traditional commercials to target children directly. Fast food restaurants offer incentives such as playgrounds, contests, clubs, games, free toys and other merchandise related to movies and television shows. A company which produces toys based on the World Wrestling Federation encourages children as young as four to use their play sets &ldquo;to bash and dump opponents senseless with an array of street fighting accessories&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will consider next year a crackdown on the use by broadcasters of competitions, product placement and similar subliminal advertising. This issue will be prioritised as part of the first overhaul in eight years of the BCI's general advertising code. The overhaul will start this year and will be completed by mid-2004. The commission believes that the code needs to be adjusted to reflect the increasing reliance by broadcasters on commercial sponsorship for individual programmes and on competitions with large prizes.</P>
      <P>Changes in legislation governing alcohol advertising will be reflected in the new code. The changes will follow the BCI's first children's advertising code, which is due to be put in place early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to be conscious of the dangers of simply driving children's advertising from Irish broadcasters to satellite and cable television channels which are widely available here. I refer to Sky and Nickelodeon, which the Minister mentioned earlier as a dedicated children's channel. Mounting competition for advertising revenue from Sky has already been eating heavily into the advertising income of TV3 and RTE. I await the BCI report with considerable interest. I urge Deputy Eamon Ryan, even at this late stage, to <Col N="1048" />save the time of the House by withdrawing this Bill, which is a mere duplication of what will be done by the BCI at the instruction of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>

      <P>The parents of young children have an important role to play in protecting them from invasive marketing and educating them about advertising from a very early age. Research has shown that children aged between two and five cannot differentiate between regular television programming and commercials. Young children are especially vulnerable to misleading advertising and do not begin to understand that advertisements are not always true until they are eight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill to the House. In the last few months before Christmas, we see a great deal of advertising on our television screens, especially for toys. It is very worrying, since the advertising is now carrying through from September. The most vulnerable are being targeted, namely, our children. The Minister said that we all have children, but I have none of whom I am aware, but I appreciate that other Deputies do. Children are most vulnerable, with advertisements targeted at them, but their parents are equally vulnerable. Deputy Ryan spoke about a child seeing a toy or some other item on television that he or she wants. The child wants to get that toy or whatever equipment it might be because he or she is pressurised into getting it.</P>
      <P>We need powers to protect the most vulnerable and I hope the Bill is passed. I am very disappointed the Minister will not support it. He was not clear in regard to what he spoke about. There are many fast-food outlets, and every sort of advertisement has been shown over the past few months. Some Deputies spoke about obesity, a very important issue which affects us all, particularly our children. There are many television channels, such as cartoon networks, Sky, RTE 1, Network 2 or whatever, and children watch them from the moment they return from school until they are taken away to do their homework, after which they are straight back in front of the television screen again.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Flynn mentioned the many advertisements between those programmes, be they for perfume for the ladies, toys for the children or fast-food outlets. I do not mind the advertising of products &ndash; that must be done to make people aware of them, but it is being overdone. Someone spoke about football shirts and related matters, but what are the advertisers giving back to local communities? I do not see McDonald's or any of the toy stores giving anything back to the local GAA club or community. We always depend on the same people. It is very important that we see what is happening in terms of advertisers bullying our young children. The parents feel the brunt of such advertising because they are harassed by their children into buying the products.</P>
      <P>It is very important that a measure is brought in to stop such advertisements, be they for junk food, toys or whatever. As someone said, advertising is a very powerful tool. The run-up to Christmas is the time when people are most vulnerable and they go out to buy equipment or toys. It is important that we introduce strong legislation to stop such advertising. Deputy Gormley said that this would eventually cost the State in years to come, through obesity, diabetes or heart disease. We should look very seriously at the matter and ensure that such advertising is not allowed every year because it is aimed at the most vulnerable in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" />My party and I support this Bill. I hope that something will be done to stop the type of advertisement that has been shown recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG" hpid="Ms Enright Ms Enright">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the Private Members' motion tabled by Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party, particularly for the opportunity it gives us to discuss the matter. It is timely because of the season and the publication today of the national health and lifestyle survey. I have difficulty with the concept of codes as opposed to the imposition of a statutory obligation or duty. We should be clear that they are different.</P>
      <P>The motion tonight is intended to ensure that certain things are included in the code currently being drawn up. I looked at the questions that the BCI has posed for children and parents on its website. They are comprehensive, but it is very clear that there are certain matters about which it has not yet made up its mind. I am sure the Green Party will speak for itself, but the thrust of the motion seems to be to ensure that certain matters are included. The advertising standards code states that children should not be made to feel inferior or unpopular by not buying the advertised product and that they should not be encouraged to pester their parents to buy it. That code has clearly failed and is not working.</P>
      <P>It is plain that advertisers would not advertise if it did not work. The problem arises throughout the year, but it is more acute at Christmas. Last year's toy show on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; was the biggest money raiser ever in terms of advertisements, with 30-second slots reaching premium fees of &euro;14,000. Only the world cup advertising fees were higher. No company will spend that much money unless it gets a definite return. The pressure being put on parents is acute. It is not the only influence since children put a great deal of pressure on each other, even without advertising. They have to have a specific brand or type of trainer. However, advertising and branding have a significant impact. We are not meeting like with like. Parents have no way of protecting themselves or their children. It is them against massive media and companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those big businesses employ child psychologists and marketing specialists to see how they can best get in there and get their products purchased. Reports can be purchased by companies on such subjects as marketing to &ldquo;tweens&rdquo;, which covers the age between young children and teenagers. There is even a report available on the web &ndash; I believe that the price is $1,200 &ndash; on marketing to pre-school children. That is what we are dealing with. Those reports are available and usable everywhere. The chief strategy officer of one such company has even written reports on the methods that can be employed to get children to persuade their parents. One was called The Nag Factor and another The Fine Art of Whining. This person advises companies to give chil<Col N="1051" />dren a good reason or argument that they can use against their parents to get the product that they want, such as that it will help them with learning or homework. We must examine that type of advertising.</P>
    <P>The National College of Art and Design has stated that children under five years do not distinguish between programmes and advertising. That can be interpreted as saying that advertising can send out a subliminal message to children of that age. Children aged between five and eight, as Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned, have no comprehension of the persuasive intentions of advertising. That makes them extremely vulnerable, and they must be protected by stricter regulations. The BCI has gone some way towards that in that it has taken the time to ask questions, not only of adults but of children, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The motion is timely as it relates to food advertising. Today's report by the National Nutritional Surveillance Centre shows that obesity levels among the population as a whole have risen by 3%. Today's reports in the British media show that doctors see cases of diabetes brought on by poor diet and lack of exercise in children as young as 13. The number of children with weight problems has more than doubled in the past two decades alone, which is significant. I do not say that advertising makes people obese, but it creates a desire in children to get their hands on the advertised products, whether they are toys or food.</P>
    <P>RTE's figures indicate that pre-Christmas toy advertisements made up approximately 30% of the advertising directed at children last year and advertisements for cereals and confectionery accounted for approximately 25% each. The type of advertising being used in these contexts is particularly persuasive, especially when it is linked to promotions run by fast food chains promoting popular children's films such as &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo;, which place characters from the film in children's meals. This is a different type of advertising and it must be tackled. It is important that the Bill relates specifically to the food sector.</P>
    <P>Television companies need to give serious consideration to adverts which promote the stations themselves, especially those advertising films and programmes they are showing. For example, it does not make sense that an advertisement for the adult film &ldquo;Se7en&rdquo; was broadcast at 5.30 p.m. The film had to be shown after the watershed, yet it was being advertised before the watershed. This issue needs to be changed because it is unacceptable. I am not sure if the television stations edit the worst bits from the film when they show the advertisement at 5.30 p.m. I am sure they do, but children see the advertisements at this time and will want to see the film later that night. I accept that parental responsibility is important but, like my colleague, I do not have <Col N="1052" />children and therefore cannot criticise parents about how they use the television. Nonetheless, the television should not be used as a babysitting tool. I understand it can be difficult to police children's television viewing, therefore we must make it easier for parents to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to the fact that our regulation of Irish television channels does not prevent children being exposed to other channels. The basic digital package offered by NTL in the Dublin area has nine children's channels. Therefore, children are being exposed to much more advertising than previously, as a result of which toy advertising on Irish channels has fallen. The Government should raise this issue at EU level to ensure that the measures in place are enforced on a broader basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill. In his speech, the Minister explained why the Bill has come before the House, that he is dealing with the issue and will have it dealt with shortly. However, there is no reason the Bill should not be discussed by a group within the Opposition. It is only right and proper this major issue is discussed.</P>
      <P>The main item on the agenda in the Oireachtas for the next few days is the Social Welfare Bill 2003. As a former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, knows more than most about problems in this sector. The broader population may suffer from children's demands as a result of advertising, but no group suffers as much as those on social welfare benefits or low incomes. Many feel they must &ldquo;keep up with the Joneses&rdquo; and parents whose children attend the same schools as better-off children find themselves under tremendous pressure to provide similar toys and goodies of all kinds which they see advertised and know about because television is now in most homes. It is correct that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is moving towards a proposal which can deal with this issue in a constructive manner. Multichannel television is available in many areas, and regulating Irish television will not solve all the problems. Nevertheless, that is not a reason for us not to try to control our own media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, my older brother travelled through the United States with his uncle who was always angry about advertising on television. When the uncle developed a headache, he went into a drugstore to buy a tablet and, when my brother asked him what tablets he bought, he gave the brand name. When my brother asked him why he bought that brand, the uncle told him it was because they had been advertised. Therefore, even someone who did not want to listen to advertising was persuaded to buy a specific brand. If that is the case for an aged adult, it must put <Col N="1053" />tremendous pressure on children to behave similarly.</P>
    <P>Although I am not a parent, I have come across families who, in the run-up to Christmas, have failed to get some social welfare payment or other, for example, the Christmas bonus. Some of them have come to my door begging because they had been relying on the payment to buy a certain toy for Christmas. They are desperate and I know they have approached the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others to try to meet the children's demands. This is a real issue.</P>
    <P>I am a diabetic and was told clearly it was because of obesity. The issue of food advertising is important in this context. It is accepted in the US and elsewhere that obesity causes diabetes and other problems. Food companies are prepared to spend significant amounts of money on advertising to persuade children that their way is the only way. I have often come across parents trying to get their children to eat wholesome good food but find themselves pressured into buying crisps or Kentucky Fried Chicken. I should not mention a specific company in case I am accused of advertising. This is a real danger.</P>
    <P>The Bill should highlight these issues and encourage the Minister to move forward and ensure his proposals are introduced as quickly as possible. I have been a Member of the House for long enough to have seen many Private Members' Bills and motions condemned by the Government which told us everything would be sorted out in a matter of weeks or months. We do not want to see this happen again. We can see what the advertising of alcohol and cigarettes has done, although the danger of cigarette advertising has been taken seriously and there are bans in place. However, many young girls in particular are smoking more than ever, which makes one wonder what this debate is about.</P>
    <P>Although it may not be as relevant as the other issues referred to, the advertising of alcohol and its use to make young people believe that, unless they have tried every drink under the sun, they have not lived is extremely serious. One of the issues which annoyed me most about the budget debate was when the Tánaiste effectively pointed out that jobs in the drinks industry were more important than people's lives. We have serious problems with binge drinking which is caused by mass advertising of these products. I object to this and reject it. We must do everything possible to ensure that advertising which is of little benefit to the people is curtailed.</P>

      <P>I call on the Minister to consider the recommendations made in the report on full-time carers, particularly those which suggest that the respite care grant should be payable to all recipients of social welfare and that carer's benefit should be extended beyond the 15 month period provided that the carer continues to look after the person for whom they are providing care, who must be qualified, during that period.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider extending free schemes to widows and widowers under 66 years of age. She might set up a study group to evaluate the costs involved. I urge her to give consideration to this matter in her forthcoming review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Crowe, Connolly and Finian McGrath.</P>
      <P>The current incumbent of the Department of Social and Family Affairs has boasted that &euro;1 of every &euro;3 to be spent by the Government in the coming year will go on social welfare payments. I presume the Minister is only taking current and not capital expenditure into account. If she took the latter into account, she would realise that the figure would be closer to &euro;1 in every &euro;4, which is still a substantial sum. I am more concerned about her assertion that this money will be devoted to social welfare payments. The money will certainly be spent within her Department, but the Minister's bald statement does not take into account the staffing and administration costs involving the thousands of officials in the Department who help her allocate it in various ways throughout the country. It also does not take into account universal benefits such as child benefit which for some is an income maintenance, while for others it is an income supplement. In my case, I have a 13-year old daughter and it is an income supplement. In addition, the Minister has failed to take into account the schemes, such as social insurance schemes, into which people have already paid.</P>
      <P>If the expenditure of the Department is analysed closely, it might be discovered that only a small percentage is dedicated to the alleviation of poverty. The figures should be presented in a more honest fashion because it is certainly not the case that &euro;1 in every &euro;3 will be spent on the alleviation of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also argued, in respect of the proposed cuts, that many of the programmes have become over-used or used for reasons beyond their original purpose. She cited rent, crèche and dietary supplements. If the Minister is making the case that these payments are not being used as originally intended, that surely says something about the policy of the Government. These supplements have become dependent payments for many in society. The Minister may wish to shunt them off to the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Health and Children, but the Government is responsible for creating <Col N="1055" />this dependency while failing to create alternatives for people other than these direct payments. The decision that they should be cut or reallocated will have a definite impact on people's lives.</P>
    <P>In her contribution on the budget, the Minister castigated the Opposition as being baby infants.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is blaming bad editing for her contributions in the House, I do not know what we, as an Opposition, are supposed to do. I am referring to what the Minister said, which is a matter of record and which is what we are meant to react to. If she is blaming EU citizens for supposed abuses of the back to education scheme, where do we stand as a nation having benefited for many years from the contribution of the European Social Fund to the education and training element of FÁS schemes&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and from the ERASMUS and LEONARDO third level education programmes? Surely we have received far more from <Col N="1056" />European Union funds than the Minister is claiming is being lost under any possible abuse.</P>
      <P>The greatest mistake the Minister has made relates to the supplementary rent allowance scheme. The categories of people she has outlined that will be affected by these changes means that people will be obliged to define themselves as homeless, as having a disability or suffering some form of hardship as a result of their family circumstances. Individuals will have to label themselves in the ways I have outlined in order to enjoy, if that is the word to use, supplementary rent allowance within the six-month period. There is also the ultimate Hobson's choice: if people are renting, why do they need the allowance?</P>
      <P>We must consider the effect of the past seven budgets in respect of social welfare and those who are dependent on it. CORI has stated that the gap has widened across the seven budgets presented by the Minister for Finance. I accept that Deputy Coughlan has held the office of Minister for only two of these, but the gap to which I refer has increased by &euro;294 per week. As a result, single people who are long-term unemployed have benefited to the extent of &euro;50 per week. However, couples with two incomes have benefited by &euro;225 per week and those with two incomes in excess of &euro;50,000 per year have benefited to the extent of &euro;421 per week. That is the extent of the unequal society the Minister has helped to create.</P>
      <P>I wish to take the Minister to task again in respect of her reliance on figures relating to consistent poverty. With which countries should we compare out level of consistent poverty? Should we compare it with those in the UK or other EU countries? The level of consistent poverty in Ireland is unique to it. The only international standard we can use for comparative purposes is that relating to relative poverty, which has widened and deepened on foot of the seven budgets presented by the Minister for Finance and the six previous Social Welfare Acts and this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final point relates to the Minister's proposed changes in respect of PRSI. There is a need for greater honesty from the Government regarding this matter. The benefit-in-kind on PRSI proves that it has gone beyond being a social insurance fund and is now a flat rate tax. There is no way that one can cost items that do not have a specific cash value, and place an insurance value on them, unless they are taxed. The ceiling is not something with which I would disagree. There are imbalances in our social insurance system and PRSI has long stopped being a social insurance fund. It is a flat rate tax administered by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on behalf of Government, which should be honest enough to admit to it and add it to the effective rate of tax. The reality is that people at the highest level are paying tax at 47% and 48% and far more will pay <Col N="1057" />it at that level as a result of these social welfare proposals and the Minister for Finance's budget proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to decisions made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Department of Finance in the Estimates and budget. The budget has been described as another missed opportunity that did nothing to tackle structural inequalities in Irish society. A budget is not merely about balancing the books; it should give direction as to the type of society people want to see emerge. It is clear from this budget that the type of society the Minister for Finance and the Government want is much the same, more of the same.</P>
      <P>Once again, working people were hit and will find it increasingly difficult to manage as the year progresses and the new stealth taxes and price rises kick in. We are told the poor and marginalised will have to wait for another year.</P>
      <P>The budget architect is not here. Instead, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has come to give us a lesson in spin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to believe that everything is great and huge improvements are on the way or have been implemented in this budget. I am not aware of any big increases given in the budget. The reality is quite different. Let us knock the lie on the head straight away. No one dependent on social welfare will benefit greatly from this budget. It tinkered at the edges and brought no positive changes for the majority of people living in this State. That is my belief and it is one shared by many people.</P>
      <P>Changes are on the way but it is the well off who will benefit, just as they benefited from consistent budgets over the past seven years. Everyone except the Government believes that the gap between rich and poor has expanded. We have become a society of extremes and it is becoming harder for families and individuals to break out of the cycle of poverty.</P>
      <P>The debate, such as it is, on this legislation consists of the Opposition attacking a Bill it knows is inadequate, the Minister promoting a Bill she knows deep down is completely inadequate and an array of backbenchers claiming credit for welfare increases they know are completely inadequate. Members wonder why people are cynical about politics.</P>
      <P>Children and young people fare worst in this budget. A party that maintains a nostalgic reverence for the men and women of 1916 has clearly forgotten to cherish the children of the nation equally.</P>

      <P>The &euro;6 a month increase in child benefit announced in the budget is not enough. If we accept the Government's prediction of 2.5% inflation for 2004, we find the increase is, in real terms, &euro;2.86 a month or less than 10 cent a day.

      <P>Compare this sum to the Government's pledge on child benefit before the last election when it committed itself to increases totalling &euro;1.27 billion over three years from 2001 to 2003. This would have seen us reach a child benefit rate of &euro;149 for the first and second child by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>Last year, instead of increases of between &euro;30 and &euro;40, the Minister for Finance gave an increase of &euro;8 per month in child benefit, higher than the increase for this year at &euro;6 a month and &euro;17 short of where it was supposed to be a year ago.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides an increase of &euro;10 per week in unemployment assistance which is a step, albeit a small one, in the right direction. The target set by NAPS is &euro;150 a week in 2002 terms by 2007. This translates as a target of &euro;182.70 by 2007, three more budgets away, if the Government remains in office that long. This, according to CORI, means an average increase in unemployment assistance of &euro;15.97 over each of the next three budgets, far and above what the Government is set to spend on welfare increases. Will the Minister confirm if the NAPS target is still achievable? Will she restate her commitment to meet that target or will we find that, like the Government's promise on child benefit, when she says 2007, she means years later?</P>
      <P>One decision that is as unsurprising as it is depressing is the Minister's determination to ensure the child dependant allowance remains frozen. It has remained at the same level since 1994. In real terms, it is worth 25% less than it was in 1994. When I asked the Minister in November about increasing the child dependant allowance, she claimed any increase would be a disincentive to work and would ensure social welfare recipients remained on the dole, saying that they would rather be unemployed than give up the few bob provided by the allowance.</P>

The Minister has failed to provide funds for increases in the back to school clothing and footwear allowances, resulting in a cut in real terms. Is the Minister telling me these allowances are not needed or is there a clever plan to encourage the recycling of worn out clothing and shoes? Carers received a slap in the face in this budget. As a group, carers save the State an estimated &euro;1.6 billion per year by providing care in the home, obviating the necessity of State-provided institutional care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for Government Deputies to explain away the budget and although they tried to do this, the people have seen through it. Had it not contained the decen<Col N="1061" />tralisation proposals as a smokescreen, concealing the pick-pocket stealth taxes of Lord McCreevy of Punchestown, it would have been a damp squib. The niggardly social welfare increases of approximately &euro;1.40 per day would not even buy a sandwich. The extra 20 cent daily for children's allowances would just about enable them to make a telephone call &ndash; if they were thrifty and saved for two days, they might be able to call the children's helpline.</P>
      <P>The smug, self-satisfied attitude of Government representatives in post-budget interviews was reminiscent of Harold Macmillan's &ldquo;You've never had it so good&rdquo; statement. If one says something often enough, one may come to believe one's own propaganda. How can those representatives possibly empathise with those forced to subsist on social welfare benefits, much less talk about protecting living standards?</P>
      <P>We hear high-minded talk from Government Deputies about addressing the substantial poverty and social exclusion that continue to exist. While the Department of Social and Family Affairs professes to cater for social and family affairs, the social welfare provisions of the budget could not be considered family friendly by any stretch of the imagination. How will the social welfare increases enable families to meet the additional costs of purchasing school uniforms or books? Approximately &euro;1.60 per day has already been eroded. Taking inflation into account, this equates to being about 25% per week worse off.</P>
      <P>The social welfare provisions of the budget could and should have been directed towards vulnerable communities and families, thereby promoting a policy of inclusion rather than exclusion. The gap between rich and poor has widened considerably. The gap in income of someone earning &euro;50,000 per year and someone on the dole has increased by &euro;30 per week. Punchestown has become a byword for the way the Government has consistently favoured the rich over the poor. In the seven successive budgets introduced by the Minister for Finance, the gap between rich and poor has widened, and it continues to widen.</P>
      <P>The ranks of those living in poverty will continue to swell as a result of these social welfare provisions. The drastic cut in community employment schemes has severely impacted on local communities and services provided to those most marginalised in the community. The less well-off are bearing the brunt of the Government's ineptitude, leading to an extension of poverty and an increase in dissatisfaction and hopelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a lack of understanding of the levels of poverty and a failure to tackle the social ills and profound inequality that are endemic in our country. Some parents are compelled to forgo meat and eat only bread so that their children might eat decently. Among the elderly, the lack of fuel and health supplements leads to the premature deaths of more than 2,300 people <Col N="1062" />annually. Homelessness is still a fact of life, and death, for our elderly. One has only to walk in the vicinity of this House to see the reality of this &ndash; people are sleeping in almost every doorway around here. Of the estimated 5,800 homeless people, approximately 20% have mental illness or other emotional disabilities. Many of these people aimlessly wander the streets. They are at once unwanted and uncared for, and the State shows a crass indifference to their plight. That this should happen here is a damning indictment of the Government and successive Administrations. Does a caring, sharing, compassionate State care for this constituency? I think not, nor did I note any reference to them in last week's budget, for which the protection of the weaker sections of the community was a supposed aim.</P>
    <P>I welcome the &euro;28 per week increase in the family income supplement as it goes some way towards alleviating the circumstances of the poor and those on the margins. An anomaly appears to exist between self-employed and PAYE workers on identical incomes. One of them is entitled to the supplement while the other is not. Perhaps accountants are more creative for the self-employed. The Government failed to grasp the nettle of alleviating poverty. The suggestion that it was protecting the weaker sections of society is a sick joke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go into the details of the Bill, it is important that we again closely examine the whole ethos of welfare in our society. It is essential that we reflect on the real issue affecting people's lives and the urgent need to assist our people, whether they are pensioners, widows or families requiring family income supplement. This Bill should be about a caring and just society. It should also be about equality, particularly in a wealthy country like this. There is no excuse to leave people behind or on the fringes of society. This Bill is a missed opportunity to take the final steps to bring social justice to our people. The budget and this Bill should have been about everybody having a right to a place they can call home. We have a long way to go before we see social exclusion being tackled effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at what is happening today in Ireland. I accept that this is a wealthy economy with many people in employment and it is something we should celebrate. However, we must also look at the negative side. Ireland is no longer a poor country and its <i>per capita</i> income is now one of the highest in the EU, yet Ireland's infrastructure and social provision are far below the EU average. Our growing poverty rates, unequal income distribution, the growing rich-poor gap and the under-equipped health and education systems represents the most visible signs of the extensive gaps in social provision. The insufficient supply of social housing and the huge problems <Col N="1063" />in public transport impact on poor people every day. In the context of continued economic growth and <i>per capita</i> income well above the EU average, the opportunity to address these deficits remains available, yet the Government has chosen not to avail of it.</P>
    <P>I strongly challenge the Government on these issues. There was potential in this budget to raise &euro;1.25 billion and distribute it to the most needy in our society. Adult social welfare rates could have been further increased. The Minister could have met her own targets on child poverty. She could have made a real attempt to tackle the social housing waiting list. She could have addressed the community employment issues and the related problems faced by local communities as services are reduced. She could have tackled the disability issue and given greater support to carers. The Minister could have addressed the issue of long-term unemployment in a more effective manner. We could also have brought ODA towards the Government and UN target of 0.7% of GNP.</P>
    <P>When dealing with social welfare, we must look at the needs of our people and look deeply at the nightmare endured by a section of our population. There are 1,382 persons with intellectual disabilities on waiting lists, of which 621 are seeking day care places and 823 are awaiting respite care. In this budget, they got an additional &euro;25 million, but NAMHI and the families involved had looked for &euro;35 million. The provision is &euro;10 million short &ndash; it should be noted that Punchestown received &euro;15 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have made a radical step and given an extra &euro;150 million to full-time carers who are already saving the State &euro;1.6 billion in institutional care costs. The Minister could have tackled the child poverty issue. I wish to deal with the issue of child benefit. According to some members of the Cabinet, we have a pro-family and pro-child Government, even though child benefit increased by only 21 cent per day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not 2 cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could have opted for a radical approach involving &euro;24.30 per month, which would have dealt with the problem. This is the Government which is talks about stem cell research and the rights of children, yet it gave an increase of 21 cent per day. The Government could have done something about building 7,000 social housing units. These are the issues we need to examine. Teachers on the front line in disadvantaged areas sought an additional &euro;20 million, which would be a small figure in overall budgetary terms, to tackle social disadvantage and neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the core issues we should address in the Bill and the budget in general. I challenge <Col N="1064" />those who say the gap has not widened to look at the reality. In 2003, a single, long-term unemployed person is &euro;50.08 better off than in 1997. However, a person earning &euro;50,000 per year is &euro;330.08 better off. Therefore, I rest my case on the issue of the widening gap.</P>
    <P>Some of the announcements are a bit over the top, such as the &euro;630 million social welfare package, given that there are cuts in community employment schemes, high rates of homelessness, increasing numbers on social housing lists and an increase in child benefit of only 21 cent per day. A recent poll in Dublin showed that 59% of the population blames the Government for the homelessness problem. Therefore, the Minister should not get carried away. She is not in the happy-clappy club yet.</P>

Tá sé beagnach dochreidte go bhfuil breis agus &euro;11 billiún le híoc sa chóras an bhliain seo chugainn agus go bhfuil timpeall &euro;630 milliún sa bhreis seachas an méid atá á chaitheamh i mbliana á íoc. Tá beagnach dhá thrian den méid airgid atá á chaitheamh ag an Rialtas i mbliana sa chóras leasa shóisialaigh.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for providing generous increases in various pensions. In general, the rates of these increases are three or four times the projected rate of inflation. An allowance of &euro;200 for the contributory old age pension by 2007 is now a realistic goal. By contrast, if we were still experiencing the kinds of increases introduced by the rainbow Government in 1996, we would not even hit the &euro;100 mark by 2007.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on social welfare has doubled since 1996. More significantly, the number suffering from consistent poverty has dropped from 8.2% in 1998 to 5.2% in 2001 according to ESRI figures. I know some members of the Opposition have been critical of this provision but it is a constant, independently measured and acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now expending more than &euro;11 billion on social welfare, about &euro;10 billion on health and almost &euro;7 billion on education. It is clearly of <Col N="1065" />paramount importance that the economy is run sensitively and imaginatively, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has been doing for some years.</P>
    <P>Any return to the tax and spend regime that brought this country to its knees in the 1980s under Fine Gael and the Labour Party would be disastrous. The main sufferers would be the weakest and poorest who depend on social welfare payments. We would quickly see many of the 1.8 million who are employed losing their jobs and returning to dependency. As a result, a considerably larger number of dependants would place an even greater burden on those at work. A vicious circle would begin and we would find ourselves back in trouble very quickly.</P>
    <P>To be fair, it is also reasonable to remind ourselves that the Department of Social and Family Affairs provides for more than payments. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service and other centres that have been set up make a valuable contribution to people who have difficulties with budgeting. Many of us, if we were not familiar with the service, would be of the opinion that most of its beneficiaries were on low incomes. However, people across a range of incomes depend on it. I recently had the opportunity to visit the new office opened in Ennis and hear of the wonderful work done by its excellent staff. I commend them and ClareCare for the positive role they have played. Moreover, I commend the professionalism of the Minister's staff on the Kilrush Road in Ennis who contribute handsomely to the effective money advice and budgeting service. In County Clare the service is mainly run in Ennis and Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Minister also contributes to various family studies and has had a series of meetings to establish how Irish families have evolved and what needs to be addressed as a result. This is a hugely important area. The Ceifin Institute in County Clare is working in this area in co-operation with the Minister and her Department. It is doing interesting, worthwhile and important work.</P>
    <P>One important scheme that has come to our notice in recent days is the farm assist scheme. I was delighted to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announce the new places on CE schemes in this regard. When one includes the additional budget of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this area and the CE scheme places provided under the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, it seems that considerably more than 25,000 places are provided for. This is welcome news.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" />One also tends to overlook the huge importance of the family income supplement. It has played an important role in enabling people to remain in employment and enabling others to take it up. The increase of &euro;28 in respect of the thresholds has been lauded by a Member on the Opposition benches and it is significant. The rate, at &euro;584, is considerably higher than most would have expected. Equally important is the raising of the minimum payment from &euro;13 per week to &euro;20 per week.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for her willingness to do her job properly and for being prepared to undertake a reform of the social welfare code. I am astounded that some experienced and normally responsible members of the Opposition are reduced to being apologists for cheats and those who abuse the system. I welcome the Minister's initiative and applaud her for taking on fraud and sharp practice and for weeding out anomalies in the system.</P>
    <P>The amendment to link unemployment benefit and disability benefit provisions by doubling the existing 13 week period provided for in section 8 of the 1997 Act is a considerable advantage for genuine claimants. The payment of increases from January rather than July or September is hugely advantageous for pensioners and other social welfare recipients. This represents a real cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of weeks of paid social insurance contributions from 39 to 52 addresses a practice that has grown up in certain places of employment, mainly to the detriment of employees. I hope this change will encourage certain employers to recognise that there are 52 weeks in a year. In any event, the genuine cases will be dealt with by unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance. It needs to be said that supplementary welfare allowance provides, in all cases, an important safety net and one about which people have no difficulty finding out.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined in her speech the <i>modus operandi </i>for the revised rent supplement. It is clear that it does not affect those on local authority waiting lists, even if they are waiting for less than six months, those who are homeless as defined in the housing Acts, recipients of rent supplement or those who are tenants for six months.</P>
    <P>Despite these facts, some members of the Opposition manage to terrify many who depend on social welfare and pensions. The soundbites suggest to elderly people the demise of almost every pension and every scheme. Some of us have taken pleasure in putting the record straight and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and its many initiatives. It provides for the introduction of a range of social welfare improvements <Col N="1067" />announced in the budget. Despite increasing pressures on the national economy, the Government has delivered budget increases to those who are vulnerable, less well off or disadvantaged, benefiting an estimated 970,000 who will claim a weekly social welfare payment. These funds will benefit approximately 1.5 million people, including dependants, or about four out of every ten people in the State. Recent statements by Opposition parties have claimed that the Government has introduced social welfare cutbacks. Clearly the Opposition is intent on ignoring the facts.</P>
      <P>A sum of &euro;11.3 billion will be devoted to social welfare expenditure in 2004. The social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost &euro;630 million in a full year, a massive increase of &euro;100 million on last year. This means that social welfare expenditure in 2004 will be almost two and a half times the level set by Labour and Fine Gael when last in Government.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil returned to Government those on disability benefit received &euro;85.73 a week, representing an increase of a &euro;3.81 over the whole term of Government of the rainbow coalition. That now stands at &euro;134.80, representing an increase of &euro;49.07 since 1997. This budget sees an additional &euro;25 million allocated to support persons with intellectual, physical or sensory disability, on top of the Estimates allocation of &euro;10 billion. The Government has taken action to ensure that people with disabilities have a dignified standard of living. Rather than talking and making speeches we are doing something about it.</P>
      <P>The Government acknowledges the full measured contribution of older people to society in general and it is fully committed to improving all aspects of their lives by focusing on issues that affect their well-being. Fianna Fáil has always prioritised the needs of the elderly and it is our mandate to guarantee a decent quality of life for all our people, especially the elderly who built our country.</P>
      <P>The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil is that the rate of the old age contributory pension will now stand at &euro;167.30 per week. This is an increase on the &euro;99 per week which was the payable rate on the day the champions of social justice in Fine Gael and Labour left office. The increases in pensions this year are real and are well ahead of inflation. Our critics on the Opposition benches should explain why, when they were last in office, old age pension increases were below the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority Fianna Fáil has attached to child benefit means that following this budget child benefit will be payable at a rate of &euro;131.60 for the first and second child, and &euro;165.30 for the third child and subsequent children. This means that the rate of child benefit payment has increased by almost 350%. These increases mean that in <Col N="1068" />our period of office we have more than trebled the payment rates of child benefit. It is a record that the Opposition cannot compete with. It was interesting when Opposition parties reduced the amount to 21 cent a day as I thought they might try to reduce it to an amount per hour.</P>

      <P>Let there be no mistake, it is Fianna Fáil policy that has brought about this change. Unprecedented increases in child benefit since we returned to Government in 1997 have played a significant role in the reduction of child poverty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition conveniently ignores the reality that due to the fact that Ireland has the lowest tax rate in the EU we have an unemployment rate that is half the EU average. There is no doubt that the best way to alleviate poverty is through employment. Increased taxes will lead to increased unemployment, increased poverty and an increase in the demand for social welfare payments, with less Exchequer money to pay for it.</P>
      <P>The Opposition does not allow for the fact that social welfare expenditure has increased, despite the fall in unemployment. The unemployment rate has halved from over 10% in 1997 to under 5% today, yet we have increased expenditure on social welfare by over &euro;4 billion since 1997 to &euro;11.3 billion today.</P>
      <P>The Government has also acted positively to help those on lower pay. The minimum wage has been introduced and will increase by 10% next year. The number of low-paid workers removed from the tax net has increased and in 2004 an extra 41,000 people will be taken out of the tax net. This means that 35% of all those on the tax records will pay no tax.</P>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy unit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs has issued guidelines, the NAPS guidelines, which are to be used by Departments for poverty proofing policy proposals. The primary aim of the poverty proofing process is to identify the impact of the policy proposal on the poor so that this can be given proper consideration in designing policy.</P>
      <P>The social welfare measures in the budget will accrue mostly to those at the lower end of income distribution who, without such measures, would experience a significant deterioration in their income in relative terms. The most significant net income gains are to those on the lowest incomes, while much smaller gains accrue to those in middle to high income brackets. The budget is highly progressive and sees those dependent on welfare getting the greatest gains and ensures that the lowest income groups gain progressively more from welfare payments than the higher income groups, who contribute progressively more to the cost of public service provision. The overall distributional effect is similar to that of the last budget but is greater in impact.</P>
      <P>It is not just the Government which recognises this fact. Cliff Taylor, the economics editor of <i>The Irish Times </i>wrote of the budget:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combination of the tax and welfare measures means the gains from budget 2004 are firmly focused on the poorer sections of society. An analysis in the budget documents, using an ESRI model of the economy, shows that the poorest 30% of the population will receive increases in disposable income of <Col N="1070" />between 5.7 and 7%. Meanwhile, the top 30% will gain by between 0.4 and 0.9%.</P>
    <P>The social aspect of the budget is undeniable. The withering comments about the Government's neglect of the poor in Ireland are simply not true. One just has to look at the improvements in social welfare payments and our efforts to tackle poverty. Old age pensions have increased by well over two thirds and child benefit is up by almost 350%. Despite increasing pressure on the national economy, the Government has delivered budget increases to the vulnerable and disadvantaged in society. The Opposition will have a difficult time creating scurrilous and disingenuous claims about this budget, though I am sure they will do their best.</P>
    <P>This is the first of two instalments of the Social Welfare Bill and it builds on the unprecedented record of the Government in the area of social inclusion and reinstates the fact that the Fianna Fáil-led Government is the most left of centre that this country has ever seen. It supports the most vulnerable in society and ensures that those who rely on social welfare continue to be fully supported by the Government.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">

    </Speaker>
    <P>Our job is to criticise but I will be positive. I welcome the social welfare increases announced in the budget but they were needed because of inflation. Deputy Killeen referred to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which is an important organisation, and I am glad it has received an increased budget. The service will be necessary in future. As I travelled to the House today, I listened to &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; and heard about the case of a poor woman in Bray who was being evicted by her local authority. I was annoyed not because she had failed to pay her rent but because she was given a bill for &euro;9,000, which, <Col N="1071" />when it was checked, should have been for less than half that amount. It was interesting that other people pledged to pay the bill through Joe Duffy's programme. People are willing to ensure the less well off are helped, and that is an important characteristic that the Government should recognise. When the Government acts responsibly towards the poor, it will get a response.</P>
    <P>The horsey set and the jet set believe poor people should not get anything and that it is more important to provide &euro;15 million for the Punchestown event centre. They do not need to fill forms, unlike social welfare recipients who are forced to keep everything in check. However, what happened on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; earlier must be acknowledged. There was such an outcry among the public that a woman's debt was paid in full on her behalf. A member of the horsey set from the south contributed in no small way to the fund and a great deal of credit is due to him. He said everything was going well for him and he was prepared to ensure the woman would not be evicted. I do not justify for one second the non-payment of bills, but a common sense approach must be adopted when individuals experience difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution to the budget debate is impressive. She stated the social welfare package amounted to &euro;630 million and overall spending will increase to &euro;11.262 billion in 2004. She also highlighted the different categories she has helped, which I welcome. However, the CORI justice commission analysed the budget package differently. Its comment was: &ldquo;A little done, much more to do&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>CORI states there is a long way to go before social exclusion is tackled effectively. This independent group produced a report on the budget. Opposition Members are often accused when they make negative comments about the Government that they are being political and divisive, but 15 or 16 independent groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, have highlighted their disappointment about various issues that were not addressed in the budget.

      <P>According to the Schedule, which will be debated on Thursday and Friday, the first group to be helped is widowed people <Col N="1072" />and I welcome the increase for those aged over 66. It is difficult to understand how individuals who are suddenly widowed are expected to live on such an income. Will the Minister examine this issue in the context of the overall budget? All public representatives come across genuine hardship cases where young families are left behind when a father dies. The widow cannot stay in employment nor can she seek employment and she becomes dependent on social welfare. This is a different scenario to that of a single mother. A widow or widower has been part of a normal family with a mortgage and so on. Even after this brilliant budget, a widow is expected is to live on &euro;140.30 per week plus allowances for her children, which have not been increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I plead with the Minister to re-examine this issue and, if she cannot address it this year, she should make it a future priority. An increase is provided for those aged over 66 but they could take up the old age pension anyway. However, those who need help most when they are bereaved should be looked after.</P>
      <P>I welcome the special increase in the invalidity pension. The carer's allowance has also been increased by &euro;10 per week but few improvements have made been to the scheme to permit more people to provide necessary care. I can provide the Minister with a report which highlights the need in this area. Until yesterday, 64 of my constituents who had made representations to me were on a waiting list for subvention beds. They could not even get into nursing homes.</P>
      <P>A local councillor claimed, on a local radio programme, that he had dealt with the matter through the Minister of State, Deputy Callely &ndash; I am not sure whether he knows the Minister of State. However, it is a matter on which I have been working for some time. I feel sure the Ceann Comhairle has also been working on it behind the scenes. At last, it appears we have got some respite for the 64 people concerned. However, we need to improve the position of carers in so far as we can. While I appreciate the Minister may have a limited budget, this is one area which will pay dividends. The Minister would be well justified in going to Cabinet on the basis that if more is spent on carers, less will be needed for nursing home subvention and medical treatment generally. A person can be cared for at home at a much cheaper cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer again to the position of widowers. I believe the Minister has details of a case in which a widow, following the sudden death of her husband, was the carer for her in-laws. Before her bereavement, she had the benefit of her hus<Col N="1073" />band's income and a carer's allowance. Obviously, however, her husband's income died with him and she now receives a widow's pension. Although she could work outside the home, she is not allowed compensation for her caring duties at home. If the Minister checks the figures, it would not cost very much to rectify that situation. We succeeded in having it included in the report that the person concerned should get at least 50% of the allowance. I urge the Minister, independently of this Bill, to deal with that sector. Her officials will be in a position to clarify the position. I understand a mistake was made in respect of the relevant form 33, or whatever is the correct description.</P>

The Government guaranteed an additional 200,000 medical cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be appreciated, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the increase in family income supplement. However, there is a major anomaly in that a self-employed person cannot benefit from that. Every large town now has a huge supermarket on its outskirts. That is excellent because it facilitates the advice of the Tánaiste to shop around. However, as the Minister will be aware from her knowledge of the situation in County Donegal, small shopkeepers will suffer as a result of that. Many of them would like to live out their lives in those premises, giving a service to the locality, but that is not economically possible for them because if they remain they will not be eligible for income, whereas if they move out they will possibly qualify for non-contributory pension on reaching the age thres<Col N="1074" />hold. I urge the Minister to give further consideration to that matter.</P>
      <P>I will refrain, on this occasion, from asking the Minister once again to bring farmers into the system, having failed miserably on that issue for many years past. Those concerned still remain on the farm assist scheme. That is another issue. A number of transfers have taken place and that will result in savings to the Minister's Department. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has boasted that he will bring 2,500 people back to work. That should result in some savings on expenditure by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. There are only 8,000 who will ever quality for the farm assist scheme, out of the 20,000 on which the then farm organisation president and now Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, agreed with the Government at that time. Of that 8,000, approximately 2,500 will now be removed from the scheme, irrespective of whether that is what they want, presumably, and transferred to the new rural scheme. Perhaps the Minister will use the savings in her Department in that regard to rectify some of the problems which have been mentioned. Being the nice person she is, I know she will not ask me to say where the money should come from, but I have suggested where funds might be found to deal with some of the issues affecting widows and widowers, to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>The PRSI increase will obviously affect incomes. Some middle-income people will find the recent budget much more damaging than they had thought when it was hidden behind the smokescreen of decentralisation. I welcome the increase in the widow's grant and many other changes. However, there is one area which I simply cannot understand. I refer to the hype about the children's allowance, which almost convinced me to make different decisions a few years ago.</P>

      <P>The increases of &euro;10, or whatever, are important. However, the Minister is a member of a Government which is increasing stealth taxes almost daily. Further increases in refuse collection charges are on the way. Fortunately, due to the pressure which has been applied on the issue of local government funding, there have been three separate increases in support for local authorities in recent weeks. That will take care of the election year. However, bin charges are a major problem. We need a more structured system which will make some allowance for those in dire hardship. Monaghan County Council made an allocation of &euro;20,000, not all of which was issued. The situation is very serious for those on low incomes who may to have to pay for help with household tasks.</P>
      <P>In the case of pensioners under 70, the comparison between social welfare payments in 1977 and now should be set alongside a similar comparison of the cost of a television licence over the same period.

I urge the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to take account of the real problems of the real poor and ensure that some of those proposed cuts are not implemented. I believe she is easing back on them and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The back to work scheme was available for those who were 15 months on the dole. Last year, this was raised to five years. I welcome the U-turn made by the Minister in this example&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which affects over 1.5 million people and is important to all of them. The bill for the provision of social welfare benefits amounts to a minimum of &euro;11.2 billion. Most Members will agree that for those not involved in high finance, it is impossible to comprehend this figure and is better expressed as &ldquo;eleven thousand two hundred million euro&rdquo;. We have started to trot out the term &ldquo;billion&rdquo; as if it were simply a euro in our pockets.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Coughlan, on providing such a wide range of services from the allocated &euro;11 billion. Those who object to the changes she is making are suggesting that these services should never be examined or changed. Instead, they should continue on without change. I disagree with that approach. The services are so wide and varied and there are so many changes in society that it is essential they should be examined on an on-going basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crawford suggested that Members on this side of the House objected to criticisms of the Bill. I never heard any Member on this side criticising the Opposition's right to comment. What I did criticise was the hypocrisy on the other side of the House. I will give a few examples for the Opposition to compare&mdash;</P>

The Senator never explained what would happen to the other 10,500 people. There were complaints in the Chamber about the abuse of the scheme, with landlords raising rents every time extra money was made available. There were also complaints about landlords purchasing extra houses with the income earned from the scheme. There were abuses, in what is described as co-habiting, when the person was supposed to be living alone, yet had their partner living with them.</P>

      <P>I have battled to protect the rent subsidy scheme in the Southern Health Board area. In Cork, Fine Gael councillors were complaining about the figure given, not knowing what the national figure was. May Heaven help them if they had to deal with the national figure that the Minister has to deal with. It is pure hypocrisy when Fine Gael Party councillors take one stance in county council chambers, which the Minister then tries to cope with, and then they take a different stance here. That is one example of this hypocrisy that has been happening over years, not just the past few weeks. All the allegations are there on the record if they wish to check them.</P>

      <P>It is hypocritical for Members to argue on the one hand against the indigenous horsebreeding industry while arguing for a similar tax break for the film industry. I will back both tax incentives because they will create jobs.</P>
      <P>The best way we cut our social welfare needs was through the 400,000 extra people that are now working. I was one of those who had to leave these shores to find employment, so I appreciate more than most the need for good, solid, well-paid employment at home that we now have. This is the biggest change between the three years of the rainbow Government and this Government's last six years.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts recently dealt with the installation of submarine cables to cater for the telecommunications business. The Labour Party spokesperson questioned why the Government gave &euro;77 million to the project rather than leave it to the private sector. The Secretary General of the Department concerned explained that even one day's loss could cost jobs and upset the State's commercial base. These are the types of innovative steps I want the Government to take. This is why we are near full employment, have halved the unemployment figure and created a better atmosphere for business and industry. Though this was questioned by the Labour Party spokesperson and not the Fine Gael Party Member, it was the same carry-on that we have seen in the Chamber. This investment was made to ensure we had the basis for a solid commercial approach and solid business. Cheap shots should not be taken because of help given to any industry. While I do not know anybody involved in the bloodstock business, 25,000 people earn their living from it.</P>
      <P>In the same way that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, will spend &euro;11.2 billion helping people who need assistance, this and the previous Fianna Fáil-led Governments have taken every opportunity to foster employment opportunities, and long may we continue to be on this side of the House to do so. Opportunities were lost in the past. There are now 1.8 million people working here. People better qualified than I am have said the best way to give people respect etc. is to give them properly paid jobs. If the job is not well paid, we are taking steps to ensure the difference is made up through social welfare payments such as the family income supplement.</P>
      <P>We need to work to the targets we have set. The Minister must examine every scheme. Those who work in local government are aware of the issues. There is no point speaking out of one side of the mouth in a council chamber and speaking out of the opposite side here. We should work together to ensure the systems are there and the money is used to the best advantage by the most needy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" />I wish to refer to some of the points raised by Deputy Crawford. Refuse charges have nothing to do with social welfare apart from the cases of people who cannot afford to pay. I have had a major grievance about people in Dublin not having to pay for services until recently. Some years ago I led an all-party deputation from Cork City Council to meet the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith. A senior Department official pointed out to me that if we collected all the arrears of payments in Cork we would have another £500,000. I asked him whether he lived in Dublin and when he confirmed he did I told him he had some nerve. At that time we had imprisoned two people for non-payment of service charges. The official, who paid nothing in Dublin, was advising me to collect outstanding arrears. The Dublin city manager, John Fitzgerald, made the point that Dublin charges the lowest rate in the country. If everyone pays his or her fair share it will help us all.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been accused of misleading before the last general election. All the party manifestos made the same pitch to the electorate. While the media do not seem to understand it, the big difference at that election was that workers looked at their payslips and saw the difference in their income tax, old age pensioners looked at their pension books and could make the comparison with five years earlier and mothers looked at child benefit books and could see the trebling of benefit. This coloured people's judgment. While I do not hold myself up as a paragon of virtue, it had nothing to do with being told lies or mistruths. People saw the big difference in their pockets and payment books.</P>
    <P>This trend is continuing. We stand over the figures that exist for the reductions in income tax and increases in benefits paid pre-1997 and post-1997. When the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has completed her work in three and a half years' time, the people will look at where they stand and will be as supportive as they were in 2002. The way to encourage people to vote for us is by giving them a fair deal and making sure the less well off in particular are looked after.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned hypocrisy in the context of people preaching one thing and doing another. The greatest area of hypocrisy is the area of pensions. I hear people at local authority and national conferences talking about the pensions time bomb. Nobody could deal with it or had a solution. Everyone was willing to discuss it and all the economists in the country had their views on what should be done. However, nothing was done until the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, took what is probably the most courageous step by any Minister in this or the previous Government and put money aside that could have been spent to do what we were accused of &ndash; buying votes and favours. He put it <Col N="1081" />aside to ensure the future benefits of people now working their way through the system. I complimented the Minister on this previously and I do so again. The hypocrisy came when people said it should not be done even though they claimed to be very concerned about future pensions.</P>
    <P>There has been a level of hypocrisy about the pre-1953 contributions. I lobbied four or five previous Ministers to get recognition for these. I knew a very big proportion of these people were in the UK. Working in the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I was besieged to do something for our people many of whom are semi-destitute living in England. While some of them might have been seen as being better off, very few were well off. While we argued for recognition to be given to that sector, it was repeatedly denied until the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, gave recognition to pre-1953 contributions which are reckoned as three contributions for every two paid.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Whip, who has left the House, was sneering because the bill for this soared. This happened because nobody had enough interest to count how many of our people, whom we had driven out of the country, were still in Australia, the US or the UK. Some 50% of all claimants were abroad. The bill soared because proper figures did not exist to make a proper forecast at the outset. The hypocrisy comes in when we decide whether it was right to pay these people. Did we decide that because the bill was so high it was no longer social justice? Was it wrong to give them benefits for the time they had worked? Was it wrong to recognise that we had driven them out and they did not have a full pension? I believe we were right and I argued this with Ministers of all persuasions, but failed until this Minister was appointed. It is hypocritical to say we should look after these people and then criticise it when the bill becomes too large. The same happened with the redress scheme. However, sin scéal eile.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last general election a list was published by a Fine Gael Deputy who is not present. He claimed that &euro;22.5 billion had been squandered by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government on social welfare. This spoke volumes of his thinking about the poor people of the country. It showed exactly what he thought about the less well off. It showed an approach that I would not like to see pursued, nor do I believe it would be pursued by the vast majority in Fine Gael or any party in this House. Deputy Crawford said there is a willingness to help the less well off, and most people support the concept. Unfortunately, he immediately hopped from that to a reference to Punchestown, which did not help the case he was making.</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote too many comments, as I know Fine Gael was anxious to write the budget, but it turned out that party did not even <Col N="1082" />get the budget broadcast right. Ms Helen Johnson, the director of the Combat Poverty Agency, said the budget provisions were in line with the requests of the agency and that the increases were almost &euro;7 ahead of expected inflation. She said she was pleased with the budget. As someone at the coalface, she must be listened to. Her comments are most welcome.</P>
    <P>We were all inundated with pre-budget submissions. They are often cited in the House by Deputies who pick and choose among them depending on what suits the circumstances. It was impossible to marry the submissions as many were diametrically opposed. The opinions of IBEC and chambers of commerce obviously differed from those of Fr. Seán Healy of CORI. We should learn from the submissions as we do from our clinics. It was positive to hear from the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see confirmation of the central role of carers. When the Irish communities in Britain worked to produce a huge information programme, the pre-1953 scheme was made known to many more people. The Minister should ensure that the same happens with the family income supplement. Not everyone entitled to take advantage of it is aware of the scheme's existence. It now provides &euro;437 for a husband, wife and two children, which is very welcome. A further publicity campaign should be pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to know where to start on this debate. I am sorry the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is not in the Chamber. I acknowledge that she has been attentive to the debate. I genuinely feel sorry for the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, who is popular. She has been shamefully treated on this occasion by the Minister for Finance in terms of the social welfare allocation. While it might not be fair to say the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has taken advantage of a new Minister, it is certainly fair and correct to say he has imposed severe cuts on her Department's budget. I refer in particular to what have become known as the 16 cuts. The serious shortfall in her Department's allocation does not reflect on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. She will fight her corner over the next few years to reverse the cuts. No amount of bluster by the Minister for Finance who shouted down a reporter on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; can mask the fact that serious cutbacks have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to an answer to a parliamentary question, the savings being made through the cutbacks amount to &euro;55.8 million. The cut in the back to education allowance will save &euro;2.2 million and affect 1,200 people. The transition in the one-parent family allowance will net a saving of &euro;1.3 million and affect 350 people. The cut in minimum rent contribution will save &euro;3 million and affect 60,000 people. The exclusion from rent allowance of people who are working will save &euro;1 <Col N="1083" />million and affect 350 people. The ruling on no rent allowance for six months will save &euro;10.5 million and affect 4,000 people. The cut in crèche supplement will save &euro;2.3 million and affect 1,600 people. The cut in the money advice and budgeting service will save &euro;700,000 and affect 370 people. The cut in diet supplement allowance will save &euro;1 million and affect 13,500 people. The cuts in child dependant allowance, unemployment benefit and disability benefit will save &euro;10.4 million and affect 16,800 people. The cut in the unemployment benefit earnings threshold will save &euro;7.4 million and affect 10,300 people. A cut in half rate payments for one-parent and widows' allowances will save &euro;5.5 million and affect an average of 2,000 people per week. The changes to consideration criteria for disability and unemployment benefit will save &euro;2.5 million and affect an average of 400 people per week. The cut in unemployment benefit entitlements will save &euro;5.2 million and affect an average of 700 people per week. These are the facts of the 16 cuts.</P>
    <P>No matter what Deputy Dennehy says, these cutbacks represent the continued breaking of promises made during the general election. We will see whether the people remember this or not. It is a matter for the electorate. While I have never been one to prejudge what the electorate will think, in my office and on the street I hear from people who remember what the Government said.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to refer in this regard to the cuts in the community employment schemes and the effect of those on, for example, people with disabilities. There are people with disabilities who can live independent lives in their communities because they have a personal assistant who is on a community employment or FÁS scheme. In my Galway constituency, 15 such assistants are employed, of whom seven will no longer be able to continue on the community employment scheme at the end of the year as their three years will be up. That represents a serious cutback and a serious problem for the dependent person who finds himself or herself without a personal assistant. A person who was able to live independently in the community may now be forced into institutional care.</P>
    <P>The community employment embargo will also have a serious effect on the person who loses his or her job. It could affect two families. The effect could be long-term in that people may be forced to seek institutional care resulting in a far greater cost to the State. This is being done for the sake of the &euro;25 difference between the unemployment assistance rate and the community employment rate. Somebody in the Government should wake up and look at what is happening in our communities.</P>
    <P>Perhaps someone did see what was happening. There was a short-lived revolt led by the Minister <Col N="1084" />of State from my constituency, Deputy Fahey. He and 40 backbenchers signed a petition which asked the Minister for Finance not to make cutbacks in the community employment schemes. However, when the Labour Party tabled a motion on the subject last Tuesday, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, made a rambling and half-hearted withdrawal of his previous opposition. He went on to attack my constituency colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins. When he finished, the Government still had ten minutes left to speak, but there was not one backbencher to take it up. It had to be taken up by the Opposition. A warning must have been received as many Government backbenchers rambled into the House on Wednesday to contribute to the debate and to withdraw their previous opposition. They voted against the Labour Party motion and, in effect, for the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Had Deputy Dennehy not used the word &ldquo;hypocrite&rdquo; so often, I would not mention it. He protested too much. The Members who can be described as hypocrites are the ones who caved in last week. They were like chocolate soldiers coming to the House. As soon as the heat was turned up, they melted. If that is not hypocritical, I do not know what is. I was reminded of the character Tommy Owens in &ldquo;The Plough and the Stars&rdquo;. He said he would die for Ireland, but he never got the chance. Last week, the Government Deputies got a chance to vote on a motion and they elected to support the cuts. If that is hypocrisy, so be it.</P>
    <P>While there are pros and cons to rent supplement, people will face hardship as a result of the Government's cutbacks. Health boards can refuse a supplement to anybody not already renting for six months, unless they are homeless or there are compelling reasons to provide supplement. I ask the Minister to provide clarification of what these compelling reasons might be. Is the case of a parent and children fleeing a violent situation and seeking refuge a compelling reason? The normal procedure in this instance is that they must go to a refuge and identify a landlord who will accept rent receipts. The rent supplement must also be assessed through a community welfare officer in order for them to secure a tenure on their identified property. How do parents and children in such circumstances secure tenancy of a home for six months without a rent supplement? It is not hypocritical to ask that the procedure to be spelled out for us. We require a straight answer. Is the Minister suggesting that such a family remain in the refuge? I am sure that is not what she suggests but we would like clarification of the matter.</P>
    <P>Another example of the cutbacks is in education allowances. In Galway city, the back to education programme has been enormously successful with young mothers who avail of the back to education allowance and crèche facilities. The <Col N="1085" />cuts imposed mean that to qualify for the back to education allowance a claimant must be unemployed for 15 months rather than six months. A person pursuing education, at least, makes an effort to earn supplementary allowance. The supplement given to recipients on the social welfare allowance being supported by MABS will be discontinued. Will the Government force those families back into the black economy and into the clutches of moneylenders? Why does it propose to discontinue a programme which improved the standard of living for participants and their families and which might subsequently lead to full employment and full participation in society? What is the purpose of extending the length of time required to qualify for the allowance? Why not cherish the enthusiasm and willingness of the claimants instead of crushing them?</P>
    <P>People will live in poverty as a result of the cutbacks. Poverty is defined in the national anti-poverty strategy, adopted by the Government in April 1997, as follows:</P>
    <P>People are living in poverty if their income and resources, material, cultural and social, are so inadequate as to preclude them from having the same standard of living which is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally. As a result of inadequate income and resources, people may be excluded and marginalised from participating in activities which are considered the norm for other people in society.</P>
    <P>That definition was adopted by the Government in April 1997 but people are now being forced into that situation.</P>
    <P>It is important that people realise that those on social welfare do not wish to be in that position. They are not looking for hand-outs but are seeking support through a particularly tough time in their lives. Unemployment or disability may touch any of our lives at any time. People must be treated with due respect. There should be greater incentives for people to return to work rather than putting obstacles in their way. Currently, if people go back to work they lose all their secondary benefits, medical cards, fuel allowance, back to school allowance etc. People who go back to work on a temporary basis &ndash; for example, a man anxious to return to work after six months or a year might get a temporary job on a building for two or three months &ndash; lose their benefits when they return to work. Not only that but when the temporary work ends they are put through the rigours of a further assessment although the facts and figures are on the files. I cannot understand why there is such red tape, creating a disincentive for people to go back to work.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly I have come across is the regulation concerning the assessment of an applicant for maternity leave or benefit. The Department now requires the provision of the figures for the two previous years' taxable earnings. This <Col N="1086" />discriminates against women on maternity leave. In a normal family a woman of child bearing age might have a child every two years and would be out of work for a considerable length of time in that period. She would also do little overtime as she would want to spend as much time as possible with her child. Why can she not be assessed on her last full year's earnings? I ask the Minister to examine and correct that anomaly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford referred to another anomaly and I have raised the same issue at every budget debate for the past seven years. I wrote to the Minister, made submissions to the review group on carer's allowance and raised the matter through parliamentary questions. By coincidence, I tabled a question on carer's allowance the day before the budget which asked the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to explain her plans in the budget to facilitate full-time carer's who were in receipt of other social welfare payments so as to be eligible for the carer's allowance while continuing to be full-time carers. An freagra a fuair mé ón Aire, ná &ldquo;Caithfidh an Teachta fanacht go dtí tráthnóna amárach.&rdquo;  Bhí mé sásta leis an bhfreagra sin ag an am, ach tá mé fós ag fanacht.

      <P>I illustrated this issue to the Minister by raising the question of a particular case in my constituency, the circumstances of which I was aware. I am glad of the support I am now getting from other Deputies who have seen the same anomaly in their constituencies. A close neighbour of mine was minding the incontinent, bedridden relative of her husband in her house. She did not mind the work and dedicated herself to it 365 days a year. Unfortunately, her husband, a small farmer eligible for the carer's allowance, was killed in a traffic accident. This woman applied for the widow's pension which she got. She continued to care for her husband's relative for seven years but the day after she received the widow's pension the carer's allowance was taken from her. The man is now deceased so I cannot solve her problem but I hope I can do something about the problem for somebody else.</P>
      <P>Despite this woman continuing to care for that man 365 days a year, she lost the allowance. This may be boring for the Minister's officials because I have pointed this out at every budget debate for the past seven years. I have written to review groups and to the Minister. I wrote to the Minister on 10 October and I am still waiting for a reply. If I achieve nothing else here, I hope to achieve the correction of that anomaly.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dennehy spoke about hypocrisy, but he should have consulted Government backbenchers before doing so &ndash; perhaps he was not one <Col N="1087" />of the 40 who signed the motion for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, or one of the chocolate soldiers who came here and melted when the Minister said jump. The Minister was public enemy number one with those same people on Tuesday last, but at the announcement of the budget on Wednesday they were clapping and laughing because he promised that he would decentralise 10,000 people to their constituencies. It is not as if the people believe that rubbish anymore.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Dennehy think that the people do not remember the false promises that were made? Let him ask people in rural areas whether they believe 300 or 400 people will be decentralised to their towns within the next three or four years. Live horse and you will get grass, the people will not buy this sort of promise any more. Is it not hypocrisy to want to knife the Minister on Tuesday but to clap him and give him a standing ovation on Wednesday? That is what I call hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>There are many more anomalies in the budget which I would like to discuss. There are also good points in it. I am the first to recognise the &euro;10 a week increase in the carer's allowance and the increase in the old age pension. Those increases are good and welcome. However, I do not agree with Opposition Deputies who say that it is not our duty to come to the House to point out the anomalies in the budget. We should point out the anomalies in the social welfare system that allow the problems, such as those that other Deputies and I have outlined, to develop. It is our job as Opposition Members to make such statements.</P>
      <P>Certain Members have compared the statistics for 1997 with those for 2001, 2002 or 2003. The finances of the State were in good and proper order when the rainbow coalition left office. This led to the best five years of economic benefit the country has ever achieved. It is poppycock for Government Deputies to praise themselves because the social welfare system is better now than it was in 1997. It does not make sense.</P>
      <P>Despite the availability of resources, child benefit has been increased by less than half the level needed to keep pace with the commitments made in Sustaining Progress. It is hard to believe that the Government has not increased the child dependent allowance for the ninth year in a row.</P>

The means test for carer's allowance has not been abolished. Although I acknowledge that there has been a slight increase in the means test for the spouses of carers, it is nothing. It is fitting that I should conclude by speaking about those who have to stay at home 365 days a year, because I have spent a great deal of time speaking in the House about the great work done by carers. Those who care for another person in the home each day should be given the recognition they deserve. Will the Minister to re-examine this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important issue on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister for com<Col N="1092" />ing in at this late hour to respond, positively I hope. Ballybay Community College has been seeking an extension for at least ten years, and it was first announced as having got the go-ahead in 2000. It is the only VEC school in County Monaghan which has not had its needs recognised by the Government over many years.</P>
      <P>The extension is absolutely essential. In the early 1980s, the school was under pressure. The then Deputy, John F. Conlon, led a delegation to the Fine Gael Minister for Education, Deputy John Boland, who is now deceased. The Minister gave the school leaving certificate status, which was a major boost at the time. Today, it is academically the highest-achieving VEC school in County Monaghan, despite the fact that it is desperately overcrowded and dependent on prefabs. Were the building in private hands, would it be allowed to remain in business by the health and safety authorities? I do not think so. It is certainly not suitable for modern educational needs.</P>
      <P>In May 2002, before the general election, the main Government party, Fianna Fáil, announced that work on the extension would begin in the autumn of that year. The local Senator rang the school last spring to advise that it was on the list, but unfortunately he had not read exactly where it was on it. It was certainly of no benefit to its getting the go-ahead this year. Teachers and pupils in Ballybay Community College deserve sincere congratulations on how well they are doing, taking their difficulties into account. I hope there is no alternative agenda. A recent report condemned small schools, but Ballybay Community College proves that such schools, properly run, can do a great job.</P>
      <P>The new extension to Castleblaney College was opened by the Minister, Deputy Martin, in 2000. At that ceremony, the Minister clearly recognised the unsuitability of the structure across the road, where the national primary N2 roadway forms part of the campus, with 1,400 crossings made there each day. It is nothing short of a miracle that a serious incident has not happened. It was announced in the local papers just before the election in April 2002 that a &euro;2.6 million investment was to take place. Of course, that did not happen. The Department agreed a schedule in 2002 as a result of a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Woods, in 2001. He also recognised the serious situation of the school. The VEC met the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on 23 May 2003. He had meetings with a very active parents association and the board of management. He also recognised the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crossing is not the only problem. The building across the road was built in 1951 and its condition is serious. The windows are falling apart and damp is rising up through the floor. The land across the road, together with the adjacent land, is worth a great deal of money. I believe that it could provide funds towards building a <Col N="1093" />proper structure on the other side of the road with the main building. The Minister suggested, when he met the parents and others, that he would provide prefabs in the short-term to relieve the issue. However, when one looks at the site, as he did later, and sees how small it is one sees that one would have to put the prefabs on top of each other, and that is not an ideal situation. I urge that the two schools be funded as a matter of urgency in the interests of health and safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Ballybay Community College, Monaghan, and Castleblaney College, Dublin Road, Monaghan. Ballybay Community College has applied for the provision of additional accommodation to the school building. The Department has already accepted the need to provide additional accommodation for students at the school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a proposed building project for Ballybay Community College is listed under section 7 of the 2003 school building programme, which is published on the Department of Education and Science's website. The proposed project is at stage three of architectural planning, meaning that detailed plans and costs have been received. It has been assigned a band two rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. The Minister intends to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January 2004 at the latest. The programme will clarify what progress is planned for projects such as Ballybay Community College during 2004.</P>
      <P>Regarding Castleblaney College, Monaghan, the Department is currently examining the school's application for improved accommodation. It is planned to locate the entire school on the main campus by providing an extension of approximately 1,500 sq.m. of additional accommodation on the main campus, thus obviating the need for students to traverse the road. The matter of appointing a design team to advance the project will be considered in the context of framing the 2004 school building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending delivery of the additional accommodation at both schools, the overall safety of students remains the statutory responsibility of the school's management authority. Accordingly, the onus rests with it to explore all options and overcome potential dangers associated with operating a school campus on a split site. In particular, the school's authority might assess the extent to which the local authority and/or the National Roads Authority can assist the school with signage, traffic calming measures and so on. Additionally, the authority should examine the <Col N="1094" />timetabling position to minimise crossings. The local gardaí may also be able to assist the school with suggestions and proposals. I once again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the issue of Aghinagh National School, Macroom, County Cork, and the developments that the Department intends for it. In 1996, Department of Education and Science officials visited Aghinagh National School. At that time, they stated that the school was not suitable for refurbishment and that a new school should be built on the site. The Department first initiated proceedings, which have been ongoing for several years. The Department has purchased a site for the construction of a new school. At this stage, there is no indication from the Department whether it is proceeding with a new school or what it intends to do with Aghinagh National School on behalf of the pupils.</P>
      <P>The school's board of management is currently in a catch-22 situation. Pupils are not coming in because the school is in such a terrible condition and numbers are dropping. If a new school were provided for Aghinagh, I have no doubt that they would increase substantially. The two-teacher school is in extremely poor nick, having been built in 1912. One of the rooms is now divided by a partition. A flat roof room was added to the school by the parents some 15 years ago. The room is not insulated and further adds to the unsuitable conditions in Aghinagh national school. I urge the Minister to give us a clear indication of when the new school will proceed to construction stage since we understand it is currently at tender stage in the Department.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, in his call for a new school in Aghinagh. This national school was listed at number one in section 4 of the Department's 2003 school building programme. The board of management and parents of Aghinagh national school understood that it would be put to tender in 2003 and they are impatient about the delay. They have expressed annoyance that the project has not proceeded to construction in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conditions in the school are bad and the educational well-being of the children is compromised as a result. The question has been raised about the level of commitment to the school and I ask the Minister of State to outline the progress of the proposed programme for a new school <Col N="1095" />building and its current status on the Department's school building programme.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline the Department Education and Science's position in regard to the proposed new accommodation for Aghinagh national school, County Cork.</P>
      <P>The Department received an application from the board of management of the school requesting additional accommodation. Following an examination of the case architectural planning of the project commenced. The Aghinagh national school building project is listed in section 4 of the 2003 school building programme, which is published on the Department's website. It was planned that is project would be authorised to proceed to construction during 2003, subject to significant cost savings and a review of the enrolment levels later in the year.</P>
      <P>The school enrolment has declined significantly over the past number of years. Accordingly, the Department's schools inspector visited the school to ascertain the enrolment intake in September 2003. The enrolment at September 2003 had fallen to 25 pupils. Department officials recently wrote to the chairperson of the board of management of the school, requesting the board to contact the Department, with a view to arranging a meeting to decide on the best way forward for the school. The Department is awaiting a response from the chairperson.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science intends to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify what progress is planned for projects such as Aghinagh national school during 2004. I thank the Deputies for giving me this opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.</P>
      <P>Following last night's shocking revelations regarding the extent of Internet child abuse, I call on the Minister of State and his Department immediately to investigate this urgent matter with the involvement of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, &ldquo;Crime Against Children&rdquo; was deeply disturbing and is a wake-up call for parents, teachers, the Garda, public representatives and the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all who are concerned about child protection issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda must be given the resources immediately to investigate this possible Irish paedophile ring which is supplying horrific images of <Col N="1096" />child rape and torture in Internet chat rooms. What is most disturbing is that many of the child porn images are being traded by paedophiles who offer their own images in exchange for those of other paedophiles. To do this, they must create their own images and therefore involve themselves in very serious child sex abuse.</P>
    <P>While we know it is a criminal offence to download child pornography, can the Minister of State tell us whether it is a criminal offence to trade in child pornography? Children from all over the world, including Ireland, are being filmed and photographed while being abused for the gratification of a small number of dangerous individuals. Revealing the extent to which this behaviour is carried out in Ireland, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; identified 105 Irish paedophiles during a three month investigation. That is more than were charged under the Garda's Operation Amethyst, which deals with criminal activity in this area. Research indicates that approximately 20% of those who download Internet child pornography also abuse children outside the Internet. This reinforces the argument for strengthening our resources to tackle the problem of Internet child pornography. I call on the Minister of State to inform the House what resources have been put in place to tackle this horrific abuse of innocent children. How many gardaí are employed in the sexual assault unit and how many of those are dedicated to tackling Internet child pornography? How many Irish paedophile rings which trade in pornographic images on the Internet have been discovered and have any successful prosecutions been brought?</P>
    <P>Protecting our children must be a priority and we must also look at the wider issues which are related to sexual and physical abuse of children on the Internet. International studies have demonstrated the far-reaching effects of child sexual abuse. It is a horrific crime which destroys a person's life. People who have been abused in this manner suffer very low self-esteem, are very often suicidal, suffer from chronic depression, have difficulty maintaining relationships and their life opportunities have been totally destroyed because of the experience of their abuse. In some cases, victims can go on to be offenders later in life. The area of child offences has not been properly tackled in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The sex offenders register is growing four times faster than that in the UK. There are now up to 500 people on the Irish register and it is growing by approximately 20 people per month. The figures clearly indicate that significant numbers of people represent a real on-going risk to children. Society is obliged to ensure that all possible safeguards are introduced to protect children. Last night's programme demonstrates that we are not doing this in a proper fashion and it shows either a lack of resources or a lack of will to tackle the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am deputising tonight for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is aware of last night's television programme and shares the concerns which have been expressed by the Deputy about this type of crime. This is an issue of concern, not just to the Government, but to all of us who are parents and right-thinking people.</P>
      <P>In October 2002, the Garda Commissioner established the paedophile investigation unit which is located within the domestic violence and sexual assault unit based at the national bureau of criminal investigation in Harcourt Square. This specialised unit is charged with investigating and co-ordinating cases relating to alleged child abuse and the possession, distribution and production of child pornography. It investigates allegations brought to its attention by Interpol, Europol, external police forces and through the Internet advisory board hotline, as well as reports from concerned members of the public. The unit is also proactive in monitoring Internet chatrooms and strives to maintain best practice in the investigation of child pornography with an emphasis on Internet investigations.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the unit has approximately 40 cases on hand at present. The Garda will fully investigate the allegations outlined in last evening's programme. However, other than a small number of successfully prosecuted cases, there is no evidence currently available to the paedophile investigation unit that pornographic material is being made in Ireland to facilitate trading.</P>
      <P>The domestic violence and sexual assault unit, which was established in 1993, continues to act as a resource to investigating gardaí throughout the State in the investigation of sexual crimes. Even prior to its establishment, members of the dedicated paedophile investigation unit had already developed considerable experience and expertise in all aspects of paedophile activity and Internet crime.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I am satisfied that the Commissioner keeps all aspects of Garda operations and resource requirements under constant review and responds to developments in criminal activity in deploying his resources. The Garda Síochána has been involved in a number of international criminal investigations into paedophile activity. These cases have also involved the police forces of Germany, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and the USA. As Internet paedophile crime is a global issue, it can only be tackled effectively through close international police co-operation on intelligence and investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interpol, based in Lyon, France, is working together with Europol, based in the Hague, to <Col N="1098" />develop a child pornography database, containing all seized child abuse images world-wide. This will assist national police forces in the identification of victims of paedophile activity and minimise duplication of effort on criminal investigations internationally. The Garda Síochána plays an active role in the working groups of these organisations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned Operation Amethyst. On 27 May 2002, the Garda carried out a co-ordinated search of over 100 houses and premises for breaches of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. The information originated in Texas and was supplied by the Dallas police and the US postal service, via Interpol, to Ireland. Images of child abuse were seized, and a number of people were charged and convicted of possession of the images. A total of 124 persons were charged with possession of child pornography offences in 2002 and a number are still before the courts.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has called for the strengthening of our current legislation. However, I must point out that the penalty structure in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is recognised internationally as one of the most severe, if not the most severe, in any jurisdiction. Section 6 of the Act provides for a maximum penalty on summary conviction for knowingly possessing child pornography of a fine not exceeding &euro;1,904 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both. If charges are brought on indictment, a convicted person can be subject to a fine not exceeding &euro;6,348 or imprisonment for up to five years or both. Section 5 contains even stronger measures in that it makes it an offence, <i>inter alia,</i> to knowingly produce, distribute, print, publish, import, export, sell or show child pornography. A person found guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,904 or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or both. Again, if convicted on indictment, the penalties are even more severe in that the offender may be subject to an unlimited fine or to imprisonment for up to 14 years or both. Furthermore, a person who, having the custody, charge or care of a child, allows that child to be used for the production of child pornography commits an offence which can only be dealt with by way of indictment, with the offender being subject to a fine not exceeding &euro;31,743 or to imprisonment for up to 14 years or both.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the Act is generally held up as model legislation and in practice is deemed to be working well. Nevertheless, if any weaknesses are identified in the legislation, the Minister is willing to examine it with a view to further strengthening the provisions.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a growing recognition that in the investigation of child pornography images, not only must evidence be gathered for <Col N="1099" />the prosecution of the perpetrator but we must also work towards the identification, rescue and rehabilitation of the victims. This is obviously of vital importance as it facilitates the rescue of the child victim, and potential future victims, from further abuse.</P>
    <P>I note the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has properly reminded parents to exercise extreme vigilance concerning their children's use of the Internet. While this type of reprehensible crime did not begin with the Internet, there is no doubt that the new technology, with its ease of communication and perceived anonymity of users, is both a tool that facilitates the rapid dissemination of child abuse images and a mutual support structure that allows paedophiles and other criminals to pool infor<Col N="1100" />mation to avoid discovery, providing in effect new ways to commit old crimes.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined, in this jurisdiction there are robust measures at the disposal of the Garda and the criminal justice system to deal with those involved in such activities. However, we must recognise that combating these crimes on-line is a more complex issue, involving multiple jurisdictions and differing legal systems, which requires international police co-operation to constantly identify and develop mutual best practice, together with co-operation from all members of society in reporting our suspicions or knowledge to the Garda to assist it in combating this type of evil activity.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 December 2003.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The configuration of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment brings together, in a single Department, one that has promoting quality jobs at its core. This recognises that enterprise and employment are not competing factors but rather complementary. Only by growing our competitiveness, by increasing our trade performance and by expanding enterprise performance can we produce sustainable high quality jobs. Similarly, only by ensuring that we have a well trained and confident workforce can enterprise flourish.</P>
      <P>Calls for alternative configurations, such as advocated by the president of SIPTU, appear to stem from a failed paradigm that places jobs and welfare at work in competition with enterprise. Such a view leads to the development of zero-sum policies where the political champions of one perspective are pitted against those of the other. We have a different and more positive view &ndash; one that seeks to grow the quality and number of jobs by growing trade and enterprise. We seek policies that recognise the globalised nature of this modern economy. We seek win-win strategies.</P>
      <P>Moving away from political philosophy, it is instructive to look at our track record. Since 1993 when the new configuration commenced we have seen jobs and real wages growing at an unprecedented nature, we have introduced the national minimum wage and seen a significant improvement in the legislative framework protecting workers. The welfare of workers, especially those most exposed to low incomes, has been transformed during this period. However, this has also helped sustain, and be sustained by, a parallel and unprecedented improvement in trade and enterprise performance. The evidence is inescapable.</P>
      <P>While the factors supporting this transformation are manifold, and social partnership clearly played its part, I believe that our pro-enterprise and pro-jobs policies have made a real difference. Following the last election, the Government affirmed its conviction that the current configuration of my Department is right for Ireland. I strongly oppose any rowing back on this wining strategy.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent findings of IBEC's national survey of business costs and I am concerned about the effect of high insurance costs on business. The insurance reform programme announced on 25 October 2002 comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. Reductions have already occurred in the cost of insurance and further reductions are expected. It was particularly noteworthy that the CES cited lower insurance costs as a significant factor in the recent sharp reduction in the consumer price index. The key measures in the reform programme include: <Col N="1105" />implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe. To date 32 of the recommendations have been fully implemented, three have been partially implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003 was published on 18 November 2003 and is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is hoped to enact the legislation by year-end. This Bill will, when enacted, provide for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory footing; and an undertaking by my Department and the Competition Authority of a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</P>
      <P>I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law in personal injury claims.</P>
      <P>The insurance reform programme arose primarily as a result of the deliberations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. Many of the features mentioned above, which have the positive effect of reducing the cost of motor injury claims, apply equally to the cost of public liability and employers liability claims, in particular measures to tackle exaggerated claims as reflected in the Civil Liability and Courts Bill, and reductions in the cost of the delivery of settling claims which will be achieved by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</P>

      <P>The Government decided to proceed <Col N="1106" />with the ban on smoking in the workplace by way of regulations by the Minister for Health and Children, under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002. The Government also decided, on legal advice, that it is not necessary to ban smoking in the workplace under Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 as well as under the Public Health Act 2002.</P>
      <P>Legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General indicated that the Health and Safety Act 1989 or regulations made under it may not encompass the banning of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace on the grounds that environmental tobacco smoke could be considered ancillary to workplace activities. To remove this legal uncertainty it has been decided that an adjustment by means of primary legislation is required. In this regard, a review of the Health and Safety Act 1989 is currently at an advanced stage and is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The proposed Bill will provide a vehicle for such amendments as are necessary to remove any legal uncertainties.</P>
      <P>On enactment of the Bill, it will be a matter for further consideration as to the necessity for regulations under health and safety legislation to specifically ban environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace so as to complement those regulations already made under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002.</P>

      <Quest> when she intends to change the currently inequitable work permit system to a system whereby the worker would hold the work permit and would be able to change employer. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently, the work permit system grants the permit to an employer to recruit a specific employee to fill a specific vacancy where the employer has been unable to find a suitable employee within Ireland or the wider European economic area. This arrangement does have the safeguard that the non-EEA employee in question is coming to fill a specific vacancy, an important factor when most of the personnel in question are at the lower end of the skills spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, work permit personnel have been readily facilitated in changing jobs and in such circumstances a new work permit is issued to an eligible employer. This flexibility has being possible and warranted by the relatively high number of vacancies arising in recent years. If we were to move to a situation where a work permit was given to the individual employee, we would, in effect, be giving on authorisation to come to Ireland in search of an employer. Such a system is not impossible but it does give rise to a number of serious policy questions and does raise very significant resource issues. Any informed decision <Col N="1107" />to move to a new system should take into account to whom would permits be issued; in respect of what skills; how many per year; would we give quotas to other countries if requested; if so, to which countries; for how long might a person seek a job; what would be done if a person did not find a job within the period allowed; would families of the work permit holder be permitted to travel immediately, if so, who would be responsible for their support in Ireland; and, what impact, if any, would such a programme have on the housing market, particularly at the lower end of the rented private sector.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has had to put in place very significant resources in recent years to give detailed consideration to applications from 10,000-12,000 asylum seekers per year. Given the likely level of demand for employment permits from aspiring employees, the question arises as to whether the State would be prepared to devote an equivalent amount of resources to detailed assessment of employment permit applications from a similar or even greater number of applicants.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that, after EU enlargement, on 1 May 2004, the greater portion of our overseas personnel needs will be met from within the EU, thus obviating the need for a work permit.</P>

      <P>Regional development is a significant focus of Government policy and its importance has been confirmed in the national development plan and the national spatial strategy, NSS. The latter strategy addresses the ongoing concentration of population and economic activity along the eastern seaboard, especially in the greater Dublin area, with a view to achieving balanced regional development throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The objective of the State development agencies has been to encourage the design of a strategy that will enable as many areas as possible to share in balanced regional development. The State development agencies will work to ensure that key centres under the NSS play a critical role in the promotion of balanced regional development. However, the effectiveness of their strategies will be strongly influenced by a supportive business environment in the regions. Ireland competes with many other countries for new projects and the relative attractiveness of regional locations in Ireland to another is often the deciding factor on location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" />The south-east region has been successful in attracting a number of modern industries such as Genzyme in Waterford, Alza/Johnson &amp; Johnson in Cashel, PFPC in Wexford and Deutsche Bank in Kilkenny. In addition to these new substantial investments, there have been a number of notable expansions in the region from companies such as Guidant, Clonmel, AOL and Sunlife, Waterford, and Lake Region, New Ross.</P>
    <P>Within the region, some areas such as Wexford have not fared as well as others in enterprise development. To help redress the jobs situation in Wexford, Enterprise Ireland and Wexford County Enterprise Board have provided significant funding for an extension to the community enterprise centre at the Kerlogue Industrial Estate, Wexford. The IDA is also developing a 70 acre business and technology park in Carlow. The main focus in south Tipperary is Tipperary town and the upgrading of its business park.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the combined efforts of the State development agencies and the ongoing commitment of the Government to regional development, including the recently announced decentralisation programme, should facilitate the economic development of the south-east region.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for my Department for 2004 represents an overall increase of 3% over 2003. I am confident that this allocation clearly underlines the Government's commitment to continuing economic growth, maintaining the competitiveness of Irish industry, providing more high quality employment and ultimately to building a better and fairer society in the interests of all citizens.</P>
      <P>My Department's overall Estimate clearly reflects the new and increasing emphasis on support for research and innovation, areas which are crucial to driving Ireland's future economic progress and fundamental to providing sustainable, high quality, well paid jobs in the longer term.</P>
      <P>Overall spending on science and technology will increase by 36% over 2003 levels. The bulk of this will go to Science Foundation Ireland to fund its ambitious research programme while Enterprise Ireland will also see a significant increase in the moneys available to it to support innovation and research and development within indigenous industry. Funding to promote greater awareness of science, particularly among young people, is also being increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exchequer funding for FÁS training and employment programmes will be augmented by an increased allocation of moneys from the national training fund. Overall the FÁS budget will increase by 2.7%. This level of investment <Col N="1109" />means that the combined participation levels on community employment, jobs initiative and social economy programmes will be maintained at end 2003 levels and no further reductions in numbers are envisaged in 2004. Funding for FÁS training and integration programmes will increase by 3.8% in 2004.</P>
    <P>My Department's Estimate also provides funding to facilitate the establishment on a statutory basis of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board which will be up and running early in 2004. Once fully operational, the PIAB will be funded on an ongoing basis by fees levied on respondents and it is the intention that exchequer funding will not be required beyond 2004.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which reported in June 1996, recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of this recommendation with changes in the law on defamation, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform requested in September 2002 a legal advisory group to advise him on the issues involved in the reform of the law on defamation and related matters. This group recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that a statutory press council be established whose functions would include the preparation of a press code of conduct and the investigation of complaints regarding alleged breaches of the code.</P>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently involved in a consultation process on the report of the legal advisory group. On 1 December 2003 a major conference on the report was hosted by the Minister. When this consultation process is complete the Minister will bring proposals to Government on this matter.</P>

      <P>The national framework committee for work-life balance policies was established under the PPF and continued under the national agreement Sustaining Progress with a remit to support and facilitate the development of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise through the development of a package of practical measures that can be applied. One of the tasks of the committee is to examine how best to improve access to family-friendly working arrangements in order to realise the potential benefits that these arrangements would offer from both an equality and competitiveness perspective. The committee comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and Departments, and is chaired by my Department.</P>
      <P>The research report Off the Treadmill was commissioned by the national framework committee to gather information on the types of family-friendly policies in organisations, the level of availability and take-up of family-friendly working arrangements in workplaces, attitudes to family-friendly arrangements among employers, employees and work colleagues, and to identify existing research available in this area. The report confirms that demands for work-life opportunities are increasing among a broad range of people who are at work or who may be seeking work, not just people who are seeking to balance work and family responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee held a seminar in November for work-life balance policy makers and practitioners from both the private sector and the public sector to disseminate the findings of the Off the Treadmill research and to consider how this agenda can be progressed into the future. The committee is currently considering a number of areas where they can undertake a role in progressing this agenda at the enterprise level in the future, including: the provision of tools and guides to assist organisations in introducing and-or managing innovative work-life options at the level of the enterprise; the examination of the business case, at the level of the enterprise, for the introduction of work-life balance options; the provision of financial assistance to organisations to assist them to develop innovative approaches to work-life balance; the dissemination of information to organisations on work-life balance options, including the dissemination of information on successful work-life balance projects undertaken to date; and in the context of the increasing demand for work/life balance options both employers and <Col N="1111" />employees will require to be innovative in their thinking and actions in this area.</P>

The objective of the State development agencies has been to encourage the design of a strategy that will enable as many areas as possible to share in balanced regional development.

The intention is that each gateway town will lead the economic development of its region through stimulating growth in the surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is working to ensure that indigenous industry in the Border region plays an important role in achieving the balanced regional strategy envisaged in the NSS. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with companies in the Border region to improve their competitiveness and to enable them to grow. Preferential funding is being provided for companies with detailed export plans who are expanding or establishing a business in the Border region.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of recent IBEC data on the level of redundancies in the north-west region of counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal. The total number of redundancies notified to my Department for these counties for the first 11 months of 2003 was 1,406 compared with a figure of 644 for the year 2002. Statistics on unemployment are measured by the quarterly national household survey but this is devised on a regional basis. However, live register figures are available on a county basis but the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers. The figure for County Donegal was 9,975 in October 2003 compared with 9,355 for October 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 19 November last, I met with an IBEC north-west delegation to discuss employment in the area. This followed on a meeting I had with a delegation from the Donegal county development board on 16 October 2003. The key to enhancing employment in the north-west is the development of infrastructure in the area, in particular, roads, water, electricity and gas, air access <Col N="1113" />and broadband communications. Recent developments include the provision of funding for the Letterkenny water supply scheme and the approval of a feasibility study grant for the extension of the natural gas pipeline from Derry to Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has located responsibility for the national development and promotion of the engineering and consumer sectors in Sligo together with a unit of international services. This is in line with a new regional focus where key operational responsibilities are being placed in the regions. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with indigenous companies in the north-west region to improve competitiveness and to enable them to grow. The county enterprise boards have also been active in promoting and supporting micro-enterprises in the north-west. In the Gaeltacht area of the north-west, Údaras na Gaeltachta is pursuing a number of initiatives to address the jobs situation including targeting new sectors of the economy, upgrading building and telecommunications infrastructure and placing greater emphasis on high skills.</P>
    <P>The Government, along with the State development agencies, is committed to ensuring balanced regional development, particularly through the implementation of the national spatial strategy and the recently announced decentralisation programme which should also facilitate economic development in the north-west region.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>A number of reviews of community employment are currently under way. The PPF provided for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes, ALMPs to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. Indecon International Economic Consultants were commissioned by my Department on behalf of the standing committee to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the overall effectiveness of existing programmes, and to help inform the deliberations of the committee. The consultants' report was finalised and brought to the committee in November 2002. The standing committee is due to complete its work on the overall appraisal of ALMPs shortly. The FÁS internal review of the community employment scheme and job initiative programme is also nearing completion. The reports in question will be published upon completion of the review process.</P>

      <P>In deciding the 2004 Exchequer allocation, careful consideration was given to the appropriate prioritisation of funding given the limited resources available. In this context, I decided to significantly increase the funding provided by my Department to the science and technology budget which, obviously, constrained my ability to maintain funding in other areas. Notwithstanding this policy orientation, I remain strongly committed to the support and development of the indigenous sector. My Department closely monitors the CEBs budgetary situation on an ongoing basis and will continue to take a proactive stance in ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development throughout the country. I am confident that boards will still be in a position to provide an appropriate level of assistance to any good quality projects that present over the coming year.</P>

      <P>Before deciding to grant full freedom of movement for purposes of work to nationals of the ten EU accession states, the Government had regard to the findings of a number of studies carried out on the likely impact of enlargement on EU labour markets. These included studies by Brueker &amp; Boeri for the EU Commission in 2000, Sinn in 2001, and Salt in 1999. In general, research suggested that the impact on the EU labour market of the freedom of movement of workers after accession should be limited. However, it was expected that the predicted labour migration would be concentrated in certain front-line member states, resulting in possible pressures on the labour markets there. Concerns about the impact of the free movement of workers were based on considerations such as geographical proximity, income differentials, unemployment and propensity to migrate.</P>
      <P>Analysis of Irish economic migration from the accession countries showed that in 2002 approximately 34% of personnel coming here on work permits were nationals of those countries. Indeed, the percentage has increased only marginally, to 36% to date in 2003. This is at a time when few other member states are open to relatively low skilled labour migration and Ireland may be particularly attractive at the moment. After May 2004, nationals of the ten accession countries will be able to choose freedom of movement to seek work in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain, Spain and Greece, as well as to Ireland.</P>

I understand that the fund referred to by the Deputy is not open to the general public and is only available to professional investors who should be able to assess the risks involved in any such investment. Investment fund legislation is kept under review on an ongoing basis. If there is a need to strengthen the legislation in this area, I have no doubt that IFSRA will bring this to my attention and to the attention of the Minister for Finance, as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest data from the CSO shows that in the year ended May 2003 total employment increased from 1,749,900 to 1,778,300, a net increase of 28,400. This represents a very strong performance in the face of a global downturn in business activity. Our recent achievement in creating employment across the economy demonstrates that Government policies over the past few years have helped us to be more resilient to global business difficulties and better able to manage our economy when world-wide economic growth falters.</P>
      <P>Employment in firms assisted by the enterprise support agencies is collated by means of an annual employment survey. Information in respect of 2003 is not yet available, as the survey has not been completed. Figures from the 2003 survey will be available early in 2004.</P>
      <P>Companies supported by the development agencies created more than 25,000 permanent full-time jobs in 2002, a strong achievement in the context of difficult economic conditions. However, these employment gains were out-weighed by job losses of just over 35,000, as the economic downturn impacted on firms' ability to sustain and expand employment. Conditions in the global economy have remained slow for much of 2003, and it is expected that this will have a continued impact on Ireland. While I take this seriously, there has nonetheless been a 50% increase in employment in the country over the last decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the economic development agencies are undertaking a number of co-ordinated strategies to sustain and promote growth in industrial employment, with the intention of promoting greater competition in the non-traded services sectors of the economy and increasing emphasis on the importance of research and development and new process and product innovation. We are also accelerating <Col N="1117" />delivery of vital economic infrastructure for businesses including broadband, roads, electricity and waste management. Furthermore, I have recently set up a new enterprise strategy group, under the chairmanship of Eoin O'Driscoll, to recommend and prioritise new strategies and policies to ensure that the prosperity we enjoyed in the last decade will continue into the future. I have asked the group to examine the issues that I and my Government colleagues need to take into account to help strengthen our enterprise environment, to promote an innovation and knowledge driven economy and help sustain those industries already providing employment here. The group is working towards submitting a report to me by the middle of 2004.</P>

      <P>In Ireland, as in most developed countries, controls are applied to the export of military and dual-use goods. Dual-use goods are goods which have both a civilian and military end-use. These licensing systems generally reflect the need to comply with international obligations in relation to arms control, non-proliferation of weapons, and sanctions imposed on specific states. Given the increasing focus, which is being given to the necessity of strengthening strategic export control rules, it is important to ensure that Ireland's export controls are up to the best international standards. In this context, my Department asked Forfas to undertake a review of our strategic controls systems with a view to recommending how best we can modernise and strengthen them and ensure full compliance with Ireland's international obligations. Economic consultants have been commissioned by Forfas to carry out the review, which is being done in two phases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase 1, the results of which were published in August, 2003, involved a short review of the current licensing system. It identified perceived gaps in operational procedures and a number of other issues requiring further consideration. Phase 2 constitutes a more detailed review of the licensing system. More precisely, the terms of reference set out three main tasks for phase 2 of the review. These are a public consultation process, which has been completed; discussions with government departments, agencies, international organisations, specialised agencies, users of the system and other interested parties; establishing inter<Col N="1118" />national best practice. The review is expected to be completed over the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>On 18 April 2002, I announced that Churchill Insurance Group Limited was to create 600 new jobs in Galway over the next five years. This facility, a customer interaction centre was necessary to support current and future growth of Churchill's insurance business in the British market, which consists mainly of household and motor insurance. IDA Ireland have informed me that the company currently employs about 130 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also announced on 18 April 2002, that Thomson NETg, one of the world's leading providers of learning solutions to the corporate and academic markets, was to expand its e-learning product development and innovation centre operation in Limerick with the creation of 360 new jobs, bringing total employment at Thomson NETg in Ireland to 700 by the end of 2005. As part of the proposed expansion, the company agreed with IDA Ireland that up to 80 of the new jobs announced in April 2002, would be located in Birr, County Offaly. However, NETg subsequently decided to postpone its expansion plans and would not undertake the establishment of an operation in Birr due to the adverse economic climate, particularly in the e-learning sector. On 19 November 2003, NETg announced that as part of an ongoing assessment and reorganisation of its global business operations, a decision had been made to consolidate its global product development activity at its plant in Naperville, Illinois. As a result of this decision, the company's product development facility in Limerick will cease operations with the loss of 173 jobs, and plant closure is expected to be being completed by March 2004. It is understood that the closure decision was only taken after considerable examination of the corporate structure and a review of <Col N="1119" />options. The company is operating in an increasingly challenging IT environment which necessitated taking measures in order to align the cost base with revenue.</P>
    <P>The availability of the Limerick plant for a new project will be marketed strongly by IDA Ireland in co-operation with NETg. FÁS has already been in contact with the company and offered its range of training, job placement and other services to workers affected by the proposed closure.</P>

      <P>Sustainable development and supporting technologies are a core element of the EU Sixth Framework Pro<Col N="1120" />gramme for Research and Development, FP6, and of national research, technology and innovation, RTI, programmes operated by Enterprise Ireland. Most, if not all, priority-thematic programmes supported under FP6 and the national RTI programme support the development of technologies related to sustainable development. FP6, which has a budget of around &euro;16 billion for the period 2002 to 2006, in addition to covering sustainable development under all headings, has a specific programme which allocates funding of &euro;2.12 billion to support research into sustainable energy systems, sustainable surface transport and global change and ecosystems.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with some other interested Departments and a number of State agencies, operates an extensive FP6 national information and support unit to promote and assist participation by industry, research institutions and third level education bodies in FP6. This includes a specific national contact point regarding each of the 15 areas covered by FP6. Similar promotion and support arrangements operate regarding the national RTI programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department commissioned a research project this year to investigate the factors influencing the take-up by Irish enterprises of funding for research in sustainable production, technology innovation and practices. This report is being finalised and its findings will be used to seek to improve participation in the programmes mentioned above.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003, which established SFI, provides that the foundation shall promote and develop the carrying out of basic research in strategic areas of scientific endeavour that concerns the future development and competitiveness of industry. Initially, the foundation will focus on creating a critical mass of world-class research in niches underpinning information and communication technologies, ICTs, and biotechnology. There is, however, provision in the Act to prescribe other areas that concern economic and social benefit, long-term industrial competitiveness or environmentally sustainable development, should this become necessary in the future. With this in mind, the focus and activities of the foundation will be kept under review and further areas of research will be considered in due course, as the foundation within its initial areas of focus matures.</P>

    <P>This shows a combined allocation of &euro;366.549 million in 2004. This is approximately 0.1% less than the 2003 allocation of &euro;366.955 million. The 2004 allocation includes an amount of &euro;351 million that will support up to 25,000 places across three key employment schemes, namely the community employment scheme, job initiative and the social economy programme. FÁS is being given some flexibility in the management of this funding to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.</P>
    <P>The commitment to fund a continuing pool of up to 25,000 places across the three schemes clarifies the levels of activity to be supported and enables FÁS to give a clear commitment to the support of local community services. In deciding the financial allocation for the schemes for 2004, the Government was informed by the work of the cross-departmental senior officials group. While the total financial envelope for the schemes has been fixed, the views of the standing committee on active labour market programmes and the <Col N="1122" />review of the social economy programme will be taken into account in considering any adjustments in the structure and the terms and conditions of the labour market measures in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 121 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>The social economy programme aims to support the development of social economy enterprises and, in so doing, create sustainable jobs for the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>In 2003, &euro;30.836 million was allocated for this programme to FÁS and this is being increased in 2004 to over &euro;40 million. This is part of the overall allocation of &euro;351 million, which is being provided in 2004 to support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes, community employment, job initiative, JI, and the social economy programme.</P>
      <P>The day-to-day operation of the scheme is a matter for FÁS, which endeavours to work with the relevant groups in a sensitive manner, taking account of the particular needs of individual enterprises. Demands for assistance under the social economy programme, exceed the budget available and in the circumstances it is not possible for FÁS to meet all the requirements of the enterprises concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the social economy programme was recently undertaken by WRC Social and <Col N="1123" />Economic Consultants. The review is currently being considered by the social economy monitoring committee, FÁS and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The monitoring committee, which is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of the social economy programme, is chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is comprised of the social partners and relevant Departments and statutory bodies. The review together with the views of the monitoring committee will inform the future direction of the programme. It is expected that the review will be published before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there have been calls for spouses to be given an automatic entitlement to work permits. Any proposal to grant work permits on the basis of marital status rather than on the basis of skills would have broader implications for immigration policy and the labour market and will have to be considered in that context. For example, work permits are now granted in respect of an eligible vacancy for which a suitable EEA candidate could not be found. A change along the lines suggested would imply a willingness to issue two work permits in respect of each eligible vacancy.</P>
      <P>Work permits may be applied for by employers in respect of spouses of non-EEA nationals, including nurses, in the same way as for other non-EEA workers, and permits are granted on foot of a valid application from an eligible employer.</P>

      <P>Regional development is an important strategic objective for my Department. The enterprise support agencies each have specific operational activities and programmes tailored to encourage enterprises and to attract new jobs to regional locations. These help drive the delivery of core elements of the national spatial strategy. The Government's decentralisation initiative also demonstrates a commitment to help regional towns build scale and create opportunities that will increase their attractiveness for investment.</P>
      <P>There have been fundamental changes in the operation of individual agencies that reflect a serious intention to address regional development from an enterprise perspective. In the realm of planning and advice, Forfás provides important guidance concerning national development investments. This is essential analysis that contributes to making regional centres more competitive and attractive locations. Forfás also provides the secretariat to the enterprise strategy group under the chairmanship of Mr. Eoin O'Driscoll. One of the tasks of the group is to consider new enterprise policy options, which, among other factors, recognise the desirability of regional balance.</P>
      <P>In early 2001, IDA Ireland outlined its commitment to regional development in its strategy document. This initiated a regional development process whereby it strengthened its network of regional offices by allocating key sectoral responsibilities to regional locations such as Waterford, Athlone and Sligo. About 100 staff are now based in ten offices whose functions are aligned with regional development priorities, such as building flagship business parks and strategic sites to provide high-quality facilities to accommodate high-value, large-scale projects.</P>
      <P>On the employment front, 44% of new greenfield jobs were delivered in the BMW region during 2002, representing a creditable performance given global business difficulties. The agency is currently reviewing its strategy. Regional development and programme development options to meet national spatial strategy objectives have featured prominently in the planning work undertaken to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland and my Department recently reviewed its funding guidelines for companies and launched a revised schema in May this year. These align financial incentives with the national aim of balanced regional development. Location is now a key determinant of the level of aid available to Enterprise Ireland's clients. All categories of financial support provided by Enterprise Ireland now reflect a preferential bias for companies located outside the Dublin and <Col N="1126" />mid-east regions. Enterprise Ireland also launched the competitiveness fund this year, which is a new &euro;10 million fund targeted at SME competitiveness. It specifically addresses the needs of companies that have not undertaken a major development project within the past three years. This very relevant policy initiative will positively impact on the regions.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently revising its regional strategy priorities post 2003. New strategic policies will focus on three main areas, which include the existing client base, new start-up activity and regional development/business infrastructure. Programmes under these themes will be a further catalyst to expanding regional employment and wealth creation.</P>
    <P>Directed by Shannon Development, the Shannon region 2020 strategy aims to expand regional employment and enterprise opportunities. It takes a 15 to 20 year view to developing the critical mass of the Limerick-Ennis-Shannon region, while networking the major centres of Limerick, Galway and Cork through the Atlantic Alliance initiative. This regional &ldquo;vision&rdquo; aims to stimulate investment in key county towns and use regional natural resources for rural development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>At the time of adoption of the specific research programmes under the EC's Sixth Research Framework Programme 2003-2006, the Council and the Commission agreed by means of a political declaration that detailed implementing provisions concerning research activities involving the use of human embryos and human embryonic stem cells which may be funded under the Sixth Research Framework Programme should be established by 31 December 2003. The Commission stated that, during that moratorium and pending establishment of the detailed implementing provisions, it would not propose to fund such research, with the exception of the study of banked or isolated human embryonic stem cells in culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission presented on 9 July a proposal for amending the specific research programme concerned in which it proposed that the funding provided by the sixth research framework programme for the derivation of new stem cells would only be made available if proposals successfully pass a rigorous scientific and ethical review and that the human embryos used for the procurement of stem cells must have been created before 27 June 2002 as a result of medically-assisted in vitro fertilisation designed to induce pregnancy, and were no longer to be used <Col N="1127" />for that purpose. The Commission amended its proposal in the light of the opinion given by the European Parliament in November.</P>
    <P>At the Competitiveness Council on 26 November 2003, the Presidency introduced the Commission's amended proposal, which took account of the European Parliament amendments that were acceptable to the Commission. The proposal as amended reinforced the stringent guidelines and safeguards for the conduct of research activities involving human embryonic stem cells under the Sixth Research Framework Programme. However, in view of the continuing divergence of views on the matter, no decision was taken on the proposal. In the light of this development, the Italian Presidency scheduled a further meeting of the Council on 3 December specifically to take a decision on guidelines for embryonic stem cell research.</P>
    <P>At the Council on 3 December the Commission's amended proposal and an alternative proposal tabled by the Presidency, which aimed to take account of the deliberations at the Council's meeting on 26 November, were considered. The Presidency text suggested that no EU funding should be provided for the procurement of new stem cells or stem cell lines from embryos. However, research projects using embryonic stem cells would be eligible for such funding on condition that these stem cells come from existing stem cell lines that were created before 3 December 2003. The Commission for its part could not support the Presidency text.</P>
    <P>Ireland was able to support either proposal on the basis that each encompassed robust and stringent guidelines and safeguards. However, following extensive discussion, fundamental differences remained among the positions adopted by member states, and the Presidency concluded that there was no possibility of securing a qualified majority in favour of either the Commission's amended proposal or the Presidency text.</P>
    <P>Ireland feels strongly that an important opportunity has been lost to put in place controls, guidelines and parameters for the conduct of this research and the failure of the Council to adopt such guidelines has resulted in a situation where European research in this area could go ahead in an unregulated or more loosely regulated fashion. In this context, the legal opinion of the Council is that a failure to adopt the Commission proposal will not affect the existing right and obligation of the Commission to implement the specific programme.</P>
    <P>Given the protracted deliberations which have taken place on this issue over a lengthy period and the different options which have now been exhaustively explored, it would appear that there is little likelihood, if any, of reaching agreement on the matter of guidelines for this activity within the framework programme. Accordingly, we would see little benefit in further revisiting this issue in the context of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the European Union.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's ranking of 30th in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report is clearly a disappointment. The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, published its annual report last week and highlighted the key areas to be addressed in meeting the challenges to Ireland's competitiveness. I am committed to improving Ireland's competitiveness and we are taking the necessary steps to follow up on the NCC recommendations both in the context of the budget and through the Government's commitment to consider and give effect to these recommendations.</P>
      <P>The NCC reports state that Ireland's immediate priority must be to slow the growth of prices and costs. A business environment with a low inflation rate reduces firms costs, reduces the overall burden of costs on industry, and improves the competitiveness of the entire economy. The Government is committed to further reducing Ireland's inflation to bring it into line with our EU partners and other competitors.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking action on prices and costs and to improving the country's competitiveness the Government is committed to a number of actions, which would Ireland more attractive in terms of investment and job creation. These include: increasing investment in research, technology and innovation, which will provide the basis for future productivity growth; strengthening competition across the economy and implementing specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas such as insurance; and continuing to invest in key infrastructure such as broadband telecommunications and the national road network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are also working to enhance Ireland's competitiveness and improve the chances of further investment in jobs. Enterprise Ireland, in addition to providing funding for innovation development and upskilling within client companies, also provides advice and referrals for clients to improve their competitive position. In May of this year, Enterprise <Col N="1129" />Ireland launched a &euro;10 million dedicated fund for building competitiveness in client companies. This fund complements the range of supports already in place and highlights the importance of action in this area. It is geared primarily to the more traditional industries where job shedding has continued to pose serious challenges.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is actively seeking to facilitate a progression in the sophistication and breadth of its clients Irish operations. This means not only increasing value added in its manufacturing operations, but also adding corporate level innovation, such as research and development, and service, logistics and supply chain management functions alongside manufacturing. The objective is to create more rounded and strategically important operations within the overall corporation, which are better embedded and more suited to the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy in the medium to long-term.</P>
    <P>In July of this year, I established the enterprise strategy group to produce a blueprint for an enterprise strategy for growth and employment in Ireland up to 2010. All the members of the group have displayed a keen knowledge and awareness of the needs of enterprises operating in Ireland over a considerable period. I look forward to the recommendations of the group and to their contribution to the future strategy designed to ensure that Ireland remains a dynamic and successful economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. While the Exchequer provision for IDA Ireland capital grants in 2004 of &euro;81.835 million is 9% lower than the 2003 allocation of &euro;90.266 million, IDA Ireland advises that the reduced allocation will be sufficient to meet expected demands in 2004 for the following reasons: there has been a trend in recent years to negotiate grants at lower rates than heretofore applied; the value of the grant negotiated is, in many cases, less important than other factors; EU guidelines are also having an effect on the value of grants that can be offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding of the IDA Ireland property programme is unaffected by the level of funding for capital grants. Expenditure by IDA Ireland on property is mainly funded from resources arising from the sale of existing land and buildings. The requirement for Exchequer funding arises from <Col N="1130" />the need to make an amount available to the agency for cash-flow purposes, primarily at the beginning of the year. In 2004 my Department is providing funding of &euro;3.102 million to IDA Ireland in respect of this activity, which is slightly up on the provision in 2003 of &euro;3 million.</P>
    <P>Providing property solutions for inward investors is an important part of IDA Ireland's role as an investment promotion agency. IDA Ireland has factory units available for new projects around the country and will continue to provide new buildings as required in partnership with the private sector. For example, IDA Ireland is currently continuing to develop a network of regionally distributed flagship business parks that will contribute to enterprise development across the regions by providing high specification property solutions for clients in the form of operating sites, office space and supporting infrastructure including professionally managed on-site crèche facilities.</P>

      <Quest> the steps she has taken or proposes to take to combat the price rises which are seriously undermining the competitiveness of the economy; the areas most seriously affected by price rises in excess of the rate of inflation; her proposals to deal with same; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to improving Ireland's competitiveness and ensuring that Ireland is well placed to take advantage of any potential upturn in the world economy. The Annual Competitiveness Report 2003 and the Competitiveness Challenge 2003, produced by the National Competitiveness Council, state that Ireland's immediate priority must be to slow the increase in prices and costs. During October 2003, Ireland's inflation rate fell to 2.3%. However, despite this encouraging trend, we must not become complacent as many of our EU partners and other competitors currently have lower levels of inflation. The Government is committed to further reducing Ireland's rate of inflation as low inflation will stabilise firms' costs and provide them with a solid competitive business environment from which they can successfully compete on both domestic and international markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget for 2004, as announced last week by the Minister of Finance, had at its core the need to preserve Ireland's competitiveness. The Government recognised that keeping inflation low was a key priority when formulating this budget. Keeping inflation under control was important for essentially two reasons. First, a low <Col N="1131" />inflation rate improves the performance of the economy and enhances the competitiveness of Irish industry and, second, a low inflation rate is central to the partnership programme, Sustaining Progress. The goal of Sustaining Progress is to create a virtuous circle of low inflation, moderate wage growth and higher productivity, thereby providing a firm competitive business environment for Irish industry. In light of the fact that a new wage agreement will be discussed with the social partners next year, it was of vital importance to continue to control inflation in order to create the virtuous circle highlighted in Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to take steps to strengthen competitiveness across the economy and to implement specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas for Irish industry. As we are all aware, one of the areas most severely affected by price rises in excess of the rate of inflation is insurance. Almost every business in Ireland has been adversely affected by increasing premiums and, as a result, this has fuelled Ireland's inflation rate. I am implementing a programme to fundamentally reform the insurance market to tackle the issue of high premiums. This proposal is already having an impact with insurers announcing premium reductions. It is particularly satisfactory the CSF cited insurance as a significant factor in the recent sharp reduction in the consumer price index. I am committed to continuing with the reform programme and bringing about improvements in the functioning of the insurance market.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the most important and sustainable method for reducing costs and ensuring they are maintained at an acceptable level is to facilitate increased competition in all sectors of the economy. We cannot afford to have sheltered sectors of the Irish economy immune from price competition. Competition in all sectors must be encouraged to ensure goods and services are provided at an efficient and affordable price. The powers and resources of the Competition Authority have been increased substantially to enable them to effectively tackle cartels and abuses of dominant position and to recommend regulatory reforms to improve competition in key markets.</P>
    <P>The Government is aware that the largest component of Irish Inflation can be attributed to the services sector. It is therefore of great importance that we open the sheltered enclaves of service provision to full vigorous competition. We fully support the European Commission in its endeavours to fully complete the internal market for services so that services may experience the same level of success and competition associated with the European internal market for goods.</P>

      <P>While I am not in a position to confirm the accuracy of the statement concerned, I am of the view that the best way to protect the economic interests of consumers, in this or in any other sector, is by ensuring that competition is operating effectively and that consumers are empowered to be effective participants in the market process.</P>
      <P>The current range of policy measures in the competition and consumer field are, in my view, working well but there is an ongoing need to keep their operation under active review, particularly regarding such an important sector as the food industry.</P>

      <P>The breakdown of workplace inspections-visits up to December 2003 is set out in the following table. In the case of the data, there may be some subsequent minor revision as outstanding data entry is clarified or completed.</P>
      <P>In 2001, as part of a continuing process to strengthen and modernise employment rights enforcement, a major business process re-engineering review took place in the employment rights unit of my department, including the labour inspectorate. That review embraced the activities of the support units to the labour inspectorate in the area of employment rights enforcement, for example, the employment rights information unit, where enhanced customer service standards including lunchtime opening were introduced and the prosecution and enforcement units, where procedures and linkages with the Chief State Solicitor's office were improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Replacement of the existing computer system was one of several other recommendations, including revision of procedures, and develop<Col N="1133" />ment of that new system commenced at the end of August 2002. In mid-June 2003, a new fully integrated IT system, incorporating functions across each of the employment rights business units was launched at a cost of &euro;900,000.</P>
    <P>On the numbers of inspectors, the Government authorised an increase in their number, from ten to 17 inspectors, in conjunction with the introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act in the year 2000 and there are no plans at present to increase the number of Inspectors further.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the investment and actions described above have enhanced the effectiveness of the inspectorate and will ensure that the employment rights and entitlements of all employees working in Ireland are protected.</P>

    <P>The Government has decided, in the context of the 2004 Estimates, that there will be no further reduction in the number of places to be supported under CE next year. The number of places to be supported in 2004 will not drop below the end-year 2003 target of 20,000.</P>
    <P>The total allocation for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at &euro;351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes ie CE, job initiative and social economy. FÁS is being given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services. This allocation, &euro;351 million, is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003. Accordingly there will be no reduction in the total level of provision for the three schemes or in the combined participation levels next year.</P>
    <P>Approximately 4,500 CE places in schools have been mainstreamed over the past number of years. This involved the appropriate degree of funding being transferred to the Department of Education and Science for the provision of replacement services in schools. In addition, approximately 2,300 places have peen provided on the social economy programme. There are no plans to mainstream further CE positions in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>The number of workers killed in workplace accidents in the period 1 January to 4 December 2003 is 53, or 2.98 per 100,000 workers. This compares with a total of 52 worker fatalities in the full year 2002 at a rate of 2.97 per 100,000 workers. Again, while any workplace fatality is one too many, worker fatality rates per 100,000 workers have thankfully declined from a rate of 5.46 in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to know that non-fatal workplace accidents are reportable to the Health and Safety Authority if they result in <Col N="1135" />more than three days' absence. Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with overall responsibility for administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day to day function of the authority.</P>
    <P>The authority's work programme for 2003 included a wide range of actions to improve safety performance in the high-risk sectors of construction, agriculture, mining and quarrying. Many of the key bodies in these sectors such as the IFA, Teagasc, CIF, ICTU and IBEC made specific commitments and inputs to support safety initiatives, which together with the Authority's own inspection, enforcement, advisory and promotional activities are designed to help to reduce workplace accidents and injuries.</P>
    <P>There is still a major challenge to reduce workplace accidents which lead to injuries and death. In saying that there are also responsibilities on the major participants in the workplace, workers and employers. All parties working together can make the workplace safer and in this regard I commend the progress made in recent years in various partnership approaches to workplace safety.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 119 and 120 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and the difficulties it is <Col N="1136" />causing for businesses and members of the public in general. The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October 2002 comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe. To date, 32 of the recommendations have been fully implemented, three have been partially implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations.</P>
    <P>Another measures is the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003 was published on 18 November 2003 and is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is hoped to enact the legislation by the end of the year. This Bill will, when enacted, provide for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>Another measure is the undertaking by my Department and the Competition Authority of a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</P>
    <P>I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the coordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law in relation to personal injury claims.</P>
    <P>While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the recent predictions being made by the chairman of ISME in relation to the possibility of increases in insurance costs. While I do not have specific information on insurance premium levels in 2004, indications from the Irish Insurance Federation is that the cost of insurance premia have peaked, and that reductions are expected in commercial insurance, given the current conditions and the expected implementation of further reforms such as the PIAB and the Civil Liability and Courts Bill. Reductions have already occurred in motor insurance and further reductions are expected. For the purposes of comparing trends in the cost of motor insurance, I am using the insurance sub-indices calculated from the all items consumer price index produced by the Central Statistics Office. The consumer price index of motort ransport insurance shows <Col N="1137" />that between April and October of this year there was a reduction of 9.9 index points or 9.1%.</P>

      <P>The National Competitiveness Council's Annual Competitiveness Report 2003 and the Competitiveness Challenge 2003 report were published on 1 December 2003. These reports provide an extremely useful insight into Ireland's current competitiveness status as they assist in highlighting key areas to be addressed in meeting the challenges to Irelands international competitiveness. These reports have been given immediate attention by the Government both in the context of this year's budget and through the Government's commitment to consider and give effect to the NCC recommendations.</P>
      <P>The National Competitiveness Council stated in both its recently published reports that Ireland's immediate priority must be to slow the growth of prices and costs. The Government is committed to enhancing Ireland's competitiveness status and an essential component of this is to provide a business environment with low inflation. This will help stabilise firms' costs and provide them with a solid competitive business environment from which they can successfully compete on both domestic and international markets. Ireland's inflation rate fell to 2.3% during October. However, we cannot afford to be complacent. We will continue to further reduce our inflation rate bringing it into line with our EU partners and other competitors. In this context, budget 2004 demonstrated that keeping inflation low was a key priority. The Government has avoided inflation-fuelling taxes in line with the requests of the National Competitiveness Council. The budget, furthermore, reflects the Government's commitment to support job creation and investment in Ireland. We have introduced a series of new measures so that the tax system further supports initiative, risk-taking and innovation. These new measures include the introduction of a research and development tax credit, the removal of stamp duty on the registration of patents and the extension and improvement of the business expansion and seed capital schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NCC last week presented us with a set of key priority areas on which we need to monitor progress. At its meeting on 25 November the Government discussed both reports of the National Competitiveness Council. It was agreed at this meeting that the Government would consider Ireland's competitiveness status every six months and this would also include discussing the recommendations in both National Competi<Col N="1138" />tiveness Council reports. The Government also agreed to set up a monitoring process to consider and track progress on the implementation of the council's recommendations.</P>

I understand that the implementation of the redundancies is the subject of ongoing discussions between management and unions. Enterprise Ireland and FÁS are maintaining close contact with the company on its proposed rationalisation programme.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the State and its regions. Despite the global economic turndown, the level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world.</P>
      <P>During the year to 4 December 2003, 35 greenfield and expansion projects were announced by IDA Ireland with a projected total job content of just over 5,830 jobs. IDA Ireland constantly monitors its pipeline of prospective projects. This is the number of projects and associated jobs that at any time have a likelihood of being won within the next three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pipeline in recent years has not been at the very high levels reached during the high growth period between 1994 and 2000. However, given the very different global economic conditions that have prevailed since 2000 and their consequential <Col N="1139" />effects on the global market for FDI, it would be unrealistic to expect a similarly strong pipeline.</P>
    <P>The following table provides details of potential jobs and projects in the IDA Ireland pipeline for each month between April 2002 and August 2003. Despite difficult global conditions, IDA Ireland strategy and policy have been very successful with the lowpoint in the pipeline only being reached in the second half of 2002 and the trend since then being upward.</P>

    <P>It must be appreciated that the success of our economy during the 1990s and on into this decade means that Ireland is now much less competitive as a location for low wage manufacturing projects. As such Ireland must gear itself towards attracting a different type of investor. The focus for the future must be to attract investment requiring high skill levels, that is, as far as possible, innovation rather than production orientated, and that links to an increasingly sophisticated business environment.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland's overall strategic response to this <Col N="1140" />new competitive circumstance has been towards a broader vision of what constitutes FDI, with less emphasis on job numbers, and a much greater focus on job quality, higher value added activities, and making Ireland a centre for innovation and the strategic management of value chains rather than just a manufacturing or basic service location; and dedicating resources and expertise to the task of supporting the long-term competitiveness of existing clients, accelerating regional development, winning new higher quality FDI and getting a strong position in new emerging FDI sectors.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will continue to bear fruit in terms of delivering the maximum possible level of additional sustainable overseas investment and jobs.</P>

      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which implemented EU Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, provides for an annual leave entitlement of four working weeks per annum for full-time employees and <i>pro rata</i> entitlements for part-time employees as well as an average hourly working week of 48 hours averaged generally over a four month period. The Act also provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum. Notwithstanding these provisions, it is possible for employers and employees to negotiate a longer annual leave entitlement or a lower hourly working week between themselves if they so wish. I have no plans at the moment to increase the statutory minimum annual leave or public holiday entitlement nor to lower the threshold on weekly working hours provided for in the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>The supports available with regard to advancing the software sector are primarily a matter for the State agencies involved, in this case Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to comment on the views referred to in the article as they were not justified in great detail. Furthermore, it appears that Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland have adequately responded in the article.</P>
      <P>On Enterprise Ireland's supports, it should be noted that these supports are demand led. Enterprise Ireland has not curtailed support to high potential start-up companies.</P>
      <P>With regard to research and development, the Government remains determined to progress this agenda. Indeed, efforts in this regard were greatly facilitated by the widespread support given by this House to the passage of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003. Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is strongly focused on research in strategic areas where Ireland has a competitive advantage. Approximately 60% of SFI commitments to date underpin the ICT sector. My Department's 2004 Estimate provides a 62% increase to SFI and a 12% increase to Enterprise Ireland to support research and development activities. The announcement, by my colleague the Minister for Finance, of a 20% research and development tax credit is further evidence of Government support for providing a strong foundation for the development of high technology and research intensive sectors such as software in Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to work towards the long-term aim of moving Ireland's economy up the value chain by actively supporting the State agencies' strategies with regard to research and development.</P>

      <Quest> the measures in place to protect young people and children in the workplace; the number of prosecutions that have been taken in 2000, 2001 and 2002 and to date in 2003 under these measures; the number of inspectors monitoring and enforcing these protections; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures to protect young persons and children in the workplace are set out in the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. Proceedings, for breaches of the provisions of the Act, may be taken by the labour inspectorate of my Department.</P>
      <P>The complement of staff authorised as inspectors in the labour inspectorate is 17. As part of their normal conditions of service, inspectors carry out night-time work and that element of their duties is almost exclusively related to the work of the enforcement of the 1996 Act. In this connection, a regular feature of the work of the inspectorate is targeted inspections for compliance with the Act, by way of out of normal office hours inspection activity, throughout various employment sectors, including fast food outlets, restaurants, licensed premises and hotels.</P>
      <P>As part of an overall business process re-engineering project, the labour inspectorate, together with the support units &ndash; the information unit and the legal services unit &ndash; have recently completed a major review of their respective procedures. In addition, a new, fully integrated computerised case management system went live in June 2003.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied this investment, together with the other streamlining measures that have been put in place, will enhance the effectiveness of the inspectorate and will contribute positively to the effort that will be focused on enforcement of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 in the coming months and years. In this regard, I reiterate a call that has been issued previously. If there is evidence employers are breaking the requirements of the Act, it should be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action, including, based on sufficient supporting evidence, prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the inspectorate's activity in this area over the years 2000 to date, together with out<Col N="1146" />turns from the legal services unit, are set out in the following tables:</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, Enterprise Ireland is assisting the industry in implementing the relevant recommendations in the Timber Industry Development Group, TIDG, report. In this context, the report highlighted over capacity in the saw milling sector. Accordingly, support from Enterprise Ireland is being aimed primarily at helping companies to develop added value products and to improve process efficiencies. However, the over capacity problem has not yet been resolved and must be addressed within the industry as recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>Further action regarding the implementation of the report is being pursued by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and this process will continue when responsibility for forestry relocates to the Department of Agriculture and Food in the new year.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. IDA Ireland adopted a new regional strategy in February 2003. The objective of the strategy is to create a &ldquo;pull&rdquo; or &ldquo;magnet&rdquo; in the regions for enterprise development rather than rely on &ldquo;push&rdquo; or dispersal from Dublin. This is based on a gateway approach to regional economic development.</P>
      <P>The core components of the new regional strategy adopted by IDA have been successfully implemented. IDA Ireland has nine offices outside Dublin, six of which are in the Objective One region. Key IDA Ireland business units such as the regions and property division, ICT and health care divisions and engineering and consumer products have been decentralised to Athlone, Waterford and Sligo. The Athlone, Waterford and Sligo offices have national as well as regional responsibilities. Work is at an advanced stage in terms of constructing a network of flagship business parks in the regions.</P>

    <P>I am pleased the agency, in line with the regional policy objectives set out in the Government's national development plan, has made substantial progress with regard to the proportion of <Col N="1148" />new green field jobs locating in the Objective One region, which consists of the Border, midlands and western counties. The underlying process of creating new green field jobs in the region is initiated with first time site visits by overseas investors. Commencing in 2000, 50% of all first time site visits handled by IDA Ireland have been directed to the Objective One region.</P>
    <P>The objective is for IDA Ireland to secure at least 50% of all green field job approvals for the BMW counties. Following from this, the expectation is that 50% of all new green field jobs created will be achieved in the region. Typically, new jobs on the ground come on stream within three to five years of approval. In 1999, prior to the start of the Government's current national development programme, approximately 25% of all new green field jobs were locating in the BMW region. This increased to 36% in 2000, 42% in 2001 and 42% in 2002. I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for Ireland and its regions.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the recent report produced by the Immigrant Council of Ireland which found that there was evidence of unscrupulous employers exploiting migrant workers; the steps being taken to prevent the exploitation of immigrant workers; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the investigative work undertaken by my inspectorate in 2003, work that commenced in 2002 was completed on the development of a new case management system to support streamlined work procedures in the inspectorate. The new IT system went live at the end of June this year. The project represents a considerable investment by my Department &ndash;<Col N="1149" />approximately &euro;900,000 in the enforcement of employment rights for all workers. The system provides the technological support to enable Inspectors operate more effectively and efficiently in their interactions with employers and employees alike. In particular, by facilitating remote connection to head office, the requirement for regular visits to the office to complete administrative work has been significantly curtailed.</P>
    <P>Information on employment rights is provided by my Department by a variety of means and is available in eight of the main foreign languages. This element is being upgraded. In addition, where employers seek work permits in order to employ non-EEA nationals, the Department requires the statement of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions, other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement.</P>
    <P>Work permits are not granted unless there is compliance with minimum wages legislation. Applications for renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid; P60 and other sources are used. Work permits are not granted for sectors such as domestic employment where it is believed that such employment can be met from the Irish/EEA labour market.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am satisfied there are sufficient procedures in place and an appropriate level of inspection activity to ensure, as far as possible, that rights and entitlements under Irish law are being observed for all workers. If there is evidence employers are exploiting immigrant workers, it should be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the European Commission communication &ldquo;Reviving the DDA negotiations &ndash; the EU perspective&rdquo;, which brings to an end the process of reflection and review that the European Commission and member states have carried out since the failure of the fifth WTO Cancun conference. The communication <Col N="1150" />responds to the invitation and to the orientations of the European Council on 16/17 October 2003.</P>
      <P>I welcome the analysis of the Commission and the approach the Commission proposes to explore, including that: (a) the EU's commitment to the multilateral approach to trade policy remains unchanged and is a top priority in EU external relations; (b) the EU expresses its conviction that the Doha declaration is still relevant and that the DDA negotiations continue to offer great potential to foster long-term economic growth, to stimulate trade and investment, including among developing countries, to promote sustainable development and to contribute to the achievement of the millennium development goals; (c) the Council conclusions of October 1999, revisited and reaffirmed in subsequent Council conclusions, in particular in July 2003, remain valid; and (d) the EU is in favour of an early relaunch of the DDA and is determined to participate constructively and actively in efforts to this end. The EU expects all members of the WTO to act in the same spirit by being willing to reflect on their own approach and come back to the negotiations with the flexibility needed to show their commitment to a successful resumption of negotiations.</P>
      <P>In expectation of a constructive attitude on all sides, I encourage the Commission to explore with the other WTO members the ideas contained in its communication with a view to refining the EU negotiating approach in a number of areas and to taking account of the manner in which discussions have developed over the past few months or at Cancun itself. I invite the Commission to continue to operate in close consultation with member states and to report back to member states through the European Council with a view to assessing the state of play in the light of the outcome of the exploration carried out by the Commission as well as of efforts undertaken by other WTO Members.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting of the WTO General Council on 15 December is not yet available, but it is expected to concentrate on issues surrounding the possible restart of negotiations on the Doha development agenda.</P>

      <Quest> the reason the allocation for Enterprise Ireland grants to industry, has been reduced by 15% in her Department's Estimate for 2004; the way in which this reduction is to be achieved; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of &euro;53,788,000 in Exchequer funding is being allocated to Enterprise Ireland's D2 subhead in respect of grants to industry for 2004 compared with &euro;62,943,000 in 2003. This represents a year on year decrease of Exchequer funding amounting to &euro;9,155,000.</P>
      <P>First, Enterprise Ireland's supports are demand led by clients. The expected 2003 outturn was taken into consideration to calculate the likely 2004 demand by clients. It is estimated that Enterprise Ireland will draw down approximately &euro;52.6 million in 2003, primarily reflecting lower than expected claims from clients and some delays in capital infrastructure spending. The Exchequer contribution to the D2 subhead budget in 2004 of &euro;53,788,000 represents a slight increase on the expected 2003 outturn of the Exchequer contribution.</P>
      <P>Second, in deciding the 2004 Exchequer allocation, careful consideration was given to national priorities and the fact that resources are limited. Although the Exchequer contribution to Enterprise Ireland in respect of the D2 subhead represents a budgetary reduction, Exchequer funding towards Enterprise Ireland's science and technology budget was significantly increased from &euro;74,285,000 in 2003 to &euro;82,880,000 in 2004, a rise of &euro;8,595,000 year on year. The Exchequer contribution, which forms part of the F subhead, reflects the ongoing change in the direction of industrial policy to support innovation, research and development and increase the flow of applied research from third level institutions. The increase in the research and development programmes being delivered by Enterprise Ireland also reflect the increased Government commitment to increasing competitiveness and innovation within Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government <Col N="1152" />supports the overall objectives of the new legislation, which seeks to establish a single integrated system for registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals and which will require companies that produce, import or use chemicals, to assess the risks arising from their use and to take the necessary measures to manage any risk they identify. However, we consider it is essential that the right balance be struck between environmental, economic and social policy dimensions. The proposed regulatory regime must secure a high level of protection for human health and the environment, while at the same time stimulating innovation and maintaining the competitiveness of the EU industry.</P>
      <P>Discussions have commenced at working group level under the Council of Ministers in Brussels on the details of the new legislation. These negotiations are likely to be complex and protracted, as the draft legislation is extremely technical and replaces more than 40 existing pieces of EU legislation. I assure the Deputy that we will devote a high priority to these proposals with a view to ensuring that a fair, workable and balanced system is put in place.</P>

      <P>Article 40.6.iii of the Irish Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions. Industrial relations and trade union legislation make no distinction based on whether a person is disabled or not. However, case law suggests that trade unions have a right to accept or not to accept an application for membership, including imposing conditions on membership. Primary responsibility for ensuring that one's constitutional rights are upheld and vindicated rests with the individual. Where a person is of the opinion that his/her constitutional or statutory rights have been infringed it is open to him/her to seek legal advice and, if appropriate, to vindicate those rights through the courts.</P>

      <P>I understand that the liquidation is progressing in an orderly and efficient manner and that considerable progress has been made in relation to the realisation of the company's assets. However, while the company's principle properties at Arklow and Marino Point have been placed on the market, I am advised that it may take some time to sell them. I also understand that most of the company's obligations to secured creditors have now been settled while payments to preferred creditors have been, or are in the course of being, made. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that any payments will be made to the unsecured creditors, which would include hauliers, until after the main property assets are sold. I do, of course, appreciate that some creditors may be experiencing some difficulties in the meantime. I understand that the liquidator will hold a creditors meeting shortly to outline progress with the liquidation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 19,250 participants on community employment (CE), 2,174 on job initiative (JI) and 2,354 on the social economy (SE) programmes. The target participation rates for 2004 is 20,000 on CE, 2,200 on JI and 2,300 on SE. The total funding allocation for employment schemes <Col N="1156" />in 2004 has been fixed at &euro;351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes. FÁS is being given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.</P>
    <P>This allocation is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003. Accordingly, there will be no reduction in the total level of provision for the three schemes or in the combined participation levels next year. The allocation of CE places per county or region is a matter for FÁS. There are currently 818 participants on ring-fenced drugs taskforce related projects countrywide. While up to 1,000 places are available for drugs taskforce referrals on designated schemes FÁS has had some difficulty in filling these places in certain areas. However, the commitment to 1,000 places still remains in place.</P>

      <P>The funds to which the Deputy's question refers are Community funds. Framework programme funds come from Community resources collected and distributed under the legal framework of the EU Treaties. There is no national co-financing of the Framework programme. The Commission pro<Col N="1157" />posal provided that the EU would only support research on supernumerary embryos derived from IVF and no longer required for such purpose. It aimed to establish coherent, consistent and stringent guidelines and safeguards to govern Community funding of research taking place only in those member states where it is legal and deemed ethical. It explicitly respected the differing positions of member states in regard to the legal and ethical acceptability of such research, and included a guarantee that the framework programme would not support embryonic stem cell research where the national legal and regulatory environment forbade it.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views expressed by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, and the scrutiny sub-committee of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on this matter. No agreement was reached at the Competitiveness Council on 3 December on the Commission's amended proposal or on the alternative proposal put forward by the Italian Presidency. This is an unfortunate situation. I consider that, given the extensive discussions which have taken place on this issue and the different options which have now been exhaustively explored, it would appear that there is little likelihood, if any, of reaching agreement on the matter of guidelines for this activity within the Framework Programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted with interest the recently published report entitled &ldquo;Food Production and Food Prices in Ireland&rdquo;, which was prepared by Tansey Webster Stewart &amp; Company for RGDATA, IBEC and IADT. The report points to two major factors as contributing significantly to food price inflation in Ireland. These are, first, in the period since 1990, increases in business operating costs in Irish manufacturing, distribution and retailing and, second, in more recent years, the impact on the price of imported food of the depreciation of the euro against sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report confirmed the importance of the food and drinks industry to our economy in terms <Col N="1158" />of employment, exports and consumer spending. Its analysis of food prices and related matters is a valuable contribution to our understanding of many issues in that area. While not necessarily sharing every opinion or impression conveyed by the report, I think a number of useful policy pointers emerge from it including the value of good analytical research, on an ongoing basis, into consumer prices generally. In this regard, I have requested Forfás to follow up its consumer pricing report, 2003, with further prices investigative work focusing on specific sectors.</P>
    <P>The report also identified the importance of keeping under active review the effectiveness of current policy measures and actions in the competition and consumer field, particularly in such an important area for consumers as the food sector. We need to be satisfied that these measures are delivering markets that work for consumers and that consumers are being empowered to be effective participants in the market process. Actions such as the current price awareness campaign of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the ongoing competition enforcement work of the Competition Authority are very relevant to this. The report also noted the importance of pressing ahead with the wider national competitiveness agenda on the lines set out in the two recent reports of the National Competitiveness Council. The Government is committed to enhancing Ireland's competitiveness status and an essential part of this is to provide a business environment with low inflation.</P>

For example, supporters of the order claim that price inflation is higher on items not covered by the order compared to those items covered by it. On the other hand, those seeking the removal of the order suggest that it facilitates resale price maintenance and that prices are probably higher than they otherwise might be.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I recognise also that many EU member states have measures similar to the groceries order with restrictions on below cost selling. It is difficult to establish whether there is any correlation between food prices and the presence or absence of below cost selling restrictions in other member states. I am also aware from the correspondence I have received of the concerns of smaller shops. I believe that these outlets offer a valuable service to local communities in providing a convenient alternative to the multiples. I will continue to take the views of all interested parties into consideration and I will make a decision in this matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have already received a significant amount of correspondence from interested parties, including members of the Oireachtas, on the consultation process. I have arranged for my officials to prepare a schedule of those parties who have made representations and this will be forwarded in the near future.</P>

      <P>Ireland, in common with other developed economic regions, is faced with the challenge of ensuring its future economic prosperity against a backdrop of rising costs at home and increasing competition from abroad, the inevitable corollary of globalisation and advances in technology. As other sources of competitive advantage come under pressure, skills are assuming an ever-greater importance for our future economic development.</P>
      <P>The expert group on future skills needs, since its establishment in 1997, has had a considerable input to skills and education policy. The fourth report of the expert group, published in October 2003, outlines a range of specific actions to ensure that an inadequate supply of skills does not hinder our economic growth. The report brought together, in summary form, all the individual pieces of research undertaken by the expert group over the period 2002 to 2003 and addresses the future skills needs of key sectors in the Irish economy including ICT, biotechnology, construction, and food processing, and occupations such as engineering and financial services. The report makes recommendations to both education and business to ensure an adequate supply of skills in these areas. The group's recommendations for the overall labour market focus primarily on increasing the proportion of highly skilled workers in the labour force by: upskilling, reskilling improving the quality of the vocational systems, increasing the proportion of third-level science and engineering graduates, efforts to improve the take-up of further education for disadvantaged groups, and establishing a more targeted immigration policy.</P>
      <P>Ensuring the availability of an appropriate skilled workforce is the shared responsibility of employers, the State and employees. The continuing focus for the Department will be to encourage and support the skills agenda through education and training and through the operations of a flexible economic immigration policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 164 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>Maintaining Ireland's attractiveness as a profitable European location from which to do business is a key priority for both the Government and my Department. However, it is that our economy is undergoing fundamental change and we can no longer be seen as a low cost location for basic manufacturing investment. Our strength and competitive advantages <i>vis-à-vis</i> emerging economies and rapidly developing overseas growth centres has changed considerably over the past few years. Primarily, this arises because we have become a modern, advanced European economy. Consequently, competing in international markets with low value added services or low technology, basic manufacturing industrial activity, no longer matches the competitive characteristics of doing business in modern Ireland. In a globalising business world it is inevitable that the investment decisions of some companies will be influenced by the competitive attractions of alternative business locations. My Department and its agencies are acutely aware of this and what business needs to tackle this reality. However, no measure is available to accurately quantify jobs that may have relocated to other countries.</P>
      <P>We must acknowledge that Ireland operates in a global economy and that market forces influencing investment decisions will be both pervasive and unrelenting. Our response needs to be strategic yet reflect the business needs of companies. A key element of the Government's strategy to help enterprise is to encourage increased levels of investment in research, business-related technological development and innovation across all enterprise sectors. This will assist firms to produce improved, value added products and services. In the long-term, this will provide more sustainable and higher quality jobs. To this end, the budget for Enterprise Ireland targeted at increasing research and innovation in Irish companies, has been significantly increased in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year Enterprise Ireland launched a new financial support package for indigenous industry to assist with clients' development needs. The <Col N="1164" />agency has also launched the &euro;10 million competitiveness fund, designed to build competitiveness in small and medium enterprises, particularly those that have found new product development a difficult process. The development of export markets is also a critical factor in sustaining indigenous companies and Enterprise Ireland's range of supports is designed to help Irish businesses broaden their reach into competitive and demanding, but more profitable overseas markets.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Science Foundation Ireland has been set up to administer the &euro;646 million technology foresight fund to support world-class research that will be the genesis of future innovation and new technologies. This fund is intended to drive long-term growth and competitiveness by helping attract new high technology firms to Ireland and strengthening the capabilities of existing foreign and Irish owned enterprises.</P>
    <P>We are also implementing a careful progression in the sophistication and breadth of higher value activities that foreign owned companies carry out here. IDA Ireland has responded to the new &ldquo;value added imperative&rdquo; by attracting firms working with new technologies or involved in higher value activities. I am glad to observe that the higher priority my Department accords to quality inward investment projects is reflected in a number of superior, new strategic projects that have been secured. Furthermore, good success has been achieved by IDA Ireland in encouraging their clients to undertake more important strategic research and development in their Irish operations.</P>
    <P>Recent innovations in the support package available to investors, such as the changes to the taxation treatment for head office operations and research and development, clearly demonstrate the high priority Government accords to ensuring that Ireland aligns its business supports to the competitive requirements of doing business here.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of the Deputies about the impact of international market forces on enterprise in Ireland and I want to see new foundations for enterprise policy that will help create the conditions to support a sustained shift to a higher skilled, higher value added and a more knowledge intensive enterprise economy. In this connection, I have recently set up a new enterprise strategy group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Eoin O'Driscoll, to recommend and prioritise new strategies and policies to ensure that the enterprise prosperity we enjoyed in the last decade will continue into the future. I have asked the group to examine the issues that need to be taken into account to help strengthen our enterprise environment, to promote a very different innovation and knowledge driven economy and help sustain those industries already providing employment here, as well as addressing the competitive challenges presented by developing economies elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There have been job gains and losses over the last five years. While figures for 2003 are not yet <Col N="1165" />available, it is expected that the uncertain global climate, which has continued through much of the year will impact on employment in companies supported by my Department's agencies. While net employment growth in the period 1998 to 2000 was strong, we could not expect to be insulated from declining global growth. This is reflected in some employment reduction in client companies of the agencies for 2001 and 2002. However, these companies generated over 30,500 new jobs in 2001 and almost 25,600 in 2002. In the context of difficult economic conditions, should properly be viewed as considerable achievement. The impact of the global economic slowdown on firms ability to sustain and expand employment has been undeniable, and the Deputies should note that current levels still represent a 50% increase in employment in the space of a decade.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 171 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with information on public liability insurance costs. The CSO publishes monthly indices of costs for motor insurance. These statistics show there was an increase of 37.6 index points, or 54.4%, in motor insurance between October 1998 and October 2002. I am pleased to report that there was a reduction of 8.4 index points, or 7.9%, in motor insurance between October 2002 and October 2003.</P>
      <P>On 1 May 2003, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, came into operation. It has a wide regulatory remit, covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services, including insurance, and the services provided by it. One of the recommendations in the report of the motor insurance advisory board relates to gathering of statistics on motor insurance and claims costs by IFSRA.</P>
      <P>The annual insurance report contains information on aggregate insurance premiums paid to insurance companies in respect of various classes of business. Responsibility for publishing this report has transferred from my Department to IFSRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents Governments from intervening directly in the matter. However, I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and the difficulties it is causing. The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October 2002 comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. Indica<Col N="1167" />tions to date are that the reform programme is having its desired effect, as is illustrated by the reductions in motor premia to which I have already referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of an interim national commonage framework plan introduced in October 1998, farmers with commonage land in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, who were not then participating in the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, were obliged to reduce their ewe numbers by up to 30% of their existing permanent quota and up to 30% of their permanent quota was frozen pending the completion of detailed commonage framework plans for individual commonages.</P>
      <P>The person named held a ewe quota of 170 premium rights in 1998 and under the interim national commonage framework plan, 51 of his quota was frozen pending the outcome of the commonage framework plans proper.</P>
      <P>When the commonage framework plans were published in February 2002, the quota position of every farmer with commonage land was reviewed to reflect the actual destocking percentage recommended under those plans. In this case, the recalculation showed that the person named was overstocked by 97 sheep and this would required destocking of a further 46 sheep which would leave him with a quota of 73. He opted to have this calculation further reviewed by a registered planner and this review resulted in a revised destocking figure of 84 which would leave him with a quota of 86, which is 170 less 84, for 2003. The person named agreed to that reduction in March 2003.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for the 2003 ewe premium scheme in respect of 170 ewes but the 2003 ewe premium can only be paid up to the level of his existing quota of 86. He was paid the 2003 ewe premium on 86 ewes on 21 October 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers on the commonage which forms part of the holding of the person named have lodged an appeal with the commonage appeals board to have the level of destocking reviewed. His quota <Col N="1171" />cannot be reviewed until that appeal has been heard.</P>

The person named has slaughtered 158 animals under the 2003 slaughter premium scheme using the old herd number.

      <P>The person named participated in 2002 extensification premium and opted for the census system to determine the stocking density of his holding. Based on the numbers of bovine animals over the age of six months declared by him at the five census dates for 2002, the stocking density was 1.6035 livestock units per hectare. Under the relevant EU regulation, the Department is required to carry out stocking density cross-checks prior to payment to ensure that stocking density limits are observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of the cross-check, the livestock unit value of the number of bovine animals over the age of six months declared by the person named at the second and fourth census dates was substituted with the numbers found as per the CMMS animal database at the same two dates. When this was done the stocking density of the holding increased to a figure greater than 1.80 livestock units per hectare. Under EU regulations, where the stocking density of a holding is greater than 1.80 livestock units per hectare, extensification premium cannot be paid. In late September, a letter and a herd profile was posted to the person named. The herd profile set out by livestock unit category the ear tag number and date of birth of each animal found per CMMS to have been present on the holding on the second and fourth census dates. The person named <Col N="1174" />brought to the notice of the Department some discrepancies that appeared on the profiles. When these were corrected and the cross-check carried out again, the stocking density of the holding was found to have been 1.8665 livestock units per hectare. In view of the fact that the stocking density of the holding is still greater than 1.80 livestock units per hectare, the person named cannot be considered for payment of 2002 extensification premium.</P>

      <Quest>the position under the full decoupling arrangements that pertains to farmers who have been engaged in bed and breakfast operations for a number of years, and who therefore would have very little entitlements for themselves in 2005, and in this context, would be compelled under the current arrangements to farm their full holding to receive their limited entitlements; if in this context, they would be entitled to special arrangements or treatment from the National Reserve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>With effect from 2005, the decoupled payment, which is to be known as the single payment scheme, is to be based on the average number of animals or the average number of hectares, in the case of arable aid, on which payments were made under the livestock premia and arable aid schemes in respect of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The single payment is calculated by taking the three yearly average number of animals and arable hectares which attracted payment and multiplying them by the payment rate for 2002 in respect of livestock or by &euro;383.04 per hectare in the case of arable aid. Entitlements are established by dividing this single payment amount by the average number of hectares declared on the area aid applications over the three-year period. Farmers for whom entitlements have been established must activate those entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and submitting an area aid declaration in that year.</P>
      <P>Under the European Council regulation, farmers must have an eligible hectare in respect of each payment entitlement. There is no provision in the Council regulation to provide special treatment to farmers in the circumstances described by the Deputy. While the criteria for allocating entitlements from the national reserve is not yet available, the regulation specifies that new entrants to farming who commenced their farming activity after 31 December 2002 will have priority access. Other groups to whom allocations from the reserve can be made will be specified in the European Commission's detailed rules regulation, which is not expected to be published for some weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on the detailed rules regulation will get under way at official level. It is unlikely <Col N="1175" />that final agreement will be reached before April 2004.</P>

      <P>The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, received grant assistance of &euro;601,977 from my Department in 2002. This payment represented an increase in funding of just over 35% on the previous year.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1997, there has been an ongoing transfer of functions and associated costs from my Department to the ICBF. In 2001, provision was made in the Estimates for &euro;994,000 to meet the additional costs associated with the total transfer to the ICBF of responsibility for beef bull performance testing and the operations of the Tully bull performance testing station in Kildare. However, as the take-over did not take place until September, which was much later in the year than anticipated, a reduced allocation of &euro;601,977 was provided to cover the shorter period of responsibility.</P>

      <P>Since 1997, Exchequer funding has been paid to local authorities to help them meet their statutory obligations to inspect and certify meat at domestic abattoirs and other ancillary activities. Following the establishment of the FSAI, the local authorities commenced working under service contract to that body from 5 July 1999. My Department continued to be the route through which Exchequer funding was paid to local authorities until 31 December 2002, when this role transferred to my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, who has since had responsibility for the matter.</P>
      <P>Funding paid to local authorities under these arrangements in respect of 2002 was &euro;6.321million an increase of 9% over 2001. This was mainly due to salary increases arising from national wage agreements and increases arising from ongoing development of the service.</P>

      <P>The provision in question relates to the development of organic farming and, in particular, to payments made by my Department, as the competent authority, to three private certification bodies. These bodies are approved to perform the inspection and certification of organic operations. Standards for organic crop produce have been fixed since 1992 by Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91. With effect from 24 August 2000, Council Regulation 1804/99, which supplemented Regulation 2092/91, brought organic livestock and livestock produce within the ambit of EU rules. This made it necessary for my Department to make arrangements for the inspection and certification of organic livestock operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's proposals in this respect became the subject of a judicial review sought by one of the three private bodies. During 2001, the three bodies continued to be approved to inspect crop produce only for which they received a subvention of some &euro;45,000. In anticipation of an early High Court judgment, I provided &euro;100,000 in 2002 for the subvention of inspections in both the organic and crop sectors. Judgment was not eventually delivered until 2003, however. During 2002, the private bodies continued to inspect the crop sector only. As a result, they received a subvention of some &euro;50,000. Discussions are currently taking place between my Department and <Col N="1177" />the three bodies with a view to extending approval to carry out livestock inspections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>The amounts in question were used to cover, in part, the cost of creation, maintenance and further enhancement of the computerised cattle monitoring system, CMMS, and the development and integration with CMMS of the animal health computer system, AHCS. Bovine animal identification and tracing is a key element of the national beef assurance scheme. The uses and value of the system have gone well beyond the original design. The primary aim of CMMS was to provide a comprehensive central database of the origin, identity and life history of cattle. The extent and accuracy of data now available allows it to be used for other applications. The system is used increasingly and systematically to reduce the burden of paperwork for farmers, notably, through the elimination or simplification of application forms for livestock premiums, the establishment of premium entitlements direct from the system and the provision of ongoing data to farmers on the number and status of animals in their herds. The system is also routinely used to identify and trace cattle for disease control purposes &ndash; contact tracing for BSE and brucellosis. It provides general assurances to consumers about the origin and identification of Irish beef and is employed as a marketing tool by Ireland's beef export industry. It is used to assist in the testing and certification requirements of a variety of schemes such as certification of beef for Russia, determination of age for BSE testing etc.</P>
      <P>The scheme has become an integral part of the ante-mortem process at factories and pre-clearance for live exports to the extent that neither can function in the absence of the system. It fulfils Ireland's EU identification obligations and cross-compliance obligations and acts as a management tool to highlight and follow up anomalies in animal origin and location. Its most recent use is as a statistical tool to assist the industry in making informed decisions about breeding and production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The table below outlines the main areas of expenditure in the period from 1998 to 2001. Development of CMMS commenced in late 1997. <Col N="1178" />It required the purchase and installation by the Department of computer equipment and communications lines in over 100 livestock marts, 45 export approved factories and 30 live export points. It also involved the payment of grant assistance to factories, export points, marts and local authority abattoirs to help meet the cost of accommodation for computer equipment and to acquire additional computer hardware, software and ancillary equipment to enable them to transmit data. The bulk of this work took place in 1999 which accounts, in part, for the increase in expenditure in 1999 over 1998. In addition, in 1999, an amount of &euro;1.3 million was used to print and supply an on-farm herd register to all registered cattle keepers.</P>
    <P>In 2000, with a view to improving the accuracy of the database, a project was undertaken to exchange old hand-written cattle identity cards for pre-printed, bar-coded cards. This project had the effect of populating the database in respect of older animals whose existence had not been recorded previously. The bulk of expenditure on this project occurred in 2001. This accounts, in part, for the increase in expenditure in 2001 over 2000. In addition, a herd reconciliation exercise, or mini-census, was conducted with herd owners in 2001 to confirm the extent of the then current cattle population and to update, where necessary, the location of these animals in a particular herd. In 2001, there was a significant increase in capital investment on development of the animal health computer system.</P>

      <P>This increase took place against the background of a review of the Department's IT, undertaken during 1999 as part of a broader systems review of the Department. As a result of this review a new IT strategy was developed which recommended major investment in IT. It made wide-ranging recommendations with regard to upgrading IT infrastructure and implementing major new corporate systems. An IT work programme was developed, as part of this strategy, which identified some 34 IT projects to be implemented over a four to five year period. The recommendations of the review and the new IT strategy were acted upon without delay and work on the implementation of the IT work programme commenced during 2000. This involved the outsourcing of some IT projects, which led to this increased expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have placed a high priority on improving Ireland's animal identification and traceability systems and I am determined to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control, and remains at the forefront in terms of consumer assurance and food safety. In the wake of the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001, and against a backdrop of earlier unsuccessful efforts in this regard, I introduced a comprehensive individual sheep identification system, the national sheep identification system, NSIS, which provides full individual identification and traceability of sheep from farm of origin to carcass and which is designed to be multi-functional, facilitating aspects such as flock management, consumer assurance and disease monitoring and control. In the latter regard, the foot and mouth disease crisis underscored the potential damage to which our economy and the agriculture sector would be exposed in the event of serious disease outbreaks if shortcomings in animal identification and traceability were not addressed. Based on monitoring of NSIS and feedback to my Department from various quarters since 2001, I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are now firmly bedded in across the sheep sector and working well. I have, however, made it clear consistently that I am always willing to enhance and improve NSIS and to address any operational difficulties which might arise, while maintaining its key components.</P>
      <P>A new harmonised system of identification for the whole of the European Union has been proposed by the EU Commission. The current proposals provide that there will be electronic individual identification of sheep from January 2008, together with a central movement database recording movements on a batch basis. The implementation date is subject to review following a Commission report in 2006. For the interim period it is proposed that all sheep be double tagged and identified individually, but that all recording would be on a flock basis, in line with the vote of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is anticipated that the final form of the proposal, on which the Italian Presidency is working and which it hopes to bring before the December Council of Agriculture Ministers, will afford member states which already have systems in place offering a higher level of traceability than would be the case under the interim period system the option of retaining their own systems <Col N="1181" />until the advent of electronic identification in a few years from now.</P>
    <P>I support the broad principle which underlies these proposals. In particular, I believe that it is necessary to have in place a robust, harmonised system of sheep identification backed up with good record-keeping allowing full traceability of animal movements at all times. I have always been in favour of making use of new and efficient technologies to achieve this end, subject of course to practicalities and cost-effectiveness and I would be very anxious that Ireland and other member states would be in a position to move at the earliest possible date to an electronic system. In the interim, however, I believe that the system now in place and operating throughout the Irish sheep sector will continue to afford Ireland the level of protection and assurance with regard to both identification and traceability which I believe is strategically appropriate to this country.</P>
    <P>I have no plans, therefore, to dismantle NSIS and roll back the progress which has been made in this area since 2001, only to see Irish sheep farmers, marts, meat processors, etc. being asked a few years from now to once again reinstate and accommodate individual identification and traceability, by the 2008 target date for the introduction of electronic systems. However as I stated before, I am willing to examine and address aspects relating to the operation of NSIS in so far as these be addressed within the community system that is put in place.</P>

      <P>In order to ensure that the highest standards of welfare are accorded to animals during transport, legislation in the form of S.I. No. 98 of 1995, S.I. No. 326 of 1997 and S.I. No. 215 of 2001 was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vehicles which are used solely for the transport of animals up to a maximum distance of 50 km from the start of the transport of the animals to the place of destination do not require registration for livestock transport purposes under the above legislation. However, all vehicles used for the transport of livestock should be safe for the animals and well maintained so as to reduce the risk of discomfort or injury during transport. The <Col N="1183" />vehicle must also ensure livestock safety during loading, transit and unloading so as to afford animals protection from unnecessary suffering, injury and from the weather.</P>
    <P>In an effort to raise awareness of these legal requirements, my Department conducted a poster campaign in livestock marts in January 2002. My Department also notified manufacturers of transport vehicles of both national and EU requirements in July 2002. In 2002 a pamphlet entitled Guidelines For Animal Welfare During Transport Within Ireland was published and issued to all herdowners. I can arrange to make a copy of this available to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>This is an important aspect of farm animal welfare and my Department will continue efforts to bring about the necessary improvements whenever significant shortcomings are evident. It is important to say that standards generally in Ireland in this area have been improving and I do not believe that Irish livestock producers generally have anything to fear from continuing improvement.</P>

      <P>The next stage of this process under the Arterial Drainage Acts would be to bring both schemes forward to statutory public exhibition.

The work of the review group has now been completed and will be submitted to Government shortly. The findings of the review group will have an important influence on the whole flood management area in the future. The progression of the proposed schemes in Mallow and Fermoy will, therefore, depend first, on the recommendations contained in the flood policy review and, second, the availability of the necessary capital funding over the next few years for flood relief schemes.</P>

The first transfer of moneys to the fund in respect of dormant assurance policies is scheduled to take place in April 2004.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a claim for a refund of PRSI was received from the person concerned on 24 November 2003. The claim, which arises because the person received survivors' pension, relates to the period between 1987 and 2002. The supporting documentation supplied with the claim covers the period between the tax years of 1997-98 and 2002, however. The claim has now been processed in so far as the latter period is concerned and a refund of &euro;2,016.58 for this period will issue shortly. In respect of the earlier period, however, arrangements are being made to verify the PRSI deductions that were actually made. This will take some additional time to resolve because the claim dates back 15 years. The Revenue Commissioners will arrange for any additional refund that may be due after this information has been established. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person in question may be due a further PRSI refund in respect of part-time employment in recent years. As refunds in such cases are dealt with by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the relevant papers have been forwarded to it for consideration of any possible further refund.</P>

I am determined that implementation of the decentralisation plan will proceed without delay. I have provided an additional &euro;20 million in my Department's Vote to that end, to meet any upfront investment required in 2004. Furthermore, every Minister is expected to take responsibility for the part of the programme which relates to his or her Department or the agencies which come within his or her remit.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I published a carbon energy tax consultation paper prepared by my Department on 31 July last, following my budget statement regarding carbon energy taxation in December 2002. The consultation paper was designed to facilitate discussion on the introduction and design of the carbon energy tax while recognising that there are divergent views on the issue. Submissions in response to the paper were invited from interested parties to be received by my Department by 30 September 2003, but additional time has been given to organisations that need it in order to complete their submissions. Some 116 submissions have been received by my Department in response to the carbon taxation consultation paper to date. A decision on the details of a carbon energy tax will be informed by the consultation process under way. The most recent step in this process is the examination of submissions received by the Department. All relevant issues, including the effect of carbon energy tax on those on low incomes, will be taken into account in the consideration of the proposal.</P>

      <P>The decentralisation programme takes account of the national spatial strategy by locating 2,650 of the 10,300 jobs to locations identified in the strategy as gateways or hubs. The attached table sets out the locations of the 2,650 jobs. Some 2,800 civil servants work in existing decentralised offices in gateways or hubs, excluding the cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway. Other public servants also work in these locations. The spatial strategy recognised that balanced regional development is not all about gateways and hubs. It identified the need to strengthen the county town and large town structure and the need for a renewed emphasis on the potential of the small town and village structure. Virtually all of the locations included in the programme are mentioned in section 4 of the spatial strategy, which outlines how each region will participate in the strategy.<Col N="1191" /></P>

      <P>The &euro;280.6 million in question is not technically appropriations-in-aid but relates to additional social insurance fund expenditure, or the SIF element of the budget day social welfare spending package. The Estimates and the budget are presented on the basis of gross expenditure, because it provides a more complete picture of overall Government expenditure. The Exchequer balance is a net figure, however. Accordingly, the appropriations-in-aid figure is increased by the amount of additional spending from the social insurance fund so that there is no impact on net voted spending or the bottom line Exchequer balance position. The gross cost of the social welfare package announced on budget say is &euro;607.9 million. Of this total, some &euro;327.3 million in assistance and grant payments will be funded by the Exchequer through the Vote for the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Vote 38. The &euro;280.6 million cost of increases in insurance and benefit payments is funded from the social insurance fund.</P>

      <P>Since the announcement in the 2000 budget, made in December 1999, to proceed with a new, more radical programme of decentralisation, my Department has received submissions, representations and enquiries on behalf of more than 130 centres throughout the country. Representations were made by a significant number of groups and individuals, including the person concerned, seeking decentralisation of Departments or offices to County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the summary of 2004 budget measures, which sets out at page B.25 the wide range of factors which have been taken into account and balanced against each other in selecting Departments and agencies for decentralisation and locations for the new decentralised offices. Having taken all the criteria into account, the Government has decided to decentralise 140 staff of the NSAI to Arklow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, or INCB, wrote to the Department of Foreign Affairs on 22 September 2003 following reports in several Irish newspapers that the Government was considering the possibility of opening so-called &ldquo;consumption rooms&rdquo; for heroin users. In its letter, the INCB drew attention to Article 4 of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which obligates state parties to ensure that &ldquo;the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs&rdquo; is &ldquo;limited exclusively to medical and scientific purposes&rdquo;, and to Article 35 of the same convention which obligates state parties to &ldquo;make arrangements at the national level for co-ordination of preventive and repressive action against the illicit traffic&rdquo; in drugs. The INCB requested further information on the status of the issue in Ireland and urged the Government to ensure full compliance with the international drug control conventions.</P>
      <P>Ireland's policy on illicit drugs is set out in the national drugs strategy for 2001 to 2008. That strategy examined the issue of heroin prescription and drug consumption rooms and considered that the introduction of those forms of treatment was not warranted. However, the strategy called for the issue to be kept under review and for the results of research, both national and international, to be monitored. In that context my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Deputy Noel Ahern, had discussions with his German counterpart on the experiences in mainland Europe of a variety of drug treatment options. Following those discussions, the Minister of State decided to visit Germany to view a range of drug treatment facilities, including drug-free projects and low threshold facilities. That visit took place between 23 and 25 September, during which he visited several facilities, including a drug consumption room and a heroin prescription programme in Frankfurt, similar facilities to those which, I believe, have also been visited by the INCB. I can confirm that there are no plans to introduce such facilities here. Ireland remains fully committed to complying with the international drug control conventions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding arrangements for voluntary secondary schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants for secretarial and caretaking services. There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. In the context of the 2004 Estimates, I recently announced a further improvement in the <i>per capita</i> grant to &euro;274 per pupil, as against the rate of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997. That increase will bring the grant to &euro;312 in the case of disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of &euro;25 per pupil that was introduced for second level schools in September 2000 was increased to &euro;89 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by &euro;10 per pupil from January last to &euro;99 per pupil. In the case of voluntary secondary schools, the grant was increased by a further &euro;28 to &euro;117 in September 2002, bringing the support services grant in the case of such schools to &euro;127 per pupil from January last. In the context of the 2004 Estimates, the grant will be further increased to &euro;131 per pupil. That increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, or &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;105,684 per annum and annual grants of &euro;242,501, or &euro;261,551 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of those resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. That is in general a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives, including that referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" />Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In that context, the Tánaiste has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. The Government considers that those measures constitute a programme that is capable of delivering very real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums. I am committed to improving further the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in the light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Courses specifically designed to cater for teachers trained outside Ireland who wish to sit for the scrúdú le haghaidh cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG, are run by a number of education centres throughout the country. Funding towards the running of these courses, among others, is provided to education centres by my Department. The question of course provision and the level of courses provided is a matter for decision by the education centres and is influenced by demand for such courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I established a working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the scrúdú le haghaidh cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge in 2001. Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann, the colleges of education, primary school management organisations, the INTO, the National Parents Council &ndash; primary &ndash; and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment all were represented on this working group. Organisations were invited to submit proposals as part of the review of the SCG <Col N="1199" />and all such proposals were given full consideration by the working group in preparing its report. The report of the working group has now been finalised and is being presented to my Department. To date, the review group has drafted a revised syllabus. The revised syllabus was circulated to all schools in December, 2002 and the SCG examinations held on 29, 30 and 31 October, 2003 were the first series of SCG examinations to be based on this syllabus.</P>
    <P>The review group has also drafted a handbook for the examination. The handbook will contain detailed information on the SCG and will provide answers to a wide range of questions raised by candidates. The review committee is also recommending changes to the content and format of the examination modules to take effect possibly from autumn of 2004. It is also planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose.</P>
    <P>Candidates for the SCG are expected to have knowledge of the teaching methods of Irish as a mother tongue and as a second language to primary school children, and of strategies to promote the use of Irish as a language of communication and as a teaching medium. The standard required to obtain a pass in the SCG is the standard of Irish that would enable teachers to teach the language to sixth class in a national school. Candidates must, therefore, demonstrate that they have attained the level of language competence described in the syllabus and reflected in the examination papers, and that they understand the methodology of teaching Irish as a second language.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that many primary schools not only teach Irish but have Irish as the principal language of instruction and communication generally. The number of such schools has grown significantly in recent years. A primary teacher may have to teach pupils whose mother tongue is Irish, or who are competent users of the language. Even when teaching Irish to pupils whose mother tongue is English or another language, it is widely accepted by language teachers that, in order to be effective, the teacher needs to have a very good command of the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>The specific information which the Deputy requires on the transfer rate over the past five years is not available. However, the latest information, published in the NESF report 2002 on early school leaving estimated that approximately 1,000 children do not transfer from primary to post-primary on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently completing analysis work on the development of a primary pupils database. A project team, overseen by a steering group, has been assigned to work on the development of this key resource, which will facilitate the collation of comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future. A number of programmes operate at both primary and post-primary level that are designed to tackle the problem of early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Expenditure on this programme in 2003 will be in excess of &euro;17 million.</P>
      <P>A key role in this regard is also played by the home-school-community liaison scheme, which has been extended to each of the 311 designated disadvantaged primary schools in the country. This scheme helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also operates transfer programmes to help primary school pupils to make the transition to post primary level. Expenditure on this scheme will be in the region of &euro;7 million in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving 82 projects &ndash; 296 primary and 109 post primary schools &ndash; parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. It entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and <Col N="1202" />outcomes. Total funding of &euro;23 million was provided for the programme in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Education Welfare Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The strategies will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. A budget of &euro;5.4 million has been allocated to the board for the current year.</P>
    <P>There are five youth encounter projects, YEPs, three in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick, which are supported by my Department to provide educational facilities for young people aged between ten and 15 years who have become alienated from the conventional mainstream education system. Many of the pupils are persistent truants and have become involved in, or are at risk of becoming involved in minor crime and delinquency. The primary objective of the youth encounter projects is to rehabilitate these pupils and return them to mainstream education in the shortest time possible. The projects liaise closely with specified schools in their catchment areas. A total of &euro;915,000 was allocated to youth encounter projects for 2003. Such concentrated and focused deployment of funds should effectively assist in redressing the problem of early school leaving.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 to 254, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not operate a specific national scheme for the provision of homework clubs. However, a range of schemes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage under which resources are allocated for the provision of a range of holistic supports to enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in school.</P>
      <P>The school completion programme, which currently supports 82 projects, involves 296 primary schools and 109 post primary schools. The SCP aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. There are six school completion programme sites in the Dublin south west-Tallaght area, targeting approximately 1,394 children most at risk of early school leaving, have been allocated a total of &euro;1,211,000 for 2003-2004. Each project site must submit a retention plan, devising a collaborative programme of in-school and out-of-school actions, which provide after-school, holiday time, home, family and community supports to enhance the young person's readiness to benefit from education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to determine the number of staff working in homework clubs as a combination of full time, part time and voluntary staff provide this support. A total of 2,351 primary schools are participating in Giving Children an Even Break and are in receipt of additional sup<Col N="1204" />ports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. After-school support services, which include literacy and numeracy, personal development, leisure and sporting activities are among the supports provided under this initiative.</P>
    <P>My Department has also provided funding for homework clubs in disadvantaged areas under the fund for the development of targeted responses to certain children at risk. This fund is the responsibility of my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. Its purpose is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. In addition, many of the area partnership companies have provided homework support under their education measures.</P>

      <P>The post leaving certificate review was commissioned by my Department to examine the sector and make recommendations as necessary regarding the organisational, support, development, technical and administrative structures and resources required in schools with large scale post leaving certificate, PLC, provision.

      <P>The recommendations in the report are wide-ranging and encompass proposals which extend beyond PLC provision, including issues which impact on the shaping of structures for the delivery of further and adult education into the future, and on other sectors of the education system. During October 2003, in separate meetings, officials in my Department met with the management and staff representative interests in the sector to examine their respective priorities and to consider issues surrounding a number of the recommendations of the report as well as areas of common interest, having regard to the implications for other areas of the education system. Each side has agreed to review their position with regard to prioritisation of the recommendations. Further exploratory meetings with relevant stakeholders in the sector will be necessary in the period ahead in connection with this report.</P>

      <P>I established a working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge in 2001. Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann, the colleges of education, primary school management organisations, the INTO, the National Parents Council, primary, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were all represented on this working group. Organisations were invited to submit proposals as part of the review of the SCG and all such proposals were given full consideration by the working group in preparing its report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the working group has now been finalised and is being presented to my Department. To date, the review group has drafted a revised syllabus. The revised syllabus was circulated to all schools in December 2002 and the SCG examinations held on 29, 30 and 31 October 2003 were the first series of SCG examinations to be based on this syllabus. The review group has also drafted a handbook for the examination. The handbook will contain detailed information on <Col N="1205" /><Col N="1206" />the SCG and will provide answers to a wide range of questions raised by candidates. The review committee is also recommending changes to the content and format of the examination modules to take effect possibly from autumn 2004. It is also planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The stay in school retention initiative, SSRI, which is now a strand of the wider school completion programme, provides funding to targeted second level schools to empower them to tackle early school leaving. At the core of the initiative are multi-annual retention plans drawn up by the individual schools and agreed by the Department. These provide for a range of specific measures directed at the particular needs of individual schools, together with clear targets in terms of increased retention up to the end of senior cycle. The overall aim of the allocation is to improve the retention rate of pupils from homes in disadvantaged areas in post-compulsory education programmes and encourage them to avail of the opportunities to develop their educational potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools were selected to participate in the stay in school retention initiative based on my Department's records of school retention rates. A total of 118 schools participated in the stay in school retention initiative, 44 of which, located in RAPID areas, received £40,000, &euro;50,790, for each <Col N="1210" />of the school years 2000-01 and 2001-02, respectively.</P>
    <P>In 2002, my Department amalgamated the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative under the aegis of the school completion programme and provided for the funding of extra projects. The amalgamated initiative incorporates the learning, experience and best practice from the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the SSRI. It covers both primary and post-primary levels and is focused on young people between the ages of four and 18 years. The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the national development plan, NDP, with assistance from the European Social Fund, ESF.</P>
    <P>Sites for participation in the school completion programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using my Department's post primary pupils database. This analysis also identified their main feeder primary schools. Having regard to the amount of funding available to this programme, 82 project sites, including 32 of the SSRI schools in RAPID areas and their associated feeder primary schools, were selected to participate in the school completion programme. The annual allocation for each of these sites ranges from &euro;140,000 to &euro;325,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 82 project sites, my Department continues to support the remaining 53 second level schools previously in the SSRI under the stay in school retention strand of the school completion programme. These 53 schools did not qualify for inclusion in the main project strand of the initiative. Of the 53, 12 are in RAPID areas and they received &euro;50,790 each in 2002-03. It was decided to fund the 53 schools involved on a phasing-out basis to 2005, as the available evidence shows that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated services approach involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. This is the approach, which my Department is now taking to address the problem of early school leaving, which replaces the previous process of funding individual second level schools, under the stay in school retention initiative.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering the inclusion of further schools in the project strand of the school completion programme. Some of the remaining 53 SSRI schools could qualify for inclusion in the project strand and they will be notified of the outcome as soon as the process is completed.</P>

      <P>A summary document in the context of special educational needs, SEN, is a document completed by the relevant professional which summarises the outcome of a full professional assessment or report. The purpose of the report is to assist the school authorities in making an application for SEN supports. However, this document is not sufficient to enable an application to be reviewed and processed by the Department's professional staff. My Department has since received a full professional report in support of the application already made for SEN supports for the pupil in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for SEN supports received between 14 February 2003 and 31 August 2003 are being examined at present on the basis of the supporting professional reports and in the context of resources already available at the school. The process involves an examination of each application and supporting documentation by a dedicated team of inspectors and psychologists. The application referred to by the Deputy is being considered by the dedicated team and the school <Col N="1214" />concerned will be informed of the outcome as early as possible in the current school year.</P>

      <P>The fairest way to deal with all schools is to have an open and transparent system for deciding priorities. I have published criteria used by my Department for determining priorities. In light of that approach, it would be unfair to all schools for me to become involved in discussions on individual projects.</P>

      <P>The school planning section of my Department is currently framing the capital programme for 2004. In the interest of fairness to all schools, I am not in a position to give details on individual projects until the programme is finalised and published. The Deputy can be assured, however, that every consideration will be given to the proposed works at the Fatima national school in the context of available funding for 2004 and the competing priorities for that funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under present EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, such as public private partnerships, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general government balance, GGB, over the construction phase. The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue and a final report on the matter has not yet been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration of any new PPP projects will also be based on an evaluation of the completed pilot post-primary PPP schools project, together with a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the capital funding envelopes and taking into account the issues surrounding the general <Col N="1215" />government balance. EUROSTAT is currently examining the implication of PPPs on the general government balance.</P>
    <P>My Department is actively considering the use of PPPs in the procurement of both primary and post-primary school accommodation. The decision on how this will proceed will depend to an extent on the final outcome of the EUROSTAT deliberations.</P>

      <P>However, before committing major capital funding to any project my Department must be satisfied, having regard to all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, that the school in question has a viable future, thereby ensuring value for money. When these issues have been fully investigated by my Department, a decision will be made on how best to provide for the school's long-term accommodation needs. My Department officials will be in contact with the school authorities in this regard shortly.</P>

The management should ensure that the proposed development will not affect the running of the school or be a hindrance to future development. Management should also ensure that the additional building has adequate insurance cover.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 49 of the Forestry Act, all lands clear felled under a general felling licence must be replanted. In accordance with section 41 of the Act, replanting obligations are normally attached to limited felling licences. It should also be noted that under section 41 a replanting condition attaching to a limited felling licence can apply to land other than the area felled which is owned by the licensee at the date of grant of the licence.</P>
      <P>However, in accordance with section 41, limited felling licences have issued to Coillte Teoranta without replanting conditions in the following circumstances: silvicultural thinnings; felling to construct forest roads; area felled under an EU LIFE bog restoration project; where lands are transferring to the National Parks and Wildlife Service; where trees are classed as exempt under the Act, for example, dead, decayed or irremediably damaged trees. The above procedures apply to all applications for felling licences.</P>

      <P>The Department's right and duty to manage and protect the State's mineral wealth is enshrined in the Constitution, section 10 of which says that all natural resources belong to the State.

The mining lease of 1968 was subject to a fixed rate of royalty which was not index-linked.</P>

      <P>Safety of the natural gas network is the statutory responsibility of Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, oversees how it discharges that responsibility. Safety is part of the daily operation and of the planning and management of the network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A programme to replace all cast iron pipes over four inches in diameter or serving premises of four or more storeys, instituted in the wake of the Raglan House explosion in the mid-1980s, was completed well within the ten years set for it. Other cast iron mains have been and continue to be replaced in pace with road works, building development and new installations. Approximately 85% of BGE's mains network is now polyethylene pipe. The network is now 8,000 kilometres compared with the 3,000 kilometres when BGE took over from the former town gas companies. In the area of Dublin city between the canals, all cast iron mains have been replaced and <Col N="1228" />work to replace the remaining 1,000 kilometres was scheduled to take a further ten years.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations made to the CER in the report of the investigation into the explosion which destroyed a family home on 2 November was for BGE to consider an accelerated replacement programme in areas liable to subsidence. When the commissioner wrote to me on 26 November, the day he published the report, he indicated that he accepted this recommendation and all the recommendations in the report. BGE had already appointed consultants to assist it in this before the report was published.</P>

In April 2003, Wexford County Council submitted a proposal for funding to carry out works to the inner harbour wall at Courtown at an estimated cost of &euro;800,000. There were no Exchequer moneys available in 2003 for this project. The question of providing funding in the post-2003 period will depend on the amount of Exchequer funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is run on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>One of the stated main objectives of the programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports and recreational sports facilities. In 2001 and 2002 alone, over &euro;77 million was allocated in respect of 815 projects located in areas of disadvantage, representing 58% of total funding provided. My Department continues to evaluate how best to provide for the needs of disadvantaged areas in terms of providing sporting and recreational facilities and increasing participation under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the 2003 sports capital programme, following consultation with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, DCRGA, it was decided that disadvantaged areas were those that have been designated by Government for <Col N="1231" />special support through the schemes administered by the DCRAGA, that is, not only RAPID 1 and RAPID 2 but also local drugs task force areas and CLÁR areas. Applications located in such areas received priority in the assessment process, provided that they met the basic eligibility criteria for the programme as highlighted in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. Applications from RAPID areas which were eligible for assessment and which were endorsed by their local area implementation team received greater priority in the assessment than other applications.</P>
    <P>The designation of disadvantaged areas for the 2004 sports capital programme will be similar to that in 2003. My Department has been singled out for praise by Area Development Management, the agency which administrates the RAPID programme, for this designation and for its ongoing evaluation of how the evaluation of RAPID projects under the sports capital programme can be improved.</P>

The issue of the derogation was examined by the pharmacy review group. Its report was submitted to me at the end of January and I hope to publish it as soon as possible. There has been no change in the legislation affecting EU or EEA qualified pharmacists.</P>

      <P>At my Department's request, the board's chief executive officer set up a group to examine the potential use of the lands and buildings at Myshall. The terms of reference of the group include: identifying the potential health care uses for the property including but not limited to the proposed use of the property by the Irish Society for Autism; to evaluate the feasibility of each of the proposed developments, including having regard to the location, accessibility, scope for future development, capital costs, revenue costs and potential return on investment in both qualitative and quantitative terms; and to prepare a recommendation on what should be done with the property. The board hopes that the group will report back to it by the end of February 2004 at the latest. The group consists of representatives from the board's technical and financial services, in addition to the disability sector.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the use of the property prior to the group reporting back to the board. My Department will continue to work closely with the board on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 2002 the Alliance of Nursing Unions referred a claim for a Dublin weighting allowance to the Labour Relations Commission. The claim was discussed between management and union representatives on 3 December 2002 but no agreement was reached. The matter, along with claims for a 35 hour week and increased shift premiums, was referred to a full hearing of the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court hearing was held on 20 May. Management argued that the claim had been considered by the Public Service Benchmarking Body and that a weighting allowance of &euro;3,000 per annum was a cost increasing claim. Therefore, it was precluded under the stabilisation clause of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The claim for the introduction of a weighting allowance for nurses could not be looked at in isolation from the position of other public servants in the Dublin region. It is estimated that there are approximately 88,000 public servants employed in the Dublin region. The costs of conceding the claim for a Dublin weighting allowance would cost an extra &euro;102 million per annum if conceded to all health service employees in the ERHA. A further cost of &euro;162 million would result if applied to the wider public service in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court issued its recommendation on 18 June. It took the view that the benchmarking body had considered submissions on the issue of Dublin weighting allowances for nurses and had taken them into account when making its judgment. It was accepted by the parties to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the <Col N="1241" />only means of addressing claims was through the benchmarking process and that claims would be dealt with solely within that context. Given the court's judgment that the benchmarking body considered the submissions made on the Dublin weighting allowance, the court did not recommend concession of the unions' claim.</P>

      <P>A range of dental services for adult medical card holders are available under the dental treatment services scheme from participating dentists holding contracts with health boards. The treatments provided include examinations, prophylaxis, fillings, extractions, dentures and x-rays.</P>
      <P>In 2002 my Department provided an additional &euro;6.166 million ongoing funding to the health boards and an authority for the DTSS to meet an increased uptake. This year once-off funding of &euro;3.08 million was made available.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered by the GMS payments board on behalf of boards. It is monitored at a local level by principal dental surgeons with a regional responsibility for the DTSS. The guideline time for replacing dentures is every five years. The time limit may vary by agreement with the principal dental surgeon in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act 1996 is known as accountability legislation. It contains a number of statutory provisions for the income and expenditure of health boards. In effect, health boards or an authority are statutorily obliged to deliver a level of service consistent with their approved allocations. It is a matter for the health boards or an authority to agree their budgets for the DTSS.</P>

It is generally considered to provide good coverage and represents a reasonable balance between convenience to test applicants and the need for economy in delivering the driver testing service.

      <P>The licensing and operation of small public service vehicles, including hackneys, is governed by the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these regulations hackney licences may be granted by local licensing authorities in respect of a particular vehicle. This can only be done following the presentation of a vehicle test certificate and a certificate of suitability issued in respect of the vehicle by the national car testing service, demonstration that the use of the vehicle as a hackney is covered by insurance and the payment of the appropriate licensing fee of &euro;250. A person who uses a wheelchair can be granted a <Col N="1248" />hackney vehicle licence, subject to compliance with these requirements.</P>
    <P>Hackneys, as with all small public service vehicles, may only be driven by persons who hold a current small public service vehicle drivers licence. Under the public service vehicles regulations the consideration of applications for the grant of a small public service vehicle driver's licence is administered by the Garda Commissioner. Applicants are required to have the following: a current driving licence; they must satisfy the Garda Commissioner that they are a fit and proper person to hold a licence to drive a small public service vehicle; have an adequate knowledge of general traffic regulations, the regulations relating to small public service vehicles and the area in which they propose to make services available as a driver of a small public service vehicle. In these circumstances, it is a matter for decision by the Garda Commissioner as to an applicant's suitability for a licence to drive a small public service vehicle.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2003 provides the basis for the operation of roadside preliminary breath testing of drivers by the Garda Síochána for the purpose of establishing whether they have consumed alcohol. The section provides for the replacement of section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, as substituted by section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. It was considered that the wording introduced by section 10 of the 2002 Act was not sufficiently clear and could have prevented the fullest possible application of the system.</P>
      <P>The new provisions, which came into effect on 1 December 2003, extend the basis for the taking of breath specimens to include incidents where the member considers that a driver of the vehicle has been involved in a collision or has committed a traffic offence. This is in addition to the position through which the member must form the opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act 1994 provided for the introduction of evidential breath testing, EBT, by the Garda Síochána. EBT was introduced in 1999 and has been rolled out to 61 Garda stations as part of the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002. It provides that drivers may be required to undergo a breath test in a Garda station, instead of a blood or urine test, following arrest for drunk driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of High Court challenges to the operation of that system have already been successfully defended. Approximately 75 High Court legal challenges to the EBT system are pending. However, the Garda are continuing to use the <Col N="1249" />system in the enforcement of drink driving legislation.</P>

      <P>It is intended that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, subject to his and my approval of the report, will use its findings to issue, as soon as possible, planning guidelines to the local authorities to assist them in their consideration of the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports.</P>

      <P>Following unanimous agreement by the Council of Transport Ministers on 5 June, to give the European Commission a mandate to negotiate an open aviation area, OAA, agreement with the United States, the first round of formal detailed negotiations was held in Washington in early October. A second round of negotiations will take place in Brussels on 9, 10 and 11 December 2003. During these negotiations, a special com<Col N="1250" />mittee made up of all member states will assist the Commission. Ireland is represented on this committee by a senior official from my Department. It is unclear how long these negotiations will take.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the issue of the dual gateway status of Shannon Airport, I must also take account of wider considerations, especially the opportunities for new business for Ireland currently not being exploited due to the limitation on the number of US destinations open to Irish airlines because of that dual gateway policy.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism recommends that my Department should immediately renegotiate the Ireland-US international air agreement in advance of an EU-US agreement to remove the present US gateways restriction.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, change in this area is inevitable. Officials are holding consultations, on my behalf, with the trade unions representing airport staff, and I will shortly consult the new board-designate of Shannon Airport. I have also recently spoken to interest groups from the Shannon region. When these consultations are concluded, I will decide on the next steps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of bus lanes in this country is provided for in the Road Traffic, Traffic and Parking, Regulations 1997, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. These regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.</P>
      <P>An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access.</P>
      <P>I have received many representations seeking to extend access to bus lanes from a wide range of other road users including hackney and limousine operators and motorcyclists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have any immediate proposals to review the question of extending access to bus lanes to other road users. However, as I have <Col N="1251" />already indicated on a previous occasion in this House I will review the question when the number of bus lanes has doubled.</P>

      <P>Penalty point systems are now operating in this country, Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The authorities in all three jurisdictions are actively considering the issue of the introduction of a scheme to provide for the mutual recognition of penalty points between the United Kingdom and Ireland. This consideration is being pursued under the auspices of the British-Irish Council. One of the first matters that will need to be addressed before full mutual recognition can be realised will be the introduction of bilateral recognition of the separate penalty points systems operating in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The issue of the collection of fines generally was addressed in the report of the high level group on the collection of fines. The group was established and chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform arising from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the current system for fine collection. That report did refer to the collection of fines from non-State residents.</P>
      <P>At EU level, a draft framework decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties is currently being negotiated. It is expected that this will be adopted during Ireland's Presidency. The purpose of the instrument, which arises from the programme of mutual recognition, is to provide that a financial penalty, fine, imposed in one member state can be recognised and executed in another and also will include fines relating to road traffic offences. This draft decision is being pursued under the auspices of the Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the complaints from the public regarding the lack of uniformity in regulatory road signs; the action he has taken to compel South Dublin County Council (details supplied) to use speed limit signs which conform to the shape and distinctiveness of standard road signs as set down in the rules of the road; the action he is taking generally to ensure uniformity of road signs in different local authority areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The provision of road traffic signs is a matter for each road authority under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 as amended by section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. That section provides that all traffic signs must be in accordance with traffic signs regulations in the case of all regulatory signs or, in accordance with directions under section 95(16) of that Act in respect of all other traffic signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current parameters set for local authorities for the provision of traffic signs can be found by <Col N="1253" />reference to the Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations of 1997 and 1998 and the Traffic Signs Manual, published in December 1996, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P> South Dublin County Council has made representations to my Department seeking to utilise a new sign format as a repeater speed limit sign. The council were advised that provision had already been made in the traffic signs regulations for a traffic sign to be used for that purpose and that the signs they were proposing did not correspond to those provisions.</P>

    <P>Annual passenger licences issued by my Department are valid for a period of one year. No licences have been withdrawn. The four licences shown as not having been operated, were not renewed and therefore expired one year after issue.</P>
    <P>The company has advised my Department that a controlling interest in the company has been acquired by another party, but the company remains the holder of the current licences.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the value of licences, the attention of the Deputy is drawn to section 18 of the Road Transportation Act 1932 which provides that licences are not transferable by the licensee. They are therefore not tradable commodities. However, the Act gives the Minister discretion to transfer a licence where the ownership of the passenger road service, the subject of the licence, has been transferred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this issue is that a 1983 arbitration finding recommended that certain Garda allowances should be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982. The finding was applied only to personnel who retired on or after that date. The pensionability of the Garda unsocial hours allowance was treated in a similar way when it was introduced. It was applied with effect from 1 January 1994 to personnel who retired or died in service on or after 1 January 1993. The position was consistent with that in other areas of the public service where in the context of making allowances pensionable, the benefits were confined to those retiring after a specified date and did not extend to pensioners who retired before that date.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions, as part of its deliberations, examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for those who had retired prior to the implementation date, in respect of members of the Garda Síochána and others, but, having addressed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved. The concession sought for the Garda allowances could not be confined to the Garda and there could be considerable additional costs with regard to allowances in other areas of the public sector, notably the Defence Forces, teachers and prison officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> A concession in these areas could impose a very significant cost on the State in excess of approximately &euro;12 million a year and an accrued liability <Col N="1255" />of about &euro;152 million, based on 1997 costs for Garda and Defence Forces pensioners outlined in the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions when considering the issue of extending pensionability.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who has overall responsibility for public service pensions, that he has had the matter carefully examined and that he is prepared to make the changes requested by the Garda Síochána Retired Members Association in respect of the pensionability of the Garda allowances.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers. This directive is to be transposed into national law by those member states which are party to the directive by 6 February 2005.</P>
      <P>Article 11 of the directive deals with the question of access by asylum applicants to the labour market. In particular, it provides that &ldquo;Member States shall determine a period of time, starting from the date on which an application for asylum was lodged, during which an applicant shall not have access to the labour market.&rdquo;  The article also provides, <i>inter alia </i>that if a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the presentation of an application and this delay cannot be attributed to the applicant, member states shall decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant. The directive is covered by Title IV of the treaty establishing the European Community and the protocol to that treaty on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Ireland is not party to this directive at present.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for disability equality policy and legislation development, and in that context has in the last number of years, in co-operation with the European Commission, organised the Irish National Information Day on Disability. Each year, a particular theme is chosen for the day. Themes to date have included: &lsquo;Progress Through Partnership' (24 November, 1997); &lsquo;Progress Through Employment' (30 November, 1998); &lsquo;Building a Future Together' (29 November, 1999) and &lsquo;Information Technology &ndash; Access for All' (27 November, 2000). This took place simultaneously in 3 locations &ndash; Dublin, Sligo and Ennis; &lsquo;Design for All' (22 October, 2001); &lsquo;Do they take sugar?' &ndash; a television programme (aired on Network 2 on 3 December, 2002 at 9 p.m.)</P>
      <P>This year, my Department chose to focus the National Information Day on the public sector. More than 200,000 brochures were distributed to public sector employees to inform and raise awareness of disability issues.</P>
      <P>As this year is the designated European Year of People with Disabilities, Ireland, and our EU partners are working together to create awareness about disability issues among the population at large and, more importantly, to promote awareness of the right of people with disabilities to equal opportunities and protection against discrimination. My Department designated the National Disability Authority, NDA, as the national co-ordinating body. The NDA is chairing the national co-ordinating committee which is co-ordinating events for the Year in Ireland. The members of the committee represent disability organisations, the social partners, Government Departments and the media. My Department is represented on the committee which is focusing on four particular themes for the Year; Awareness Raising; Youth and Disability; Rights, Partnership and Responsibilities; and Employment.</P>
      <P>The committee is supporting a wide ranging programme of projects nationwide to highlight the aims of the Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department funded other initiatives and events to publicise the Year including the &ldquo;Youth &ndash; Beyond Disability&rdquo; seminars, organised by People with Disabilities in Ireland; a calendar, in conjunction with PwDI; and the &ldquo;Design for All&rdquo;<Col N="1257" />exhibition in partnership with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>While my Department has been active in promoting disability awareness, it should be noted that there are other State organisations which are also actively involved in ensuring that this issue is active in the public consciousness. The Equality Authority, Comhairle and other Departments are involved in promoting this issue.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to bringing forward a Disability Bill which will underpin the principle of mainstreaming and provide for positive action measures to remove barriers to equal participation for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Given the complex and crosscutting issues involved, the process of overseeing the preparation of the Disability Bill has been referred to a Cabinet Committee. As stated in the Agreed Programme for Government the Bill will include provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement. However, pending completion of the Cabinet Committee and Government deliberations, it would not be appropriate to comment in detail on the likely content of the Bill. The intention is that the Bill will be ready for publication before the Dáil resumes after the Christmas recess. The Taoiseach met with the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, DLCG, on 28 November, 2003 to advise them accordingly. The DLGC is a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers which was brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, to facilitate dialogue at national level.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department, in an application for business permission by a non-national, requests a statement of character from the police authority of each country in which he had resided, when the police authority, under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 - section 4 - does not empower them to provide information to a third party and does not provide a clearance or vetting procedure for employment purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Business permission is the permission granted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to non-EEA nationals who wish to become established and engage in business in the State in a capacity other than as an employed person, for whom an employer would have to obtain a work permit. The criteria to be met by an applicant for business permission includes a requirement that the applicant must be of good character. In this regard, the applicants are requested to provide a statement of character from the police authorities of each country in which they have resided for more than six months during the previous ten year period. The giving of information to data subjects about themselves is a general principle of data protection legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>There are no asylum applications from Congolese nationals for the period 1996 to 1998 awaiting finalisation in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. There are four such cases &ndash; one family &ndash; outstanding in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The cases in question have not been finalised at appeals stage to date due to judicial review proceedings.</P>
      <P>In so far as cases in the repatriation process are concerned, I can inform the Deputy that, where a person is unsuccessful in seeking refugee status, a notice of intent to deport issues under section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. A person served with such a notice of intent is afforded three options, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of the deportation order or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why the deportation order should not be made and why he or she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
      <P>If a person makes representations as to why he or she should not be deported and seeks leave to remain, the Minister, under section 3(6) of the 1999 Act, in determining whether to make a deportation order, shall have regard to 11 specified considerations. The determination as to whether a deportation order is made or whether leave to remain is granted is not dependent on whether the person has made representations for leave to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all persons who have entered the asylum process at any point in the past, the relevant <Col N="1264" />repatriation procedures in the legislation as set out above will be followed. Save for the relevant statutory safeguards, no special procedures or policies apply to Congolese nationals who applied for asylum in the period specified in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>I understand that four persons were convicted at Cork District Court. Two of those convicted received prison sentences for a period of one month, suspended on condition that they enter a bond to keep the peace for two years and not to park within 500 metres of the church in the Glen, Cork.</P>
      <P>The provisions referred to by the Deputy were brought forward in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 which is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and any amendments are therefore a matter for him. I can inform the Deputy that I have no proposals at this time to amend the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</P>

      <Quest>his proposals for establishing community policing fora throughout the country; the location of each policing forum in existence; the level of funding awarded to date from his Department to each policing forum; the criteria used for awarding grants from his Department; the management structures in place for the organisations in receipt of funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of community policing fora have arisen in the context of the national drugs strategy. There are two such fora operating on a pilot basis under the aegis of the north inner city and Finglas-Cabra local drugs task forces respectively. The Garda Commissioner also established the Kevin Street community policing forum on a pilot basis following upon extensive consultations between gardaí and community interests. No specific allocation of funding has been made for this forum.</P>
      <P>The first two of these fora are funded via the local drug task force initiative. Under this initiative, funding for local drug task force sponsored projects is provided by the lead Department for the national drugs strategy, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, via an appropriate State agency identified to act as a channel of funding during each project's pilot phase. After this phase, projects are independently evaluated and assessed for mainstreaming by the appropriate state agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The north inner city community policing fora was established in 1999 and operates in Dublin's north-east inner city area. The project receives annual funding of &euro;53,329 and Dublin City Council has acted as the channel of funding to the project to date. The council have recently indicated that, in line with the standard procedures in place under the drugs initiative, they will mainstream this project in 2004. A management board consisting of representatives of the Garda Síochána, Dublin City Council, the local drugs task force, <Col N="1267" />the local community and public representatives oversee the work of the forum.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the drugs initiative, the north inner city local drugs task force has received approval for funding of &euro;64,198 to establish an additional pilot project which involves extending the work of the policing fora within the task force area. Dublin City Council will again act as the channel of funding to this project during its pilot phase.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a community policing forum under the aegis of the Finglas-Cabra local task force has been established as a pilot project this year. In this instance, and under the same processes outlined above, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in conjunction with Garda community relations division, acts as the channel of funding to the project which receives an annual allocation of &euro;50,790 during its pilot phase.</P>
    <P>The catchment area for the forum is Cabra and a company limited by guarantee has been established to take legal responsibility for the work of the forum. The board of directors of the forum contains representation from the community of Cabra, the Garda Síochána, Dublin City Council, the local drugs task force and the local business community.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's question inquires of my proposals for establishing community policing fora throughout the country. It should be noted that action 11 of the national drugs strategy commits the Garda Síochána: &ldquo;to extend the Community Policing Fora initiative to all local Drugs Task Force areas if the evaluation of the pilot proves positive&rdquo; and to consider whether such fora should also be set up in regional areas under the aegis of the newly established regional drugs task force.</P>
    <P>My position on this to date has been that this action and the overall growth of community policing fora in general needs to be delivered in the context of the development of an appropriate policy framework for what are relatively new partnership structures involving the Garda, local authorities and local communities. Such a framework will ensure that such fora can be appropriately developed in a consistent and properly planned manner rather than the <i>ad hoc</i> way in which they have tended to emerge in a number of different contexts to date.</P>
    <P>Work is well under way on the development of such a policy framework which will facilitate progress in this area. The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the draft scheme of a Garda Síochána Bill 2003 earlier this year. This Bill represents the most significant legislative reform of Garda structures since the foundation of the State. Included in its draft provisions are mechanisms for enhanced co-operation between the Garda and local authorities through the establishment, on a statutory basis, of policing committees. It is intended that such committees will act as fora where matters relating to all aspects of policing can be discussed and where strategies and recom<Col N="1268" />mendations for dealing with issues arising locally can be decided. It is intended that these policing committees will facilitate the establishment of local policing fora to address specific issues in local areas. Furthermore, the recent report of the National Crime Council on tackling crime via a partnership approach also sets out recommendations in this respect including the establishment of a national crime prevention model. The model which emerges via these initiatives will better facilitate the input of local communities in tackling crime at local level in partnership with the relevant statutory agencies.</P>

      <P>Work will be carried out to improve security in the vicinity of that portion of the Midlands Prison boundary which adjoins the Beladd Park estate to prevent further incursions in the area by persons throwing contraband over the prison wall. This work will take place following the departure of the small number of remaining residents from Beladd Park at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the future use of the houses, I have yet to make a final decision on the use to which they may be put. However, I can advise the Deputy that disposal of the property is not in contemplation at this juncture.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that recruitment to the Garda Síochána is governed by the Garda Síochána (Admission and Appointments) Regulations 1988 to 2001, as amended. These are statutory regulations. The recruitment process is administered on behalf of the Garda Síochána by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The information sought on the number of recruits to the force who have addresses in areas of the city and county which are designated for RAPID funding is not readily available and can only be obtained by the disproportionate expenditure of Garda resources relative to the information required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau enforces the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 which provides statutory procedures of restraint. The effect of restraint orders made by the High Court is to freeze property deemed to be the proceeds <Col N="1271" />of crime for at least seven years. After that period, a disposal order may be sought from the court to vest the property in the Minister for Finance. It is only when the court directs that such property be transferred that funds accrue to the Exchequer. Having regard to the seven year safeguard period, the issue of such disposal orders has not arisen to date. Until these orders are made by the courts under section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 it cannot be assumed that there will be a windfall for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 2002 the Criminal Assets Bureau obtained interim and final restraint orders to the value of more than &euro;34 million and &euro;10 million, respectively. Since its statutory inception in October 1996 and up to December 2002, the bureau has obtained interim and final restraint orders to the value of more than &euro;48 million and &euro;21 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that, while it is not the practice or policy to comment on particular operations carried out by the Criminal Assets Bureau and other national units, a total of 26 orders were obtained by CAB under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 in 2002 and approximately half the defendants in these cases were involved in drug trafficking. However, the majority of assets frozen to date under the Act did not derive from the activities of drug dealers.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons for his refusal to provide funds to a project (details supplied) in Dublin 8 which has led to an improvement in the relationships between gardaí and the community and which has led to a growth in trust, co-operation and understanding, providing many benefits to all involved in this project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The community policing forum in Dublin's A Garda district, Kevin StreetKilmainham was established by the Commissioner in 2000 on a pilot basis following upon extensive consultations between the Garda and community interests. No specific allocation of funding has been made in relation to this forum. The original forum did not provide a co-ordinator. An independent evaluation of the work of the forum in 2002 identified the need for a state funded co-ordinator to assist in the work of the forum.</P>
      <P>My Department received a proposal from the gardaí early in the summer for the funding of a co-ordinator for the A district policing forum. A number of factors were considered. These included the question of funding from the Garda Vote or seeking another source, the role and function of the co-ordinator, the policing forum model, the possible expectations that would arise to deliver this model nationwide if a positive decision were given in Rialto and the possible implications for the forum of a negative decision on this proposal.</P>
      <P>It has been decided that the Garda will not fund a co-ordinator for the A district policing forum at this time. Perhaps the biggest influencing factor on this decision was the Government decision of 4 December 2002 which immediately capped public service staffing levels and required reductions to be achieved over a particular period. The Government is intent on achieving this objective. In that regard, any post which is funded by the public purse is regarded as being covered by this cap. Accordingly, the Minister for Finance is not in a position to sanction the appointment of additional civilian personnel unless a civilian post could be suppressed in order to facilitate such an appointment.</P>
      <P>As you may be already aware, I am determined to maximise the extent to which civilian employees can perform functions being performed by gardaí which would make those gardaí available for more conventional and higher priority policing duties. It would be difficult to justify a case for the employment of a forum co-ordinator in these circumstances, at this time.</P>
      <P>Co-ordinators are provided in certain cases for fora through funding under the national drug strategy. I will refer the Deputy to a comprehensive answer I have provided to Deputy Costello's question today on community policing fora generally where I have described in detail the operation of such fora, the mechanisms for funding and my plans for the future in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>At its meeting on 29 September 2003, the Government established a group comprising the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Finance and myself, to deal with the evolving industrial relations situation in the Prison Service, <Col N="1274" />including putting in place contingency arrangements in the event of industrial action. In line with this decision, I can confirm that contingency planning is at an advanced stage for the possible use of Garda and Defence Forces personnel in the event of industrial action in the prisons. In such a situation, the Defence Forces will play a significant role. The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to go into the details of the arrangements which are being put in place at this time. I must point out that deployment of the Defence Forces and the Garda is by no means inevitable. It is a last rather than a first resort. First, it would clearly be preferable to reach a deal on an annualised hours package with the Prison Officers' Association, POA, and I still hope this can be done. Second, even if no deal is agreed and other cost cutting measures are implemented in January, this does not guarantee industrial action &ndash; that is a matter for the POA. Third, attempts have been under way for some time to obtain agreement from the POA on a satisfactory level of emergency cover in the event of industrial action. This would entail POA members providing sufficient staff to keep the prisons operational, albeit with a reduced level of service. Negotiations in this regard are ongoing.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the importance of our prison system to public safety and security dictates that contingency plans are in place to ensure that it remains operational in all circumstances.</P>

      <P>Emissions from the plant in question are regulated by an integrated pollution control licence issued by the EPA and, as such, any emission related complaint would be a matter for the agency.</P>
      <P>My Department has received no recent complaints in relation to this plant. Earlier correspondence was received over a period up to and including April 2001 in regard to the plant and to air quality in Leixlip more generally. Following inquiries by my Department, the EPA in March 2001 indicated its satisfaction with air quality in Leixlip, and confirmed that it had received many queries over a period of time from one person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Air quality assessment is a matter for the EPA <Col N="1276" />and air quality management is a matter for local authorities. The attention of Dáil Éireann has previously been drawn to aspects of air quality in County Kildare, most recently in the reply to Question No. 432 of 4 February 2003 with reference to anomalous summer time peak levels of sulphur dioxide SO2 at the Leixlip monitoring station. These were highlighted in the agency's air quality annual report 1999 and addressed further in its report for 2000.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 403, 422, 431 and 432 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development contributions have been levied on developments of significant scale since 1964 to ensure that developers who benefit from the provision of infrastructure contribute to the cost of providing that infrastructure. The Planning and Development Act 2000 revised the development contribution system in order to introduce transparency into the way in which development con<Col N="1277" />tributions were levied and applied. There are no proposals to introduce any further amendments to this system.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that the contributions levied will unduly affect the price of houses and the level of inflation. The major driver of house price increases in recent years has been the demand for housing, fuelled by rapid economic growth and demographic changes. The Government has responded to this unprecedented demand by focusing on measures to boost supply as the most appropriate way to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases. The key component of this strategy is ensuring a supply of serviced land for housing which the development contribution system helps fund.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may comment on the draft development contribution scheme during the consultation period, it is ultimately for the elected members of the planning authorities to determine the level of contribution for their functional areas and the classes of development to which the contributions will apply, having regard to the actual cost of providing infrastructure in that area. Circular Letter PD 4/2003 of 27 June 2003, which issued to each planning authority, advised that the basis for determining the contribution levels in the scheme should be justified and supported.</P>
    <P>In addition, at a meeting in my Department on 13 November with the chairperson of the City and County Managers Association and the chairpersons of the association's various sub-committees, I reiterated to the managers present that contributions proposed in development contribution schemes should be set at a reasonable and realistic level.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) suggesting that the costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol will substantially exceed its benefits; if he has commissioned studies on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the unreferenced study referred to in the report provided. The authoritative statement of the impacts of climate change, including the costs of climate change and of not taking action to mitigate emissions, and the costs of the associated adaptation requirements, is the 2001 Third Assessment Report, TAR, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The synthesis for policy makers states that projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse effects on both environmental and socio-economic systems, <Col N="1278" />but the larger the changes and rate of change in climate, the more the adverse effects predominate &ndash; IPCC Synthesis Report (2001), Q3.15 page 9.</P>
      <P>It also finds that the cost estimates for countries with Kyoto targets to implement the Kyoto Protocol vary between studies and regions, and depend strongly, among others things, upon the assumptions regarding the use of the Kyoto mechanisms, and their interactions with domestic measures. All studies show that costs are reduced for parties, generally, with the use of emissions trading. The report states that with full emissions trading, the estimated GDP reductions in the year 2010 are between 0.1 and 1.1% of projected GDP. It points out that at the time of these studies, most models did not include sinks, non-CO2 greenhouse gases, the clean development mechanism, negative cost options, ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue recycling, the inclusion of which will reduce estimated costs. On the other hand, these models make assumptions which underestimate costs because they assume full use of emissions trading without transaction costs, both within and among countries with Kyoto targets, that mitigation responses would be perfectly efficient and that economies begin to adjust to the need to meet Kyoto targets between 1990 and 2000 &ndash; IPCC Synthesis Report (2001), Q7.17-18 page 25.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that EU and Government policy should continue to be developed in the context of the analysis and advice contained in the TAR, that this report reinforced the necessity for continued action, and that the Kyoto Protocol is only a first step in achieving the necessary global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to prevent dangerous human-induced interference with global climate systems.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive economic and environmental analysis for purposes of the national climate change strategy was undertaken in 1998, through a consultancy study on the limitation and reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland and taking account of the range of available analytical work at national and international levels. The strategy also took account of further economic analysis at a sectoral level, including in particular, for purposes of the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, 1999. Further consultancy work is currently under way to advise Government on preparations for the commencement of EU wide CO2 emissions trading from 2005. The intention will be to seek to ensure that no sector of the economy is faced with a disproportionate cost for their share of meeting the country's Kyoto target, thereby minimising the impact on national competitiveness.</P>

      <P>The issue of unfinished housing estates was examined as part of the review of planning legislation leading to the adaption of the Planning and Development Act 2000. Arising from this review, section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 made substantial amendments to the statutory provisions governing the taking in charge of estates. These new arrangements, which came into operation on 21 January 2002, provide that where an estate is unfinished, and the planning authority does not initiate enforcement action against the developer within seven years requiring the estate to be finished, the authority is then required to take the estate in charge where the majority of the residents so request. My Department has not been made aware of any difficulties being experienced with these provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 417 to 419, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In including housing as a major area of activity under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the Government has underlined its commitment to increasing support for social and affordable housing programmes. Despite the pressure on the public finances, the Government has again increased the total housing provision by 5.5% to &euro;1.885 billion in 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" />Primary responsibility for the provision of social and affordable housing rests with local authorities, who discharge this responsibility by various means including renting to households on their approved housing lists or through the application of the various home ownership options. The latter include the affordable housing, tenant purchase and shared ownership schemes. Furthermore, planning authorities are required to prepare a housing strategy which forms an integral part of their development plans and is the cornerstone for future housing policy and programmes at local level. Housing strategies must contain specific objectives and policies that address the differing housing needs of the existing and future population in the area of the development plan, including, in particular, the need for social and affordable housing. The voluntary and co-operative sector plays an increasing role in the delivery and management of social housing and along with the possible use of public private partnerships provides alternative options to direct housing provision by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a discussion document presented to a recent meeting of Dublin City Council strategic policy committee on housing, raising the possibility of other options for the provision and future management and maintenance of the council's rented housing stock. While no detailed plans have yet been submitted, my Department will be pleased to consider any appropriate proposals put forward by Dublin City Council which assist in meeting housing need or ensuring that its housing estates are managed effectively and efficiently with maximum participation of residents. I will continue to encourage local authorities in the vital role they play in underpinning housing development.</P>

A document entitled, Comprehensive guidelines on Managing Voids: Co-ordinating the Monitoring, Repair and Allocation of Vacant Dwellings, has already been produced by the housing unit as part of its series of guidelines on good practice in public housing management. These guidelines provide advice to help housing authorities to develop programmes to improve practice in this area for the efficient use of their housing stock.</P>

In determining general purpose grants by my Department from the local government fund, account is taken of the cost to local authorities of maintaining and operating domestic water services.

    <P>The days of polling, turnout and polling times at the six by-elections to the 28th Dáil were: Dublin North, Wednesday, 50%, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Limerick East, Wednesday, 55%, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Cork South-Central, Friday; 50%, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Dublin South-Central, Wednesday, 28%, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Tipperary South, Thursday, 57%, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; and Tipperary South, Saturday, 58.6%, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>No firm correlation between voter turnout and day of the week emerges from the above data, nor did the 15 hour poll for the general election 2002 produce a greater voter turnout than the 14 hour poll at the general election 1997. It should also be noted that the last combined European and local elections of 1999 were held on a Friday, but with a 13 hour poll rather than the 14 hour poll envisaged for 11 June 2004.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. In drafting the strategy, the issue of drug consumption rooms was examined and the introduction of this form of treatment was not considered to be warranted. However, the strategy did call for this issue to be kept under review and for the results of research, both national and international, to be monitored. To inform myself further on this issue, I visited Frankfurt and Berlin in late September to view a range of facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug consumption room that I visited in Frankfurt, as well as similar facilities in that city, were established to address the issue of on-street injecting which had reached a very high level <Col N="1291" />there in the early 1990s. Although I was impressed by what I saw in Frankfurt, it must be borne in mind that these facilities were put in place to address circumstances in that city at that time, which are very different to those that pertain in Dublin today, and must be seen in that context. In Berlin, I visited a drug-free facility for young drug users.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter, I am not convinced that there is sufficient evidence regarding the need for drug consumption rooms in Ireland especially as there are ongoing efforts to expand our existing treatment facilities in accordance with the aims of the national drugs strategy. In this context, I am also aware that the International Narcotics Control Board, which is responsible for overseeing and monitoring international policy in relation to international drug controls, has been opposed to such forms of treatment.</P>
    <P>The introduction of such facilities would require changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act, responsibility for which lies with the Department of Health and Children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 439 and 440 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, all my Department's functions in relation to the Gaeltacht and the islands are already headquartered in a Gaeltacht area at Na Forbacha in County Galway. Under the decentralisation programme announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 3 December last, a further complement of ten staff responsible for Irish language policy matters in Dublin will transfer to Na Forbacha. This will mean that the vast bulk of my Department's Irish language, Gaeltacht and islands functions, which are administered through the medium of Irish, will be located in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, the Deputy may wish to note that Section 13 of Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 includes a provision that Departments and <Col N="1292" />public offices located in a Gaeltacht area will be required to exercise their functions through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the choice of Knock Airport as the location for a further 140 staff of my Department, who deliver services through the medium of English, is eminently suitable having regard to my Department's particular role as regards rural and western development and the achievement of better regional balance, particularly as it is in a CLÁR area.</P>
    <P>In the interest of consolidating my Departments section dealing with the Irish language in one location, it was decided to relocate ten positions to the existing office in Na Forbacha. Other than Foras na Gaeilge, no other agency that would comply with the requirements of the language Act is being decentralised.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's reference to job creation in Gaeltacht areas, I outlined the position on this in my replies to a number of questions on 27 November last.</P>
    <P>In regard to Údarás na Gaeltachta's budget for 2004, the position is that I have provided &euro;10.193 million for current expenditure, representing an increase of 17% over 2003. This will allow an tÚdarás to assist further the development of crèches, nursery schools, co-operatives and community organisations in accordance with the recommendations contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>I have also provided a capital grant of &euro;22 million for 2004 towards the industry and building programmes of an tÚdarás. A report prepared by consultants on the property and equity portfolios of an tÚdarás states that assets to the value of &euro;20 million could be sold over a period of time without adversely affecting the organisation. It is estimated that an tÚdarás will raise a significant sum from the sale of property in 2004. I am confident that this revenue, along with the &euro;22 million in my Department's Vote, will enable an tÚdarás to continue to implement a comprehensive development programme, aimed at sustaining and creating employment in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department, in partnership with Údarás na Gaeltachta, is continuing to actively examine the recommendations of the working group on the creation of employment in the Gaeltacht which was published last December to determine how they can be most effectively implemented.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives being pursued by Údarás na Gaeltachta include targeting new sectors of the economy and placing greater emphasis on high skills and on the resources of the Gaeltacht itself, including the Irish language particularly in view of the enactment of the language Act.</P>

      <P>Subject to specified eligibility criteria, it is envisaged that the scheme will be open to farmers throughout the State. Clearly this will have a positive effect on the wider availability of places on existing community employment schemes. As regards instances where the number of applicants is in excess of the number of places on a scheme, I can confirm that a revolving door policy is an option under consideration.</P>

      <P>Subject to certain conditions, any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs may be entitled to assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The objective of the scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term ongoing solution in an individual case.</P>
      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which provides assistance to people experiencing indebtedness. There are 52 independent companies nationwide operating the service. The key feature of the MABS programme is the provision of money advice, including the publication of information on money management and debt counselling. The service is targeted primarily at individuals and families who have problems with debt or moneylending and who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare payments. The service places an emphasis on practical, budget-based measures that succeed in removing people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and open up alternative sources of low cost credit. In 2003, I have provided &euro;9.9 million for the operation of the MABS and an additional &euro;1.01 million is being provided for next year. The latest information available from the companies providing the service shows that some 12,000 people avail of the service.</P>
      <P>Separate from these arrangements, ongoing weekly payments, known as MABS supplements, have been paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The duration of these payments confirm that the supplement has in effect become a long-term arrangement which is effectively a subsidy for creditors.</P>
      <P>Payments have been made in these cases because the people concerned have entered into repayment arrangements that are so onerous that they do not have enough income left to meet their basic needs. This is unrealistic and unsustainable, and providing a weekly supplementary welfare allowance payment is not the solution. Creditors should accept a more realistic repayment arrangement in these cases. It is with the support and expertise of the MABS companies that people can be best assisted in sorting out their debts and these companies will continue to provide their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>MABS supplements in payment will not be withdrawn. Payment of the supplement in such <Col N="1297" />cases will continue for the duration of their current term of agreement. In exceptional circumstances, where there is a particular difficulty, an exceptional needs payment can still be made.</P>

      <P>The current FIS computer system limits the choice of payment methods to customers to personalised payable order, PPO, books. As this system is now obsolete, the administration of FIS payments is being migrated to a new computer platform which offers a choice of payment methods including electronic fund transfer, cheque or postdraft. All customers may now select their favoured payment method from these options.</P>
      <P>FIS customers can continue to be paid at any post office if they choose to do so. Payments can be made electronically using a swipe card at automated post offices or by manual voucher at non-automated offices.</P>

      <P>A major decentralisation programme for the Civil Service was announced on budget day, 3 December 2003. It is intended that a significant proportion of the programme will be completed over the next three years. As far as my Department is concerned, the programme involves moving the Department out of Dublin to a number of locations, and this will be done on a phased basis. Arrangements are being put in place in the Department to implement the programme as it affects the Department. At this stage, the details, including the timetable for the move of the Department's headquarters to Drogheda have not been worked out.</P>
      <P>A decision on the future location of the Department's information system division will be made at a later stage. As referred to in the Budget Statement, this relocation will demand extreme care. The implementation committee which is being established to drive forward the decentralisation programme overall will examine this issue separately and report to Government by March 2004.</P>
      <P>As regards this programme generally, a primary concern is to ensure that service delivery is maintained at a high standard during the implementation of the programme.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce.</P>
      <P>There are 7,498 participants availing of the BTEA scheme, of whom 5,375 are pursuing third level courses of study and the remaining 2,123 are pursuing second level courses.</P>
      <P>Information on the nationality of persons receiving a BTEA is available only in cases where the people concerned were in receipt of either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance prior to participation in the scheme. This is not available in relation to people on other qualifying payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" />Nationality details are available in 5,273 cases, which amounts to 70% of current BTEA recipients. More than 4,491 or 85% of these are Irish, 444 or 9% are from other EU states, mainly the UK, and the remaining 338 or 6% are from outside the EU.</P>

      <P>At 1 December 2003, there were 4,304 posts filled in my Department. Taking account of worksharing staff, there are 4,731 people filling these posts.</P>
      <P>The Department is organised on a headquarters, regional, local and decentralised office basis rather than on a county basis. Ten geographical regions, which include the social welfare local office network, five decentralised provincial offices and Dublin headquarter offices constitute the structure of the Department.</P>
