      <P>I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, whether the Air Corps has advised the Government to purchase the Boeing 737-800 series, also known as Boeing Business Jet, given that this is a jet that <Col N="598" />Ryanair uses in training and given that pilots training on this type of aircraft are requested by Ryanair to pay the &euro;20,000 costs.

      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) No. 19<i>a </i>shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon, shall be taken forthwith; (2) the proceedings on No. 6 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m.; (3) the proceedings on No. 25 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after one hour; and No. 20 shall be taken immediately thereafter and shall be decided on without debate; the proceedings on No. 26 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this matter is so important it should be debated in this House. On radio this morning the Minister for Health and Children made a commitment that dialysis patients would not suffer as a result of cutbacks. Implicit in that is the issue of a Supplementary Estimate for the Department to protect patients whose lives are endangered because of Government policy in regard to cutting back on hospital services. This is a grave issue. Can we have debate on the issue and a guarantee that there will be a Supplementary Estimate to deal with the crisis in the major Dublin hospitals, includ<Col N="600" />ing Beaumont, to ensure that the House can protect patients&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask you, A Cheann Comhairle, to take into account, not just in regard to the difficulties in the health service but in regard to these Estimates, that many of us have some knowledge from our constituencies and elsewhere that cutbacks are indiscriminate and completely lack understanding of where the needs are greatest in society. It is important we voice that and that the debate takes place in the House where the maximum number of Deputies can inform the Government of ways the hurt can be lessened in the event that it embarks on such a draconian course of action.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance's motion states that the Revised Estimates for the public services will be circulated to Members today, 27 February. I have not had sight of any documentation on this proposal, yet we are being asked to rubber stamp it. It is clear that it has serious ramifications in regard to a number of Department responsibilities. One of the key questions was alluded to by an earlier speaker. Is there a Revised Estimate included in this to make up for the inadequate provision for health care delivery? What is the position? Are we not entitled to the full details before we take a decision such as the one suggested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to clarify the long-standing ruling on promised legislation on the Order of Business as I feel there is a need for clarification in view of the exchanges in the House recently, particularly on Thursday. Under Standing Order 26(3) a question may be asked at the discretion of the Chair in respect of &ldquo;the taking of business which has been promised, including legislation promised either within or outside the Dáil&rdquo;. Under rulings of the Chair and practice, questions have been <Col N="603" /><Col N="604" />allowed asking when legislation is to be introduced or circulated, if such a date, previously given, can be brought forward or the state of preparation of the legislation in regard to drafting, for example, draft heads of the Bill. Other questions which stray outside this context are not in order. This means policy matters, such as what should be included in the content of a Bill, are not in order, nor is a statement, nor is a preamble to a question. Only a question, which I remind the House is to elicit information, is permitted and once that information is put on the record in a given week a repeat of an identical question the same week is repetition and in these circumstances may be disallowed.</P>
    <P>I ask Members to co-operate with the Chair in operating this Standing Order. As I have stated on numerous occasions, if the Dáil sees fit to change the rules the Chair will be more than happy to faithfully implement any such change.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, this process relating to the Order of Business on Thursday is totally unacceptable in a democratic parliament, although it is not through your fault, a Cheann Comhairle. I give notice of our intention to bring forward proposals to make Thursday and every day in the House meaningful as far as the public is concerned. This is not a junior school where we are to be corralled and curtailed to the extent that we have no effectiveness. It is essential for democracy that we are seen to operate fully, fairly and without hindrance on each day the Parliament sits.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, am I to understand from what you have just said that you are confining questions on promised legislation to the date, which we already have? This makes a question meaningless because we already know the answer to it. Is that the substance of what you have said and, if so, can you quickly facilitate a meeting of the Whips which would allow that to change? It must seem absolutely comical to people outside the House to be told that the only question we may ask is one to which we already know the answer. It would be comical if it were not so sad.  </P>

      <P>Valuable time is lost, perhaps every day, in what amounts to a sham fight. What is required is reform of the conduct of business in the House.</P>
      <P>You have made the point on many occasions that if the Standing Order is changed you will faithfully implement it. I disagree with your interpretation. However, as the process of Dáil reform may take more time than Members would wish, I appeal to you in the interim, rather than perpetuate an unacceptable situation, to introduce a degree of latitude in line with the express views of Members and allow for a more substantive engagement on legislation with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Minister of the day. There is no other formula we can employ. I appeal to you to allow greater latitude and allow for a process of reform to take place where new Standing Orders would be introduced and the long-standing nonsense would be replaced by real and substantive engagement between the Opposition parties and the Government.</P>

On any given day 60 or 70 motions under Standing Order 31 could be produced from the Opposition benches which would make a mockery of the time of the House and what we do here. There exists in the office of the Minister of State a body of information and reports on how we can sort this out. Writing in 1998 about the crime figures, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said that political determination was the way forward &ndash; be radical or be redundant. We will facilitate the Government if the Minister of State brings in here a list of proposals for effective reform and effective working of this House. I do not want to be here on my feet, nor does Deputy Rabbitte or anybody else, with this nonsensical business whereby the Taoiseach has a plastic brief every morning containing a list of legislation which will not appear until 2004 or 2005.

It may appear reasonable on the face of it for you to say you will operate the Standing Orders of the House and if the House wants to change them, of course, you will do that also. The House does not change the Standing Orders, a Cheann Comhairle, it only approves a recommendation from Government. If Government does not come forward with reasonable changes to Standing Orders and if you interpret them in the fashion you have just outlined, we would be better off at home e-mailing you and letting the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, when he comes back from shopping abroad for three jets, e-mail us back.</P>

Will the Bill be withdrawn to cater for the inclusion of amendments on specific mandatory guidelines for contact between Oireachtas members and members of county councils? In respect of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, section 17 of that Act requires that the name and address of off-licences be attached to all products sold. It is obvious that this section has not been implemented. Literally thousands of beer cans and bottles are picked up on streets and locations all over the country without the name of the off licence from which they were bought being contained thereon in accordance with the law. When is it proposed to introduce that secondary legislation to implement that section of the Act?</P>

      <P>Following the revelation on Tuesday that the State has a secret data retention regime, I questioned the Taoiseach and he gave me a wrong answer. When can we expect publication and debate on the proposed Bill in line with the EU directive which will mandate a three year retention of all telephone, mobile, Internet, fax and e-mail traffic information and will potentially result in the greatest mass deprivation of personal privacy ever proposed in the State? The Bill's title, for the benefit of the Minister, in case he cannot find it in the long list in front of him, is the telecommunications (retention of traffic data) Bill. Publication is expected this year but can that be brought forward so that we can debate the revelation that the former Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke, allowed the retention of data secretly for the past year?</P>

      <P>I had finished addressing the Minister on the failure, when quoting statistics relating to increases in social welfare in recent years, to place them in context. I referred particularly to the failure to mention the rise in the cost of living, especially in the past year. The Government failed to mention that it is mainly people who depend on social welfare who have the worst housing conditions, who are on most of the housing authority waiting lists, who languish on hospital waiting lists, who pay the price for failure to invest in public transport and who have the worst health and lowest life expectancy. These are the realities. When quoting statistics, these are the statistics from all the agencies, from the Combat Poverty Agency to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and a range of Departments, that prove the case I make. The bottom line is that the derisory increase of &euro;6 per week provided for in the Social Welfare Bill is unacceptable, yet this is what the Government and its backbenchers have been boasting about during the course of this debate. It amounts to less than &euro;1 a day for the most disadvantaged people and it has already been wiped out by rises in the cost of living, many of them due to costs imposed by the Government in other areas of the budget. Given the increasing cost of living, there should have been, at an absolute minimum, an increase to &euro;130 a week for the lowest social welfare weekly rates. The increase in this Bill is an insult. I ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, through her colleague, to explain how anyone can be expected to live with dignity on &euro;124 a week. I would vouch that it is impossible.</P>
      <P>Child benefit for the first and second child is &euro;23.40 short of the Government's own commitment. For subsequent children, it is &euro;27.70 short. The child dependant allowance has not been increased. This means an effective 6% cut for the poorest of poor families who currently account for some 400,000 children in this jurisdiction. I will continue to address the needs of the low paid worker and the social welfare recipient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, I reminded the Taoiseach of the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that all children develop to their full potential, yet the Government has again failed to <Col N="619" />increase the back-to-school footwear and clothing allowance for primary school students. Does the Minister believe that &euro;80 goes anywhere near the real cost of providing clothing and equipment for children for school, particularly for families already struggling on very low incomes or on social welfare?</P>
    <P>A recently published survey by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul showed that many children are still going to school ill-nourished and inadequately clothed. In post Celtic tiger Ireland, the situation is such that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has proposed the establishment of book rental schemes and breakfast clubs in disadvantaged areas. Instead of boasting and rhyming off statistics, the Government spokespersons should be hanging their heads in shame that such emergency measures to alleviate dire poverty are necessary in a society where wealth is flaunted and squandered as never before.</P>
    <P>It is no good others looking at their respective constituencies and saying they cannot see the reality. It is not that they cannot see it but that they refuse to see it. I warrant it is in every constituency represented in this Chamber and it is time people started to seriously look at the reality of poverty in their midst.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to re-examine policy in relation to community employment. I understand that today is the day of reckoning for many of the community employment schemes. I appeal to the Government not to banish to the dump heap the people and their communities who have received great opportunities through community employment schemes. It should allow the projects to proceed and dignity to be maintained by the individual.</P>

      <P>The background to this Bill is that over the past ten years this country has been awash with money, and it is still awash with money, despite the claims of doom and gloom and recession being made by the Government, various Government agencies and the media. There is a significant amount of money in this country. The Government books for the end of last year were in credit to the tune of &euro;100 million on both current and capital accounts. As regards the current account, on day-to-day spending, the Government was in credit to the tune of about &euro;3 billion. There is no basis for the miserly increases and cutbacks in this Bill. Given the details I have outlined, is it not absolutely outrageous that consistent poverty continues to run at about 10% and that relative income poverty has increased to the extent that the proportion of the population living on less than 60% of median income has grown from 16% to 22%? Is it not outrageous that one in four Irish children is growing up in a household that lives on less than half the average income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the European Union. The child poverty rates in many other member states are half, or less than half, that of this country. Child pov<Col N="620" />erty rates in the world's wealthiest nations vary from about 3% to 25%. Ireland is the sixth highest nation on the list of child poverty rates in 23 OECD countries. Given that we have such a child poverty problem, the fact that child dependant allowances have not been increased in this Bill &ndash; they have not been increased since about 1996 &ndash; is an absolute disgrace and is indefensible. The tenor of the Government's thought in relation to social welfare is exemplified by its treatment of child benefit, or children's allowance as it used to be known. Child benefit is always the first benefit to be cut. The Government has not kept its election promises in relation to child benefit in this Bill, although it was prepared to keep its promise to reduce tax on the profits of corporations from 16% to 12.5%, helping large companies to save &euro;300 million.</P>
    <P>The changes in social welfare rates in this Bill are not in line with the commitments made by the Government to the social partners. If it had kept its promises, old age pensioners would receive a minimum increase of &euro;13.20, but the actual increase is &euro;10. The increases in other social welfare payments should range from &euro;10.10 to &euro;15.40, according to the Government's promises, but the actual increase is a disgraceful and miserly &euro;6, which represents less than &euro;1 per day. The qualified adult allowance is &euro;4. The &euro;6 increase in the basic social welfare rates has been wiped out when one recalls that VAT was increased in the budget, that local authority rents, electricity and gas costs have gone up and that we have the highest inflation rate in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has increased the payments of those on rent allowance by &euro;4, leaving them with a net increase of &euro;2 per week. Rent subsidies have been capped, meaning that people are unable to meet their rent payments to private landlords. The effect of these measures will be that more people will be homeless. People come to me on a regular basis to say that they are unable to meet rent payments to private landlords. It is disgraceful that community welfare officers, by direction of the Minister, are not in a position to help them. I ask the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to make changes in this area immediately. I could mention many other aspects of this Bill with which I do not agree.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 and the arrangements made in the budget which the Bill enshrines should be seen in the context of the Government's record during its six years in office. Its proposals to assist those dependent on social welfare represent a continuation of the policies that have provided for a substantial shift in wealth from the working class to the very wealthy. The figures released by the Central Statistics Office since 1987, when the misnamed national partnership agreements were first introduced, show that the percentage of national income going to working people and social welfare recipients has decreased, while the percentage going to <Col N="621" />those who rake in rents, profits and dividends has increased dramatically. The Government has helped land speculators, millionaire corporate shareholders and bankers to increase massively their wealth at a cost to working people and those on social welfare who are trying to keep a roof over their heads.</P>
      <P>It is revolting that parliamentary representatives of the Government parties who receive incomes of about &euro;100,000 each year &ndash; Ministers, Ministers of State and the Taoiseach earn considerably more &ndash; have paraded into the Chamber for this debate to boast of their generosity to the section of society that depends on social welfare. They have trumpeted an increase of &euro;6 per week in basic social welfare as a major boost for the recipients. Deputies on the Government side pay far more than the &euro;6 they have awarded as a basic social increase in social welfare for a Havana cigar.</P>

      <P>The increase in real terms of about 30 cent per week is made much worse when one takes into account the litany of stealth taxes and increased charges that have been inflicted on working class people in recent months. The increase of &euro;6 is taken from such people before it even reaches their pockets. Fingal County Council has increased the rents of subsidiary earners by &euro;3.70 per week, which represents 60% of the increase given by the Government. The Minister's regulation in relation to the contribution that has to be made by those dependent on private landlords before they receive rent supplements has also taken the vast bulk of the increase. When one takes account of the effect of inflation and increased ESB, television and other costs, it is clear that social welfare recipients will be much poorer, in real terms, at the end of 2003 compared to the start of the year. Is it any wonder that the Simon Community has seen through the con that is social partnership? I am surprised that other non-governmental agencies have not realised that it is a con, but I believe they will.</P>
      <P>The denial of rent supplement to asylum seekers is mean, harsh, small-minded and absolutely deplorable. While many asylum seekers are catered for by means of direct provision, it is not always suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last few days have given us a real sense of the Government's priorities. The Government is prepared to spend tens of millions of euro on flashy new jets, while social welfare recipients suffer as a result of the measures I have discussed. Per<Col N="622" />haps the new jet would be useful if the Taoiseach and his two Cold War warriors, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, would jet into the sunset and not come back, or perhaps land in North Korea and disappear.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to recent speakers, particularly the last speaker, Deputy Joe Higgins, on whose contribution I intend to comment. The Government believes that supporting older people must be a core priority. It has delivered record increases on pensions, but there has also been a lot of progress in developing new care services and extending entitlement to other schemes such as the free GP care scheme. In light of the comments of Deputy Joe Higgins, I would be interested to hear the Deputy provide comparisons with other Governments that have the record of this and the last Government.</P>

      <P>The widows contributory pension saw a 72% increase and the old age non-contributory pension saw a 68% increase over that period. The Government has also made progress in regard to private pensions and is committed to <Col N="623" />further improving living standards by encouraging private pensions coverage. The target is to increase coverage from its current level of just over 50% to 70% of the workforce. The PRSA framework was introduced in the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002. It is significant that the first PRSA products were approved by the Pensions Board this week, and a pensions awareness campaign is planned for later this year. The Government also created the carer's allowance and the numbers in receipt of this payment were over 20,000 at October 2002.</P>

Much progress has been made on the extension and enhancement of the free schemes.</P>
      <P>The household benefits package, which comprises electricity and gas allowance, telephone allowance and the free television licence scheme, is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over and in receipt of a social welfare payment.

In May 2002, the household benefits package was introduced, providing for the streamlining of the electricity allowance, telephone allowance and the free television licence scheme into one combined household benefits package which ensured that all recipients received the full range of schemes previously available under the three different schemes.

      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and Deputy Kelleher for sharing time with me. I welcome the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003. The Bill provides for the introduction of a range of social welfare improvements announced in the recent budget and a number of additional proposals agreed by Cabinet. It provides in sections 3 and 4 for increases in child benefit and the respite <Col N="625" />care grant. It extends child dependant allowances for certain children of recipients of short-term social welfare payments and provides for changes in the means test of certain social assistance schemes. It also makes changes to the PRSI system by giving effect to the budget measure for the application of PRSI contributions and health and employment training levies to benefits-in-kind.</P>
      <P>Section 3 pertains to child benefit and this Bill provides for increases in that benefit as announced in budget 2003. The increase amounts to &euro;8 in the lower rate payable in respect of the first and second child and &euro;10 in respect of the third child and subsequent children. It brings the monthly rate to &euro;125.60 in the case of the first and second child and &euro;157.30 for subsequent children. From next April, a family with three children will receive &euro;408.50, an increase of &euro;26 per month.</P>
      <P>These measures will mark the beginning of the final phase of the child benefit investments package, which was initiated in budget 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
      <P>On completion, Government investment in this area will increase by &euro;1.27 billion. An estimated 530 families and more than one million children will benefit. Research has shown that child benefit, as a universal payment made directly to families, is the most efficient and effective way in which the Government can channel support to children. The Opposition was not aware of this research when it was in government. At that time, when the country was beginning to enjoy economic affluence as a result of policies pursued by previous Fianna Fáil led Governments, the so-called rainbow coalition Government provided no significant financial support to parents. It implemented child benefit increases as low as &euro;1.27.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
      <P>We prioritised this issue and initiated a plan to invest an unprecedented &euro;1.27 billion in increased child benefit over a number of budgets. In the past two years we achieved two thirds of the planned increase and this year, the Minister for Finance announced an additional &euro;105 million in a full year. The Government has trebled child benefit payments since the champaign socialists of the rainbow coalition Govern<Col N="626" />ment left office. We have proved that what counts is hard work and action, not rhetoric.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend the Pensions Act 1990 to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board to allow it to respond on a case by case basis to schemes that find themselves in funding difficulties on foot of the recent extraordinary fall in the global equities market. The Bill proposes to allow the board to properly manage this funding crisis to ensure that the public does not move away from their contribution schemes, which are of great benefit and in the long-term interests of participants. This measure will protect the position of those who are not pensioners but who wish to enjoy their retirement in comfort. It is another example of the Government providing for and protecting the most vulnerable in society, in this case the elderly.</P>
      <P>All our budgets have been characterised by measures designed to improve the position of older people with regard to pensions. There has been much talk of broken promises. During the 1997 general election campaign, we promised to increase all old age pensions to at least &euro;127 per week, and it was delivered. In the last general election campaign we promised to increase it to &euro;200 per week and we will also deliver on this commitment during our term of office. There will be no broken promises.</P>

      <P>The so-called pseudo-socialists in the Opposition choose to forget that over the three budgets of the rainbow coalition Government, the Labour Party Minister for Finance provided pensioners with a total average increase of a derisory &euro;2.95. By contrast, the average annual increase for pensioners under the Fianna Fáil led Government now stands at a massive &euro;9.71. In percentage terms, the rainbow coalition Government provided pensioners with an increase of approximately 10%. Under the Fianna Fáil led Government it has amounted to approximately 60%.</P>
      <P>Since we came to Government in 1997, we have implemented the most generous welfare provisions since the foundation of the State. The Opposition has made numerous attempts to disregard this. It likes to believe it is the left wing champions of social justice. However, the facts and the polices of the past speak for themselves, and the public knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rent supplement is allocated by the various health boards. The health board in my area, the North-Western Health Board, has increased the allowance from &euro;63 to &euro;77 per week for a single person. Unfortunately, it is applicable to all who live within the health board area. The rents of certain houses in the larger urban areas, such as Letterkenny and Sligo, are considerably higher. I ask the Minister to use her influence with the health board to ensure that constituents living in <Col N="627" />urban areas are granted a bigger increase. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues eloquently outlined the positive elements in the Bill. There is an underlying problem with community welfare officers and racism. Allegations are frequently made in the media that asylum seekers are getting money from officers to purchase cars, insurance and so on. A deep and sinister element in society believe these allegations and I plead with the Department and the health boards to address the issue. They should establish a PR mechanism to enable them respond to allegations by journalists and individuals by explaining the entitlements of asylum seekers, refugees and nationals. I have encountered a number of such cases in my constituency, but despite numerous parliamentary questions I have been unable to ascertain the facts. This kind of situation makes it very difficult for public representatives to state categorically in the media that such allegations are without foundation.</P>
      <P>This is a very emotive issue and it is being used and fanned by elements in society. The silence of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children encourages them. It is a fundamental issue that must be addressed, especially as society becomes more multi-cultural and more people come into the country for whatever reason, be they asylum seekers or non-nationals on work permits. An element of society appears to automatically think that those who are non-Irish or non-white in colour are asylum seekers or refugees. No Department and none of the health boards appears to be willing to confront this way of thinking and explain the reality and the facts. While the anti-racism commission is active, Departments and other bodies must be proactive in monitoring the media to ensure that the correct message is conveyed.</P>
      <P>Huge efforts have been made to address the concerns of the elderly and to ensure they have a decent quality of life. However, there is also a need to ensure that adequate services are provided, such as one-stop-shops and day care centres, to address the needs of isolated pensioners who live alone. While the Government should continue to implement its commitment to increase the weekly old age pension to &euro;200, there is also a need to improve services, such as day care centres, which will act as a focal point where the elderly can congregate and have immediate access to medical services.</P>
      <P>We will have to address this matter, particularly because of the demographic changes in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average age is increasing. I read recently that there is one pensioner per five workers and that there will be one pensioner per three <Col N="628" />workers in 20 years' time. Therefore, there will be considerable financial strain on society. The cheaper option is to ensure that we have day-care centres and an infrastructure in place so the necessary expertise will exist when the population grows older and becomes more dependent on such services.</P>
    <P>There are many elderly people. Society is becoming more fractured and we do not have the same community spirit that we used to have. Neighbours were able to look after the elderly in the past. We have had recent cases in which elderly people were dead in their houses for three weeks before anybody knew about it. This issue must be examined.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and all those involved in the dental dispute for bringing it to a successful conclusion. It was a major issue.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to debating the positive initiatives contained therein, which will be implemented between now and next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share five minutes of my time with Deputy Murphy.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Kelleher for raising the matter of migrants to our country, for being brave enough to talk about it and for seeking clarification on certain issues. It is important that it be discussed. It is noteworthy that one of the provisions in this Bill is to restrict the rent allowance paid to asylum seekers, immigrants and refugees. It is sad that we are going down that road and I hope it does not reflect a shift in Government policy, which will lead to our being anti-immigrant and anti-refugee.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, at a meeting of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, the Minister for Justice estimated that the allocation of funds to refugees would cost &euro;300 million. Subsequently, he said that the Government's overseas aid package is not up to the standard that he would like because, in considering its size, he had to take into account the expenditure on refugees. I was absolutely shocked by this statement which required clarification, but the Minister did not offer any when I sought it. He told me to talk to my constituents to see what they thought about the issue. In other words, he was saying that he is doing what he is doing because the public want him to. That is not the way to do business and I am disgusted by it. I told him so, but unfortunately the issue got no airing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So many of the scripts that have been read by Government backbenchers seem to have emanated from the same source. We have had many statistics poured out regarding what the Government did and did not do, mainly what it did over the past five years, and what the previous coalition Government used to say. That is the approach Deputy Dermot Ahern adopted when he was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. He frequently gave us distorted versions of history. I am beginning to wonder if the <Col N="629" />same script writers are still at play. Will we have a repeat of this approach in the coming years?</P>
    <P>Backbenchers should talk to their constituents to elicit their reaction. Statistics do not stick in their minds and they do not notice the percentages by which their benefits increase, but they are not happy with the increases they received in the most recent budget. They were led to believe by the Government during the election campaign that there would be huge increases. Unfortunately, they did not materialise. The Minister said there would be no cutbacks, hidden or otherwise, but when it came to the crunch we had them.</P>
    <P>It is the job of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle to uphold standards in the House. If one examines the budget speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for social welfare in the two previous budget debates, one will notice that they said child benefit would increase on a three year basis, with equal amounts being granted over three years. Is that not a case of Ministers deliberately misleading the House? Did they come in to apologise and say, &ldquo;That was not the case at all. We had no right to say that.&rdquo;? They did not. Who will uphold the dignity of the House, ensure that standards are maintained and that Ministers do not mislead the House? A feeling obtained that one could promise anything in the run-up to an election.</P>
    <P>What has happened in respect of the increases in child benefit? Miserly increases have already been eaten away. The minimum payment in respect of rent allowance has increased by &euro;5. Therefore, if one has received an increase of &euro;6 in child benefit and there is a claw-back on one's rent allowance, one is left with an increase of &euro;1. To make matters worse, there were increases in VAT and the cost of electricity, telephony, gas and rent.</P>
    <P>What about other changes that should have been made to the social welfare system? I am sure the officials could write down some of the things I have said and probably will repeat in respect of the child dependant allowance. Maybe I should not be repeating myself but I feel strongly about the issue. If one is on social welfare and has child dependants, one gets a child dependant allowance. The rate of that allowance has not changed since 1994, almost ten years ago. It is remarkable that neither the previous nor present Minister has done anything about it, despite the fact that many have asked them to, particularly the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is in touch with really poor people.</P>
    <P>If a family is in receipt of unemployment assistance, disability benefit or old age contributory pension and has dependent children, each child is worth &euro;16.80 per week. If one is in receipt of a one-parent family payment or an invalidity pension, one's child is regarded as different and is worth &euro;19.30. That is not fair. I thought we were supposed to treat all children equally, but we do not. If one's father is on unemployment benefit the Government gives him less, but if he is on invalidity pension it gives him a little more. The <Col N="630" />child of someone on a widow's contributory pension gets even more, a sum of &euro;21.60. There is a difference in the amount of child dependant allowance payable of about &euro;250 per annum depending on what social welfare benefits a family receives. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul says it is unfair and should be changed to a uniform system.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement is an excellent system, involving reasonably generous payments by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to help families whose members work to stay at work. It was introduced by a coalition Government some years ago and the rate of payment has increased gradually. It is very worthwhile for families on low incomes. There is a rule within the system that if one's income changes in the course of one's receiving family income supplement, the Department will not withdraw the payments.</P>
    <P>A person successfully assessed for FIS, receives a book of payments which lasts for 12 months. If income increases in the course of those 12 months, the Department of Social and Family Affairs does not reassess payments, which is generous and admirable. However, if income falls in that time, the payments are not increased, which is mean. A family can experience a significant decrease in income which will have serious consequences. I am aware of a three-child family in which the father was earning the minimum wage of &euro;235 per week and the mother was in receipt disability allowance of &euro;50. This family was entitled to FIS of &euro;19 each week and when the disability payments to the wife were discontinued that sum did not increase. According to the Department's FIS guidelines, the family was entitled to a substantial increase, but it would not review the case until the payment came up for renewal ten months later. Does the Minister think that is fair? It is generous to say the payment will not be reviewed if income increases, but those who have lost income and are surviving on the minimum wage have the greater need. They do not know from where the next few shillings will come. I ask the Minister to use whatever influence she has to have this matter reviewed.</P>
    <P>It strikes me as peculiar that the self-employed are not entitled to receive FIS payments because the Department of Social and Family Affairs does not trust the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. The Revenue Commissioners are under his remit. A three-child family with a &euro;15,000 income will receive approximately &euro;70 per week in FIS payments if the earner is a PAYE worker, but will receive nothing if the worker is self-employed. The Department of Social and Family Affairs refuses to believe that the income of the self-employed family is &euro;15,000 despite the fact that this figure has been assessed by the Revenue Commissioners. That is an outrageous way to do business, but it will take a political decision to change it. I have heard Fianna Fáil Members discussing this anomaly and we will give them the opportunity to vote on the matter and demonstrate where they stand. Many self-<Col N="631" />employed tele-workers, mainly women, who work from home do not qualify for FIS either despite their low incomes.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the matter of overpayments by the Department before, but the response I received from the Minister's office was very unsatisfactory. She is not listening to me.</P>

I have a contemporaneous note of the discussion I had with an official with regard to the overpayment. We were assured that the payment was a result of an error by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and that repayment would not be sought. Despite this, repayment is now sought, but the money has been spent and must be clawed back over several years. That is unfair. When I raised the matter with the Minister's office, I was referred back to the person with whom I spoke in the first place. I would have expected a fresh view, but that did not happen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, I heard Fianna Fáil backbenchers compare the rate of social welfare increases to previous increases which were made by other Administrations. I wonder when Fianna Fáil will understand that it will have been in power for 18 of the previous 20 years when this Dáil comes to an end. No matter how one looks at matters, Fianna Fáil must take responsibility. The party is very quick to take credit for years of power when things are going well, but when they go badly they revert to jargon about successive Governments. The Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil Ministers now refer to successive Governments over the past 30 years, having suddenly realised that they have <Col N="632" />been in control over the past 20 years and should, therefore, take responsibility for the condition of the State.</P>
    <P>In local newspapers and on local radio, Fianna Fáil backbenchers come across as though they were members of the Opposition, yet in vote after vote they support and implement cuts in every Department. In terms of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the rate of increases would have seemed substantial were it not for the policies of the Department of Finance whose philosophy is to give a little through one Department while taking back more through another. The financial policies of the Fianna Fáil led Government have caused the rate of inflation to spiral out of control. Everybody in receipt of social welfare benefit, including the elderly, families and children, knows they are worse off despite the increases in their payments. The costs of food, heating, electricity, water, telephone, road tax, car insurance and rent have increased and the only thing social welfare recipients can be sure of is a daily diet of stealth taxes which pushes their families deeper into the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory level of social welfare payments is fundamental to good Government. An inadequate rate has a negative effect on the quality of life of our less well-off and hinders the effectiveness of many programmes in other Departments. The inadequacy of the severely means tested carer's allowance shifts the onus of care in many instances from families to the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. The Department is unable to pay subventions for nursing homes and in the Southern Health Board area alone more than 500 people await approval for enhanced payments. No beds are available in community hospitals and hospital managers are seeking legal advice on how they can get rid of older patients who occupy beds for acutely ill patients.</P>
    <P>The elderly are frightened and their families feel helpless all because we cannot find sufficient resources to adequately look after carers. It is impossible to put a price on the dedication of carers but we should be able to find enough money to ensure that carers could afford to stay at home and look after the elderly.</P>
    <P>Another consequence of this funding crisis is the effect on the home help service. Not alone is there no money available for nursing home subventions and no community hospital beds, but less home help is available. Those receiving home help are constantly being re-assessed and, as a result, usually lose home help hours. Families are fearful of taking on the responsibility of caring for the elderly because of continuous cutbacks. A complete review of the carer's allowance system is urgently required. A re-assessment of the real value of their services to society and an introduction of a realistic system of means testing is required.</P>
    <P>The inadequate social welfare payments impinge on the health boards in the context of the huge sums of money required for community <Col N="633" />welfare budgets. Instead of getting viable social welfare payments, recipients are further humiliated by having to go cap in hand to the community welfare officer to get the money for the ESB bill, rent subsidies or transport vouchers and to ask for help to pay for the most basic necessities of life. There should be very little need for the services of a community welfare officer.</P>
    <P>In every town and village each week there are queues of people lining up to get a top-up on their social welfare allowance. No further proof should be necessary that social welfare payments are inadequate. The Department of Education and Science spends a fortune on back to education schemes whereas if the people had their own adequate resources, this funding would not be needed. If social welfare payments were adequate in the first instance, massive amounts of money could be saved in other Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a different view of what the Minister is doing. I am sorry the Deputy has fallen into the trap into which some of his Opposition colleagues have also fallen of lecturing Fianna Fáil backbenchers. We seem to be an endangered species. If I had been elected last May to the Opposition benches I might have had an easier life. There is not much challenge over there as far as I can see. I am not going to sit at home in Tallaght and wait for 20 years until Fianna Fáil might be in Opposition. As far as I am concerned, I have been elected by the good people of Dublin South-West to come to the Dáil, participate in debates in this House and talk about the experience I bring to this House. I am not afraid to do that. Like my colleagues, I am not afraid to bring matters to the attention of the Taoiseach and the Government. I am a bit new and perhaps I do not know the system as well as others but I will do my job as I see it and I will make representations on behalf of my constituents.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that everything is not perfect in this Bill and we must fight for resources at a time when the economy is being challenged. I believe the Minister has made a great deal of progress and she is deserving of praise from all sides for the courage she has effected in her first period as Minister for Social and Family Affairs. She is a willing listener and has listened to a broad range of views on how to tackle social issues. I believe she and her officials will continue to meet the demands of our constituents, ranging as they do from child benefit to old age pension and social inclusion. I come from Tallaght and I have a strong background in understanding social inclusion. I will continue to bang on the door of Government as far as that is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister in bringing the dispute with the Irish Dental Association to a mutually satisfactory conclusion. I have been asked by a number of constituents in Dublin South-West to applaud the Minister with regard to the grant to the National Organisation for the Unemployed. At a time when the economy is being <Col N="634" />challenged it is important that we acknowledge what is being achieved.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in the Opposition consistently criticise the Government for not spending enough on particular issues but I believe it is the role of the Opposition to suggest what areas should be cut in order to pay for the increases they demand. At a time when choices have to be made and when expectations and needs continue to rise, it is vital that the Members of this House on all sides provide meaningful and effective contributions both in committee &ndash; and I am a member of the Committee on Social and Family Affairs &ndash; and in the House on all social welfare issues. We should impress upon the Minister and her officials that they should be delivering within the budgets allowed.</P>
    <P>I respect and support the tireless contribution which individuals and families make to the care of their relatives. This Government continues to maximise the benefits paid to these unsung heroes and continues to show that their contribution is valued. The section in the Bill which increases the amount payable in the respite care grant to &euro;1,470 for carers looking after two or more people and which takes effect from April and June, will cost &euro;2.5 million in a full year. I commend the Bill to the House. I congratulate the Minister and assure her that she will have the support of like-minded people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members have spoken at great length about the adequacy of this year's social welfare increases. I would have preferred if additional resources were available to deal with many of the social welfare needs that have been raised in the House. The overall budgetary and economic constraints this year means that I could not do everything and I am sure Members appreciate that fact. It was very important that the Government prioritise initiatives this year, given the level of fund<Col N="635" />ing available. I decided to focus on pensions. This is only a first step in meeting the Government's commitments as set out in the five-year programme for Government. As one of my colleagues said, the first five minutes of the game is not enough. We have to wait until the final whistle blows before we know the final score. We will proceed with a five-year programme for Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be taken off the pitch. The Opposition might put in a few dirty tackles but it is up to the rest to make sure things go right. In addition to the programme for Government and the five-year programme, objectives have been reaffirmed in the most recent social partnership document Sustaining Progress.</P>
      <P>No one can deny the facts. This Department now has a budget of over &euro;10 billion. People come into the House and complain they only got this or that but they should look at the base line figures and the huge increases there have been since 1997. Through our priorities we are building on and will sustain that progress. One example is old age pensions which have been increased by 59% since 1997, from &euro;99 to &euro;157.30. That is well ahead of inflation. Short-term benefits have also been increased ahead of inflation over recent years. We will make further progress with both long-term and short-term benefits over the next five years.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the discussion paper that was prepared by my Department last year for the tax strategy group. There were some inaccuracies in what they had to say. The tax strategy group recognised clearly that the pace by which the commitments to improving social welfare payments would be realised over five years, to 2007, was a matter for Government. All the discussion paper did was cost the overall commitments. Unlike what a number of Deputies, particularly in the Labour Party, said, there were no recommendations arising from that discussion document. It outlined the facts about what would have to be done over five years.</P>
      <P>Inflation and the adequacies of social welfare payments are issues that have been raised. One of the key objectives of the social welfare package over 2003 was to protect and enhance the value of all the rates of payment in relative terms. We had a discussion in regard to inflation on Committee Stage of the first Bill. I reiterate now that at budget time it was projected that prices would increase by an average of 4.8% in 2003. I welcome the recent fall in the annual rate of inflation from 5% to 4.8% as outlined in the consumer price index report of last January. Inflation is at 4.8% and all short-term and long-term payments are well above inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken inflationary measures into consideration. The Department of Finance gave us parameters and we alluded to them. There was a lot of criticism in regard to child benefit. The criticism was not just that the increases were &euro;8 and &euro;10, but people saw them as rowing back on a commitment. We had to make a decision whether to put all the money into child benefit or to put some into the other benefits on which people rely. I made a difficult decision and now we have reviewed the commitment and will deliver on it. Over the past two years child benefit has increased by &euro;71.64 per month for the first two children and &euro;86.20 per month for the third child and subsequent children. This may be too late for some Members. I appreciate that their children may be over the age limit and they have fewer liabilities. Child benefit is the most realistic way of dealing with the issue of child poverty. I will continue to support the necessity of addressing the issues of child poverty. Planned investment over the next two years will help us meet the commitment we have given in regard to child benefit for 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their views regarding increasing the age limit for child benefit from 18 years to 22 years for people on short-term benefits. We have delivered on that commitment. Contrary to what many Deputies think, we deliver on many commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall the Deputy making that case. There has been ongoing debate about addressing the issue of child poverty and whether it should be done through CDAs or child benefit. There is a difference of opinion in the House on the issue. Concerns have been expressed that there are three types of CDA payments but this is an improvement on the previous position when there were more. I am not convinced that an increase in CDAs is the best way to address the issue of child poverty. The universality of child benefit, whether the receiver is in or out of work, is the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of rent supplement is one to which I wish to return. I have been advised that rents have stabilised and decreased over the past year. In that context last November I raised the issue in the House and advised Members that I was setting a cap on the maximum rent payable for the purposes of the social welfare rent allowance scheme. If an individual is unable to secure accommodation at or below the applicable maximum rent level it is open to health boards to provide payment above the maximum level as an exceptional measure for a limited period. I appreciate Deputy Gilmore still does not believe that so I will furnish him with a copy of the guidelines issued to the CWO. In exceptional circumstances the cap does not apply and flexibility is given to the CWO. My Department must be made aware of the exceptional circumstances but <Col N="637" />there is flexibility. It is important that people are not told they will be made homeless as a consequence of the cap. I do not accept that as there is flexibility in the system.</P>

In regard to rent supplement, it is wrong for someone like myself to set the market in rent. That is what happened when rent supplement was increased on an ongoing basis. People raised rents accordingly when the supplement was raised, and that is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" />Other issues also arise in regard to rent supplement. For instance, many landlords are not registered with county councils. I hope to monitor those issues. I reaffirm that there is flexibility for people who find themselves in exceptional circumstances. One other issue which was raised &ndash; clarification on this is important &ndash; is the usage of the PPS number.

      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is not before time that an independent appeals mechanism for licensing is established. This is 20 years too late but it is here at last and it is very welcome. It is important that I record my appreciation of this new system. I hope it will work well and fairly. I have been concerned by the fact that when tonnage became a valuable asset the practice of selling or holding on to tonnage was concentrated in the hands of five or six agents. This did not work to the betterment of the fishing industry or of individual fishermen. I hope the new mechanism will put an end to that practice and that it will be replaced by a fairer and more equitable system. It was wrong that lawyers, accountants and fishing agents bought up tonnage at £200 or £300 per tonne, held on to it for a number of years and made a killing on it. That system was unfair and unjust. I hope the new licensing system will rectify the problem.</P>
      <P>The main platforms of the Bill are the conservation issues agreed at he New York summit meeting in August 1995. Conservation is a key issue for the Irish fishing industry. There is much discussion in the European context about conservation, which is an important factor, and whether we like it or not, certain stocks are in danger. If we ignore the warning signals, in less than ten years some stocks will be wiped out. There was the case off Newfoundland where valuable fish stocks were wiped out, never to be replaced. In this regard we have an ongoing problem about the Irish Box which was not determined at the pre-Christmas talks in Brussels. If Europe is serious about conserving fish stocks the whole issue of the Irish Box must be looked at in terms of controlling and conserving what we have already.</P>
      <P>Some 40 Spanish vessels are entitled to fish in the Irish Box. This Irish Box holds some of the key spawning grounds for various fish species and any interference would seriously damage the industry. Any encroachment or opening up of the Irish Box to the Spanish, Portuguese or French would be a disaster so far as the Irish fishing industry is concerned and would fly in the face of the notion of conservation both in Europe and internationally. I reiterate my concerns at any proposals on this issue. We must be careful to conserve and retain existing stocks. Having regard to the size of our quotas <i>vis-à-vis</i> the French and the Spanish, we have a very small slice of the cake but even that small slice will quickly diminish if there is encroachment into the Irish Box. It is not so much what is taken out in a given year but the damage that may be caused to the industry by depleting already endangered stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the new scheme for the licensing and regularisation of inshore fishing vessels of 12 metres and under which is not before time. While there are some difficulties in this area, I also welcome the announcement by the Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources of ongoing consultations with the small inshore fishermen who came from a poor starting position in that up to now they were not organised. In my area the Irish South and West Inshore Fishermen's Organisation was set up and has brought together fishermen from places such as Waterford, Cork and Kerry. It is working to streamline its claim in order that the regularisation will be fair and acceptable to all. It would be impossible to get a system which would keep everybody happy. One has to consider the tradit<Col N="641" />ional inshore fishermen with small 21-foot, 22-foot or 25 foot boats, some with outboard engines, who have traditionally fished for pollock and mackerel in small quantities. If the restriction is imposed that they cannot engage in the polyvalent sector, which is technically within the broad parameters set out by the Department, that would be very wrong. Given that some of these fishermen have small vessels, that they are restricted by the weather and that fishing is seasonal, I would like to see the widest interpretation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I met a man at the weekend who works five days a week with a bottling company. It is not a permanent job. At the weekends and during the long evenings, he fishes. He has four children and has built a new house. Last year when applying for a mortgage he was able to show that he earned &euro;8,500 from fishing on a part-time basis. That was the key factor that enabled him to build his house and get a mortgage. It would be wrong if such a person who has come from a fishing background and who genuinely fishes on a part-time basis was excluded from the new scheme. People who have a record in fishing should be considered sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn briefly to the issue of conservation. It has been brought to my attention that according to certain sources in the fishing industry there is a bias by Irish Naval Service vessels to over-police the Irish fishing fleet. Given that Haulbowline is in Cork harbour, the Irish Naval Service vessels find it much easier to target vessels off the south and west coast. I would like to be told this is an exaggeration, that it is untrue and unfair, but unfortunately statistics which have come to light in the past two or three years indicate that the number of Irish vessels being brought ashore for illegal fishing is substantial and that few, if any, of the Spanish fleet were brought in during the same period. If this is the case, I have been listening to incorrect information for the past decade or more because we have been hearing of the rape of good Irish waters by Spanish vessels with secret holds, undersize meshes and many other furtive activities in an effort to take high numbers of valuable fish stocks out of Irish waters. I am concerned about this area and would like equal treatment to be given to all. Our small Naval Service fleet should patrol the Irish Box and ensure that any foreign vessels over the 40 foot allowed under EU regulations and EU law would not be allowed fish.</P>
    <P>It appears from information I have received that when the Spanish fleet returns to its ports in Spain there is little or no supervision by European officials to monitor the fish stocks coming ashore or the size of fish. This is a worrying development. Perhaps the Minister would look at this area and discuss it with the Minister for Defence in order to allay these fears which have been highlighted in the press and on local radio in west Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" />I welcome the provisions of this Bill. It is an excellent idea and is long overdue. I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donovan for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. I am pleased at the introduction and establishment of an independent appeals process for sea fishing boat licensing. The Bill is particularly relevant to my own county of Donegal, a county with a large coastline which relies heavily on the fishing industry. In areas such as Greencastle, which is one of the largest white fishing fleets in Europe, a fishing port one of my predecessors, the late Neil T. Blaney, went to great lengths to develop into what it is today. The spirit of entire communities in Donegal is dependent on sustaining this industry and the jobs it creates.</P>
      <P>The Bill which endeavours to ensure the management and conservation of straddling fish stocks falls short when it comes to safeguarding the fishing industry in Donegal and Ireland as a whole. The restrictions placed on fishing effort in part of ICES area VI &ndash; north of Donegal Bay and up the west coast of Scotland &ndash; mean that whitefish boats fishing in this area will be restricted to nine days per month out of port, which equates to about seven days actual fishing if time steaming to and from fishing grounds is taken into account. No boat can remain viable fishing seven to nine days per month. Fishing effort in ICES Area VII has not been restricted, so those boats large enough to migrate will have to move south and base themselves in Rosaveal, Castletownbere or Dunmore East as fishing seasons change. Smaller boats do not have crew accommodation suitable for living on board for more than a few days, so they will not be able to migrate and will be forced to exist on nine days' work per month. What boat owner will be able to retain crew if he can only offer nine days' work? These smaller boats will eventually be tied up permanently with the loss of three jobs per boat. No business could continue if its trading was reduced to 30% of its previous pattern, yet the Minister expects fishermen to adopt such a scenario with only 35 days' notice.</P>
      <P>The effect on Donegal's indigenous shore based marine industry will be equally serious. As all the boats leave the area, much of the work they generate on shore will eventually move with them. There will be no dramatic immediate closures but jobs will gradually disappear and some small firms will be forced to close when they are not viable any more. These service industries will be the first to be affected. These tend to be small family run concerns. Members of the same family will be put out of work at once and social stress will occur as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the fish processing area, Donegal white fish processors will be deprived of their regular supply of locally caught fish and will be forced to absorb the extra transport costs as a result of buying fish <Col N="643" />in Scotland or Kerry. This will make them less competitive and further emphasise the peripheral nature of Donegal. Loss of competitiveness will eventually lead to job losses and company closures. The majority of white fish processors in Donegal are small family firms, so the social stress will be similar to that in the service industries.</P>
    <P>In many areas the jobs attached to the fishing industry are the only jobs available, so retraining will not be much comfort to those being put out of work. Moving away from the area will be the only option for most of these people and this will lead to depopulation and further losses to businesses not directly involved in fishing.</P>
    <P>The results of the EU Council meeting have been praised as a good result for Ireland and for fish stock conservation. Unfortunately, they will be a disaster for Donegal and will have no real effect on conservation.</P>
    <P>Boats fishing with nets of 100 millimetre mesh size will be allowed nine days out of port in part of Area VI. This is the type of net, particularly when fitted with square mesh panels, which allows the smallest, most juvenile fish to escape to grow and breed. All small fish which get caught are dumped overboard and some survive. Larger mesh sizes would allow more juveniles to escape and decrease discards. This is the policy Irish boats wish to pursue.</P>
    <P>Boats fishing with nets of mesh sizes from 16 to 31 millimetre will be allowed to fish in the same area for 23 days per month. This type of net is used by industrial fishing boats that fish for small fish with which to make fishmeal. They literally catch everything in their path and everything caught is retained on board.</P>
    <P>How can these different rules for the same area be classed as conservation measures? The answer is that the majority of these industrial boats are Danish. It is funny that Denmark holds the current Presidency of the EU. The fishmeal they produce is used to feed livestock in the intensive farming industries of Denmark and Germany.</P>
    <P>Boats fishing in Area VI East of the newly designated line created at the EU Fishery Council are subject to the effort limitation regime I already described. Boats fishing west of that line suffer no such effort restrictions. This line has been drawn to follow a 200 metre depth contour down the west coast of Scotland and Donegal. Outside that line is traditionally fished by the French and some Spanish. Approximately five Irish boats are capable of fishing in those deep waters as all the other boats are too small. France and Spain capitalise here and once again, science and conservation do not come into it.</P>
    <P>The large cod, which these measures are supposed to protect, migrate into the Atlantic and then come back into shallower water to breed. French and Spanish trawlers will be allowed to catch them in the deep water before they reach the shallower spawning areas close to land. Where does conservation come into it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" />Dramatic restrictions in the inner part of Area VI will only cause an increase in fishing effort in Area VII as the Donegal boats are forced south. This will put more strain on existing stock in that area and will eventually lead to effort restrictions being introduced in Area VII as well.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara is currently preparing data to indicate the number of boats in Donegal which will be affected. It is estimated that 30 to 40 boats will fall into the category. Some 18 of those boats will migrate south which will take 144 wage packets out of the county. Of those remaining, about 15 will go to the wall incurring 45 job losses.</P>
    <P>The total number of white fish boats in Donegal is estimated at more than 200 vessels, most of which are under 10 metres in length and are exempt from the effort restriction regulations. However, these small boats will also be affected by the withdrawal of the larger boats to southern ports. Around the coast of Donegal, the small boats land small quantities of fish at irregular intervals as they are very weather dependent. The sale and transport of these fish by land is handled by the large selling agents, co-operatives, etc., and the market is dependent on the landings of the bigger boats to make things economically viable. To send ten boxes of ray from Inch Island to Grimsby or four boxes of white pollack from Malin Head to Dublin or six boxes of a megrim from Burtonport to Spain is obviously not economic.</P>
    <P>The core transport, selling and accounting systems are dependent on the bulk of fish generated by the larger boats. If this bulk of fish falls below a critical mass, the transport system will be withdrawn as no transport company can run with almost empty lorries. Not only will the larger freight hauliers lose jobs but so too will many of the small single van operations which service the internal county transport network. Many of these small operators depend on moving fish to sustain their operations. Again, the small indigenous family run firm will suffer most.</P>
    <P>The GIS may be able to give an indication of current job levels in ancillary industries in the county. In the immediate service industries, such as engineering repairs, net mending, etc., most of the jobs will be at risk within six to 12 months. The larger engineering, gear and electronics firms will survive but will start to cut staff within 12 months. Smaller processors will start to close within six months while larger firms will start to cut jobs within the same period. The product quality of Donegal fish will decline and selling agencies in the county will start to suffer.</P>
    <P>The Donegal Task Force on Employment, set up to address the Fruit of the Loom crisis, rightly identified fishing as an indigenous industry which should be protected, nurtured and helped to develop. The marine resources sectoral working group also highlighted the added importance of the fishing industry to Donegal.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Connolly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Unfortunately, I was not able to speak on the legislation when it was first introduced in the House because I was not in the country, so I am delighted to be able to contribute at this stage. I echo Deputy Blaney's regarding the effect of conservation measures that were agreed during the re-negotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy. The result will be that many fishing vessels, particularly in Donegal, will not be viable in the medium to long-term. I appeal to the Minister of State and the Department to re-negotiate these measures.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is twofold, as it proposes to establish an independent statutory appeals process for sea fishing boat licences and to give effect to an international UN agreement on the implications of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, relating to the conservation and management of straddling and migratory fish stocks. The Bill also strengthens fisheries enforcement measures, particularly in sections 21 and 22, giving increased powers to fishery protection officers and increasing the number of officers by order of the Minister. Members of the Garda, Naval Service and coastguard will become fishery protection officers upon the enactment of the legislation.</P>
      <P>However, it is to our shame, as an island nation on the western periphery of Europe, that Ireland is the last country in the continent to enact the legislation. All the other European countries who are affected have done so, as has the European Union. We are dragging our feet in this area and for that reason I am anxious that the legislation should be passed. The Minister of State will have the support of Fine Gael on Second Stage, although we may propose minor amendments that can be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the themes of the legislation, the first of which is the allocation of licences to fishing vessels and the appeals process that will be established. I welcome the proposed appointment of an independent appeals officer. This is a move <Col N="646" />towards a more transparent and positive system, which will be more accountable than systems in the past. Deputy McGinley's contribution to the debate was telling. He stated the Minister was all-powerful in regard to the allocation of licences. I have experienced the frustration of fishermen in my constituency and elsewhere about licensing decisions. They could not avail of an appeal mechanism and that was totally unacceptable. That is part of yesterday's world of politics. The setting up of an independent appeals process is a necessity and it is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>A connected issue is the allocation of quotas to fishing boats through the licensing system. A suggestion has been put to me by interested parties in this area. It is proposed that the restructuring of the quota allocation procedure should be considered to allow industry representatives distribute part of the quota. Currently, Ireland is given a quota by the EU and that is re-allocated by the Department to various boats nationwide. I propose that when the quota is announced by the Union, a pilot scheme should be introduced under which a percentage of the quota would be allocated to industry representatives who could then divide it among its members. Industry representatives have a better understanding of the needs of fishermen because they are on the piers talking to fishermen, skippers and boat owners about what quotas they need and when they need them. If a system such as this was introduced the State would enjoy a greater economic return for the same overall quota.</P>
    <P>There are times in the year when stocks are low and it is not suitable to trawl for certain types of fish. This means that surplus quota is available for certain species of fish at these times. If there was flexibility within the system to re-allocate the quotas between boats depending on which boat fished for which species, it would be more effective. The current blunt mechanism ensures many small boats have a relatively short time to catch as much as they can to fill their quotas. I ask the Minister and the Department to consider this proposal as it does not re-invent the wheel. The system is in place in other EU countries. There is three main industry representative bodies, which are the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, the South and West Fishermen's Organisation and the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation.</P>
    <P>During the re-negotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy those bodies demonstrated a great deal of unity and ability to bring forward organised proposals and take on their responsibilities in terms of conservation and the promotion of the industry generally. Most of the conservation initiatives, which address the concerns expressed by Deputy Blaney have been put forward by the industry itself. It has taken on a number of pilot projects to conserve stocks off the south east, south west and west coasts. The time has come for us, as policy makers, to engage industry representatives in a more pro-active way in the allocation of quotas. At a minimum, this should be attempted on a pilot basis because we <Col N="647" />can get better value per tonne of quota, particularly now that quotas are scarce following the disappointing results of the re-negotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    <P>On the issue of conservation and management of fish stocks, the Minister will be given power under the legislation to create conservation areas. This principle should be carried forward into negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy because the fishing industry is keen on it. Everybody wants to put set aside areas in place that have been scientifically researched and proven to need conservation, whether it is for the purposes of breeding, spawning or fish growth, and that can be policed. I am glad under the relevant section serious punishment will be meted out to those who break the regulations relating to conservation areas. The section provides for fines of up to &euro;500,000, which would be a significant penalty.</P>
    <P>The enforcement measures are welcome. However, if regulations are not enforced even-handedly across Europe, fishermen here will continue to be aggrieved. There are two essential issues in relation to enforcement. No fisherman has a problem with tough enforcement measures if fishermen in Spain, France, Britain and the North Sea are subject to the same regulations. As long as there is a common standard across Europe, Irish fishermen will accept the regulations. However, they will not accept tougher enforcement with two or three fisheries officers waiting when they come into the pier if their counterparts in Spain do not also have that type of regulation. Many accusations have been made. It is up to the Department to verify whether they are true. If they are, the issue needs to be addressed at EU level.</P>
    <P>Enforcement within Irish waters, over which we have more control, should also be even-handed. Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the concern among fishermen operating off the southern and western coasts that they are being subjected to tighter regulation and enforcement than their counterparts on the north-western and eastern coasts, simply because of the geographical location of Haulbowline in Cork Harbour. I do not know whether this is true. However, I have seen charts depicting the number of inspections and boardings of fishing vessels. These charts show a density of inspections along the southern and western coasts. I would like to think that is because of the extra Spanish fishing vessels in the Irish box which are likely to come from the south. However, I have also heard that before Christmas two fishing vessels were boarded within a mile of each other by two different naval vessels within three or four hours. That is not likely to happen off the north-western coast. The Naval Service is doing a very good job with the resources it has &ndash; it has eight ships, four or five of which are at sea at any one time, and there are 140,000 square miles of sea, 11% of European waters, that it must monitor. It is a massive job for a small navy and it is doing a good job. However, it is neces<Col N="648" />sary that the Department ensures that inspections and clusters of inspections are spread evenly between foreign vessels and Irish vessels. We do not expect special treatment for Irish vessels. They should be treated in the same way as foreign vessels, and vessels off the southern coast should be treated similarly to those off the northern and western coasts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has received an almost universal welcome. I welcome it for its establishment of a statutory and independent appeals process for sea fishing boat licensing. In particular, I welcome its belated recognition of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea agreement adopted in 1995 regarding the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. Global fisheries resources are now under severe pressure and nature is sending out clear signals that unsustainable fishing practices cannot continue. In total 11 of the world's major fishing areas are in serious decline. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation the international fishing fleet is twice as large as fish stocks can support.</P>
      <P>We also know that the longer we wait to deal with unsustainable fishing the more intractable the problem will become. Fishing is the life blood of many of our coastal regions and fishing traditions are deeply entrenched around our coasts. Everyone agrees that conservation is a good thing, but there is always pressure to find more ways of exploiting the ever dwindling resources. With every year the Government puts off difficult choices, more young people enter fisheries that are already being over-exploited. For every year problems are ignored, dependency on a diminishing resource becomes more entrenched and harder to address. Unsustainable fishing must be addressed urgently to ensure that fish resources are conserved and allowed to rebuild. Whether we like it or not, reducing fishing capacity must be part of that, whether through sponsoring active retirement packages or by promoting the industry's self-rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that reduction of fishing capacity is difficult to carry out. However, foreign trawlers should not be given a licence to operate freely in our waters as this operates to the detriment of local fishermen. If fishing continues to exceed the productive capacity of the resource, the resource will decline or collapse. In that event, individuals and communities who depend on the resource will suddenly find themselves with few prospects and little hope for the future. Reality will hit hard and can no longer be ignored. Addressing over-capacity in a meaningful way before it is too late can shape a bright future for commercial fishing. Responsible fishing must mean putting the needs of fish stocks ahead of the immediate needs of the fishermen. Common sense tells us that without fish there can be no fishing and hence no livelihood for fishermen, their families and communities. <Col N="649" />The challenge, as custodian of the resource, is to help balance the harvesting capacity of the fishing industry with the health and abundance of fish stocks.</P>
    <P>Our territorial waters, amounting to more than 20% of EU waters are dominated by Spanish vessels which seek to enlarge their quotas in spite of diminishing stocks. Adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea agreement will enable EU countries, including Ireland, to deal effectively with issues like straddling or highly migratory fish stocks and the growing problem of use of flags of convenience, pirate fishing and wasteful and destructive fishing practices. Unchecked, these irresponsible activities undermine progress on conservation and fleet reduction. It is galling for Governments to have to restrict their own fishermen only to see fish stocks exploited by rogue elements. Conservation must be the number one priority for fishermen and commitment to conservation and responsible fishing practices. Conservation is in everybody's best interests to ensure the strength of our fisheries in the years to come. Responsible fishing has a major role to play. According to the UN FAO, some 30 million tonnes of the world's total fish catch is lost because of improper handling, discards and dumping. In the EU a discard level in excess of 70% is not uncommon. This level of discard of juvenile fish is a major cause for concern and seriously undermines the ultimate aim of sustainable fish stock. This is a formula for accelerating the decline in fish stocks. In the interests of the future of the fishing industry, this matter should be addressed urgently. The future of the industry will be seriously threatened if the level of discard remains at 70%.</P>
    <P>One of the major pluses of the Bill is that authorities will be given the power to board and search fishing boats under all flags to enforce quotas. Foreign ships have endeavoured to play ducks and drakes with fishery patrol vessels in the past. As it is vital that a high level of enforcement is maintained, it is important that the power to search all ships is granted and that the appropriate penalties specified in this Bill are applied across the board. Conservation must be the byword for the fishing industry's future and this Bill makes a valuable contribution in that regard. More responsible fishing means less waste, which in turn means maximum quality and value. By making the most of the fish we catch, we can make a major contribution to our conservation goals. I welcome the independent statutory process established in this Bill. It will be viewed as transparent, independent and impartial and should enjoy the confidence of the industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, which achieves a worthy balance between the establishment of a licensing mechanism for sea fishing boats and an appeals procedure on the one hand, and protocols for conservation and diminishing fish stocks on the other hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate on this Bill on all three days when it was discussed in the House. The wide-ranging, constructive and informative comments made about the fishing industry show the importance attached to it by Deputies. I thank them for their ideas and suggestions and I assure them that they will be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As I said when I introduced this Bill, this legislation is needed to implement the commitment in the programme for Government to establish an independent statutory appeals process for the licensing of sea fishing boats. It also enables Ireland to ratify and take part in the EU and international implementation of the 1995 United Nations agreement concerning the conservation and management of vulnerable and valuable straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. It will ensure that we have sustainable fishing and strengthen some existing sea fisheries enforcement legislation, in the interests of greater enforcement efforts and deterring illegal fishing.</P>
      <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources' website was mentioned by a number of Deputies, who welcomed the fact that information on the licensing of sea fishing boats will be available on-line. I hope it will play a key role in achieving a fully transparent licensing and appeals system, as envisaged in the Bill. I assure the House that all concerned will work to enhance the value of the website for all sectors of the Department related to fisheries and, of course, for the public.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies mentioned licensing decisions and asked who may appeal, and when, under this Bill. The clear intention is that only licensing decisions made on or after a definitive future date will be allowed to be appealed. Earlier decisions will not be allowed to be re-opened. Following further examination of the Bill in that regard, I will propose a technical amendment to section 4 on Committee Stage, to put the matter beyond doubt. It is proposed that licensing decisions made one month after the Bill becomes law will be open to appeal as it is intended that the statutory appeals officer will be in place by then. As a corollary, the proposed amendment will also make it clear that a licensing decision which is appealed will be suspended until the appeal is decided on or withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The fees that will be charged for appeals were mentioned by many speakers. They are dealt with by ministerial regulations under section 15 of the Bill and are as follows: &euro;380.90 will be payable by an appellant who is the licence applicant or licensee concerned and &euro;152.37 will be payable by any other appellant. An additional &euro;76.18 will be payable by those who request an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Control of the operations of the Naval Service was raised by a number of Deputies, who mentioned that there is a perception that it does not operate in an even-handed manner. I receive <Col N="651" />many telephone calls, particularly from Deputy Coveney's part of the country, to tell me that the Naval Service is over-active. I did not realise that so many fishermen in County Cork have my mobile telephone number to complain about such activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics that are received as a result of checks in the Department do not support this view. The pattern of sightings and boardings has remained consistent in recent years. The Naval Service is extremely conscious of maintaining an even-handed approach to boarding and inspecting vessels. The targeting of vessels is not a factor unless the Naval Service is asked to do so by a specific fishery or fishery control, particularly in relation to a closed cod or hake box. The statistics show that more than half of the Naval Service's inspections relate to non-Irish vessels. Deputy Coveney asked me to raise the issue of enforcement with the EU. It was decided at a Council meeting last December to review enforcement across the EU to ensure a level playing field. Inspectors from the Commission may get involved in the process with, or independent of, national enforcement officials. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is actively pursuing the matter at EU level. The number of new licences issued annually was also raised, and I can inform the House that about 200 new licences are issued each year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney also raised the interesting possibility of the quota being allocated by fishermen. Such an idea is worthy of consideration. Farmers are involved directly in the allocation of quotas for milk, grain and many other things. Deputy Coveney's suggestion will be carefully considered in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I hope to arrange a meeting between the Deputy and senior officials in the Department, Mr. Cecil Beamish and Ms Josephine Kelly, to discuss and tease out the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>One might have concerns about policing of the quota by fishermen, but it is an interesting idea. I will ask officials of my Department to discuss it with Deputy Coveney as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was heartened by the many speakers who highlighted the ongoing need to conserve fish stocks and to ensure there is sustainable fishing activity. The Government and the fishing industry, with the international competent authorities, continue to work together to ensure that appropriate conservation measures are put in place to safeguard future fish stocks, not only in Irish waters but also in other waters of particular interest to Irish people. We can ensure the survival of the <Col N="652" />fishing industry and the coastal communities that depend on the industry through sustainable fishing. Over-fishing by those involved in the fishing industry is unfair and threatens the future opportunities of others. Given that the rules must be enforced for the public good, I welcome the support of Deputies for the Bill's provisions that strengthen and control our enforcement arrangements and back up conservation and recovery plans. I would like to say to Deputies who mentioned new species that my Department, BIM and the Marine Institute are actively exploring the scope for sustainable new sources of fish to be caught by Irish fishermen, particularly in deep seas. Competition in this area will be very intense.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the small, unlicensed and unregistered inshore fleet and that regulations are about to be introduced. I mentioned in my speech introducing Second Stage that extensive consultation is under way on the Minister's outline proposals for the regularisation of small, unlicensed and unregistered inshore fishing boats. The Minister will carefully consider the outcome of the consultation process. Concerns have been expressed about conservation and sustainable fishing. Many licensed fishermen are worried about the best share-out of available fishing resources. All these matters will be examined before the scheme is finalised. There will be no requirement to acquire replacement tonnage. The current arrangements for sea fishing boat licensing are set out in my Department's document of June 2002 and are the subject of an expert review that will be completed by 30 June 2003. A key factor in the deliberations and the basis of the main report is the awaited clarification of decisions of the EU Common Fisheries Policy late last year, notably regarding the permitted overall size, composition and capacity of the Irish sea fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contribution to the debate, particularly the spokespersons from the various political parties. I look forward to Committee Stage and am sure that, as Deputy Coveney and others have said, the Opposition will table amendments which the Government will consider seriously. I thank Deputies for dealing quickly with Second Stage and thank the officials involved. I look forward to completing passage of the Bill as quickly as possible. It is important legislation which was committed to in the programme for Government. It is a further part of new legislation procedures which will be implemented by my Department in coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill to establish an independent statutory body, the Railway Safety Commission, with wide-ranging powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement; to require the railway undertaking to put in place a formal safety management system and describe the components of that system in a document called &ldquo;Safety Case&rdquo;; and to establish an independent statutory body, the Railway Safety Advisory Commission, or a council comprising representatives of organisations with an interest in rail safety.</P>
      <P>In researching this Bill, I discovered that the first CIE general meeting was held in the Gresham Hotel, Dublin, on 14 March 1946. The then chairman outlined plans for the future of the railways and the conversion from traditional locomotives to diesel traction engines which would be built at the Inchicore workplace. Work had already commenced on that. In comparing that situation with today, it is clear that things have changed considerably and I am delighted with the establishment of an independent rail safety body in Ireland for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's rail network is inextricably linked in history and style to the much more extensive UK network, formerly known as British Rail. Most of today's network was constructed under British rule and the railways have been in existence in some form since the early 19th century. To get a sense of the different scales of the two networks, there are many criteria which it would be useful to compare. For example, the combined UK rail <Col N="654" />companies have more passenger journeys in one day than Iarnród Éireann has in one year.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concerned with rail safety and prompts me to look back at one of the worst Irish train accidents of recent times, in August 1980, when the Cork to Dublin train derailed outside Buttevant, not far from my area, costing the lives of 18 people. The expert bodies that reviewed that accident discovered that the old timber-frame carriage bodies mounted on a steel frame were totally inadequate and were completely destroyed, while the more modern steel-frame carriage bodies survived. An inquiry was held and eight recommendations were made covering various aspects of the accident, many of which have been implemented.</P>
    <P>I was in Tralee in 1983 and can remember seeing a train taking off over what is now known as the Thomas McEllistrim Memorial Bridge. Seven people were killed in an accident which happened to a train in that area on 21 August 1983. The train from Tralee was stopped and a train coming from Galway hit its rear. Three people from my area &ndash; from Kanturk, Bothar Buí and Ballydesmond &ndash; were killed in the accident. I remember it being said that it was a freak occurrence that of seven people killed in the accident, three were from such a small area. The accident shattered confidence in rail safety.</P>
    <P>When I checked the provisions of this Bill, my mind was brought back to those two accidents, particularly that of 1983. Safety regulations must be put in place to ensure that such incidents never again occur and that lives are not lost on the railways. Some of the regulations in force go back to the Railway Acts of 1924 and beyond &ndash; some date from the time of British rule &ndash; and it is sensible to update them.</P>
    <P>Railways offer a fantastic service. With the advent of motor transport in the 1950s, there was a suggestion that there was no further use for railways or for the updating of the railway network. Ireland was looking to America and Australia where the railway networks and their profits collapsed. However, the rail network is more important now than ever before. The Arrow services to and from Dublin have quickly come on stream and are needed. In other major cities of the world, railway networks have provided a fantastic service and we should consider that.</P>
    <P>Travelling by rail from Dublin to Cork, particularly at busy times such as when football and hurling matches are played, passengers must tolerate poor conditions. People lie in corridors or stand for a three and a half hour journey. I realise that further engines are coming on stream and more are being purchased for the inter-city rail network but that is not before time. We must ensure there is a proper rail network because if that was the case for the whole country, fewer people would travel by road. My area is lucky to have two rail lines, the Cork line and the Kerry line, which give a good service. Other parts of the service have been completely closed down and the re-laying or re-opening of those tracks should <Col N="655" />be considered. I realise that would cost a lot of money but the situation would be far better in 25 years if that was done.</P>
    <P>A lot of money has been invested, including &euro;115 million for 80 new carriages for suburban services in the greater Dublin area. Iarnród Éireann has a total of 187 carriages for inter-city routes and this will be of huge benefit. I am not certain whether Iarnród Éireann will keep its title and remain under the auspices of CIE but it is vital the issue of rail safety is considered. I realise that the splitting up of CIE and increased competition is being considered. However, it is most important to ensure that trains are provided for the comfort of people at a reasonable cost and standard. This should mean that when passengers alight, whether it be at Heuston Station or elsewhere, they should feel they had been on a good journey and that the railways provide an excellent form of transport. Given that the roads are so clogged with traffic, the inter-city rail services have a great potential to provide a countrywide transport service.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. Some of the legislation in this area was enacted under British rule while the 1924 Act continues to apply. In view of this, it is a good idea to enact further legislation on rail safety.</P>

      <P>This is important legislation. Things have gone backwards in the past 100 years. My village of Mulranny has a population of 300 people. One hundred years ago there was a train service to the back of the Mulranny Great Southern Hotel, which was the jewel in the crown of the Great Southern Hotel group. In those Victorian days entire families and their servants would travel to Mulranny by train, which continued its service to Achill and elsewhere. A constituent once told me that on her return train journey from Westport she would deposit her shopping from the train near her home as it slowed down, alight at Mulranny station, collect her bicycle at her house and then proceed to collect her shopping. The train service enabled her to do her shopping in Westport, 17 miles from her house, and return home in time for dinner. Nowadays there is hardly a bus service, never mind a train service.</P>
      <P>Railways are needed because of the state of the roads, yet the allocation for rail spending for Connacht this year is a disgrace. While there are train services from Dublin to Galway and Sligo, County Mayo is largely neglected. I would like to see measures in the Bill that will improve this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport has the capabilities and the potential to do much, but he needs the <Col N="656" />resources. As a west of Ireland man I hope he will deliver. I commend him on his ongoing efforts to revitalise State industries through the introduction of competition and other appropriate measures. Communities must be involved because the service exists for the public. It is not a question of making or losing money. The station at Mulranny is falling down and the great hotel, which once employed 100 people, lies empty and neglected. Bats fly in and out of it.</P>
    <P>The decision to facilitate a private rail freight operator to run the State's rail network is timely because public disapproval of Iarnród Éireann is growing. The decision to introduce GB Rail Freight may pave the way for liberalisation of the entire industry. It is also important to ensure that the freight rail services to Foynes and Waterford ports continue.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks there has been much talk about the massive increase in public capital investment that is required to modernise the rail network. It is an important infrastructure that is totally under-utilised. However, I question whether Iarnród Éireann has the ability to oversee this vital programme. If it is not done properly it will never be right. The company's involvement in previous major capital infrastructure projects has not been good. For example, its record on the mini CTC re-signalling project is abysmal. There were cost overruns and alleged corruption involving sweetheart deals. There was no accountability with the result that a deteriorating rail service continued to ignore the plight of the hard pressed public.</P>
    <P>It is puzzling that some of the company's expensive rolling stock in Dublin, such as DART and Arrow cars, depreciates while lying idle. They cannot be used because of a lack of capacity on the city's central rail thoroughfares. While regional railways must close for the want of &euro;2 million in funding, some of the &euro;16 million DART trains are not used. The board of Iarnród Éireann must make these hard decisions on behalf of the taxpayers. Perhaps when the rolling stock in Dublin is replaced the old stock will be transferred to the west. We are always the last to be considered and must accept whatever is left over.</P>
    <P>The only Government-funded Iarnród Éireann project that has been accepted by the public covers the company's flashy advertisements, which are on the air at peak times on RTE every week. The catch-phrase states: &ldquo;We are not there yet, but we are getting there.&rdquo;  Will the company ever get there? It is a joke at this stage because the Government is forced to preside over the slow strangulation of the country's railway services by this dinosaur of a monopoly company.</P>
    <P>As it is currently constituted, Iarnród Éireann will not get anywhere, regardless of how many billions of euro of taxpayers money is directed at it. The railway services constitute a valuable and finite resource. In County Mayo, Iarnród Éireann has spent approximately &euro;30 million over the past couple of years upgrading track between Manulla <Col N="657" />and Ballina and Manulla and Westport. While it is welcome, it must be asked if the taxpayer is receiving value for money. At present, only six trains per day and two irregular freight trains use the line.</P>
    <P>By their nature, railways carry an unusually high fixed capital cost in terms of rolling stock and infrastructure. The structure must be used as much as possible to make it pay. Most of the direct costs involved are time based, that is, traction, labour and so on. The key to running railways efficiently is tied into the intensive utilisation of fixed capital assets. The Ballina branch line is remarkably well patronised considering its inefficient running. At present, a 99 tonne locomotive, which was designed to pull freight trains in excess of 1,500 tonnes, pulls two 45 year old carriages and a steam van, or a total of 200 tonnes, from Ballina to Manulla three times each way to meet the Dublin train. It amounts to one and a half tonnes per passenger at a maximum loading. Five drivers and three guards are employed in the provision of the service. An annual wage bill of &euro;300,000 is required to provide a service of six 30-minute train trips per day. The position of guards on modern trains is obsolete and a maximum of three or four drivers should be sufficient to operate the Ballina service.</P>
    <P>It gets worse. Each day the train runs empty to and from Claremorris to turn the engine. That is a total of 106 kilometres a day. It means that revenue is expended on running empty trains for approximately 40,000 kilometres per year. The Iarnród Éireann board speaks of cost-cutting, but this train is travelling 106 kilometres every day and it is empty. How can it pay for itself? </P>
    <P>The sensible proposals to better utilise the railway, involving no capital costs and a reduction in day-to-day running costs, have been put to Iarnród Éireann by a consortium of local representative groups, including the Mayo County Development Board, the Moy Valley and south Mayo IRDs and the Ballina, Castlebar and Westport chambers of commerce. However, the proposals have all been shot down.</P>
    <P>An article in the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> stated that the Minister has encouraged the setting up of a working group to steer through the redevelopment of the Nenagh line at a considerable capital cost of approximately &euro;30 million to &euro;100 million. Is the Minister willing to address a Mayo delegation, of which I am a member, regarding the setting up of a Ballina-Castlebar-Westport service at no capital cost? The necessary infrastructure is already in place. It would save the taxpayer money and earn more revenue for Iarnród Éireann. If the proposal of the delegation is not taken on board, a useless service will be allowed to operate indefinitely until Iarnród Éireann, faced with mounting losses, states that it is forced to close the Ballina line because it is not paying for itself. It is no surprise that the line is in the west.</P>
    <P>The cost of line maintenance is proportional to the weight of locomotives so the heavy loco<Col N="658" />motives should be replaced with modern vehicles. The heavy locomotives should be consigned to the transport museum and not be used to transport the poor, wretched, unfortunate people of Mayo up and down a 106 kilometre line. More often than not, the locomotives are empty, which makes no sense.</P>
    <P>If Iarnród Éireann refuses to use our valuable rail infrastructure properly, it is about time somebody else did, such as a private investor. I am not saying we should follow the disastrous lead of the UK in this respect, but something must be done to bring about more competitive practices in the rail sector, whether it involves private or community based initiatives. There are many young people with expertise and communities who would be delighted to get involved. Local transport initiatives are being implemented all the time. Why should they not pertain to rail as well?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider allowing the community in Mayo to help itself by establishing a local rail initiative? I refer in particular to a proposal for rail services between Ballina, Castlebar and Westport.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to speak on the Railway Safety Bill, the primary purpose of which is to establish an independent statutory public body, the Railway Safety Commission, which will have wide-ranging powers and will put in place a formal safety management system. It will also establish an independent, statutory, public body, the Railway Safety Advisory Council. Many welcome the publication of the Bill because the improvement of railway safety is a key concern, particularly if rail travel is to be a genuine alternative to road travel.</P>
      <P>One matter that has concerned me greatly in the past year or two is the number of advertisements by Iarnród Éireann, paid for by the taxpayer. They state: &ldquo;We're not there yet but we're getting there&rdquo;. There seems to be a familiar ring to this slogan, which is like the slogan, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;. Where the Sligo-Dublin rail link is concerned, the slogan should read: &ldquo;Little done and lots to do&rdquo;. This applies to both passenger and freight rail traffic.</P>
      <P>Last week the NRA spoke directly to those of us who live in the west after having given us a derisory 5% of its allocation. It said, in the simplest possible terms, that when the major projects are completed in the south and east, the west will get the crumbs from the table if there is anything left over. At least the NRA was frank and did not try to fool us. However, Iarnród Éireann is taking the softy-softly approach &ndash;&ldquo;We're not there yet but we're getting there&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and those who use the Sligo-Dublin rail link can tell Iarnród Éireann that it is not even close to &ldquo;getting there&rdquo;. It can spend approximately &euro;4,000 on a 30 second slot on RTE or &euro;8,000 on a one minute slot, night after night, telling us what a good service it is providing, yet even Government Deputies have admitted in the House that its service is second rate. One adver<Col N="659" />tisement per night for two months &ndash; there are many more than that &ndash; costs approximately &euro;250,000, give or take a few thousand euro of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>There is no proper dining car on the Sligo-Dublin train, yet Iarnród Éireann can spend &euro;250,000 telling us how good things are. We get the carriages which are cast off from other lines, yet we have to sit and listen to the jingle, &ldquo;We're not there yet but we're getting there.&rdquo;  Freight services from Sligo are virtually non-existent although we watch the images of happy children basking in the glow and warmth of the advertiser's message. Sometimes I ask myself if we have lost all sense of reality when advertisements that we pay for try to convince us that fantasy is fact and that images on television represent good service. What happens when the fantasy is replaced by reality and what about the future of rail freight?</P>
    <P>This Bill is about railway safety, but that should not be considered in isolation. Railway safety can contribute to road safety by cutting down on traffic. There are too many heavy-goods vehicles on inter-urban routes. However, hardly any rail freight containers have left Sligo in the past month as almost all of them have been transported by road. If rail freight transport shifts to road transport, the Government will end up spending more on road maintenance than it would have cost to encourage goods to be transported by train in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that tax breaks are available in other countries to promote freight transport by rail. Will the Minister consider giving relief on capital expenditure on the construction of a railway or tramway lines used to transport goods in or out of a building or structure used for the purposes of trade? Relief could also be given on the restoration to active use of a railway or tramway line previously put to such use or the modification of a building or structure to facilitate the transport of goods by rail. Capital allowances could be granted at the rate of 20% per annum for five years and any allowances granted could be clawed back if the railway or tramway line ceased to be used for trade within five years. This would provide a real incentive for companies to become involved in freight transport by rail.</P>
    <P>It is critical that freight transport by rail be expanded and that we have a comprehensive service in this respect. Iarnród Éireann has made a lame attempt to brush over the extra 400 trucks that will be on our already-overcrowded road network every day, which will amount to a staggering 146,000 extra trucks every year. This problem cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The proposal to have a commuter service from Sligo to Ballymote is a visionary project which would see a number of commuter trains running daily on existing lines between the two towns. A feasibility study was carried out and the project is now with Iarnród Éireann. Will the Minister deal favourably with this project and not just pay it lip <Col N="660" />service by saying it is a good idea, which it is, but run it as a pilot project? Sligo has been designated a gateway in the spatial strategy. A commuter service would enhance Sligo's gateway status in the national spatial strategy and take hundreds of cars off the N4 at peak times, which would improve the environment. I ask the Minister to examine the feasibility of re-opening the Sligo-Limerick line. This important infrastructure is necessary to provide adequate rail services for the west coast beyond a merely radial network which serves Dublin. I do not object to the large investment in rail services for Dublin, but we are in danger of focusing exclusively on what a constituent of mine calls &ldquo;Pale rail&rdquo;. In the interests of safety and rail travel, I ask the Minister to look at upgrading the Sligo-Dublin line and launching a pilot commuter system from Sligo to Ballymote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their varied and interesting contributions. The Minister for Transport is pleased that the House takes such a keen interest in the safety of our railways, a subject on which he feels very strongly. I will respond to some of the issues raised by Deputies in a moment, but before doing so, I re-iterate the point that this Bill provides a modern regulatory framework for a modern railway transport network which should serve us well for many years to come.</P>
      <P>The principal feature of the legislation is the creation of an independent railway safety regulator &ndash; the Railway Safety Commission &ndash; and its provisions will apply to passenger and freight operations. The Bill does not apply to industrial railways, such as the Bord na Móna network, except in so far as they interface with public roads or other railways. From an occupational safety perspective, industrial railways will continue to be the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority. The Railway Safety Commission will have a wide-ranging remit to ensure safe operations by railway companies and will be given extensive powers to carry out its functions. These powers will be similar to those available to the Health and Safety Authority with which the Department of Transport is consulting to agree a memorandum of understanding to ensure maximum co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission is to be given the necessary teeth to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Bill through the issue of statutory enforcement notices. The Bill also provides for the prosecution of offences with penalties of up to &euro;500,000. The Minister notes Deputy Naughten's comments and expresses his confidence that the commission and the DPP will not be slow to prosecute under this Bill. The Minister is also open to considering including more offences or increased penalties on Committee Stage. The Minister shares the concerns expressed by Deputies Breen and Dennehy regarding the danger posed to the safety of our railways by vandals, but notes that <Col N="661" />the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 provides for terms of imprisonment of up to seven years for endangering a railway in this way. If vandalism were to cause a death, a charge of manslaughter, which carries more severe penalties, could be brought.</P>
    <P>An important function of the Railway Safety Commission will be the investigation of railway accidents. Discussion is taking place of a draft EU directive proposing that such accident investigations be carried out by a national body independent of the safety regulator. These talks are at an advanced stage and there are varying opinions on the issue. Depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Minister may refer to this issue on Committee Stage. The Bill seeks to provide the new commission with significant investigative powers and to give it discretion regarding which incidents it chooses to examine. Further consideration is being given to the need to require the commission to investigate certain types of incident. Deputy Shortall stated that the Bill makes no provision for representation of employees being interviewed by the commission as part of the investigation of a railway incident. Section 70 of the Bill addresses this issue, but leaves the issue of representation at the discretion of the inspector conducting the investigation.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies commented on the safety of level crossings, with Deputy Naughten commenting on a number of specific sites. Iarnród Éireann has carried out significant works on level crossings over the past four years. Since 1999, the company has invested some &euro;64 million of Exchequer funds under the railway safety programme to permanently close or upgrade some 260 high-risk level crossings and a substantial number of low-risk crossings. For Deputy Naughten's information, a compulsory purchase order has been drafted by Iarnród Éireann with regard to Woodfarm to facilitate construction of a bridge to replace the existing level crossing. Pending this work, the views and surface at the level crossing have been improved and Iarnród Éireann has written again to its regular users to remind them of their legal obligation to close the gates after use. The Slieve Corbally crossing was not rated as a high risk by consultants, AD Little. Iarnród Éireann has nevertheless improved the views at the crossing as much as is practicable and extra signs have been erected on the gates. At Kiltoom crossing, colour light signals were installed in 2001 and are working satisfactorily while Iarnród Éireann is looking at the feasibility of replacing the Knockmoylan crossing with a bridge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore expressed concern about landslides and coastal erosion beside railway lines. Substantial investment is ongoing under the railway safety investment programme to protect the railway against natural hazards. Works are complete or ongoing at Malahide, Sorrento, Killiney, Bray Head and between Greystones and Wicklow. larnród Éireann is considering the need for further works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" />A number of Deputies commented on the provisions of this Bill regarding random testing for alcohol and drugs. This provision applies only to specified safety-critical staff on the railways. While all staff of railway undertakings have a duty of care not to endanger others by being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, railways will not be required to test all staff under this Bill. Random testing is increasingly being looked to in areas of work where an employee is responsible for lives of others. The Defence Forces recently introduced random testing of all ranks for drugs and have begun taking random samples. The intoxicants provisions of this Bill were carefully drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure compliance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The former Attorney General confirmed at the time of publication of this Bill that he was satisfied with the constitutionality of these provisions. The Minister notes Deputy Naughten's comment regarding the independence of personnel taking and analysing samples for intoxicants. Part 9 requires that the analysis body be independent of railway undertakings. The Minister will consider the need for any amendment on Committee Stage. The provisions of this Bill relating to intoxicants apply equally to passenger and freight lines. However, the Minister will consider the intoxicants clause and will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister notes also Deputy Shortall's comments in regard to the complexity of the language used in section 85 (1) and will consider, in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the need to clarify the text on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowe expressed concern about fatigue suffered by train drivers. The Minister has been advised by Iarnród Éireann that the new deal for train drivers provides for a maximum rostered day of ten hours and that monitoring arrangements are in place to ensure compliance with this. Deputy Neville mentioned the counselling services available to train drivers following any suicide attempt involving their train. Such counselling services are made available by Iarnród Éireann and according to the company most drivers involved in a suicide event avail of them. Drivers can have as many counselling sessions as they wish.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies spoke about access for disabled people to the Iarnród Éireann network. Iarnród Éireann has informed the Minister that it is its policy to include accessibility requirements in the purchase of all new rolling stock. The 80 diesel railcars whose delivery has commenced and which will begin to enter service in the summer, are fully accessible, as will be the 67 inter-city carriages ordered by Iarnród Éireann in December. Similarly, all new station works and major refurbishment of existing stations provide for accessibility in the plans. Many older stations have now been made accessible and more will be <Col N="663" />adapted this year and in future years. Section 66 (1) will enable the Railway Safety Commission to make regulations in relation to standards, specifications and procedures to be used by railway undertakings to safely facilitate the special requirements of mobility-impaired persons.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies spoke about the issue of crowding in railway carriages. The Minister is very aware of this problem and is conscious of the discomfort and inconvenience this causes to passengers. This problem has been largely caused by the significant increase in passenger numbers in recent years.</P>
    <P>The problem is being addressed in a number of ways. Investment in new rolling stock has substantially increased passenger capacity on certain routes in recent years and we will see further significant increases from later this year as the new rolling stock I mentioned earlier begins to enter service. In addition, this Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case all issues impacting on the safety of its operations. Such issues would include its strategy for managing crowding of trains, particularly at peak periods. The railway undertaking will have to demonstrate to the Railway Safety Commission that its overall safety management system is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall mentioned the safety audit carried out by consultants IRMS on the mini-CTC lines. In their report the consultants concluded that overall the results of the sample audit gave confidence that Iarnród Éireann is adequately controlling risks on the mini-CTC lines. The consultants' report is available on the Department of Transport website.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowe raised the issue of the balance of representation on the Railway Safety Advisory Council. The Bill provides for at least three railway union representatives and at least four representatives of railway companies, one of which must be a heritage railway. This is an important point. Heritage railways are run by volunteers and enthusiasts and thus worker representation is not an issue for heritage railways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney suggested that the remit of the advisory council could be expanded to include other issues not directly related to railway safety. The Minister feels the proposed advisory council is not the appropriate forum for discussion of such issues and that the dilution of its remit would detract from the council's intended function, that is, to be a forum for consideration of issues relevant to railway safety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan expressed concern about how the provisions of this Bill will apply to the Luas system currently under construction. Section 51 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 requires that no part of a railway shall be opened for testing and commissioning or passenger or freight traffic, until it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the railway inspectorate of the Department of Transport that the railway and rolling stock are safe and suitable <Col N="664" />and that the systems and procedures to ensure the safe operation of the railway are appropriate. Prior to this Act, a similar provision had been included in the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act 1996.</P>
    <P>As part of the safety validation process for Luas, the inspectorate agreed with Luas project managers that the safety validation process for this project would be carried out in accordance with the terms of the Railway Safety Bill. This process has been ongoing since the commencement of Luas works.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan asked about the safety case required of a heritage railway. This Bill provides in section 47 that the commission shall have regard to the size and nature of the railway undertaking in considering its safety case. As such, the Minister would expect the safety case for a heritage railway to be less complex than that required of Iarnród Éireann and would strongly urge any heritage railway operator who has not already done so, to discuss their proposed safety case with the railway inspectorate of the Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies commented on the punctuality of train services. The Department is in discussions with each of the CIE companies, including Iarnród Éireann, with a view to introducing service level agreements. These are designed to provide greater transparency and accountability with regard to the level and quality of service provided by each of the companies, and as such incorporate targets for both service quantity and quality. These are expected to be in place for the year 2003. The service level agreements will build on a system of performance indicators already introduced by the Department during the past year.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made suggestions for the restoration of closed railway lines or extension of railway lines to areas not currently served. I note Deputy Harkin's contribution. These and other railway development issues are the subject of a strategic rail review which was recently completed. The main purpose of the review was to establish a strategic policy framework for the future development of the railways in Ireland. The Minister intends to bring the review to Government and to publish its findings. It would be inappropriate to comment on these matters now in advance of the Government having the opportunity to consider the review.</P>
    <P>I again emphasise that the new regulatory framework outlined in this Bill, together with the major investment this Government continues to make in our railways, will lay the bedrock for safe railway travel in the future and will provide assurance to the travelling public that safety will continue to be of paramount importance to this Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harkin referred to the pilot project on the commuter line from Ballymote to Sligo, the Sligo-Limerick line, the Sligo-Dublin line and the west. I assure her that I will bring her views to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" />I thank Members for their constructive contributions to this debate. The Minister looks forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 2003 school building programme, which was published on 22 January 2003, amounted to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver 146 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition approximately 433 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and of course all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
      <P>An innovative feature of this year's programme is the introduction of a devolved building initiative for small rural primary schools. A total of 20 school communities will benefit from this pilot initiative.</P>
      <P>The cost of the 2003 building programme published on my Department's website provides details of the level of commitments to be met in 2003 and the estimated amount available for new projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains committed to continuing the work it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as out<Col N="666" />lined in An Agreed Programme for Government. To meet our objectives I will be looking closely at the potential for using PPP mechanisms and the concept advanced in An Agreed Programme for Government of a multi-annual programme schools modernisation fund to be financed through the National Development Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>To ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey will be placed on a geographic information system, GIS, database. My Department is at present undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of the nationwide survey.</P>
    <P>The proposed standards will be largely based on the planning guidelines for primary and post-primary schools currently used by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG" hpid="Ms Enright Ms Enright">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the programme is an attempt to begin to tackle the school building problem, I do not think that the schools believe it gives the amount of information the Minister claims it does.</P>
      <P>There are a number of primary projects at an advanced stage of architectural planning. A school in Clare is listed at band 1 which is for the most urgent category of school, but it is only at stage 4 or 5 and pre-tender documents have only recently been requested. There are two schools from Cork which are at bands 3 and 4, that is, in less urgent categories. In one of these cases the pre-tender documents have been received and in the other they have been approved. Technically they are much further advanced even though they are less urgent, yet they are all on the same list. What criteria will the Department put in place to deal with this situation? How will the schools be assessed and dealt with? Will the ones at a more advanced stage of planning proceed more quickly than the ones that require to be done more urgently?</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister said in terms of public private partnerships. I raised this issue on the Adjournment on Tuesday in regard to two schools in Portlaoise that were given the impression that they would be dealt with under PPP arrangements but the response did not mention public private partnerships. Will the Minister outline to the House a programme for schools that will be dealt with under public private partnership arrangements because they were specifically excluded from the school building programme list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept the current level of waste that is generated in the system? One primary school in Cavan has spent over &euro;100,000 in getting to its current stage, yet nothing further will happen this year and we do not know what <Col N="667" />the situation will be next year. Much of the work will have to be done again in terms of quantity surveyors reports and so forth. Much more money will have to be clocked up before the project advances further. Has the Minister made progress in terms of using similar plans or using a different planning process so that schools can share, to some degree, existing plans to save money. I welcome the proposal in terms of the multi-annual programme but I wonder what the timescale is for that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the final point in the question about similar plans, they are nearing completion and are being worked on by officials in the Department. In regard to the issue of money being wasted because plans are advanced to a certain level and cannot go further, that is a problem of the system as it existed up to now. This is one of the reasons I initiated the programme to publicise exactly where each project stands and why I am not allowing further projects into the programme until we have cleared out some of the backlog. Following that, we will move in an orderly manner to bring the rest of the schools into the programme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that in the past projects have been brought so far and then left for five, six and seven years because the money was unavailable for them to proceed, yet when the money became available they had to go through the same procedures again. That will not arise in the system that I am putting in place. A school will not be allowed to go from one stage to the next unless the money is available.</P>
      <P>We are in discussion with the Department of Finance in regard to PPPs. The Deputy may be aware that a problem has arisen at European level in regard to PPPs and how they are to be treated for GGB and within the Maastricht guidelines. Solely from the point of view of the money that is made available, public private partnerships would not give us added value, if you like, if the EUROSTAT ruling was not changed. There are other reasons we should pursue a PPP approach but it would not give me an advantage from the point of view of value-added at the moment and that has to be sorted out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10 of November 2000 the first meeting was held between officials of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and representatives of the religious congregations. At that meeting the representatives for the religious congregations indicated their willingness to make a meaningful contribution to the residential institutions redress scheme.</P>
      <P>A series of meetings followed between November 2000 and June 2001. These meetings were attended by representatives of the congregations, officials of the Department of Finance, the Attorney General's office and officials of my Department. In the course of these discussions the religious congregations raised the question of an indemnity as part of an agreement to contribute to the redress scheme. A document drafted by Arthur Cox Solicitors on behalf of CORI was not accepted by the State at that stage.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the discussions at official level terminating in October 2001, the former Minister for Education and Science attended further meetings with the congregations on 7 November 2001 and 7 January 2002. The outcome of these meetings was a substantially better offer than the one made prior to the termination of discussions with officials in 2001. The then Minister brought these proposals to Cabinet.</P>
      <P>On 30 January 2002 the Government agreed in principle to all the key elements of the indemnity agreement. From January to late May 2002 a series of meetings were held at official level with the congregations and their legal advisers to finalise details of the agreement. The Arthur Cox document was used as a starting point but was substantially revised to accommodate the requirements of the State side.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Attorney General was fully involved at all appropriate times during the course of these negotiations and his office prepared comprehensive advice for the Government prior to the decision being taken to sign the agreement. I am satisfied that the indemnity agreement contains all the essential points of a legally binding contract. There is no provision for renegotiation in the indemnity agreement and there are therefore no plans to review it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>I assure the Deputy that all legal considerations which ought to have been considered were considered during the negotiation period and again during the final drafting of the indemnity. Certain background papers relating to the indemnity agreement were provided by my Department under freedom of information requests. Access to certain documentation was refused. This refusal has been appealed and the matter is now being considered within my Department under the internal review provisions of the Freedom of <Col N="669" />Information Act. This review will be concluded shortly.</P>
    <P>I would add however that some of the papers to which access has been refused under the Freedom of Information Act relate to property aspects of the agreement. This matter is still being considered by officials in my Department and is the subject of ongoing negotiations with the legal representatives of CORI. I am aware that the freedom of information legislation provides that access to requested documentation can be refused where the matter is the subject of such ongoing negotiations. However when the negotiations on the property issues have been concluded and the schedules of property have been agreed, they will be made available.</P>

      <P>When will the Minister publish the list of properties that have been transferred or are proposed to be transferred from the religious institutions? Specifically in relation to the indemnity, it was assessed that the costs would be roughly from &euro;250 million to &euro;500 million. Was that assessment based solely on cases that would be settled by the redress board or was an assessment made of cases that might go to court? The indemnity contains an expansion to include any court cases. The document states, &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, such indemnity shall extend to all loss, claims, damages, demands, expenses, costs, including legal costs and charges arising therefrom, of any kind whatsoever awarded to any claimant by any court or otherwise&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in the indemnity. Did the Department make an assessment of the cost of court cases as opposed to cases settled by the redress board? Who decided to include court cases in what would be covered by the indemnity? The information received by way of Freedom of Information Act requests and replies to parliamentary questions merely addresses costs in the redress board. Was specific legal advice given on the likely cost of court cases? If cases subsequently go to court and it finds major culpability on the part of a religious institution rather than the State, will the State still bear all of the costs? Should a court decide that significant costs should fall on the religious institutions, will such a case be re-examined?</P>

      <P>We will publish the list of properties when it is finalised. The religious congregations produced a list of various properties they were willing to transfer but it is part of the agreement that the State has to be satisfied with the properties to be transferred. A very thorough examination is being made of the properties offered. The State has made suggestions of specific properties that might suit for the provision of <Col N="670" />a school, for example. That process continues. If we cannot reach agreement on the properties within the stipulated time, the agreement allows for the State to get cash in lieu of property. The reason the list of properties has not been published&mdash;</P>

      <P>The legal indemnity given to the congregations only covers cases which can be heard before the redress board. Where a victim opts for a court hearing, the case has to be commenced within six years of the date of the indemnity. The figures of &euro;250 million and &euro;500 million were best guesstimates of total costs, whether the court or the redress board route was taken. There is an argument that if the State had decided to contest all of these cases, the cost of the scheme to the State as well as to the religious would be considerably less. However, that would not be in keeping with the apology the Taoiseach made to victims of abuse in May 1999. The apology would have been very hollow if the State had subsequently fought every case in the courts.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if funding was allocated in February 2002 for the refurbishment of the science laboratory and home economics room in Tuam vocational school; and the reason this work has still not been carried out.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding was allocated in February 2002 from the 2002 programme for the refurbishment of the science laboratory and home economics room at Tuam vocational school. The expectation was that the works would have been carried out and the moneys substantially expended in that year. Unfortunately, this did not happen mainly because the tendering report process became more protracted than had been anticipated. In this regard, a series of clarifications had to be obtained from the client, County Galway Vocational Education Committee, in advance of approving the tender report. The issues were finally resolved in mid-November 2002. Clearly, the works could not have been executed at this late stage of the year with the result that the allocated funding could not be drawn down in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" />Framing the 2003 programme took place against a difficult economic backdrop. This project had to compete with a significant number of other similar projects for funding since, inevitably, priorities attaching to projects can vary over time. This highlights the importance for a client of ensuring that when funding is allocated to a project in a particular year, the works are substantially completed in that year with the moneys being drawn down.</P>
    <P>In view of the scale of the 2003 schools building programme as now published and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, it was not possible to include Tuam vocational school in the new starts for 2003. The project will be considered further in the context of the 2004 capital programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the school had a prefab which accommodated a science laboratory but which deteriorated to such an extent that it had to be demolished three years ago? Is he further aware that the students have not had a science laboratory since that time?</P>
      <P>There have been indications of a dispute between the VEC's consultants and the professionals in the Department of Education and Science. I cannot accept that consultants employed by a VEC would not have their documentation right for a project costing &euro;269,000.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that his explanation is a fig leaf to shield from the public the naked truth that the Government does not give two hoots about the students of this school and is reneging on its obligation to treat all the children of the nation equally? Will he further agree that this fig leaf hides the fact that the Government is reneging on a commitment given in 2002?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the situation in this school is reminiscent of trying to teach a child to cycle without a bicycle? One does not need a racing bike, a tricycle will do. The Minister expects the science teacher in this school to teach her subject while not providing her with the tools of her trade &ndash; a basic science laboratory.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister correct this appalling situation by immediately giving approval for the project to proceed to construction stage in order that the school can be provided with basic science and home economics rooms? The money was allocated and all the documentation is now in order. The Minister should let the project proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">

      <P>The project could have proceeded last year if the people concerned had been properly organised. The architectural planning was complete, the project was ready to go to tender in 2002 and, consistent with practice in the Department, there was an examination of the school's long-term viability which was confirmed in September. It was still expected that the project could be on site in November with some of the funding drawn down in 2002. The expected <Col N="672" />timeframe for the work was 16 weeks. When the tender report was submitted to the Department, discrepancies were found between the consultant quantity surveyor's assessment of the cost and the consultant mechanic and electrical engineer's assessment. The Department raised the matter with County Galway VEC on 29 October. It responded on 4 November but failed to address the specific issues. This caused a further delay and by the time everything was clarified on 16 November the money was no longer available. Unfortunately for Tuam vocational school, there were higher priorities in the 2003 building programme. I would like to see the project advanced as quickly as possible but it has to compete with other projects and other schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Cork School of Music, a constituent part of Cork Institute of Technology, is being procured under the public private partnership model. The CSM provides training in a wide range of musical instruments, musical theory and speech and drama. The school caters for first, second, third and fourth level students, whether they are amateur musicians, music teachers or performers.</P>
      <P>The tender for this project was advertised on a European wide basis in June 2000. Following the project launch in July 2000, 12 consortia expressed interest in bidding for the project. Following the presentation of outline proposals the number of bidders was eventually reduced to three. These bidders were issued with an invitation to negotiate in November 2000.</P>
      <P>The consortia bids were submitted in February 2001, were subject to detailed evaluation under design and construction, services, financial and legal, by officials of my Department together with specialist advisers. Following this process Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder in March 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department's officials and advisers entered into a period of intense discussion with Jarvis with a view to reaching financial close on the project. During this period Jarvis, under the terms of the project, sought and received planning permission for the project from Cork City Council. However, An Taisce submitted a planning appeal to An Bord Pleanála against the grant of permission. During the period of the appeal, work on the project was suspended and was only resumed after An Bord Pleanála rejected the appeal and granted planning permission for the development in December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Department of Finance raised a number of additional issues in respect of the pro<Col N="673" />ject that my officials have been examining in conjunction with specialist advisers. In addition the question of the involvement of the European Investment Bank is being addressed. Proposals have been tabled whereby the EIB could provide refinancing for the project two years into the operations phase, thus reducing the overall cost of the project. Discussions with both the Department of Finance and the EIB are currently ongoing. In addition, under EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance over the construction phase. As the Deputy will be aware, the GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the stability and growth pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EURSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue, as will a standing committee being established by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the final approval for the CSM will be a matter for the Government and consideration of it will be based on a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes and taking into account the issues surrounding the general Government balance. My Department will continue to pursue this matter with the Department of Finance and all other concerned parties with a view to having the matter determined by Government in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the Department of Finance raised a number of additional issues. What are those issues and how recently were they raised? Is the Minister aware of the importance of this project to the southern half of the country given that Cork will be European City of Culture in 2005? Is he aware that if the project does not proceed Jarvis is entitled to recoup its costs from the State which, I understand, would be in the region of &euro;12 million? Will the Minister answer the question I asked, when will the project start? Will he explain why there was no problem signing a contract for the Maritime College recently for &euro;51 million, but all of a sudden there is a problem with the Cork School of Music?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the involvement with the European Investment Bank and will the Minister agree it has no problem in financing such a project if necessary? Does he realise that 3,000 students who are trying to learn music are discommoded in all parts of Cork city and that he runs the risk of a teachers' strike if this project does not go ahead? What kind of mess is the Government presiding over? How did we get to this position? Everything was fine until a few months ago and suddenly there are problems. The Minister must give answers. Someone has to be accountable for this awful mess. Will the Minister agree that if <Col N="674" />this project goes belly-up the whole PPP enterprise will be at risk?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues the Department of Finance raised were issues regarding changes in the project and the consequential cost increases that were involved . I am aware of the importance of the project to Cork, particularly in light of the City of Culture award for Cork in 2005. I am aware that Jarvis Projects Limited indicated that if the project does not go ahead it may take legal action. That is within its rights if it wishes to pursue that avenue. I cannot give the Deputy any more information as to when the project will start because I do not know when the current discussions will finish. There is a distinct difference between the Maritime College and this college which relates to the other issue I mentioned in relation to EUROSTAT. The Maritime College involves a substantial transfer of risk to the private sector and that does not affect our GGB whereas there is no substantial transfer of risk involved, according to EUROSTAT rules, with this project. We are contesting the EUROSTAT ruling and we have set up a committee. A committee has also been set up in Europe in relation to it because this has caused difficulties not only for us but for a number of other countries in Europe.</P>
      <P>There is no problem with the European Investment Bank which is also involved with the Maritime college. The necessary legal discussions regarding refinancing part of this are taking place. I realise there are 3,000 students and many lecturers who are in about 17 different locations in Cork. The project is a worthy one but as with every other project it can only proceed if the money is available and if these issues are resolved. Certainly if we can resolve the EUROSTAT issue, that will happen sooner rather than later.</P>

Officials of my Department are conducting the review. However, some issues require the engagement of external expertise.

I am sure he is aware of the huge protest which took place a number of weeks ago organised by the Union of Students in Ireland. There is much concern among students. The main issue, apart from the question of fees, is the uncertainty. If the Minister does not publish his decision, let alone the report, within the next couple of weeks, that uncertainly may continue into October. Will he, therefore, release the findings of the report or, at the very least, his decision on the preferred option within the next couple of weeks in order <Col N="676" />that there will be certainty, that we can tackle him on the adequacy or inadequacy of his proposals and that students will know what they face as they enter first year or subsequent years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Circuit Court decision referred to by the Deputy. The case was subsequently appealed to the High Court which overturned the Circuit Court decision and found in favour of the bus operator. The accident in question occurred on a private service outside the scope of the school transport scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation regarding the fitting and use of seat belts in public vehicles is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Under existing regulations, seat belts are not compulsory on school buses. In operating the school transport scheme Bus Éireann is fully compliant with all relevant regulations as laid <Col N="677" />down by that Department. Contractors' large vehicles, when tested by the Garda authorities to obtain the licence to operate school bus and other public services, are not required to have seat belts installed to get the PSV licence.</P>
    <P>The safety aspects of school transport, including the question of the provision of seat belts, is being examined by the school transport section of my Department with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. In line with the commitment given, The Road to Safety &ndash; The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, a consultation paper that set out a wide range of options for enhancing school bus safety, was published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government last year. Following an extended consultation period, a large number of responses were received. These are being reviewed with a view to identifying a range of specific proposals for implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

      <P>In regard to the Government's road safety strategy, a commitment was given that the review would be completed and decisions made on any changes to the legislation by the time the strategy was completed last December. Given that the joint Oireachtas committee completed a report on school transport and school bus safety three and a half years ago, will the Minister of State implement two of its recommendations which deal specifically with this case? One related to seat belts &ndash; the Circuit Court found the operator to be negligent in the aforementioned case &ndash; while the other proposed bringing private operators under the regulations introduced under the Department of Education and Science's school transport scheme.</P>

In regard to safety, there was extensive consultation in drawing up the report. The recommendations are not yet to hand but when they are, we will see what we will do about their implementation. The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Education and Science played a significant role in the consultation process in which it outlined its views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety on school transport is of paramount importance to the Department and Bus Éireann which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department. Great care is taken by Bus Éireann to ensure loading does not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity of the vehicle. All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. We look forward to identifying the range of specific proposals in the <Col N="678" />report when it is made available and implementing its recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to carrying capacity, does the Minister of State agree that squeezing three 16 or 17 year olds into two seats is overcrowding and needs to be amended? When will the recommendations of the review be completed and published? In the interim, will the Minister of State publish the report completed for the previous Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in regard to the joint Oireachtas committee's report on school transport? The Department undertook a review and its costings. Will they be published in the interim?</P>

      <P>As promised at a previous Question Time, the appeals boards is in operation in regard to the school transport system. Other issues are under review. I am looking at the whole system of school transport in conjunction with departmental officials. When we reach conclusions, we will be happy to make them available to the House.</P>
      <P>Safety is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government. We have taken the opportunity to ensure the Department of Education and Science's views are known in that regard. As I said, we await the publication of the report and implementation of its recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the three to two ratio in regard to seating and seat belts. The loading on all school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the road traffic regulations for the construction, equipment and use of vehicles laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Under the PSV regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils to every two adult seats. Under existing regulations passenger seat belts are not compulsory on buses, including those operated under the school transport scheme. To provide seat belts on buses for all pupils would require the replacement of the 3:2 seating ratio with a 2:2 ratio in the first instance and this would mean considerable technical difficulties and significant costs.</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for the national educational <Col N="679" />psychological service, NEPS, agency recommended an overall target number of 200 psychologists, of whom approximately 180 would be in NEPS and the remainder elsewhere in the educational system. The planning group also recommended that this target should be achieved over a period of five years, beginning during the school year 1999-2000. The Government made a decision in early 1999 that these recommendations should be implemented. The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 43 psychologists already employed in my Department.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of competitions through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are 120 psychologists in NEPS. The Civil Service and Local Government Commissioners have established a panel of psychologists who were successful in the most recent competition. Thirty seven of these psychologists have entered the service since September 2002. My Department has made provision in the Estimates for the employment of the psychologists who remain on the panel. It is hoped these will all be in the post before the end of 2003. If NEPS psychologists leave for any reason, they are automatically replaced from the panel. The planning group for NEPS envisaged that all schools would have access to the NEPS service by the end of the five year development period and my Department intends, subject to availability of resources, to attain this target.</P>
      <P>With regard to measures to ensure full scrutiny of the psychological services, these range from measures generally used in the public service, such as financial audits, business planning and performance management and development to measures that NEPS has itself introduced, such as professional supervision, feedback from clients and instruments for self-evaluation.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest a similar approach will be taken to that for Garda places where the number of people required will be recruited through a five year plan rather than fast-tracking recruitment because it is urgent? Is the Minister aware that many schools, such as St. Mologa's in Balbriggan, would love to meet him to outline their position? Vacancies are not being filled. Is he aware there is a wider problem in that not enough psychologists are being trained in Ireland? If people study abroad, they are more likely to stay there. Is he further aware of the need to offer more attractive packages to ensure there are greater numbers on the panel because if someone on the panel is offered a job, he or she may not take it? There is a need for psychologists in a number of schools in my constituency and if there are vacancies, they should be filled. <Col N="680" />Does he agree there is a reason for them not being filled?</P>

      <P>I do not have much to add to my reply. There is a plan in place. It was agreed by the planning group that 200 psychologists were needed and there were 43 in place when the plan was rolled out. The target is to have the 200 in place by 2005. The panel is there and psychologists are replaced as vacancies arise. However, the Deputy is correct that psychologists cannot be on call at all times. If an individual leaves the service, the panel is immediately invoked and it will be maintained and refreshed. We expect that almost 150 of the 200 psychologists will have been appointed by the end of the year. That is as close as we can get to fast-tracking.</P>

Is it correct that there are cases where in the professional opinion of a psychologist a child is in need of support services and, subsequently, a professional departmental official has decided the opinion is wrong?

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for not repeating himself. The Government has a moral obligation to ensure this project goes ahead with full funding from the Exchequer, if necessary. With regard to the difficulties that have arisen, there are historical factors involving the company concerned whereby contracts were exchanged and there was confusion between the State and the company regarding whether it would be paid in sterling or euro. The company has been strongly criticised by a British Government audit commission in regard to a private finance initiative in the provision of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the public private partnership approach to developing this type of infrastructure is falling around his ears, that it was a wheeze invented by the Government to pretend <Col N="683" />it was not borrowing, and that EUROSTAT has seen through it. The Government should present these projects more honestly and pay for them from the public Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government pays, whether through public private partnership or the Exchequer. In other words, taxpayers pay. The Government has an obligation to ensure they get full value for their money. In regard to the suggestion that public private partnership is a wheeze invented by the Government, this is probably one of the last governments in Europe to enter into public private partnerships. There are PFIs and various other manifestations in other countries.</P>

I will not, nor can I, take &euro;60 million out of my first and second level budget to provide for the Cork School of Music, which is what I would have to do unless we sort out the EUROSTAT problem.

      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Maritime College, the Minister explained that the risks to the private sector were greater, and that in terms of the Cork college, the transfer of risk was different. Will he explain the difference and elaborate on how he sees other building projects for schools being affected? Is all the risk to be carried by the public sector? Is that the reason they are caught under the EUROSTAT ruling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that in respect of the Maritime College, there is a real transfer of risk to the private sector in that the private sector must depend for pay-back partly from the Exchequer and partly from fees and so on because, as well as catering for our own students and the Navy, it is a commercially run college which will also be used by foreign countries. There is, therefore, a transfer of risk. In respect of schools projects, there is no transfer of risk. I stress this is the EUROSTAT ruling, with which I do not agree. Because of IT, expenditure on schools projects is treated as borrowing for the purposes of the Maastricht treaty criteria. I do not agree with this. Neither does the Department of Finance. However, until the ruling is changed, we must operate within those rules. If they are not changed, the effect from the point view of <Col N="684" />schools will be that while we could go ahead with PPP projects, the money would have to come from my Exchequer provision as a lump sum. To take an example, if I wanted to build five or six schools at a cost of &euro;60 million over the period of the PPP, I would have to provide that &euro;60 million from my Exchequer Estimate. That is the difficulty.</P>

      <P>The European City of Culture 2005 is as important to Cork as next year's Presidency of the European Union is to the Government. If the Government can find &euro;50 million or so for a jet next year, can it not find money in some budget for Cork? I cannot understand the reason that funding cannot be found. Surely, within the entire Government process of using capital, the money could be found. It is crucial to Cork in terms of the European City of Culture 2005.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth and stability pact and the EUROSTAT rules have been in place for quite some time. Did the Government sleepwalk into the situation in which it now finds itself? Is it not true that the bidding committee set up comprises officials from the Department of Education and Science, that officials from the Department of Finance were involved from the outset, as were A &amp; L Goodbody, Solicitors and Farrell Grant Sparks, and that special acquisition advisers were involved in the bidding committee for a number of years? Why is it that it is only now that this is arising? Why was this not spotted months or even years ago when this first started?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it also true that under a PPP, the first payment is made only when the handing-over takes place? In this case that will be some time in 2005. Has the operator, Jarvis, requested a meeting with the Minister, and has the Minister any intention of meeting the operator to explain this situation? Is there now a risk that the site could be taken over as a derelict site by Cork City Council and be lost? Does the Minister not realise how important this is to the students and the whole culture of the southern part of Ireland when as a result of the European City of Culture 2005, the focus of Europe will be on Cork? This was to have been the gem in the crown, and it will not <Col N="685" />go ahead. Why has the Minister sleepwalked into this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall saying this project would not go ahead. I would not like the Deputy to go away with that notion. It is a question of how we can proceed with it and when. In relation to the Deputy's question as to whether we sleepwalked into this, PPPs have been place throughout Europe in various guises for many years. They have operated, for example, in relation to Portugal's roads programme. There were PFIs in the United Kingdom and so on. No problems were raised by EUROSTAT until very recently. If it had not raised this issue as a result of a query from the CSO, this project would have gone ahead on the same basis as every other PPP in other countries in Europe. Once the question was raised, EUROSTAT made a ruling. We must either comply with or try to change it. We are trying to change it. I do not agree with it as I believe it is incorrect. However, we must operate within the rules unless they are changed. That is what we intend to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in his endeavours to get this project off the ground as soon as possible. There is a deadline in relation to the European City of Culture 2005. On a number of occasions the Minister mentioned the transfer of risk. To what type of risk was EUROSTAT referring? Will the Minister explain to the House exactly what these risks are?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that EUROSTAT is stating there is no transfer of risk to the private sector because it is providing the project and guaranteed payment from the State. That, as far as EUROSTAT is concerned &ndash; I emphasise that is its view, not ours &ndash; is the equivalent of Government borrowing and must form part of the GGB. We disagree. A risk would be involved if money was being recouped under a PPP project, such as the Cork School of Music, by charging higher fees to the students of the college. I presume that those involved would argue that the matter could be dealt with off the balance sheet. That is my best attempt at deciphering what they are saying.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of student support provisions is being conducted in my Department, aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised in accordance with the requirement, under the terms of reference, &ldquo;to review the present system of tuition fees and student supports, having regard to international experience, in order to provide options for the Minister's consideration with a view to ensuring greater equity in access to and participation in higher education.&rdquo;  Departmental officials are conducting the review, although some issues require the engagement of external expertise. In this regard, the Economic and Social Research Institute has undertaken work to enable my Department to estimate the cost of various options. The work of the review group will be informed by relevant recently published reports and it is anticipated that the review will be sub<Col N="687" />mitted for my attention soon. I will make a decision on publication of the review when I have had an opportunity to consider its contents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts that there are concerns about the review for people who are planning to go to third level college. I accept that there are many ways of looking at the key issues and I agree that the education system needs a thorough overhaul. Families cannot plan ahead if they do not know whether the Minister plans to reintroduce fees. Does he intend to continue to reintroduce fees by the back door by increasing registration costs? Such a reintroduction would cause particular difficulties for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Minister vowed last summer that means tested student supports would help reimburse those who cannot afford to pay fees. People are still waiting to receive money, however, as a result of the delay in his Department in sending out forms to local authorities. Many organisations, such as the USI, believe that the Minister will not do away with fees. People need answers as they cannot plan without them.</P>

      <P>I look forward to the support of Sinn Féin if the review suggests that the Government should reintroduce fees for the wealthy. At the launch of my Department's Estimates, I said that I did not plan to allow an increase in registration fees or to make any changes to the higher education grants scheme until the review has been finished. People who are in the system and those about to move into it can rest assured that there will not be any major changes in relation to registration fees and the higher education grants before completion of the review. I said earlier to Deputy Gogarty that I will make an early decision and an early announcement about the academic year 2003-04 if the report is delayed or is more extensive than first thought. I accept the latter part of Deputy Crowe's point about students from disadvantaged backgrounds, but I am sure he will appreciate that such people qualify for grants and do not pay registration fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the House a little more information about the review's terms of reference? I am not asking for a huge amount of detail. The Minister's comments in response to Deputy Crowe's question about supporting the reintroduction of fees if it is recommended by the review indicated that he favours such a move in such circumstances. Does the Minister feel that his comments will have influence on the outcome of the review? I am concerned that he appears to be stating his own opinion before the review has been finished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally try to answer the questions I am asked, regardless of whether I am inside or outside the House. Coming from the background from which I come, I strongly believe that the limited amount of money I have for student supports &ndash;&euro;383 million &ndash; should go to those who need it most. The concept of universality is a wonderful one in relation to certain benefits and we should aspire to it as long as we can afford it and everybody is treated equally.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what I have seen that people from disadvantaged backgrounds, for example from parts of Dublin and Limerick and certain rural areas, do not receive a fair chance to access third level education. This opinion was echoed strongly in the report of the action group on access to third level education, which stated that it is neither equitable nor efficient for students from more advantaged social backgrounds to receive financial aid from the State to attend higher education, especially given that so many others are excluded. I have strong personal views on this matter, but the Government as a whole will make the decision on it.</P>
      <P>Of the &euro;383 million that is being spent on student supports, &euro;120 million is being spent on third level maintenance grant schemes, &euro;239 million on direct tuition fee support for all undergraduates and &euro;24 million is targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The latter sum has increased substantially in recent years. I do not deny that I have strong feelings about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister publish the review group's report before the Government makes a decision on it, to allow for discussion and consultation? Deputy Crowe mentioned that colleges are looking for an increase in registration fees for next year. In response to a question I asked him about the matter in November, the Minister said that the increase of 69% brought the registration fee more into line with the cost of providing the services that colleges have to provide. Is the Minister satisfied that the 69% increase was sufficient to allow colleges to meet the cost of examinations, registration and student services? Is he satisfied that the colleges are using the extra funds to pay for the services I have mentioned? If he is satisfied that the 69% increase was sufficient, surely the colleges do not need another increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The 69% increase was based on the 1999 needs of colleges in relation to the services mentioned by the Deputy, updated for inflation. The registration fee now covers everything that the colleges said it would cover and I do not expect it to increase by a huge amount. I would not like them to decide to increase the fee just to get extra income. It has to be related to the services it is supposed to provide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the presentations to the Joint Committee on Education and Science which indicated that the link between a possible reintroduction of third level fees and an increase in access among those from more disadvantaged backgrounds was, at best, tenuous? If that is so, will he leave this out of the equation in considering whether, with regard to the funding of an equitable education service, it is more efficient to introduce a wealth tax on income earners or fees for wealthier individuals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pre-empt the review or its findings. The introduction of free fees halted a slight decline in the numbers of lower to middle class students &ndash; I hate the terms &ndash; that had begun around 1993 or 1994. I refer to the children of teachers, gardaí, nurses and civil servants, among others. There was a decline from the mid-1990s in the number of children from that social class entering higher education. It appears, anecdotally rather than scientifically, that one child from such families was entering education while other children from the family were not. Free fees halted this and ensured the restoration of normal levels. However, this could have been achieved by an improvement in the grants system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In January this year, for the first time ever, I published the 2003 school building programme, full details of which are available on my Department's website. The programme is intended to consolidate the substantial progress the Government has made over the last five years in improving the physical infrastructure in schools. A total of &euro;342.9 million is available for spending on schools in the current year and over 550 primary and post-primary schools will benefit from the programme.</P>
      <P>Meánscoil an Leith Triúigh is a co-educational all-Irish school with a current enrolment of 79 pupils. It is currently owned by an individual who is the sole trustee. It consists mainly of temporary prefabricated accommodation in poor condition.</P>
      <P>My Department received an application from the parent-teacher committee, the Bishop, as patron, and Castlegregory Community Council to replace the existing accommodation with a permanent new school. The owner was not party to the application. Following examination of the application, my Department's planning unit recommended the building of a new school to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 125 to 150 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" />The proposed building project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning. It is proposed to provide a new purpose built school on a new site in Castlegregory, County Kerry. However, matters pertaining to the purchase of the site have yet to be finalised prior to the project proceeding to tender. An application to provide temporary accommodation on the proposed new site has recently been received from the board of management of the proposed new school. This matter is being examined in my Department's building unit. It will be necessary to ensure the provision of any proposed temporary accommodation on the proposed new site will not hamper the provision of the new school in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the conditions in this school are among the worst in the country. Prefabs are rat infested and have asbestos tiling on the roofs; the fuse box recently blew up; the heating system is continuously out of order; the toilets are unusable and pupils are refusing to use them, which has led to a number of kidney infections. Will the Minister make a commitment that the school will be part of his programme next year and that he is prepared to go to tender towards the end of this year in order that work can start immediately next year? The school also featured in a recent article in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> If the Minister saw the photo of the school, he could only agree with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the condition of the school and accept it is far from ideal. I do not accept that any school should be infested with rats or mice, something that should be easily resolved. The school board of management should make sure it is. The other difficulties at the school are very real, which is the reason it is part of the building programme. The finalisation of the site should be a first priority and, when that is done, the school will take its place in the schools building programme.</P>
      <P>As I have told Deputies from all sides of the House, high profile media campaigns will not ensure any school jumps the queue. I will consider schools with respect to the Department's criteria in this regard. The school in question is in a serious condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the matter of the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take urgent action to halt the <Col N="692" />escalation in the cost of insurance which is having a very damaging effect on economic and social life, and the need for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. My reason for raising this issue on the Adjournment and my message to the Minister are stark &ndash; the great insurance rip-off continues and it demands radical action. Jobs are being lost, companies are closing down, and business and commerce are being damaged by the scandalous and still spiralling cost of insurance cover.</P>
      <P>It is mostly small firms which are being crippled and there are many examples. I know of a company in County Meath which had to shut down with the loss of 12 jobs because there was a 200% increase in its insurance premium. A firm in Monaghan saw its premium jump from &euro;100,000 in 1999 to &euro;260,000 this year. A small engineering firm which started up in 2000 saw its insurance bill leap from &euro;2,000 in that year to an unbelievable &euro;27,500 in 2002. Despite this company's claim free status, it is unable to get a quote.</P>
      <P>These are but a few random samples from studies conducted within the industrial sector. They are indicative of the massive rip-off being perpetrated. A survey by Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, carried out last winter, has shown the average increase for insurance cover experienced by its members was 71% in 2002. One in five companies reported job losses in 2002 as a direct result of intolerable insurance cost rises. When this is seen in the context of the current general economic downturn in which job losses are mounting, the devastating effect is obvious. The Government may not be able to effect change in the global marketplace but it can do something about the fleecing of people in this State by rapacious insurance companies.</P>
      <P>This was one of the main issues raised by the electorate, especially as it affects drivers, with all parties during the last general election. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board reported and last October the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced a programme of measures, including the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on an interim non-statutory basis. I welcome the priority given to this issue by the Minister, but regrettably the measures are too limited. They treat the insurance companies and especially the legal profession with kid gloves. The Minister of State must be aware of this and I have no doubt he agrees that the rip-off must be addressed head on. Roundabout approaches and half measures are not enough. There must be direct Government control of insurance prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the civil servants will respond by saying that European Union regulations prevent such State intervention in the insurance market. I do not have the legal expertise to refute that contention, but if it is the case and if there <Col N="693" />are EU imposed obstacles to the necessary measures, the Minister is duty bound to campaign, lobby and negotiate within the EU to remove them.</P>
    <P>Another, little mentioned, aspect of the insurance rip-off is its damaging effect on social life. Sports clubs, voluntary bodies of all kinds, community groups and many others often find it impossible to organise fundraising and other events which were once their bread and butter. This is because they cannot afford the exorbitant cost of public liability insurance cover. It is stifling community life.</P>
    <P>The measures already announced by the Government do not go far enough. I hope the Minister of State will acknowledge this and indicate the additional measures the Minister and the Department are prepared to take. More radical and comprehensive action is needed. I eagerly await the Minister of State's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I make this response on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I appreciate the constructive manner in which Deputy Ó Caoláin raised this issue on the Adjournment. We are all familiar with the condition he outlined. I share his concerns and am aware of the difficulties that have been created for individuals, businesses and the voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister also is very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and of the difficulties this is creating for individuals and businesses and the effects it is having on the economic and social life of the country. These costs have major implications for companies, community and sports bodies, local authorities, motorists, households and many other sectors of society. Many reasons, both domestic and international, have been put forward by the insurance industry for the increases in insurance premiums. These include the number of accidents, the cost of settling claims, the requirement to strengthen insurance reserves, lower investment returns and the impact of the 11 September attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>Extensive studies have been carried out over a number of years on the cost of insurance here, notably the recent report by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board which was published in April of last year &ndash; it was referred to by the Deputy. There is general acceptance of the analysis, conclusions and recommendations contained in the report. Following publication of the report, a high level implementation group was set up and mandated to draw up an action plan for the implementation of its 67 recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 October last, the Minister announced a programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given <Col N="694" />in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by the Minister, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the MIAB report; publication of the action plan to give effect to these recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put it on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</P>
    <P>The Minister regards insurance reform as her number one political priority and she is ensuring that progress is made on the various elements of the reform programme. The ministerial committee overseeing implementation of the MIAB report recommendations, which the Minister chairs and which includes the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Transport, has had two meetings and has discussed the progress being made. The action plan itself, drawn up by the high level implementation group, was published last October and sets out the timeframe for implementation of each recommendation and by whom. A number of the recommendations have been implemented, some by the insurance industry and some by the relevant Departments, as appropriate. Progress on the implementation of the other recommendations is continuing. The Minister is willing to be benchmarked on this issue.</P>
    <P>The report of the implementation group on the establishment of the PIAB was also published last October. I reassure the Deputy that Ministers act in the public interest regardless of their previous occupation. Following that, the Minister appointed the chairperson and ordinary members of the interim PIAB in November. The interim board includes representatives of the relevant stakeholders, that is, the ICTU, IBEC, the Irish Insurance Federation and a number of nominees with relevant expertise.</P>
    <P>The chairperson has engaged in an intensive round of bilateral contacts with members of the interim board. These bilateral meetings have covered matters relating to the future work of the board and fundamentals of particular concern to the relevant stakeholders. Discussions have also commenced among members of the interim board on the future ongoing monitoring of delivery costs of compensation in the PIAB system.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of the interim board, a number of items were discussed and agreement on how they will be progressed was reached. Outline procedures for the PIAB have been agreed and work on production of a book of quantum has commenced. Agreement on initial drafting of legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing <Col N="695" />was also reached. The work being done by the interim board is very necessary and needs to be done in a thorough manner so that the PIAB can proceed with its work immediately it is established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>In parallel with and complementary to the reform programme, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a study of competition in the insurance marketplace, with particular reference to motor insurance, employers' liability and public liability insurance. A public consultation process has taken place prior to finalisation of the terms of reference for the study. The scope and terms of reference are to identify anti-competitive practices or other constraints on competition in the non-life insurance market in Ireland, with particular reference to motor insurance, employers' liability and public liability insurance; to highlight anti-competitive practices or other constraints that are particular to the Irish market; to make recommendations to ensure that competition works well for consumers in the Irish market; and, in the case of problems identified at EU level, to make recommendations for change at that level.</P>
    <P>The reference to the Competition Authority is in addition to the acceptance of the recommendations in the earlier report. Considerable preparatory work on the study has been done. Tender documents in relation to necessary consultancy reports on the insurance industry, the insurance market and statistical and econometric analysis have been issued as part of this work. The bulk of this work will be completed this year and a report will be produced in the early part of 2004. It should provide accurate information in respect of the insurance market.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes that the reforms being introduced will bring new players into the market, thereby introducing more competition. There is a clear case of market failure here and market forces must be allowed to prevail in the insurance sector. While EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance, the Minister has made it clear that she expects a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the insurance industry, in the form of reduced premiums, in response to the reform programme.</P>

Tá foireann an-mhaith san ospidéal céanna, idir an lucht bainistíochta, na banaltraí agus na dochtúirí. Tá na daoine sin ar fad thar barr. Le cúpla bliain anuas bhí orm mo pháistí féin a thabhairt go dtí <Col N="696" />an t-ospidéal níos mó ná uair amháin, ar fáth amháin nó ar fáth eile.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, is totally outdated. Through their heroic efforts the staff have managed to keep the hospital going. They have endured conditions that hospital staff in other countries would not endure. This is because they have the interests of the children at heart.</P>
      <P>The hospital was built in 1958. In recent years there were some additions and good improvements by various Governments. However, the site no longer serves its purpose, which is to provide care for children. I am not just raising this issue because the hospital is in my constituency but because it is a national hospital dealing with many children from every county. It is the cancer centre for children from the 32 counties of Ireland. It needs to set a standard on a worldwide basis, especially considering that we have a young population.</P>
      <P>Since the hospital was built there has been huge growth in the number of operations, yet it has not expanded to cope with this. There was a 539% increase in admission numbers between 1958 and 2002. A similar percentage applies to operations and causalities. An increase of 790% pertains to outpatients.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has had children in the hospital will know that there are virtually no facilities for parents who have to stay over. They have to sleep on a mattress next to the bed or in a chair, if they are lucky. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The report lists exactly where standards are falling in the hospital. I could open any page to indicate how substandard it is in comparison with hospitals in other countries. There is a lack of basic facilities. There are no play areas or baby changing rooms in the accident and emergency unit. Another list applies to Holy Angel's Day Centre. The hospital has fallen below international standards in every respect, which is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Dr. Pollock, who produced the report, said the hospital was totally unsuitable for the provision of medical care for children. The Minister, in response to the report, said major redevelopment was planned but that is news to the parents who bring children to the hospital, the staff and managers. What is planned is the building of two small, additional units.</P>
      <P>The Government has authorised an MRI scanner for the hospital but forgot to authorise the building of a room in which to place it. Until that is done, those requiring a scan will have to be brought by taxi or ambulance to other hospitals in Dublin. They will have to be accompanied by a nurse and, frequently, an anaesthetist. Having no anaesthetist in the hospital leads to emergencies like those that happened in hospitals outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take heed of this report and make sure the planned demolition and <Col N="697" />rebuilding of a new hospital on the Crumlin site happens in months rather than years in order that we will have the best facilities in the world for sick children.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region and those outside the region referred for specialist treatment. On foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin Hospital, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, recently approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. It includes representatives from the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Many of the hospital buildings are approximately 50 years old and have not been upgraded in any significant way. Consequently, they generally do not meet contemporary standards for paediatric hospital facilities.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of a development control plan which will set the context for future capital developments on the site. Work on the preparation of the development brief has commenced and is expected to be completed by the end of 2003. It is intended that a phased approach to new development and the upgrading of facilities will be taken. The plans will allow for the prioritisation of developments according to the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA. The phased approach will ensure services continue to be provided during the redevelopment.</P>
      <P>A number of additional major developments, funded by the Exchequer, are being put in place at the hospital. These include a &euro;30 million investment in the new operating department, which will provide two additional theatres, increasing the capacity of the hospital to five major theatres and two minor theatres. Developments will include new recovery beds, a day surgery unit and a modern central sterile supplies department. This is expected to increase the capacity of the hospital to meet the additional surgery demands at both inpatient and outpatient level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the volume and complexity of cases being dealt with at the hospital, the Minister approved the provision of an MRI facility which will significantly enhance the level of diagnostic services. The project team is engaged in the pro<Col N="698" />cess of identifying the most appropriate location for this service in the context of the overall development plan.</P>
    <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, was established in 1956. It is the largest paediatric hospital in Ireland and the main specialist referral centre for the whole country. These specialist areas include cardiology, oncology, neonatal surgery, urology, neurology and all of the sub-specialties.</P>
    <P>The ERHA has allocated substantial additional revenue funding to the hospital in recent years to develop its cardiology services. Funding has been provided for the appointment of two additional consultant cardiologists and support staff which will allow the hospital to develop cardiology services. Funding has also been provided for the development of paediatric oncology and haematology services.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently met the new Crumlin Hospital group which is composed of parents of children who regularly attend the hospital for treatment. This group commissioned the Pollock report into facilities at the hospitall. The deficiencies highlighted in the report are known and accepted and the Minister is committed to the redevelopment programme. The hospital group was appreciative of his assurance in this regard, particularly that the redevelopment of the hospital is being carefully planned on a phased basis. The Minister, in turn, was pleased to note the group's praise for the quality of care provided at the hospital which it described as excellent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 September 2002 there were about 54,000 on the waiting list for driving tests. The latest figures, which I have on foot of a parliamentary question, suggest that there are now over 108,000 waiting. Therefore, the number has doubled.</P>
      <P>In Dundalk there are 2,700 waiting for a driving test, which will make it impossible for the Department to process all the applications in reasonable time. I may be anticipating what the Minister will say by saying that if one lives in Drogheda or south Louth, one can opt to do the test in Navan. However, the number of applicants has also doubled in Navan where there are in excess of 3,800 waiting. The second closest driving test centre is in Finglas where the number of applicants has increased from 5,000 to 8,000. Therefore, it is not possible, locally, regionally or nationally, to deal with the massive backlog of applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must open new driving test centres. Tipperary has four test centres, in Thurles, Tipperary town, Clonmel and Nenagh, while there are three in Donegal, in Buncrana, Donegal town and Letterkenny. Counties Galway and Clare have four and three centres, respect<Col N="699" />ively, in Galway city, Loughrea, Tuam, Clifden, Ennis, Kilrush and Shannon. County Waterford has two, in Waterford city and Dungarvan as does County Wexford, in Gorey and Wexford town. Establishing a second centre in County Louth would not set a precedent.</P>
    <P>The population of Drogheda has increased by 16% since the last census, making it the largest town in Louth. It is bigger than most other Irish towns and its inhabitants demand this facility. They need it and there is an unanswerable case for providing it for them. The Government has neglected the town which does not have a swimming pool and is omitted from the national spatial strategy. It is my job to ensure that pressure is put on the Government to deliver for south Louth. The Minister must not allow this state of affairs to continue, but rather must address the matter with the Minister for Finance to procure extra funds to process applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to reply on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>The substantial waiting list for driving tests is a result of the decision of the Government to insist on a rigorous enforcement of road traffic legislation. I do not accept that the number of persons waiting for tests is a reliable basis for future planning in this area. The Government has embarked on a determined effort to ensure that all persons driving vehicles are licensed, which has dramatically increased the numbers seeking to take the test.</P>
      <P>There are 51 driving test centres located in towns with, and adjacent to, large centres of population. I accept the Deputy's point that Drogheda is a substantial town, but many of the counties he mentioned, including Tipperary, Galway, Donegal and Clare, are geographically extensive in contrast to Louth. I share a great affection with the Deputy for the county , but I acknowledge that it is very small. The current network of centres is considered to provide good coverage across the country and represents a fine balance between convenience and the need for economy in delivering the driver testing service. The essential criteria for a test centre include adequate demand, distance from nearest centre, adequate parking and access, proximity to suitable test routes and suitable office accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Establishing a new test centre in a particular location requires considerable resources. It is necessary to ensure that the correct location is chosen, a suitable road network is in place and all planning requirements are met. The Department of Transport has prioritised the upgrading of test centres at some locations. In conjunction with the <Col N="700" />Office of Public Works, the Department is carrying out an extensive programme of improving test centres in a number of towns with below-standard facilities. On foot of enhancements to the driving test, additional facilities will be required at a number of test centres. The test centres in Navan and Dundalk adequately cater for the demand for driving tests in the Drogheda area. Prior to the recent unprecedented level of applications, the average waiting time had fallen to ten weeks and the test centre in Dundalk is being upgraded to provide additional capacity. In some cases test centres in north Dublin may also be convenient to candidates from the Drogheda area. The Minister for Transport has no proposals at present to establish a test centre in Drogheda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is in the House, given that Ronanstown was once in his constituency. Perhaps he will be able to influence his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Ronanstown Garda station covers a number of rapidly growing areas, including Ronanstown, north Clondalkin, Neilstown, Rowlagh and south Lucan, which have seen huge development but very little in the way of facilities and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>There is a deficit in terms of places for young people to hang out, which has led to an increase in anti-social behaviour. I have heard accounts of victimisation from single working mothers who are struggling to make ends meet for their families on the Foxdene estate. A number of years ago, a person told me that soiled nappies were put through her door on a regular basis and, recently, another individual had her house broken into while she was there and was told by a number of 14 year olds that they would be back the next night to take her motor bike. These people are known and the county council is doing its best to evict certain individuals through its anti-social officers, but in many cases the problem is that parents have no control over 14 year old children. The system does not have the means to stop these young tearaways from becoming involved in anti-social and criminal behaviour. Facilities are needed to distract people from a life of crime, but that is a debate for another night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight my focus is on Foxdene and Ronanstown Garda station, which has come under attack on a number of occasions recently from stone throwing mobs. A car was overturned outside its main entrance. There are four regular units in Ronanstown operating on the three shift system with one unit being rotated for holidays. There is an average of six persons working each shift, but that does not account for permanent sick leave and it does not include a probationary officer, <Col N="701" />who might be in Templemore. There are supposed to be two people in the station at all times, which leaves, at best, four gardaí available. Is the Minister of State aware that Ronanstown's public order vehicle is out of service, not because it is broken, but because of lack of personnel. Ronanstown has two regular cars and one public order vehicle. Before the election, the Government trumpeted Operation Encounter as a mechanism for getting tough on crime and boasted of how it would provide 2,000 extra gardaí. I am sceptical about that provision, but if we accept the Minister's word it is to be hoped that the personnel will be made available sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Ronanstown must be targeted immediately because it cannot operate its public order vehicle. The suspension of overtime means that additional Garda staff are not available to man it in an area of high anti-social activity and where there is intimidation by persons under the age of 18. I am sure the Minister of State's script will include a great deal of back-slapping in relation to the amount of money invested over the past few years, but I want to hear specific detail of whether Operation Encounter still exists. Will the Minister of State make a commitment on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that Ronanstown will be given a sufficient overtime allocation to enable it to operate its previously successful public order vehicle? Will additional resources and motivation be supplied to ensure that areas like Foxdene are the subject of a targeted response from the Garda? Action taken over two or three weeks could root out many of the offenders. I ask the Minister to provide more resources for Ronanstown and, in particular, to allow the public order vehicle to be properly maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I welcome this opportunity to set out for the benefit of the House the current position. The Deputy will appreciate that the matter he raised on the Adjournment was the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to increase the resources at Ronanstown Garda station in light of the ongoing public order and crime problems, most recently in the Foxdene estate. The Deputy will appreciate that there was no reference to a public order vehicle in the notice of the Adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indeed a valuable resource but it was not referred to by the Deputy in the notice of the Adjournment, although as the Deputy outlined to the House, I am familiar with the area in question. For the record, the Foxdene estate is in very close proximity to the relevant Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" />The House will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the overall provision of resources to the Garda Síochána while the commissioner is vested, under section 8 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act 1925 with the general direction and control of the force, and the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter in the first instance for the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister will continue to ensure that the Garda Síochána has adequate resources to tackle crime. The Government has substantially increased the number of gardaí in recent years from 10,800 in 1997 to a current strength of approximately 11,900 members, and this is set to increase in the near future to 12,200 which is a historic high. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is committed to supporting the Garda Síochána in every way he can in tackling crime, not only through increasing Garda numbers, but through facilitating and promoting change and reform, both within the force and in the criminal justice system in general, aimed at meeting the challenges of present day crime. The Minister is, for example, finalising proposals for legislative change to significantly improve Garda powers of criminal investigation and currently has a Bill before this House to improve the law on public order.</P>
    <P>A major review of Garda organisational structures under the strategic management initiative programme of modernisation is currently under way which centres on the efficiency and effectiveness of the way the force is organised and structured. The outcome of that review will be submitted for consideration by Government when completed.</P>
    <P>A study for further civilianisation in the Garda Síochána was also completed as part of the bottom-up review of the organisation as recommended in the Garda steering group report of 1997. The objective of the study was to carry out a detailed analysis of existing posts held by gardaí to assess the potential for further civilianisation; to examine the options for career structure and related matters and to establish the implications for control of civilian staff by the Garda Commissioner. The study recommended a programme of civilianisation of 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing. These posts are located in Garda headquarters, in the Garda college and in districts and divisions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A working group, comprising representatives of the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is overseeing implementation of the report. It is envisaged that the posts will be civilianised on a phased basis over a number of years. The impact of this development will result in a higher visibility pres<Col N="703" />ence of gardaí on the streets thus enhancing public safety and reducing public fear of crime and street violence. The releasing of gardaí will also result in putting expensive training and experience to better use and, among other things, allow for more resources for interventions with juveniles, youth clubs and special projects.</P>
    <P>With regard to policing of the Foxdene estate referred to by the Deputy, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength all ranks of Ronanstown Garda station as at 27 February 2003, is 71. This compares with a figure of 58 on 31 January 1997 and represents an increase of 13 or 22%, in the personnel allocated to Ronanstown since that date.</P>
    <P>The Foxdene estate is regularly patrolled by gardaí from the divisional crime task force and the divisional traffic unit. Gardaí regularly meet local residents and members of South Dublin County Council to identify and deal with anti-social behaviour. Offenders have been identified, resulting in cautions being administered under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997, <Col N="704" />relocation of a family and the placing of a youth on a rehabilitation course.</P>
    <P>As a result of ongoing patrols in the area, arrests have been made for the unauthorised taking of vehicles. Within the past three weeks four stolen cars were recovered by gardaí from Ronanstown in the area.</P>
    <P>Since 1991 the Garda Síochána has operated special projects which aim at identifying young people at risk of involving themselves in criminal or anti-social behaviour in a defined geographical area. Special projects, which are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, provide a series of intervention and prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>The situation will be kept under review by the Garda authorities and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Ronanstown will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 March 2003.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families in primary schools. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances such as substance abuse which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>
      <P>At primary level, in 2003, a total of &euro;3,851,000 has been provided towards the cost of school books for pupils from low-income families. This compares to expenditure of &euro;3,816,000 in 2002 when it is estimated that approximately 144,000 needy pupils in 2,900 primary schools received assistance under this scheme.</P>
      <P>Additional assistance is also available to parents by way of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. A variety of locally based groups financed by Government Departments assist families and children from disadvantaged backgrounds with a diverse range of supports such as breakfast clubs, homework and other after school clubs, pre-reading, reading and family literacy programmes and toy libraries. In addition, the home-school community co-ordinators would be supporting the development of parents as prime educators to act as a resource not only for their own children but other children and families.</P>

      <P>Plans for a 1,607 square metres, multi-purpose sports hall attached to Collinstown Park community college are at an advanced stage of architectural planning. In addition to containing a PE hall of 634 square metres, the hall will also contain a crèche, a meeting room, a fitness studio, a multi-purpose area and a range of ancillary accommodation. When constructed, it is planned that the hall will serve not just the school community but also the wider community. In January of this year, for the first time ever, I published the 2003 school building programme, full details of which are available on my Department's website. The programme is intended to consolidate the substantial progress that the Government has made over the last five years in improving the physical infrastructure in schools. A total of &euro;342.9 million is available for spending on schools in the current year and over 550 primary and post primary schools right across the country will benefit from the programme. The Collinstown Park community college project appears on section 6 of the programme. The timing of when these projects can progress to tender and construction is dependent on the funding allocation in 2004 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Government policy, a contribution towards construction costs will be forthcoming from South Dublin County Council through the Department of the Environment. I also expect that funding will be made available from the Department of Rural, Community and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>

The annual cost is in the region of &euro;18 million. The purpose of the grant is to enable school authorities to undertake regular minor capital improvement works at local level. My Department intends to conduct an expenditure review of the scheme this year involving inspections at up to 300 primary schools. The scheme will be adjusted as appropriate having regard to the outcome of this review.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements in the levels of other direct funding to schools have been made in recent years. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;111.58 per pupil in 2003. This represented an increase of 95% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level over the period.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, schools have also benefited from increases in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased from &euro;224.74 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;256.49 in September 2001, and was further increased by &euro;10 from September 2002 to &euro;266.49. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra &euro;20,875 per annum, and a total capitation grant of &euro;133,245 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita </i>grant of &euro;38.09 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to &euro;152,290.</P>
      <P>This Government is intent on implementing further significant increases in line with the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government. The Deputy will appreciate that this commitment relates to the term of office of the Government and its implementation will be considered in the context of the Estimates process over that period.</P>

      <P>Circular 43/00 issued by my Department in November 2000 sets out the agreed selection procedures, including the composition of the selection board, for the appointment and promotion of teachers in vocational schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of appointment as permanent or temporary wholetime teacher, as special duties teacher, assistant principal, deputy principal and, in schools of under 500 full-time day pupils, as principal, the composition of the selection board shall be one VEC representative &ndash; to be a member of the committee, one education expert and one personnel expert. All members of the selection board must be present.</P>
      <P>In the case of the appointment as principal in schools with a full-time day enrolment of 500 pupils or more, the selection board shall be two VEC representatives &ndash; to be members of the VEC, one inspector of the Department of Education and Science, one education expert and one personnel expert. The quorum in this case will be four but must include the inspector. In the case of appointment of a catechetics teacher, the education expert may be nominated by the diocesan authority. Normally an expert will be drawn from a list of nominations from the VEC concerned and the TUI.</P>
      <P>The selection board for appointment of eligible part-time teachers will be the chief executive or deputed officer, a principal or centre director as appropriate and a representative of the VEC. However, the selection board for appointment as a permanent teacher may also be used for the selection of eligible part-time teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are agreed criteria and a marking scheme for appointment to assistant principal and special duties teacher posts. The object of the selection board will be to select the most suitable candidate for the post. The selection board is required to adopt the agreed criteria and marking scheme when determining their order of merit for submission to the VEC. An unsuccessful appli<Col N="710" />cant may submit an appeal against the proposed appointment to an independent arbitrator on the grounds that the agreed criteria and marking scheme were not applied by the selection board. No appointment is made pending the outcome of the appeal. If the appeal is upheld by the arbitrator, a new competition must be held. If the appeal is rejected, the successful candidate shall be appointed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the agreed selection procedures for the appointment and promotion of teachers in vocational schools is open and fair. Having a public representative, who is answerable to the public, on a board enhances openness and transparency. Circular 43/00 provides for a review of these procedures.</P>
    <P>Two meetings have been held between representatives of my Department, the Irish vocational education association and the Teachers' Union of Ireland for this purpose. A further meeting will be held in the near future with a view to agreeing any revisions in the procedures considered necessary. When agreement is reached, a circular authorising the implementation of the revised procedures will be issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling almost &euro;121 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the programme for prosperity and fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for implementation of many of these recommendations lies with my Department. Some recommendations require action on the part of other Government Departments. On a wider level, the recommendations call for action on the part of third level institutions, schools and community and voluntary groups. To date a number of measures have been taken by my Department in response to the main recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>The most significant spending recommendation of that group concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>Following a recent review, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and &euro;1,600 for students residing within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; of &euro;1,490 and &euro;596 respectively, for eligible students, on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, administered the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-2002 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I have increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million. ADM Limited, which is continuing to administer <Col N="712" />the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.</P>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third-level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>I have now given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>
    <P>Some of the action group's recommendations relate to the achieving of targets for access to third level education, over the period of the national development plan, in relation to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability. I am committed to progressing these, and other, recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure as Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>My Department is also conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. Some of the issues being examined, such as the reform of student supports, are issues in relation to which the action group on access to third level education made a number of recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" />Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school opened in September 2002 with provisional recognition from my Department. The school is currently housed in rented accommodation in the scout den in Lucan village. During the period of provisional recognition, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building. Interim accommodation must comply at all times with planning, fire and health and safety and building regulations.</P>
    <P>In view of the restricted capacity of the scout den &ndash; maximum capacity 30, the promoters were advised to develop and implement an enrolment policy in line with the capacity of the available accommodation. This approach was essential to ensure that there was no overcrowding that might create a health and safety problem for pupils and school staff.</P>
    <P>The board of management of the school has made a proposal to my Department to lease the site which has been reserved in the Griffeen Valley area for primary education purposes, from the owners, and to house the school in temporary accommodation on the site. This proposal is currently under consideration in my Department and as part of the process, the property management section of the Office of Public Works has been asked to carry out a rental valuation on the site. On receipt of the advice of the Office of Public Works, my Department will consider the matter further and will be seeking a value for money solution in light of current budgetary constraints. A decision will be conveyed to the school management authorities as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 was signed into law by the President on 10 April 2002. The purpose of the Act is to set up a framework to enable victims to apply for compensation. The Act provides for the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board to administer a scheme that will enable victims of institutional abuse to make an application for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Act allow the board to make awards based on a lower threshold of proof than is required in taking a case through the courts. An applicant is expected to provide proof of their identity, that he or she was resident in an <Col N="714" />institution, that he or she was injured while so resident and that the injury is consistent with any abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident.</P>
    <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was formally established on 16 December 2002. The board is chaired by Judge Sean O'Leary, Circuit Court and has four ordinary members, namely, Professor Desmond Greer, Dr. Helen Cummiskey, Dr. Ruth Pilkington and Mr. Richard O'Connell. The Residential Institutions Redress Board's offices are located in Belfield Office Park, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board is independent of my Department and I am not therefore in a position to indicate the number of applications received by it to date or when the board will begin its first hearings. I am aware that the board has undertaken an advertising campaign informing possible applicants that application forms and a guide to the application process are available from its offices in Clonskeagh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pupils and parents enjoy a number of legal rights regarding their choice of school for primary education. These derive from the Constitution, legislation and my Department's rules.</P>
      <P>Statutory rights to choice of school derives from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting &ldquo;the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In addition, section 15 (2)(<i>d</i>) of the 1998 Act provides that a board of management of a primary school shall:</P>
      <P>Publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school and ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" />At present, officials in my Department are in consultation with officials in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government with a view to drawing up regulations under the Act governing the preparation of admissions policies. This work is ongoing and will be concluded as speedily as possible. The purpose of these proposed regulations is to promote greater consistency, transparency and accountability in decision-making at school level and to further the objective, under the Education Act, of equality and participation in education.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</P>
    <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
    <P>In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of the inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: (a) The higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and (d) maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees. The arrangements for the payment of maintenance grants are a matter for those bodies, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of concerns expressed by the Union of Students in Ireland regarding the payment of maintenance grants. However, resulting from a survey of the local authorities and vocational education committees, it was confirmed to my Department that the vast majority of successful applicants had been issued their first maintenance grant for the 2002-03 academic year by the 31 October 2002. It was also confirmed by the local authorities and vocational education committees that the majority of outstanding applications, as of 31 December 2002, resulted from incomplete information being submitted by candidates and that such information had been sought.</P>
      <P>Decisions arising from the current review of student support provisions may have implications for the terms and conditions of the grants schemes. However, my Department will endeavour to ensure that the 2003 maintenance grants schemes are finalised, and application forms issued, as early as feasible prior to the start of the 2003-04 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of State support for fee paying schools raises complex issues such as social equity and prioritisation of resources. I did mention the possibility of requiring fee paying schools to admit a quota of disadvantaged students in the course of a radio programme in November last. Those comments constituted a minor part of a 45 minute programme dealing with the wider issue <Col N="718" />of educational disadvantage and should not be taken out of context. The essential point is that I flagged issues such as this, which we cannot ignore when considering educational disadvantage. I have not reached a final position on this issue and it is one of a number of issues I intend to address during my term as Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment, I have made it clear, at every opportunity, that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels.</P>
      <P>My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of An Agreed Programme for Government and the Government's national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS. Education is a central element of the NAPS, which includes three headline targets for education focusing on reducing early school leaving, and improving literacy levels in schools and in the adult population. This includes targeting resources towards those children most at risk of early school leaving, in order to encourage long-term participation in education and better educational outcomes for all children. The NAPS approach for education is based on a continuum of provision, from early childhood through adulthood, with the focus on preventive strategies, targeting and integrated community responses. The strategies and programmes which we are implementing to achieve the NAPS targets, build on the very comprehensive range of measures that have already been put in place to counter educational disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarships scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" />The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees. Given the nature of the student support schemes and the application, means testing and disbursement processes involved, officials of my Department have engaged with officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to options for the future administration of the various student support schemes.</P>
    <P>Consideration has been given to a proposal that a transfer of responsibility for the operation of the maintenance grants schemes to a single agency or body, such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs, might be administratively more appropriate.</P>
    <P>This view has been endorsed by the Cromien report of October 2000 on the review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs and by the report of the action group on access to third level education which was published in July 2001.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that the time frame for delivering on the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government of June 2002, is the term of office of the Government. When I have had an opportunity of considering the range of issues involved in implementing the commitment I would expect to be in a position to arrive at a more definitive time frame.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also appreciate that there are major implications, for example, for the local authorities and vocational education committees, in any proposals to change the administration of the maintenance grants schemes. It is my intention, therefore, that there will be full consultation with all interested parties and that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements prior to such consultation taking place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in December 1999, the Government approved the establishment of an academy for the performing arts which was to incorporate a headquarters at Dublin City University, a Limerick campus incorporating the Irish world music centre at the University of Limerick and an undergraduate professional dance facility based at the Institute for Choreography and Dance at Firkin Crane, Cork. An interim governing authority was established to oversee the development of the Academy in April 2002.</P>
      <P>In light of a lack of available capital funding in 2003 to progress the capital elements of the project, the Government has reconsidered its approach to the development of an Irish academy for the performing arts. The Government has now decided to transfer responsibility for the project to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and has agreed that other options for the development of an Irish academy for the performing arts in tandem with projects of a similar nature will now be considered. In the circumstances, the members of the interim governing authority have been requested to stand down.</P>

      <P>As part of its evaluative role, my Department's inspectorate recently conducted a sample survey of 25 primary schools which had been allocated resource teacher and special needs assistant support. This review highlighted significant misapplication of the terms of the relevant <Col N="721" />departmental circulars. Arising from these concerns, arrangements were made for the national educational psychological service, NEPS, to carry out a review of some 788 applications for such support on hands in my Department. The 788 applications in question involved a total of 1,590 individual pupils in respect of whom support was sought.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,590 individual pupils involved, the review concluded that the applications in respect of 948, 60%, of these pupils conformed with departmental circulars and the resources sought have been allocated. In the remaining 642 cases, the key deficiencies identified were: situations where the level of support sought in respect of individual pupils in a particular disability category did not conform to the support levels identified in the circulars as applicable to the disability category in question, and; situations where the relevant assessment reports required to support the application were not available at the school for inspection by NEPS.</P>
      <P>Where possible, NEPS made a recommendation as to the nature and level of the resources which should be provided and such resources have been sanctioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational research centre, ERC, at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra was commissioned by the task force on the physical sciences in December 2001 to investigate the comparability of grades awarded in different subjects in the leaving certificate examination, LCE. Specifically, the task force wanted to know if there was evidence to suggest that it is more difficult for physical science &ndash; chemistry and physics &ndash; candidates to do well, compared to students sitting other subjects. The research showed that students tended to be awarded lower grades in chemistry and physics than in the other higher level leaving certificate subjects that they sat. It used a methodology called subject pairs analysis which compared the mean of grades of students sitting a target subject, i.e. physics or chemistry, with their performance on a number of comparison subjects. The 16 most popular subjects were used in the analysis. The report was published as an appendix to the task force report which was published in the first half of 2002. However there <Col N="723" />have been concerns from a number of researchers on its validity.</P>
      <P>The ERC undertook some further work on this matter which, while made available to the task force was not ready for inclusion in its final report. This analysis used an overall performance scale, OPS, based on students' junior certificate examination, JCE, performance as a proxy measure of academic ability to assess the variation of grading in the leaving certificate examination. A comparison of JCE results in 1997, 1998 and 1999 with LCE results in 2000 and 2001 was undertaken. While the focus was on physics and chemistry the report also dealt with other subjects. Some of the findings were not unexpected, for example student academic ability varies by subject and subjects attracting students of high academic ability award a larger portion of high grades. On the other hand there were unexpected findings which included the fact that the academic ability of students who are awarded identical grades varies by subject and the grades awarded between subjects can vary even when the academic ability of students taking the subjects is similar.</P>
      <P>In mid-2002 my Department commissioned the ERC to undertake a more detailed analysis of comparability of grades in the leaving certificate examination as part of its ongoing quality assurance of the examinations process. I expect to receive this report shortly and, as I have indicated already, I look forward to its publication and recommendations.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a speech made recently by Mr. Dorgan at a meeting in Dublin of education chief executive officers from OECD countries. Mr. Dorgan's theme was the challenges ahead for education systems and education chief executive officers. A central element of his presentation was that in the context of globalisation, competition and changing skills needs, education systems must reach out and connect with the national and international social and economic environments in which they operate. Education must respond to the needs of society and the economy if it is to serve the needs of people.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with Mr. Dorgan on this approach. It is, and has been for some time, central to the Government's policy on education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to the Irish experience, Mr. Dorgan noted that our education system has worked very well for us as a society and economy to-date and that it was a very substantial contributor to our economic progress in the last ten years. The chal<Col N="725" />lenge facing policy makers now is to ensure that our education system can continue to make that substantial contribution to our development.

      <P>Schools' running costs have traditionally been met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>Grants at both levels have increased significantly in recent times. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;111.58 per pupil in 2003. At post primary, schools have also benefited from increases in the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. The grant has been increased from &euro;224.74 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;266.49 in the current school year.</P>
      <P>Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. In my view this is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives such as copyright charges. It is my intention to further improve the financial position of primary and second-level schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>The role of the Education Centre Network has expanded greatly since the first centres were set up in the late seventies. The 1998 Education Act outlined their role as &ldquo;providing services for schools, teachers, parents, boards and other relevant persons which support them in carrying out their functions in respect of the provision of education&rdquo;. The centres, therefore, have become major players in the provision of in-career development in the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the expanding nature and complexity of their role, my Department agreed with the Association of Teacher Education Centres Ireland, the representative body for the Edu<Col N="726" />cation Centre Network, to commission a review of the education centres to clarify their role, functions and developmental potential as a strategic part of the education system nationally, regionally and locally. The centre for management organisation and development of the Department of Finance was commissioned to undertake the review. This review has been a detailed process including wide-ranging research and consultation with the key stakeholders.</P>
    <P>The recommendations contained in the report are being considered by my Department as part of a comprehensive review of delivery structures for in-career development generally. I have also agreed with the ATECI to set up a consultative process to commence as soon as possible. Decisions in regard to the retention of education centres in Kilkenny and Carlow and the education centre network in general will be taken following the fullest consideration of all the relevant issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Youth Work Act 2001 was enacted on 1 December 2001 and provides a statutory basis for the development of youth work. The Act followed on a widespread consultation process and provides a legal framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services to be organised by the Minister for Education and Science, the vocational education committees and by national-regional youth work organisations.</P>
      <P>It was never the intention that the Act would be implemented fully at once &ndash; on the contrary. Section 1 of the Act provides for sections to be commenced at different stages. To date, sections 2 to 18, inclusive, and section 24 have been commenced. Sections 17 and 18 provided for the establishment of a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee, NYWAC. This is a key provision of the Act and this committee was appointed in April 2002. This committee is providing advice to me on a regular basis in regard to the implementation of other sections of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A subcommittee of the NYWAC has been established to make recommendations on the requirements necessary for the implementation of the various sections of the Act. This subcommittee comprises representatives of both statutory and voluntary sectors as well as my Department. Two reports were recently furnished to the Minister with responsibility for youth affairs and have been approved in principle by her. These reports were prepared by this subcommittee and approved by the NYWAC. The reports relate to the first two areas of action necessary to put in place the arrangements viz. the designation of local youth work organisations and the establishment of local voluntary youth councils. It is <Col N="728" />intended to have these reports circulated to the appropriate interest groups. The subcommittee's work is of a continuing nature and work on the criteria for the approval of national youth work organisations is nearing completion. This subcommittee will continue to report to the NYWAC on this and other aspects of the implementation process of the Act.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to have structures put in place at local level to enable, <i>inter alia,</i> youth work committees to be established which will be responsible for the preparation of three year development plans for approval by the vocational education committees and, in turn, by my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is engaged in ongoing discussions with the IVEA-CEOs' association and the National Youth Council of Ireland in relation to the further administrative and financial arrangements necessary to enable implementation of the Act at local level. It will then be necessary for my Department to discuss the question of resources with the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The total annual amount paid in respect of fee charging secondary schools is some &euro;77.5 million. Of this sum, approximately &euro;68.5 million relates to salaries and allowances of teachers. The balance includes the Protestant block grant, funding towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking services and grants in 2002 towards supervision arrangements.</P>
      <P>The payment of teachers salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions. Teachers in fee charging schools, irrespective of the denominational ethos of the school, are paid by the State. This may well reflect a long standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 58 fee charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant. The latter schools receive funding by way of the Protestant block grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant persuasion to attend schools, which reflect their denominational ethos. The block grant includes payments in respect of capitation and these schools also qualify for payment of such <Col N="729" />grants as the transition year support grant and secretarial and caretaking grants.</P>
    <P>Fee charging schools not embraced by the Protestant block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports. I have no plans, at this stage, to withdraw State support for the payment of teachers in fee charging schools. This support has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.</P>

      <P>A range of measures to improve teacher supply have been introduced in recent years. The intake to the BEd programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically. Since 1999 over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the undergraduate BEd programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. Since 1996, post graduate diploma courses have been run by the colleges of education to increase further the number of BEd graduates.</P>
      <P>In February 2002, 461 students commenced the post graduate course and these students will graduate in June 2003. A further post graduate course commenced this month with a maximum of 460 places available on the course which will conclude in May-June 2004. A total of 1,633 students completed the post graduate course between 1996 and 2002. As outlined, the total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>There are currently some 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. Between 2002 and 2003, it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>My Department is examining the feasibility of providing a modular type course for second level trained teachers currently teaching in primary schools who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and the necessary academic requirement in Irish. This proposal will be discussed with the colleges of education in the near future and, if implemented, would enable these teachers to become fully qualified primary teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which is now fully commenced, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national agency with responsibility for school attendance. The board has responsibility for ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The board is required to assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in ensuring that their children attend school regularly, and will also assist schools in fulfilling their role under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" />Through the appointment of educational welfare officers, the board will provide a welfare-focused service which is accessible to parents, school and others concerned with the welfare of young people. Where a child is not attending school, or is not otherwise in receipt of a certain minimum education, the board will investigate the case, establish the reasons for non-attendance, and then work collaboratively with the family, schools and others concerned with the child's welfare in order to ensure that the child either attends school or otherwise receives an appropriate education.</P>
    <P>The board also has the legal power to compel a parent to send his or her child to school. However, this power will only be used where all other measures have failed and where the board is of the view that the parent has not made all reasonable efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some 36 former school attendance officers have already transferred to the board and these are providing a service in city areas of Dublin, Cork and Waterford. Discussions between the management and union sides in relation to the terms and conditions of the officers as educational welfare officers in the new service have been under way for some time. The revised formal offer made by the board to the staff concerned in December has now been accepted by the staff, subject to a range of issues being referred to the Labour Court for adjudication. The board will now move to appoint the former school attendance officers as educational welfare officers in accordance with the offer. In the meantime, staff are working normally in accordance with guidance issued to them by the board. The recruitment of additional educational welfare officers will be facilitated by the budget of &euro;5.244 million which I have allocated to the new service in 2003.</P>
    <P>In developing and expanding this new service, which is being introduced on a phased basis, priority will be given to areas that already had a service under the previous legislation as well as areas of high levels of disadvantage, especially areas covered by the RAPID programme. However, decisions relating to the appointment of educational welfare officers in specific areas are a matter for the National Educational Welfare Board, which is an independent statutory body.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the programme to address the issue of providing PE halls to existing schools by way of a template architectural design which has been developed in my Department. The intention is to pilot this programme in four schools. Architectural planning for these projects is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>However, due to the level of financial commitments to be met from the capital programme for 2003, as published, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position to allow further large scale projects, including the pilot template PE halls, to proceed beyond their current authorised stage of architectural planning. These projects will, however, be considered for the 2004 capital programme.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out to the Deputy that the template PE facility refers to stand alone provision where existing accommodation at a school does not require other immediate extensive investment. A number of large scale projects on the capital programme for 2003 are being provided with PE facilities as part of an overall extension-refurbishment or where a new school is being provided.</P>

      <P>The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002 which was published last year, was widely supported for its rights based approach to the education of children with special educational needs arising from a disability. However, those representing the interests of people with disabilities had concerns about certain elements of the legislation and it was to allow for discussion on, and resolution of, these concerns that the further consultation was engaged in.</P>
      <P>My objective is to bring forward legislation which will guarantee that the needs of children arising from a disability are identified and that they are provided with an education appropriate to their needs as early as possible in their lives; ensure that adults with special educational needs have access to the education and related services and supports they need; ensure that parents have a central role in their child's education; and ensure that the various agencies involved in providing for special education and related support services are required to act within specified time limits.</P>
      <P>I also propose that the legislation will build on and strengthen the structures set out in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002, especially the National Council for Special Education and the Special Education Appeals Board. It will also be an objective for revised legislation that it will closely dovetail where necessary with legislation being prepared by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform relating to the broader issue of services for people with disabilities.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider requesting schools to make returns to his Department of the amounts raised through voluntary contributions, in order that it can clearly be established the amount parents are contributing; if the amounts have increased as a result of insufficient funding from his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The manner in which voluntary contributions are sought from local communities for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme is a matter for school principals and managements. Voluntary contributions by parents and others are permissible under the free education scheme. The extent of such fund raising by and on behalf of schools is determined by a range of socio-economic factors, including the level of local initiative and the need for additional facilities and curriculum provision as perceived by parents and the wider community. Local contributions towards education provision have long been a feature of the Irish education system. The benefits of obtaining returns from the schools, as suggested by the Deputy, are not clear.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to second level schools. The standard <i>per capita </i>grant from &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;266.49 in this school year. An additional <i>per capita </i>grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in the year 2000 to &euro;99 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2003.</P>
      <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of a recent equalisation measure, the support services grant was increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brings the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school &ndash;&euro;44.44 per pupil &ndash; per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of &euro;236,761 &ndash;&euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools &ndash; towards general expenses and support services.</P>

The revised procedure applies to schools intending to commence operation from 1 September 2003, onwards. The revised arrangements involve a number of stages, including formal notification of intention to apply for recognition; public consultation and identification of need; formal application for recognition; assessment of the application by a new schools advisory committee, which will consult with interested parties, and report to me; decision by the Minister; and provision for appeal by applicant to an independent appeals committee. Full details of the applications procedure and the timeframe for consideration of applications for schools intending to commence operation in 2003-04 were circulated to the primary education partners and are also available on the Department's website at www.education.gov.ie. Arrangements will shortly be put in place for an appeals facility and the details will be circulated to the relevant bodies and will also be published on the website.</P>

      <P>There are 72 post-primary inspectors in my Department. The main functions of the inspectorate in the Department of Education and Science are described in section 13(3) of the Education Act 1998. Arising from the report by Mr. Sean Cromien on the operations systems and staffing of the Department of Education and Science, the Government undertook a number of measures in relation to the implementation of the programme of structural reform of the Department. The Government decision included the establishment of a State examinations commission as a body independent of the Department to which responsibility for the administration of the State certificate examinations is being transferred. When the remaining procedures in relation to the vesting of the State examinations commission are concluded, up to 31 post primary inspectors will transfer to or be assigned to the commission. Four further inspectors have transferred to senior management positions in the commission. The present functions of post primary inspectors in relation to the State certificate examinations will then be carried out by the examinations commission. It is my intention to recruit additional post primary inspectors on a phased basis to replace those transferring to the commission.</P>

      <P>My Department allocates additional resources to children in the primary sector when it is clear that the results of professional assessments are in compliance with Circular Letter 8/02. The special education section advises the school that the application for resources has been allocated or rejected and the section would not normally correspond directly with parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a psychologist has assessed a child it is the general practice to meet the parents afterwards to discuss the results of any assessment tests. At this stage the psychologist will explain to the parents whether or not the child is eligible for extra resources under the terms of the circular. It is the responsibility of psychologists carrying out such assessments to be familiar with the terms of the circular, to make recommendations in accordance with them and to so advise the child's par<Col N="737" />ents. In addition to NEPS staff, there are also a number of other psychologists working in the educational system, bringing the current total to approximately 130.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners have established a panel of suitably qualified psychologists, selected during the most recent recruitment competition for NEPS. It is intended to continue to appoint these psychologists during 2003.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there have been delays in certain areas of the country in the process of assessing children with special educational needs and I am committed to expediting access to psychological assessments. My Department has therefore made funding available for schools to commission assessments from suitably qualified private practitioners, pending the recruitment of the full complement of psychologists to NEPS. NEPS has issued details of how to avail of this scheme to all schools and has also posted them on my Department's web site.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 was signed into law by the President on 10 April 2002. The purpose of the Act is to set up a framework to enable victims to apply for compensation. <Col N="738" />The Act allows for the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board to administer a scheme that will enable victims of institutional abuse to make an application for compensation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Act allow the board to make awards based on a lower threshold of proof than is required in taking a case through the courts. An applicant is expected to provide proof of their identity, that he or she was resident in an institution, that he or she was injured while so resident and that the injury is consistent with any abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident.</P>
    <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was formally established on 16 December 2002. The board is chaired by Judge Sean O'Leary, Circuit Court and has four ordinary members, namely, Professor Desmond Greer, Dr. Helen Cummiskey, Dr. Ruth Pilkington and Mr. Richard O'Connell. The Residential Institutions Redress Board's offices are located in Belfield Office Park, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board is independent of my Department and I am not therefore in a position to indicate the number of applications received by it to date or when the board will begin its first hearings.

      <P>Under the terms of the indemnity agreement between the State and the religious congregations signed on 5 June 2002 provision was made for the congregations to transfer property to the State to the value of &euro;76.86 million as a contribution to the redress scheme. There are two schedules of property. The first one which is valued at &euro;40.32 million represents transfers of property to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations which have taken place since 11 May 1999. Any property transferred to a voluntary organisation on this schedule must be subject to a restriction of further transfer or alienation of 25 years from the date of the indemnity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second schedule which is valued at &euro;36.54 million represents properties that the congregations have offered to the State. The State has a period of nine months from 5 June 2002 to consider each of the properties. In the event the State cannot benefit by accepting the transfer of a par<Col N="739" />ticular property, it can reject the offer. The religious congregation concerned can then offer an alternative property or cash sum equivalent.</P>
    <P>The property aspect of the agreement is still being considered by officials of my Department and is the subject of ongoing negotiations with the legal representatives of CORI. When the schedules of property have been agreed they will be made available.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the 788 applications from schools for resource and-or special needs assistant support which were recently reviewed by the national educational psychological service. The applications in question involved a total of 1,590 individual pupils in respect of whom support was sought. Of the 1,590 pupils involved, the review concluded that the applications in respect of 948, 60%, of these pupils conformed with departmental circulars and the resources sought in these cases have been sanctioned. In the remaining cases, where resource allocations were recommended by NEPS as a result of the review, the resources in question have been sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures schools are required to follow in applying for the supports in question involve the completion of a standard application form in respect of each individual child and a summary application form covering all the children included in the school's application. The individual pupil form requires particulars of the child's name, address, age, category of disability under circular 8/2002 and the nature and level of the supports being sought in respect of the child. The summary application form requires particulars of the overall number of pupils in respect of whom <Col N="741" />support is sought, the total supports being sought in respect of those pupils and the total resources already sanctioned at the school to address special needs. Where an application seeks the allocation of resources on a shared basis with other schools, particulars of those schools are sought.</P>
    <P>The summary application form contains a declaration by the school principal confirming that the application has been discussed with the parents or guardians of the children and that their consent has been obtained to apply for the support in question; that the application is supported by the chairperson of the school's board of management; that in making the application, full regard has been had to any support services already allocated to the school; that the application is based on relevant assessment reports presented in respect of the pupils in question and available for inspection by the Department; and that where a shared post arrangement is proposed, the authorities of the other participating schools are in agreement with the proposal.</P>
    <P>The main deficiencies identified in the NEPS review related to situations where the level of support sought in respect of individual pupils in a particular disability category did not conform to the support levels identified in the circulars as applicable to the disability category in question, and situations where the relevant assessment reports required to support the application were not available at the school for inspection by NEPS. Deficiencies were identified in 642 cases. Where possible in such cases, the NEPS made a recommendation as to the nature and level of the resources which should be provided and such resources have been sanctioned. In some cases, such as where the school was unable to produce the relevant assessment report, no recommendation for resources could be made.</P>

      <P>Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. The grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The standard rate of capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years, from &euro;57.14, £45, in 1997 to &euro;111.58 in 2003. This rep<Col N="742" />resents an increase of 95% in the capitation grant over that period. Local authority service and other charges payable to the various local authorities do not come within the remit of my Department. Local authorities have to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. If it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost forms part of the normal running costs of schools and are met from the capitation funding which schools receive from my Department. It would not be feasible for my Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of individual charges such as water or refuse charges.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that the primary responsibility for the health and safety of pupils and teachers rests with the managing authority of each school. The onus is on boards of management in primary schools to use the annual minor works grants they receive from my Department to ensure that urgent health and safety issues are satisfactorily addressed. Section 11 of the capital programme also refers to smaller scale primary and post-primary projects that address services, fire officer and insurers' requirements, access for all, curricular and structural requirements with an estimated expenditure in the current year of &euro;21.8 million. The timing as to when additional projects, other than those listed in section 11 can progress to tender and completion is dependent on the funding allocation in 2004 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>Under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992 the governing body is required to submit annually an operational programme and budget through the City of Dublin VEC to my Department for approval. The institute's annual budget is allocated following consideration of the programme and budget submission and having regard to the available funding and the Government's commitments and priorities. The implementation of the programme and budget and the management of the resources of the institute are matters for which the governing body and management of the institute are responsible. My Department has not yet met with the Dublin Institute of Technology to discuss its submission for the 2003-04 academic year. However, in light of current financial constraints and the fact that the institute will need to manage its resources carefully to keep expenditure within the approved budget, it is expected that it may have to review its priorities and effect economies across some or all areas of its activities.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that officials from the Office of the Attorney General were involved in the negotiations which took place prior to the signing of the indemnity agreement between the State and the religious congregations on 5 June 2002. On 10 November 2000, the first meeting in relation to seeking a contribution from the religious congregations was held. This meeting was attended by officials of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and representatives from the religious congregations. At the meeting the representatives for the religious congregations indicated their willingness to make a meaningful contribution to the residential institutions redress scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of meetings between November 2000 and June 2001 was attended by representatives of the congregations, officials from the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and my Department. In the course of these discussions the congregations raised the question of indemnity as part of an agreement to contribute to the redress scheme. The discussions referred to above terminated without any agreement being reached as to the contribution that the congregations should contribute to the scheme. The then <Col N="744" />Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, held further meetings with the congregations on 7 November 2001 and 7 January 2002. The outcome of these meetings was that the congregations agreed to make a substantially improved contribution to the redress scheme than the offer made prior to the termination of discussions with officials. At that stage Dr. Woods brought these proposals to the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed in principle to the key elements of the agreement on 30 January 2002. A series of meetings was held from January to late May 2002 at official level with the congregations and their legal advisers to finalise the details of the agreement. As the Attorney General was fully involved at all appropriate times during the course of the negotiations and his office prepared comprehensive advice for the Government prior to the decision being taken to sign the agreement, I am satisfied that the indemnity agreement contains all the essential points of a legally binding contract and that the question of referring the agreement to the Office of the Attorney General for further consideration is not necessary. I assure the Deputy that all legal considerations which should have been considered were considered during the negotiation period and again during the final drafting of the indemnity.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, following the report by Mr. Sean Cromien on my Department's organisation, systems and staffing, a major programme of structural reform was commenced. There are a number of elements to this programme: the putting in place of a state examinations commission and a national council for special education and the transfer of the responsibility for the institutes of technology to the Higher Education Authority; the putting in place of a network of regional offices of the Department; new appeal processes to underpin the Department's allocation functions; a range of efficiency measures designed to bring the Department's procedures and processes more into line with modern administrative practice; and revised internal structures to enable overarching or cross sectoral issues to be better addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" />The recent changes of responsibility at senior management level within the Department represent a conscious effort to increase mobility and experience. As part of the process, a number of key areas previously dealt with on a purely sectoral basis, such as salaries, curriculum and assessment, have been grouped on a functional or thematic basis. Finally, the standing committee concept represents a new approach to better deal with overarching areas and to provide the Department with a better policy and forward planning focus.</P>

Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the current year.</P>
      <P>In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools received a grant of &euro;1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of &euro;635.

      <P>There has been no change to the arrangements under which children in the primary system who have been professionally assessed as having special educational needs have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. As part of its evaluative role, my Department's inspectorate recently conducted a sample survey of 25 primary schools which had been allocated resource teacher and special needs assistant support. This review highlighted significant misapplication of the terms of the relevant departmental circulars. Arising from these concerns, arrangements were made for the national educational psychological service to carry out a review of a further 788 applications for such support on hands in my Department. The 788 applications in question involved a total of 1,590 individual pupils in respect of whom support was sought.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,590 individual pupils involved, the review concluded that the applications in respect of 948, or 60%, of these pupils conformed with departmental circulars and the resources sought have been allocated. In the remaining 642 cases, the key deficiencies identified were situations where the level of support sought in respect of individual children in a particular disability category did not conform to the support levels identified in the circulars as applicable to the disability category in question, and situations where the relevant assessment reports required to support the application were not available at the school for inspection by the NEPS. Where possible in these latter cases, the NEPS made a recommendation as to the nature and level of the resources which should be provided and such resources have since been sanctioned.</P>

Where the college requires a grantholder in receipt of the adjacent rate of grant to relocate from his or her residence to undertake a placement of not less than one academic term, the non-adjacent rate of grant may be paid for the duration of such placement. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>

Those involved with the school development planning initiative and the primary curriculum support programme &ndash; services which support schools in the implementation of curriculum, assessment and planning &ndash; are being asked to consider the report's findings and to factor these into the in-career development programmes which they organise at national level. A Department publication, Looking at Our School: Themes for Use in School Self-Evaluation, will shortly issue to all schools. This document will promote self-evaluation by schools as an element of school development planning and school improvement. In particular, it will assist schools <Col N="750" />in focusing on priorities for development at individual school level, taking account of deficiencies identified during the evaluation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the report's findings will be examined by the various administrative sections of my Department, with a view to considering the implications for the range of supports and services offered to schools. The report has already been circulated to all primary schools for consideration and action in the processes of planning, co-ordination, review and development across the range of school management, organisational and curricular activities.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to say, on the basis of the information supplied, if this is a matter for my Department. If the proposal involves the setting up of a business or enterprise, then my Department through its agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the Dublin City Enterprise Board may have a role to play. If the idea to develop the music industry involves an increased role for the State in supporting the industry then it would be more appropriate to consult my colleague the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism or the interim music board of Ireland which has been charged with responsibility for preparing a development plan for the music industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence recently attended a press briefing to announce the purchase of the assets of the former Miza facility, Roscrea, County Tipperary, by Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and the intention of the company to create some 300 jobs. This company will manufacture pharmaceutical products in Roscrea for the health and well-being of people and there is no basis for the suggestion that its products or by-products can be used as component parts for disabling gases. It is understood that the substance referred to by the Deputy is not either a gas or a product, but a small organic molecule liberated at nerve endings in the body as a neurotransmitter. Consequently, the issue of export licences does not arise.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is provision for a special contribution from financial institutions contained in the Finance Bill before the House. This contribution is in the form of a stamp duty which, if enacted, will raise &euro;300 million over the next three years, and this will increase the funds available for Exchequer funding in all areas, including those mentioned by the Deputy. It would not be appropriate to single out one company and apply a different tax regime to it.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that any multinational company resident in Ireland with subsidiaries in other jurisdictions will initially be liable to taxation in these countries in respect of the profits in those other countries. The question of Irish taxation on the profits of such subsidiaries only arises when the subsidiaries remit dividends to the parent company and credit must then be given for taxation paid in the other country if it is a country with which Ireland has a double taxation treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 2002, my colleague, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, launched a new Ireland Aid-Department of Finance strategy on the issue of developing country debt. This updates and develops the Government's position on the debt crisis which had been issued in September 1998. The debt relief strategy indicates, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Government believes total debt cancellation to be a politically acceptable objective and one that it would support.</P>
      <P>In our view, debt cancellation should be extended to those heavily indebted poor countries, HIPC, who are making progress in implementing economic reform and are committed to good governance. We believe any such cancellation should take place within the framework of the existing HIPC initiative, which has strong safeguards to ensure that the resources released through debt relief are channelled to social sectors, such as health and education, and are not abused.</P>
      <P>We also stressed that debt cancellation should be funded entirely through additional contributions from donors. In our view, it would not be possible to fund debt cancellation from the resources of the Bank and the IMF. Cancellation would, in effect, require faster progress by the larger donors towards meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has never given development assistance in the form of loans and is not owed any money by the heavily indebted poor countries. We have, however, contributed generously to international debt relief efforts. In 1998, the Government announced a package of £31.5 million for debt relief in the form of contributions to multilateral <Col N="763" />debt relief funds at the World Bank and the IMF and to national debt relief funds in Tanzania and Mozambique. In 2001, we paid an additional £4.5 million to the World Bank earmarked for debt relief in Ethiopia. Our share of the EU contribution to the World Bank HIPC Trust Fund is &euro;6 million.</P>
    <P>In 2002 we announced a three year funding commitment of &euro;1.5 million to Debt Relief International, an intergovernmental organisation committed to helping poor countries manage their debts and negotiate with the international financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Ireland's debt strategy also raises a number of concerns about the operation of the HIPC initiative, such as the adequacy of the existing level of debt relief and the projections and assumptions used in the calculation of sustainable debt levels. The HIPC initiative seeks to lower the debts of 42 indebted poor countries to sustainable levels and the level of HIPC debt relief granted is related to defined debt sustainability criteria, based on statistics such as debt to exports ratios.</P>
    <P>However, the Bank and the IMF have admitted that between eight and ten countries emerging from the HIPC process continue to have unsustainable debt levels. Ireland believes that the bank and the IMF have used optimistic assumptions in their efforts to estimate sustainable debt levels, particularly about the future export revenues of the HIPC countries. The bank and the IMF have also focused on economic indicators, such as exports, rather than on development indicators, such as the amount of money a country has available to spend on health and education. Ireland also believes that the impact of HIV-AIDS on the economies of HIPC countries should be taken into account in assessing debt relief. In countries where almost one adult in three is infected, such as in Zambia, there will clearly be huge economic implications. Therefore, Ireland is also pushing for reform of the HIPC Initiative in relation to these issues.</P>
    <P>In September of last year, the Taoiseach reiterated our commitment to debt cancellation in his address to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. Minister of State, Deputy Kitt has promoted our debt strategy and our concerns about the effectiveness of the HIPC initiative in reducing debt to sustainable levels while in Washington in November last year and when Mr. James Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank, visited Dublin in January this year.</P>
    <P>My Department, in close co-ordination with the Department of Finance, will continue to promote our views on debt relief in all relevant international fora. In the coming months we will continue to follow closely developments in the HIPC process and participate actively in all relevant international meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 110, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has diplomatic relations with Cuba since October 1999, on a non-resident basis. The Irish ambassador to Mexico is also accredited to Cuba.</P>
      <P>The opening of Irish missions abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. As Deputy Ó Caoláin will appreciate, however, constraints on Government expenditure and the limits on the resources that could be made available for opening new missions require that any expansion of our diplomatic network must be incremental and be based on a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits involved. At present, there are no plans to change the status of our accreditation to Cuba.</P>
      <P>As regards agreements between Ireland and Cuba, an agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of Cuba on air transport, entered into force on 8 June 1991. This provides for the establishment of air services between and beyond our respective territories. Proposals have been received by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from the Cuban authorities for the conclusion of agreements between the two Governments in the areas of criminal mutual legal assistance, co-operation against drugs and the transfer of sentenced prisoners. These proposals are being examined in consultation with the relevant Departments, Offices and Agencies. It is anticipated that consultations will conclude in the near future in the case of the agreements concerning criminal mutual legal assistance and co-operation against drugs, when an appropriate response will issue to the Cuban authorities. Following consultations with the relevant authorities, a response will also issue in relation to the proposed agreement on the transfer of sentenced persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the question of joint overseas humanitarian programmes is concerned, the situation is that Ireland's overseas development co-operation assists some of the poorest countries and people in the world through long-term <Col N="765" />development activities aimed at tackling the root causes of poverty in a sustainable manner. Ireland also delivers humanitarian aid to vulnerable populations affected by natural and man-made disasters and emergencies. This development and humanitarian assistance is delivered through a number of channels, namely, directly through Ireland Aid's bilateral aid programme, and indirectly through non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and through the multilateral system such as the United Nations agencies. Working with UN agencies like UNICEF, UNHCR and ILO, the World Food Programme provides the optimal setting for partnership with other UN member states, such as Cuba, in addressing global development and humanitarian needs.</P>
    <P>EU policy towards Cuba is defined by the common position on Cuba, to the shaping of which Ireland contributed. The common position aims to encourage through dialogue and not by external pressure a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, a lasting economic recovery and an improvement in living standards of the Cuban people.</P>
    <P>The common position was re-affirmed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 9 to 10 December 2002, when the Council noted that since the previous evaluation in June 2002, there had been no significant positive progress in reform towards the introduction of a political system respecting civil and political freedom. The Council strongly urged the Cuban Government to take the necessary steps to ratify the UN Covenants on Political and Civil Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In order to promote the aims of the common position, the Council encouraged the strengthening of EU development co-operation with Cuba in areas that promote the transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights as well as an improvement in living standards. Ireland has directly assisted Cuba in 2001 and 2002 through UNICEF and Trócaire.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, together with our EU partners, are keen to see the development of relations with Cuba across the full spectrum of contacts from trade to culture. In fact, the 15 member states have actively developed their economic relationship with the island to such an extent that the EU is now Cuba's leading foreign investor, principal trade partner, premier source of tourists, and largest provider of development aid and humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>As regards United States policy towards Cuba, Deputies will be aware of the Government's very clear position regarding the US economic embargo against Cuba. Together with our EU partners, we have consistently supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for the embargo to be lifted. Most recently, on 12 November 2002, all EU member states voted in favour of the Resolution tabled by Cuba calling for the abolition of the embargo. The Assembly <Col N="766" />adopted the resolution by a vote of 173 in favour to three against, with four abstentions.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the partial easing of the US embargo, after a vote by the US Congress in October 2000 to lift the ban on the sale of food and medicines, has not been followed up by the embargo's complete removal. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the relaxation of the embargo has enabled Cuba to purchase a considerable volume of US food products; for which, however, Havana has had to pay cash, as US financial institutions remain prohibited from extending credits for such sales.</P>
    <P>Ireland wishes to see a full and final end to the embargo. It is our belief that the effect of the embargo even in its now somewhat modified form is to work contrary to stated EU and US aspirations for a democratic and prosperous Cuba.</P>

      <P>The Government is of the view that any threat to international peace and security should be dealt with through the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations Charter generally prohibits the use of force in international relations. However, chapter VII of the Charter does allow the Security Council to sanction military action where it deems it necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. The Charter also recognises the right to individual or collec<Col N="767" />tive self-defence, if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations. Some international lawyers argue that this would allow for limited and proportional action where necessary to counter the threat of imminent attack. Others would dispute this. In any case, it is clear from the Charter that the right to act in self-defence is recognised only up until the Security Council has itself taken measures necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.</P>
    <P>I understand that the US Administration is of the view that it has a legal basis for military action in Iraq, on the basis of existing chapter VII Security Council resolutions, arising from the Iraqi regime's repeated and ongoing refusal to comply with the requirements set out in those resolutions. As I have pointed out on several previous occasions, there is no legal consensus on this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the task force in question contains approximately 180 recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates and early intervention, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services and the need for specialist training for those <Col N="768" />involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues.</P>
      <P>My Department's key focus to date has been on progressing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development of services for persons with autism in line with the task force's recommendations.</P>
      <P>A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the National Council for Special Education. The national council which will have a local presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including persons with autism. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision.</P>
      <P>It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. A chief executive was appointed to the council recently and it is intended that the council will be vested shortly.</P>
      <P>It is also my intention to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to copperfasten the rights and entitlement of persons with disabilities, including persons with autism. The objective of this legislation, which will be based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002 will be to provide a statutory underpinning for education services for persons with disabilities, including persons with autism. The Bill will provide a clear and enforceable statement in law of the rights of children and adults who because of disabilities have special educational needs.</P>
      <P>The proposed centre at Middletown will not replace any existing service provision for children with autism. Rather, it will complement existing services by providing specialist back-up support, advice and guidance on best practice to service providers north and south. The Middletown centre has the potential to play an important role in addressing the range of issues identified by the task force on autism. It will provide a centre of expertise in the area of diagnosis and assessment. It will provide specialist training programmes for service providers north and south involved in catering for children with autism. It will provide a specialist education unit to facilitate the development of individual education plans for children with autism. It will also provide residential accommodation to facilitate the attendance and participation by parents in their children's assessment and in the development of their individual education plans.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the Middletown centre has the potential to play an important role in the development of services for children with autism north and south.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey): The hardship fund, which was established in 1994, is now known as the student assistance fund. This initiative is funded under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, with assistance from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>The objective of the fund is to assist those students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The criteria for the fund confines eligibility to students participating on courses of not less than one year duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.</P>
    <P>The fund is devolved to the third level institutions. The allocation to the university sector is made through the Higher Education Authority, while the allocations to the institutes of technology and the teacher training colleges are made directly by the Department. These allocations are based on total undergraduate enrolments in the previous academic year.</P>
    <P>The allocation under this fund in 2002, in respect of the 2002-03 academic year, was &euro;8.935 million.</P>

      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, that following the report of the independent estimates review committee last year, it was decided that, in relation to new claims from 1 January 2003, the back to education allowance would be payable <Col N="771" />only in respect of the pursuit of courses to primary degree level.</P>
      <P>I understand that the basis for this decision was that the resources of this programme should be directed at those who need additional training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. Claimants who already hold a third level qualification have already achieved a good standard of academic attainment which should have a positive impact on their employment prospects.</P>
      <P>I further understand that during the present academic year a total of 650 participants are availing of this scheme while pursuing postgraduate courses of study at an estimated cost of &euro;4.6 million. The latest figures available from the Higher Education Authority for the 2001-02 academic year indicate that there are a total of some 12,300 students pursuing postgraduate studies in universities and Higher Education Authority designated institutions and a further 940 in the institute of technology sector. My Department provides a range of financial supports for postgraduate students as outlined in my Department's publication &ldquo;Financial Support for Further and Higher Education 2002/03&rdquo;. The two research councils &ndash; The Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology also support post-graduates through bursaries and scholarships.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 to 126, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The role of the Education Centre Network has expanded greatly since the first centres were set up in the late 1970s. The 1998 Education Act outlined their role as &ldquo;providing services for schools, teachers, parents, boards and other relevant persons which support them in carrying out their functions in respect of the provision of education&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The centres, therefore, have become major players in the provision of in-career development in the education system.</P>
      <P>Due to the expanding nature and complexity of their role, my Department agreed with the Association of Teacher Education Centres Ireland, ATECI, the representative body for the Education Centre Network, to commission a review of the education centres to clarify their role, functions and developmental potential as a strategic part of the education system nationally, regionally and locally. The Centre for Management Organisation and Development of the Department of Finance was commissioned to undertake the review. This review has been a detailed process including wide-ranging research and consultation with the key stakeholders.</P>
      <P>The recommendations contained in the report are being considered by my Department as part of a comprehensive review of delivery structures for in-career development generally. I have also agreed with the ATECI to set up a consultative process to commence as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>

In the case of autistic children, the circular specifies that five hours resource teaching per week may be allowed. This level of resource teaching has been sanctioned. The child mentioned also has the support of a special needs assistant for the remainder of the school week as well as a number of hours' home tuition.</P>
      <P>A psychologist from the national educational psychological service has, within the past month, observed the child in class and has attended a case conference, involving all those involved in the child's welfare. The conclusion from this case conference is that it is not appropriate to allocate further educational resources to the child at this time.</P>

      <P>The school authorities recently advised my Department that due to declining enrolments, they have been examining various options for the future of the school. The option being considered at present, is the possibility of amalgamation with another local school, with effect from September 2004. I understand that the school authorities have written to parents of pupils in the school advising them of their intentions in this regard.</P>
      <P>A meeting was held recently between the school authorities and my Department officials to explore some of the issues arising. Discussions are at a very early stage and no final decisions have been made. The school authorities have sought the views of the various agencies concerned and when these are received parents will be invited to a meeting to apprise them of the situation.</P>

      <P>There are 3,300 primary schools, each one allowed six days during the current school year in order to facilitate in-service training for teachers in respect of the revised primary curriculum. Under the school development planning initiative all schools have the option of a further day. Due to the scale of the in-service programme it is not possible to reach agreement on in-service days with all schools prior to the commencement of the school year. The training is, however, organised so as to cause as little disruption as possible to the school. Each school is given approximately six weeks notice in relation to closure to allow schools and families make appropriate arrangements. At post-primary it is not necessary to close the school for the purpose of providing in-service training. This is because it is organised on a subject-specific basis.</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for the national educational psychological service, NEPS, conducted a detailed examination of the need for psychological services in primary and post-primary schools. As a result of its findings, it recommended that 200 psychologists would be needed, of whom about 180 would be in NEPS and the remainder elsewhere in the educational system. The planning group also recommended that this target should be achieved over a period of five years, beginning during the school year 1999-00. The Government made a decision in early 1999 that these recommendations should be implemented.</P>
      <P>NEPS has been charged with the responsibility of developing and providing an educational psychological service to primary and post-primary schools. The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 43 psychologists already employed in my Department. NEPS has been expanding gradually on a national basis over the past few years in accordance with the Government's decision. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation in competitions over the last few years through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission and there are now 120 psychologists in NEPS. Recruitment is set to continue until the target number of staff has been achieved.</P>
      <P>During this development phase, those schools that do not yet have direct access to a psychological service from NEPS can avail of the Scheme for Commissioning Private Assessments, SCPA, which NEPS administers, pending the full expansion of the NEPS service to all schools.</P>

      <P>There was a commitment in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to the development of psychological services, including assessment services for those with special needs, for children and young people. The Government began to fulfil this commitment by establishing a national educational psychological service, NEPS, on 1 September 1999.</P>
      <P>The development plan for NEPS provides for a gradual expansion until all schools have access to the service, with a high priority being given to schools serving disadvantaged children. The terms of the Government decision to establish NEPS outlined how this target would be attained over a period of years, with the number of psychologists increasing gradually to 200. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of recruitment competitions for professional staff, the complement of the agency has increased from 43 psychologists on the date of establishment to 120 on 31 January 2003.</P>
      <P>In addition to NEPS staff, there are also a number of other psychologists working in the educational system, bringing the current total to approximately 130. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners have established a panel of suitably qualified psychologists, selected during the most recent recruitment competition for NEPS. It is intended to continue to appoint these psychologists during 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there have been delays in cer<Col N="783" />tain areas of the country in the process of assessing children with special educational needs and I am committed to expediting access to psychological assessments. My Department has, therefore, made funding available for schools to commission assessments from suitably qualified private practitioners, pending the recruitment of the full complement of psychologists to NEPS. NEPS has issued details of how to avail of this scheme to all schools and has also posted them on my Department's website.</P>

I regret that the compilation of the information sought by the Deputy regarding the pupil-teacher ratios at primary and post-primary levels on a county by county basis and in relation to the 20 schools with the best or worst pupil-teacher ratio is such that it would require the diversion of scarce staff resources which could not be justified in such circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 to 170, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently made very difficult choices in the area of public finances. In making these decisions, the Government was not in a position, much as it would have liked, to make as much money available for all programmes as we would all wish to see across the whole range of public expenditure. Consequently, the funding available to my <Col N="791" />Department for the coming year will be less than would have been expected. This does not take from the strong commitment on the part of the Government, as articulated in repeated programmes for Government, to forestry policy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The native woodlands scheme was developed by my Department with a significant input from organisations with an interest in Ireland's native woodlands such as Woodlands of Ireland; Duchas, the heritage service; central and regional fisheries boards, the Heritage Council, COFORD and environmental non-government organisations. The scheme represents a further step in my Department's implementation of the principles of sustainable forest management in Ireland and will serve to enhance the diversity of our woodlands. The scheme will continue to operate in 2003, albeit with a reduced budget.</P>
    <P>The following trees are covered and promoted by the native woodland scheme: alder, silver birch, downy birch, ash, sessile oak, pedunculate oak, scots pine, hazel, hawthorn, spindle, holly, crab apple, aspen, wild cherry, blackthorn, eared willow, goat willow, rusty willow, elder, rowan yew and guelder rose.</P>
    <P>Other native species may also be acceptable on a case-by-case basis after consultation with my Department. It is not intended to expand the species list under the scheme to include trees not native to the island of Ireland as this would be counter to the scheme's basic objective to promote native woodland ecosystems.</P>
    <P>Ireland remains committed to meeting its international obligations. The forestry programme has been identified as having a significant role in the national plans arising from the Kyoto Protocol and the convention on biological diversity.</P>
    <P>The habitats directive is an EU directive which is applicable in Ireland. The native woodlands scheme is one of the elements which may assist in meeting our obligations under the directive.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sports and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. Projects must be directly related to the provision of sports and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature, which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as: expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process; and purchase of permanently based sports equipment, that is, it is securely housed and will remain in use for five years or more.</P>
      <P>In relation to funding for sports equipment, it should be noted that the programme does not assist in the purchase of personal equipment, such as sports kits, gloves, shoes-boots or personal protective clothing etc.</P>

      <P>The proposed introduction of a grade of therapy assistant into the health service was among a number of recommendations contained in the report of the expert group on various health professions. This new grade is intended to complement the roles of the major therapy professions, including speech and language therapy, and its development and introduction will be progressed by my Department as part of the continuing implementation of the expert group report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative will form part of the overall move towards building on skill mix in the health service as set out in the modernisation process for the health service under Sustaining Progress, the proposed new social partnership agreement for 2002 to 2005. As outlined in Sustaining Progress, skill mix is at the core of the requirement for the redesign of jobs, development of new ways of working and the determination of the quality and cost of health care. Enhanced skill mix will benefit patients, empower health personnel to reach <Col N="793" />their full potential, maintain skill levels and also help to secure a more rational utilisation of available healthcare personnel through a close matching of skills to functions and service needs.</P>

      <P>On foot of a Government decision, my Department directed the General Medical Services (Payments) Board to discontinue the practice of reimbursing invalid or ineligible pharmacy claims. This had been identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General as an issue that needs to be addressed urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to implement this decision, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board, in a joint working arrangement with the health boards, is seeking to engage actively and openly with pharmacists as to the best way in which to address this issue on the ground. In cases of genuine difficulty where claimants make an inva<Col N="794" />lid claim or where the claimant's eligibility cannot be identified, it is intended to work closely with all concerned parties to clarify any administrative difficulties surrounding their claims. It is not the intention to permit any individual hardship to arise out of this decision, rather the process is aimed at ensuring that the large number of claims annually which cannot be attributed to a valid GMS or drugs payment scheme entitlement are no longer reimbursed at substantial cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Following a constructive meeting earlier this week between representatives of my Department, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, it is hoped that the IPU will now agree to work in close co-operation with the board and the health boards in addressing all issues relating to incomplete claims in a manner that minimises inconvenience to individual patients.</P>

      <P>The foster care allowance is paid in respect of children who have been taken into the care of the health board under the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991, for their care and protection, and placed in foster care or relative care by the health board in accordance with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995. Foster care is the main form of alternative care for those children who cannot be looked after in their own home. Under the regulations a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to providing funding in recent years to put in place new service developments to meet identified needs in relation to residential, respite, day and other support services, funding has also been provided by my Department to meet identified needs in existing services. These needs arise as a result of the changing profile of persons with an intellectual disability or those with autism in the services, and in particular the residential services, which has resulted in an increasing number of older and medically fragile persons. They would also relate to issues such as underfunding of base budgets, including the need to consolidate elements of services previously funded from sources such as fund-raising. My Department has sought over the years to address these issues as resources have permitted. It was agreed that this process should continue, albeit through new more appropriate mechanisms, as outlined in the reports &ldquo;Enhancing the Partnership&rdquo;, which dealt with the framework supporting the transfer of responsibility for the funding of former direct funded intellectual disability service providers from my Department to the health boards and &ldquo;Widening the Partnership&rdquo; which dealt with the application of that framework to voluntary intellectual disability service providers, such as Co-Action West Cork, funded by the health boards.</P>
      <P>Between 1998 and 2002, additional funding amounting to &euro;27.2 million has been allocated to services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism to meet identified needs in existing services. The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1997 and 2002, an extra &euro;188 million revenue and &euro;139 million capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the <Col N="801" />current year, further additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years. Of this total amount, over &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base. This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, around 1,700 extra residential places have been provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, about 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period from 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of around 2,950 new day places.</P>
    <P>Despite this very significant investment over recent years, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    <P>While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

    <P>The majority of notifications of proposed service changes were noted without change by my <Col N="803" />Department.

    <P>My Department reverted to Bus Éireann when assessment of the relevant private operator appli<Col N="804" />cations were complete and Bus Éireann was then in a position to introduce its proposed service changes or review them in the light of any licence issued to the relevant private operators.</P>

      <P>While Cuba is not a party to the convention, proposals have been received by my Department from the Cuban authorities for the conclusion of an agreement between the two Governments to allow for the transfer of sentenced prisoners.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Crime prevention pays a key role in maintaining the safety of the community. Although its benefits are by their nature difficult to quantify, they include reducing the incidence and human and financial cost of crime and addressing the fear of crime through awareness and practical action. Crime prevention, however, can only be viewed as part of an overall crime strategy involving detection, investigation and prosecution.</P>
      <P>The goals of the Garda Síochána in relation to crime prevention include utilising the latest technology in the fight against crime, promoting the concept of crime prevention through environmental design, identifying new target groups for crime prevention advice and promoting crime prevention and personal protection through the Garda schools programme.</P>
      <P>In rural constituencies such as Donegal North-East, crime prevention is the responsibility of Garda district officers, in co-operation with crime prevention officers and community liaison officers. These officers work with the local community to promote the concept of crime prevention and, more specifically, to develop and strengthen anti-crime prevention partnerships.</P>
      <P>One such partnership of particular relevance to rural communities is the community alert programme, which is part funded by my Department and run in partnership with Muintir na Tíre. Community alert currently consists of over 1,100 schemes, covering almost 250,000 homes. Under current arrangements, a Garda liaison officer attached to each scheme provides detailed information relating to the security of older persons.</P>
      <P>With regard to urban areas, neighbourhood watch has been in operation in Ireland since 1985. There are currently over 2,600 independent schemes countrywide and they provide a sound basis for a partnership between the gardaí and the community, the aim of which is to prevent crime. Neighbourhood watch receives considerable support from the Garda Síochána. The Garda community relations section conducts training seminars for both gardaí and area coordinators as part of their input to neighbourhood watch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that district officers are commencing a process of reviewing the effectiveness of neighbourhood watch schemes, with a view to reactivating dormant or less active schemes, and establishing new schemes if required. In addition, <Col N="808" />the Garda authorities are currently considering the establishment of business watch schemes at each district headquarters. Each district officer has been directed to appoint a liaison officer to discuss the feasibility of this project with the local business community.</P>
    <P>Superintendents in Border districts are promoting the Petrol Retailers Alliance, with the aim of reducing crime at such outlets. District officers are also giving priority to updating the database of vessel registrations as part of the coastal watch scheme. In Donegal, as in other parts of the country, the Garda schools programme endeavours to develop sensible and responsible patterns of behaviour in young people that would empower children in matters of their own safety and their social and legal responsibilities.</P>
    <P>District officers are also responsible for the development of high visibility policing to ensure that there is a continued presence of members on foot patrol.</P>

      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000, provides the key provisions relating to the sale of, provision to and purchase of intoxicating liquor to or by persons under 18 years of age. Part IV of the Act is of particular relevance in this regard. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the sale of, provision to and purchase of <Col N="809" />intoxicating liquor to or by persons under 18 years receives the appropriate Garda attention.</P>
      <P>Section 36 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, places restrictions on persons under 18 years being in off-licenses, and states that a demand made for the production of an age card shall be a defence in any prosecution. I am informed that the national age card office, which forms part of Garda community relations, has fully briefed the National Off-licence Association and other representative bodies on the implications of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999 (S.I. No. 4 of 1999).</P>
      <P>Application forms for the national age card are available at all Garda stations and in other premises that are frequented by the relevant age group of 18 years and over. The application form is also available for access at home on the Garda website www.garda.ie.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no role in the investigation, prosecution or trial of alleged offences, which are matters for the Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts. This is a long standing principle of our system of justice.</P>
      <P>The position is that all licensed premises, whether on-licences or off-licences, have a legal responsibility to ensure that alcohol is not sold or supplied to under-age persons. The current penalty for serving or supplying such an under-age person is closure of the premises for periods of up to seven days for a first offence, and up to 30 days for second and subsequent offences. I am quite prepared to consider making the law even more severe and I will carefully examine any recommendations for legislative changes in this area made by the commission on liquor licensing in its final report which is due next month.</P>

      <Quest>if he is satisfied with the operation of the home bond building guarantee system; his views on whether the system by its nature and course seeks to protect the developer or builder rather than the home owner; if he will consider the establishment of an independent regulatory authority which will enforce building standards and regulations and act in the interests of the home buyer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The homebond scheme is operated by the National House Building Guarantee Scheme Company Limited, which is a private company originally set up by the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Homebuilders Association with the active encouragement of my Department. The operation of the scheme, as such, is however primarily a matter for the company. The homebond scheme provides a guarantee to purchasers of registered new houses against major defects in construction for a period of ten years after completion. In addition, homebond assists the house building industry to improve construction standards through dissemination of advice and guidance. Liability for defects lies in the first instance with the builder. It is only in the event of default by the builder that the homebond guarantee comes into operation.</P>
      <P>As an alternative to the homebond scheme, insurance cover against major construction defects in new houses is now available from at least one insurance company. Compliance with the minimum building standards prescribed by the building regulations 1997 to 2002 is primarily the responsibility of the designer, builder, and owner of the building works involved.</P>
      <P>Under the Building Control Act 1990, local building control authorities have power to enforce the building regulations. In the circumstances, it is not proposed to introduce a regulatory authority along the lines referred to in the question.</P>

      <P>The requirement that women officers of local authorities resign on marriage was removed with effect from 2 August 1973 in accordance with the Local Government (Declaration of Qualifications) Order 1973. There is no provision for reinstatement of former officers in the local authority service. All employments are filled by competition open to anyone who meets the qualifications for the post.</P>
      <P>Women who ceased to hold local authority employment because of marriage, could, subject to certain conditions, qualify for a marriage gratuity. Any such person who subsequently obtained pensionable local authority employment has an entitlement to restore their earlier service for pension purposes by repaying the marriage gratuity.</P>

      <P>It was subsequently decided to proceed with a more limited range of works and a reduced scheme was approved in 1999 within the envelope of the planning permission. These works, which have been part funded by the EU Operational Programme for Tourism and are now completed, comprised a major programme of conservation, adaptation works to the ground floor, the provision of access to the first floor and the provision of an exhibition and reception point.</P>

Following the outcome of this inspection, consideration will then be given to the <Col N="814" />question of providing further grant aid to the organisation.</P>

      <Quest>if supplementary welfare is available to persons who are living on social welfare, whose children need orthodontic treatment, but are unable to obtain same, and who would themselves put up part of the money, but would need assistance to cover the full cost; if supplementary welfare is not available, the reason therefor; and if not, the other options open to such persons.</Quest>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department, provides basic income support for eligible people who have little or no means. The scheme also provides for exceptional needs payments to be made to assist with essential, once-off expenditure in exceptional circumstances. There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payment. Every decision is based on careful consideration of the circumstances of the case taking account of the nature and extent of the need, the availability of an alternative source to meet the need, for example, entitlements from other State agencies, and also takes into account the resources of the household.</P>
      <P>The scheme does not act as a substitute for services which are provided by other State agencies. As orthodontic treatment is a service provided by the Department of Health and Children it does not come within the scope of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>When my Department ceased to accept claims from dentists participating in this dispute in August last, claims continued to be accepted from dentists who were still honouring their contractual obligations to adhere to the then agreed charges.</P>
      <P>The list of dentists participating in the scheme changed frequently during the dispute and was updated regularly. Patients were directed to participating dentists through the LoCall service which was heavily used throughout the dispute. Without the participation of these dentists, insured workers and their spouses would not have had any service during the past six months and I appreciate the service they provided during this period. I do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to publicise at this stage the names of the dentists concerned.</P>

      <P>The legislation governing rent supplements precludes payments being made which relate to the provision of goods or services.

      <P>In the normal course, management charges, which cover services such as gardening, window cleaning and general upkeep, do not qualify for the payment of a rent supplement.</P>

      <Quest>when the decision to eliminate the back to education allowance for postgraduate students was made; when the decision was announced; the reason the decision was taken; the cost to the State of the back to education allowance for postgraduates; and if her attention has been drawn to the hardship this will cause many students.</Quest>

      <P>Following a review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions and, in the light of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, it was decided in the context of preparing the 2003 Estimates, that the schemes should be refocused towards people most at risk and who most need additional training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. On the basis that claimants in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which should impact positively on their employment prospects, it was considered that the focus of the scheme should be on persons in pursuit of courses to primary degree level.</P>
      <P>This decision was known in November 2002, initially in reply to a parliamentary question. The impact of the change was discussed recently with representatives from the Union of Students in Ireland, as were publicity arrangements surrounding this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the present academic year a total of 650 <Col N="816" />participants are availing of the back to education allowance while pursuing postgraduate courses of study at an estimated cost of &euro;4.6 million.</P>
    <P>The changes which have been made will not affect any student currently pursuing a post-graduate course under this scheme. I believe that we have ensured, in a situation where priorities had to be set and choices made, that the portion of people in the greatest need of assistance under the scheme has been protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>Orphan's contributory allowance and orphan's non-contributory pension, paid by my Department, are intended to provide income maintenance for children who satisfy the qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>The current definition of an orphan, which was introduced in 1995, includes children where one or both parents are still alive but have abandoned or refused or failed to provide for them. This approach was seen as a necessary response to changes in social and family circumstances.</P>
      <P>At present orphan's, allowance payments in respect of children in foster care are made from my Department directly to the relevant health board in respect of, and for the benefit of, a child in foster care. The health board then combines the orphan's payment with the foster care allowance which is a health board payment to give a total payment to the foster carer of &euro;281.50 in respect of a child under 12 and &euro;308.50 in respect of a child aged 12 or over.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendation of an interdepartmental working group, and in consultation with the Irish Foster Care Association, the Social Welfare Bill 2003 provides that orphan's contributory allowance and orphan's non-contributory pension will no longer be payable to children in respect of whom foster care allowance is being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This change simply means that health boards will now have full responsibility for supporting children in foster care. Foster carers will, however, continue to receive the same level of payment as before ie. &euro;281.50 or &euro;308.50, but this payment will be made by one agency only namely <Col N="817" />the relevant health board. Orphan's payment's will continue to be made by this Department to orphans who are not in foster care and who meet the qualifications for entitlement.</P>
