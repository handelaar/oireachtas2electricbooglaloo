      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Connolly, Morgan and Ferris. I will call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent national and local concern: the catastrophic effects of the very severe cutbacks in the number of beds being subvented in the Cavan-Monaghan area &ndash; the number is to be reduced from 240 to 180; the effect of this on the ageing Cavan-Monaghan population; the fact that a 99 year old resident has been placed on a waiting list for a nursing home subvention; and the reduction of 88,000 hours of home help in the North Eastern Health Board area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following specific and important matter of public interest: that the consequences of the Hanly report will be catastrophic to the ability of those living in County Louth to access proper medical care; that the report, if implemented, will mean the further downgrading of Louth County Hospital and, particularly, the closure of accident and emergency services; that due to the population figures of 345,000 in the North Eastern Health Board area the residents of County Louth face the prospect of having to travel to Cavan General Hospital for treatment; and the necessity to ensure all citizens have access to full, proper, medical services and do not face discrimination on the basis of their geographical location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek leave to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the plight of the fishermen of the Irish Sea and the need for the authorities on both parts of the island and in Britain to plan a co-ordinated approach involving the fishermen and taking into account the fact <Col N="1126" /> that the scientific data responsible for the current conservation plans are called into question by fishermen who claim that stocking levels are far higher than officially reported.</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste propose to introduce an order in the House which will provide for the equivalent of a loss of 1,600 junior hospital doctors, effective from August next year under the working time directive? We are told this poses a huge threat to hospital services and that the Minister for Finance has indicated that no significant new money will be available next year to address any of these problems. Will the <Col N="1127" /> Tánaiste be bringing forward such an order? Having employed 30,000 extra people in the health service over the last five years, why has the Government not addressed any of the serious staffing issues in relation to an order about which she knew since the mid-1990s?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have. As public sector workers have been receiving lectures from the Tánaiste and the Progressive Democrats about greater productivity, does she not accept that her words sound hollow now that she and the Taoiseach intend to close down this House for a week after only 12 sitting days since the summer break? Would it not be better for the House to sit during that week to discuss the Hanly report and the report of the National Cancer Registry and begin to deal with the backlog of 111 pieces of promised legislation, 17 of which are now printed in the form of Bills but have not been debated in the House? Does the Tánaiste not consider this to be gross inefficiency on the part of the Government? She is in no position to lecture anyone on greater productivity when she is responsible for the inefficiencies of the House regarding our work on the health service and the other areas which require legislation.</P>

      <P>No. The House is not required to approve the Order of Business. It is the Taoiseach's prerogative to announce Government business and make proposals as to the arrangements for taking it.

      <P>This morning there are no proposals to be put to the House. Therefore, we are taking the Order of Business in the ordinary way. Deputy Richard Bruton was first and Deputy McManus was second. Deputy Gormley may be next if he has something to say which is relevant to the question before the House. If not, we will move on to Deputy Ó Caoláin.

      <P>Legislation is not required specifically in relation to the Hanly report. However, the Government's reform agenda on health does require legislation, and this legislation is being prepared. I understand it will be brought before the House early next year. I also understand the Whips agreed last night to debate the Hanly report in the week beginning 11 November. However, I note that, before even reading the report, the Deputies opposite seemed to pin their colours to the mast out on the plinth yesterday afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to advise the House that I am a member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants. I am pleased to bring this Bill before the Dáil. Before outlining its content, it should be recalled that it was initiated in the Seanad on 14 February 2003 and completed all stages on 29 May. There were a number of amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad and these are contained in the text of the present Bill. I propose to refer to the principal amendments in the course of this presentation.</P>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge the many insightful, constructive and useful ideas which Senators contributed in the course of the Seanad debates on the Bill. They were helpful to my reconsideration of the Bill and provided some fresh perspectives on a number of its draft provisions. I regret that scheduling logistics did not allow me to translate several of these into amendments of that House. They did, however, facilitate a further more comprehensive and enhanced examination of the measure on my part and, indeed, by my officials in the period since then. For that the Senators have my thanks.</P>
      <P>The observations and proposals made by Senators were augmented by a sizeable number of submissions, 50 or so, received from various interested parties. We have done our best to digest this substantial quantity of material and to distil the wisdom, insight and technical improvements it contains and, along with other improvements of our own devising, put them into suitable form to be proposed as amendments on Committee Stage in this House. It was obviously not possible to accommodate all of the requests for amendment contained in the submissions for varying reasons. Some, for example, were simply considered unworkable or unfeasible while others would have delayed progress on the Bill to an unacceptable extent because of the work which they would have entailed. However, all were examined and some will be borne in mind for possible inclusion in future legislation.</P>
      <P>One of the latter categories to which I wish to make specific reference is that of legal protection for the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. This is an issue which would benefit from some further consideration and research and I will request the supervisory authority, when statutorily established, to examine the issue in detail and report back to me when it has completed its deliberations. In that context, I wish to take this opportunity to exhort members of recognised bodies to emphasise their membership of these bodies on all appropriate occasions, as well as the protection which that affords to those to whom they proffer their services. Recognised bodies could usefully promote themselves in a similar way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my presentation I intend to <Col N="1141" /> give an indication of the more significant areas in which I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage. Deputies will appreciate that it is not appropriate either to attempt to encompass all amendments which will be brought forward or to have a detailed discussion now on the more significant ones. That is for the later stages of the House's consideration of the measure. I look forward to a constructive and informative debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The origins of the Bill can be traced back to the report of the Committee of Public Accounts of December 1999 which recommended, among other things, that the Minister and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment establish a review group to examine in detail a number of matters, including auditor independence, the auditing of financial institutions and the role of the external auditor in ensuring statutory compliance. That same month, having considered the recommendations of the committee, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, decided to establish a review group on auditing with 12 terms of reference. Besides dealing with all of the issues suggested by the Committee of Public Accounts, two of the terms of reference were new and dealt with self regulation in the auditing profession. In summary, the review group was asked to examine the following principal issues: self regulation in the auditing profession; auditor independence; the auditing of financial institutions; and the role of the auditor in ensuring compliance with statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>The review group had its first meeting on 23 February 2000 and concluded its deliberations by the end of June 2000. The group was chaired by Senator Joe O'Toole. The final report of the review group was presented to the Committee of Public Accounts on 11 July 2000 and was further discussed at that committee on 28 November 2000. I would like to place on the record of this House the Government's appreciation for the professionalism and dedication with which the review group addressed its task and the scope, quality and timeliness of the report which it produced. The members of the review group, chaired as I have already mentioned by Senator O'Toole, are to be congratulated on its achievements. The report of the review group contains some 80 recommendations covering all aspects of the matters under review. I would like to clarify at this point that those recommendations of the review group that relate specifically to financial institutions will be dealt with by the Minister for Finance in the context of further legislation that he will be introducing regarding the new Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</P>
    <P>Following a public consultation on the report and its recommendations, the Government endorsed the report and also approved the establishment on an interim basis of the new oversight board recommended by the review group, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, primarily for the purpose of advising the <Col N="1142" /> Minister and her Department on the implementation of the recommendations in the report. The recommendations contained in the report of the review group have provided the blueprint for the legislation before the House today. Its evaluations and recommendations underlie the Bill and, in what I hope is a schematic way, provide for a new regime in the auditing and accounting area which clarifies and, where it was felt appropriate, redefines the roles of the various parties involved in those processes.</P>
    <P>At the time when that blueprint was developed, those concepts and solutions were particularly novel and pioneering, and, depending on the perspective of the commentator, some might have said audacious and unwarranted. The latter comments would arise from the fact that the proposals themselves and the thinking behind them were not in vogue elsewhere at the time. However, some time after the recommendations of the review group had been placed in the public domain, several financial crashes occurred in international business, most notably Enron and WorldCom, because of issues including compliance failure and supervision. Those collapses focused attention in jurisdictions worldwide on those subjects, and indeed many of the administrators in those countries, charged with the task of developing governance systems aimed at preventing a recurrence of those situations, looked for guidance to the work which had been going on here, especially the report of the review group on auditing.</P>
    <P>Obviously it has been necessary to transform the recommendations of the review group into draft legislation, and that required time, but it is probably fair to say that the road map devised should ensure that Ireland will remain at the forefront of prudential initiatives in the commercial arena. That is imperative if we are to maintain international confidence in Ireland as a place in which to invest and do business.</P>
    <P>I will give a very brief summary of the legislation which I am bringing before the Dáil to try to convey an overall sense of what is proposed. One of the Bill's key features is the proposed establishment of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, or IAASA. The authority will have a wide range of oversight functions regarding accountancy bodies, as well as, for example, examining the accounts of defined companies for compliance with the Companies Acts. In the case of prescribed accountancy representative bodies, certain aspects of the disciplinary procedures operated by them in respect of their members are to be given statutory underpinning.</P>
    <P>Existing controls on auditors are being enhanced, and they will be subject to new audit-related requirements. Other procedures are being put in place which are designed to ensure that auditors are genuinely independent of those companies whose accounts they audit. There will be greater strictures and impositions on companies themselves regarding the preparation of accounts. Moreover, directors of companies are being <Col N="1143" /> required to confirm their company's compliance with all statutory obligations relevant to it, not just those arising in company law. The company's auditor is to vet that statement. I will return to that issue later.</P>
    <P>One hopes that it will be clear from this compressed account of what is proposed that an interplay between the relevant parties is provided for, based on their respective roles. The legislation strives for a balance between objectives of unduly high standards and those pitched at a very low level, and indeed, in the apportionment of new responsibilities between the various parties involved in corporate governance.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the provisions of the Bill and explain in greater detail what each is designed to achieve. Obviously this is not intended as an exhaustive account of the contents of each section, but one hopes that it will give a feel for the essence of the provision. Part 1 of the Bill contains some preliminary technical matters. In that regard, the first three sections contain provisions that are found in most Bills where there is existing legislation. In this instance, it sets out how the Bill will relate to the existing Companies Acts. Part 2 of the Bill contains the provisions dealing with the establishment of the new authority, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.</P>
    <P>In summary, this new body will take over certain functions relating to the granting of recognition to bodies of accountants under section 191 of the Companies Act 1990, which forms the basis for the supervision and regulation of auditors. Additionally, the IAASA will have the power, among other things, to: intervene in the disciplinary processes of the accountancy bodies where it deems it necessary; carry out independent investigations of possible breaches of standards of prescribed accountancy bodies by their members; and apply to the courts to compel directors of a company to amend accounts that are not in compliance with the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>The establishment, powers, functions, <i>modus operandi</i> and practical aspects of the functioning of the supervisory authority are provided for in the sections which follow. Section 4 contains interpretations used in Part 2. Of particular interest are the definitions of &ldquo;designated body&rdquo; in the context of bodies that will nominate persons to be directors of the new supervisory authority. &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; accountancy bodies include &ldquo;recognised&rdquo; accountancy bodies, which already has a particular meaning in the Companies Acts and is the basis on which members of such bodies can act as auditors. Section 5 deals with the manner in which it is proposed that the new supervisory authority will be established. Under that section the Minister will be empowered to designate a company incorporated as a public company limited by guarantee to be the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the membership of the supervisory authority. Subsection (1) provides <Col N="1144" /> that each of the prescribed accountancy bodies will be a member, as well as designated bodies. Subsection (2) identifies those designated bodies. In that regard, it will be noted that various parties interested in accounts and auditing matters will be members. By way of amendment in the Seanad, the Law Society was added to the list of designated bodies. I wish to draw particular attention to the fact that section 46(1)(<i>a</i>) enables the Minister to prescribe any other body that may subsequently be identified as having an interest in the area to be a member of the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>As the supervisory authority is being set up as a company limited by guarantee, it will have to have a memorandum of association and articles of association. Section 7 provides that, following the incorporation of the company, any subsequent amendments to the memorandum or articles of association can take effect only with the Minister's prior approval.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the principal objects of the supervisory authority. Those will have to be enshrined in the memorandum of association of the authority. The objects are: to supervise how prescribed accountancy bodies regulate and monitor their members; to provide for adherence to high professional standards in the auditing and accounting profession; to monitor whether the accounts of certain classes of companies and other undertakings comply with the Companies Acts; and to act as a specialist source of advice to the Minister on auditing and accounting matters.</P>
    <P>Section 9 sets out the main functions to be discharged by the supervisory authority. In that regard, the functions will include certain matters relating to the recognition of bodies of accountants which up to now have been undertaken by the Minister. Deputies will see that the section also makes provision for: the approval of the constitution and by-laws of each of the prescribed accountancy bodies; the ability to undertake investigations into prescribed accountancy bodies; monitoring the effectiveness of provisions of the Companies Acts; co-operation with prescribed accountancy bodies and other interested parties in developing auditing and accounting standards and practice notes; and reviewing whether the accounts of companies and other undertakings referred to in section 26 comply with the Companies Acts and, where that does not turn out to be the case, to seek High Court directions to secure compliance.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill empowers the supervisory authority to carry out its functions and, where necessary, to adopt rules and issue guidelines concerning any matters that relate to its functions or powers. In addition, subsection (4) of that section enables the supervisory authority to apply to the High Court for an order compelling a prescribed accountancy body to comply with a rule adopted or a guideline issued by the supervisory authority. Section 11 deals with the appointment of directors of the supervisory authority by the Minister. In that regard, and arising from changes which I <Col N="1145" /> brought forward in the Seanad to deal with concerns in some quarters about the perceived underrepresentation of accountants at board level, there will now be 14 directors appointed by the Minister, nine of whom will be nominees of the list of designated bodies at section 6(2) with the chief executive officer holding his or her directorship <i>ex officio.</i>To ensure the independence of the new supervisory authority, no more than four of the directors appointed by the Minister may be members of prescribed accountancy bodies. Three may come from the accountancy bodies and one of the nominees of the designated bodies may also be an accountant. There is no restriction of that sort regarding the chief executive officer. The outcome, therefore, is one of enhanced board representation for members of prescribed accountancy bodies of up to five directors.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published, there were differing schools of thought as to the appropriate level of representation by accountants on the board of the supervisory authority. Some considered that the original apportionment was just about right, while others disagreed. I deliberated at some length and with considerable care before altering the permissible level of representation by accountants. The formula which I devised in so doing was designed to achieve what I am convinced is a fair, realistic and equitable balance in terms of overall representation on the board. I am still of that view.</P>
    <P>The number of directors can be altered by means of a ministerial regulation under section 46(1), as a consequence of changes made in respect of prescribed or designated bodies. Moreover, while enjoying the right of nomination of directors, the members of the body, unlike the position in a normal company, are not permitted to instruct directors in the discharge of their duties as directors of the supervisory authority. This is designed to secure the independence of the authority. The term of office of a director will be not less than three years and not more than five years. It will be possible to re-appoint directors.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the appointment of the chief executive officer to the new authority and also sets out in summary what will be his or her functions. Essentially, these are to carry on, manage and control generally the administration and business of the supervisory authority as well as performing any other functions determined by the board. The chief executive officer will hold office on terms and conditions approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance. If the chief executive officer is to be removed, the board of directors will take that decision.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the work programme of the supervisory authority. The authority is required to draw up and submit a work programme setting out its strategies, planned activities and intended outputs for a three-year period. This will also give information on the staff and <Col N="1146" /> resources required, including an annual programme of expenditure. As it is intended that the authority will be funded by the State and the accountancy bodies, the Minister will consult the prescribed accountancy bodies before approving the annual programme of expenditure. Provision is also made to ensure that the work programme is laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than 60 days after the date on which it is submitted to the Minister. It is worth noting that subsection (10) provides that the Minister may not give directions concerning the discharge of a work programme or, if it arises, of any amended or supplementary programme.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the funding of the supervisory authority. The authority will be funded by the State and the prescribed accountancy bodies. The review group on auditing recommended that the split should be 40% from the State and 60% from the accountancy bodies and that is the basis on which section 14 has been drafted. In acknowledgement of the financial contribution of the prescribed accountancy bodies to the funding of the supervisory authority, an amendment was made on Committee Stage in the Seanad requiring the Minister to consult with them before agreeing to the imposition of a levy under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the establishment by the supervisory authority of a reserve fund exclusively for the purposes of carrying out investigations under section 24 or conducting reviews of whether accounts of companies that fall within the scope of section 26 comply with the Companies Acts. It is difficult to estimate in advance the likely nature, extent and cost of recourse to these provisions and, in particular, those relating to investigations under section 24. However, it is absolutely imperative that when such issues arise, they can be examined immediately and that the absence of funding does not delay IAASA taking appropriate action. This is the basis for the development of a reserve fund, as provided for in section 15.</P>
    <P>The second of the functions in respect of which the reserve fund is being developed is to enable the accounts of certain companies to be examined for compliance with the Companies Acts. The provision will apply to all public limited companies, other than those used as investment vehicles by the financial services industry, and certain private companies or undertakings which meet a threshold of a &euro;25 million balance sheet total and a turnover of &euro;50 million. In the circumstances, it is considered reasonable to impose a levy on such companies to fund this aspect of the supervisory authority's activities. However, before any levy is imposed, the authority will have to establish criteria and submit them to the Minister for approval.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is in the nature of good housekeeping and simply provides that any excess revenue will be carried forward by the authority from one year to the next.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the engagement of staff by the authority and makes it clear that advisers <Col N="1147" /> can be engaged, if necessary or appropriate, to assist it to discharge its functions. Sections 18 and 19 provide for the disclosure of interests by directors and staff of the authority and will ensure that conflicts of interests will be avoided. Section 20 will enable the authority to establish appropriate superannuation arrangements for the chief executive officer and the staff of the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 21 obliges the supervisory authority to prepare accounts and submit these for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also requires that the Minister lay copies of the accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report before the Houses of the Oireachtas and provide them to the accountancy bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 22 requires that an annual report on its activities be submitted by the supervisory authority to the Minister and that that report should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of the year-end. It also contains provisions that would require the chairman and the chief executive to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee of the Oireachtas to account for the performance of the functions and exercise of the powers of the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 23 empowers the authority to intervene in respect of the investigation and disciplinary process of a prescribed accountancy body to ensure that it has complied with such procedures approved under section 9(2)(<i>c</i>). Depending on the outcome, the supervisory authority is given the power to advise, admonish or censure the prescribed accountancy body. Provision is also made for the publication of decisions of the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 24 empowers the supervisory authority, where it considers it appropriate or in the public interest, to investigate the possible breach of a prescribed accountancy body's standards by a member. The section contains the necessary powers to facilitate such an investigation by the supervisory authority, including requiring the production of documents, the attendance of relevant persons before it and the power to certify cases where relevant persons have refused to cooperate with an investigation by the authority to the court, with a view to the court determining the extent to which they should co-operate with the authority. Appropriate appeal mechanisms are also built into the section.</P>
    <P>Section 25 allows the supervisory authority to undertake a review of how the members of recognised bodies are being regulated. Under section 26, the supervisory authority will be exercising a role other than supervising the activities of prescribed accountancy bodies. Under its provisions, the authority will be able to examine the annual accounts of companies falling within the definition of relevant undertakings. Essentially, these are: public limited companies, other than investment companies; large private companies; and unlimited companies and partnerships, all of whose members have effective limited liability <Col N="1148" /> and which were brought within the requirements to prepare and submit accounts to the Companies Registration Office under the EU regulations of 1993.</P>
    <P>Arising from its examination, the supervisory authority would send a notice to the directors of the companies specifying the manner in which the accounts were considered to be defective and seeking to have them brought into compliance. Failure to comply with such a direction could result in the supervisory authority bringing the matters before the courts, seeking to have an order made directing that the accounts be brought into compliance with the Companies Acts. The section also provides that, subject to any more specific directions that may be applied by the court, any provision of the Companies Acts relating to the preparation, auditing and disclosure of annual accounts applies, with the necessary modifications, to the revised accounts.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is in the nature of housekeeping to enable the authority to delegate its functions to a committee of its directors, employees or professional or other advisers, as it considers necessary or appropriate. This provision is particularly important in the context of the authority having available to it the requisite expertise when reviewing the compliance of accounts with the Companies Acts under section 26.</P>
    <P>Section 28 sets out the procedures when the authority, or parties subject to rulings by it, need to bring matters specified in the section before the court for determination. In particular, it will be noted that court confirmation is necessary before any monetary fine imposed by the supervisory authority takes effect. Section 29 provides for the recognition of the supervisory authority's seal and instruments in any court processes.</P>
    <P>Section 30 deals with the issue of confidentiality of information obtained by the authority. It also sets out the specific bodies to which information can be communicated where the authority believes the information is connected to the functions of the body to which the disclosure is made.</P>
    <P>Section 31 deals with the transfer of functions to the authority. These are set out in the Schedule to the Bill and include the recognition of a body of accountants for the purposes of its members being able to act as auditors. The section also deals with the continued recognition of an existing recognised body of accountants for the purposes of its members, who are appropriately qualified, being authorised to act as auditors.</P>
    <P>Arising from judicial proceedings taken against the Minister in respect of the recognition of the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants in 1996, subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this section provide that the institute must apply to the supervisory authority for recognition, as soon as is reasonably practicable, after the commencement of the section. In the meantime, however, persons who are members of that body and who were authorised to act as auditors will be able to continue to act in this capacity. I intend to introduce some adjustments to these subsections on Com<Col N="1149" /> mittee Stage to take account of other elements of the settlement of the judicial proceedings to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>Section 32 is designed to protect the supervisory authority and any of its members, directors or employees from any liability for damages for anything done or omitted to be done, unless the act or omission is shown to have been done in bad faith, and includes the authority indemnifying members, directors, officers and employees in carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill contains a number of provisions which, having regard to the future consolidation of the Companies Acts, as recommended by the company law review group, primarily amend provisions of Part X of the Companies Act 1990 which deals with auditing matters. While some of the amendments are essentially implementing recommendations of the audit review group, others are inserting into primary company law provisions that were already introduced by way of the Companies Act 1990 (Auditors) Regulations 1992 &ndash; SI 259 of 1992 &ndash; which are then being revoked.</P>
    <P>The first of these amendments, section 33, inserts a number of definitions into section 182 of the 1990 Act. These definitions are of terms subsequently used in a number of the new provisions being inserted into the said Part X. I draw attention in particular to the definition of &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo;, which covers relationships an auditor may have with individuals or firms.</P>
    <P>Section 34(<i>a</i>) implements in primary law some of the provisions of the 1992 regulations which were designed to facilitate the manner in which recognised accountancy bodies regulate their auditor members. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of this section adds to the provisions of section 187 that specify circumstances where a person is not qualified to act as auditor of a company. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) is in the nature of a transitional provision. Under it, persons who hold individual authorisations to act as auditors will have a three-year period during which they have to become a member of, or become subject to, the regulation of a recognised body of accountants, or cease to be qualified for appointment to act as an auditor under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is designed to give statutory backing to the disciplinary procedures of prescribed accountancy bodies. Members of such bodies are already subject to such arrangements, but they did not have such statutory backing as is now proposed. The provisions contain the usual checks and balances and, where necessary, matters can be appealed to the courts for final determination. I should say that arising from submissions I have received from the accountancy bodies and amendments which were tabled in the Seanad, it is likely that I will be bringing forward some amendments to this section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 36 implements the recommendations of the audit review group that persons should not act, advertise themselves or hold themselves out as being able to audit, unless they comply with <Col N="1150" /> the requirements of the Act. I am reviewing the draft provisions that enable the Director of Corporate Enforcement to apply to the High Court to have a person's name removed from the register of auditors and it is likely that I will be bringing forward amendments regarding this aspect of the section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 37 contains a number of specific technical amendments designed to update section 199 of the 1990 Act, having regard to the new approval mechanisms that are being put in place, namely, the supervisory authority rather than the Minister will be the authority recognising bodies of accountants in the future. It also updates the notification procedures and the manner in which information is to be forwarded to the CRO, as had been provided for in the 1992 audit regulations. Section 38 makes similar adjustments to section 200 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>The background to section 39 is as follows. At present, the Companies Acts require that when a company prepares accounts these must give a &ldquo;true and fair view&rdquo; of the financial state of the company. There is no specific obligation in law to say that accounts had to be prepared in accordance with accounting standards. Section 39 now introduces such an obligation. It is important to note that the accounting standards that are applicable to a company are those that are relevant to its circumstances and its annual accounts. This means that some accounting standards will not be relevant to some companies.</P>
    <P>Section 40 introduces a requirement for the establishment of audit committees by certain companies. Under subsection (2), the obligation to establish such a committee will apply to the board of directors of all public limited companies, other than investment companies. As regards the directors of large private companies and relevant undertakings as defined, the obligation under subsection (3) is to establish an audit committee that meets the requirements of the section or to state in the annual directors' report that they have decided not to do so and explain the reasons for that decision. In other words, there is no mandatory obligation on large private companies or on other relevant undertakings that meet the turnover and balance sheet totals of &euro;50 million and &euro;25 million, respectively, to establish audit committees. However, where they decide not to do so they are required to say why they made such a decision.</P>
    <P>The section also contains the matters that the audit committee should deal with in the company. The composition of the audit committee is stipulated, and is essentially designed to ensure that it is an independent committee. This accords with international best practice. This section attracted significant comment and debate in the Seanad and I undertook in that House to look at and further reflect on the provision in light of the discussion. I have considered the provision as a whole and its various elements in detail during the intervening period, and placed in the balance the clear and comprehensive nature of the recom<Col N="1151" /> mendations of the review group on auditing on the one hand, and some of the observations from Senators and submissions to me on the other. Based on this exercise, I will be proposing certain amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 41 introduces for the first time in statute law a requirement for companies to disclose the accounting policies that are adopted in determining in particular the amounts included in the balance sheet and profit and loss account.</P>
    <P>Section 43 introduces an obligation on directors of a company to prepare a compliance statement concerning the company's policies respecting compliance with its obligations under company law, tax law or any other statutory law which would have a material impact on the company's financial statement. It also introduces an obligation that these be in writing, be approved by the board of directors and be reviewed every three years.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (4), the directors are obligated to include information in their annual report that they are responsible for securing the company's compliance with their relevant obligations, what procedures they have in place to achieve such compliance, and confirm that they have, where necessary, reviewed the procedures. Under subsection (5), the directors are required to give their opinion regarding compliance with their obligations.</P>

      <P>Section 205(F), also being inserted by section 43 into the Companies Act 1990, requires the auditors of a company to give their opinion on the directors' compliance statement and, in circumstances where the directors have failed to prepare such a compliance statement report that matter to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has attracted a significant amount of attention in written submissions that I have received from interested parties, in the media and in the passage of the Bill through the Seanad. I have been reflecting on the various concerns and criticisms made and voiced, some of which appeared, either intentionally or through misreading of the provision, to have completely missed the point that the section is designed to address, which is that directors have to satisfy themselves that they know what their company's obligations are, have in place procedures designed to secure compliance and give their opinion regarding compliance with these obligations. These requirements are entirely reasonable and should not create difficulties for directors who are committed to due diligence in the execution of their duties as directors, and this fact has been acknowledged in many quarters. It is <Col N="1152" /> neither the intention nor in my view, the effect, of these provisions to impose draconian requirements on company directors, as some would seek to suggest. Notwithstanding this, I have re-examined the section and the proposed scope of its application, and I expect to bring forward some amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 44 seeks to address a particular problem that has arisen with section 127 of the Companies Act 1963 as inserted by section 60 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. Essentially, the provision has the effect of confirming that, where a company makes an annual return on a date prior to its existing annual return date, the anniversary of this new earlier date will be the new annual return date, unless the company opts to retain its previous return date or otherwise establishes a new return date under section 127(9) of that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 45 is designed to ensure that for private non-profit making companies that at present do not have to submit any accounting information with their annual return, in future the auditor's report on the annual accounts which has still to be prepared by the company will be submitted to the CRO. This is already the case in respect of public companies not trading for profit or charitable companies.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill contains six sections. The first three of these relate to the powers of the Minister to make regulations regarding matters referred to in earlier provisions of the Bill. These include the prescribing of bodies of accountants and designated bodies, as well as varying monetary amounts in particular circumstances, for example, threshold levels which trigger particular requirements or levels of financial sanctions. In addition, paragraph (<i>j</i>) is designed to enable the Minister to exempt certain classes of companies and other undertakings from specific provisions in circumstances where, and to the extent that, they are otherwise regulated. This will apply in particular to entities that are used by the financial services industry and are subject to regulation by the Central Bank. As I have already said in the Seanad, it is my intention to make such a regulation exempting investment companies used by the financial services funds industry from the seven sections specified at paragraph (<i>j</i>) at the same time as these sections are being commenced. It is also my intention to undo four of the provisions from &ldquo;qualifying companies&rdquo; within the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 49 amends the Company Law Enforcement Act to enable the Director of Corporate Enforcement to act as a member of the new supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 50 is designed to ensure that where the supervisory authority engages in its activities and issues reports and summaries of decisions and directions, these will have the protection of qualified privilege, providing they otherwise meet the provisions of the Defamation Act. Section 51 revokes the 1992 auditors regulations. These have <Col N="1153" /> now been incorporated into Part X of the Companies Act 1990, as I described earlier.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given a reasonable picture of the background to and content of the provisions of the Bill and I thank the House for its co-operation in arranging this debate. I look forward to the contributions of Deputies and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his exhaustive statement on the sections of the Bill arising from the Seanad debate. Some areas were debated extensively in the Upper House and Senators took their business very seriously in going through this important Bill.</P>
      <P>The accountancy profession, of which the Minister of State is an esteemed member, has suffered major blows to its confidence and public esteem in recent years. This started with the beef tribunal report that exposed issues which were unsavoury to the public interest. I am starting from the point of view that auditors are there to protect shareholders and the public interest and the auditing profession has a major responsibility to guarantee its objectives are upheld. Reports emanating from the various tribunals indicate that there were deficiencies in law, which allowed certain practices to develop which were not in the interests of shareholders or taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The audit review group chaired by Senator Joe O'Toole did an excellent job in identifying best practice not only in the neighbouring jurisdiction but around the world to determine the practices which could be implemented to improve the regime here. This occurred because of issues arising during the beef tribunal, the parliamentary DIRT inquiry, the McCracken tribunal as well as other practices which were brought to the attention of Parliament as a result of other reviews. These practices had to be tidied up. When citizens trust a profession to uphold the highest standards, all that parliamentarians can do is to create the conditions in and rules by which that can happen. There is an onus on individual accountants and companies to ensure that the highest possible standards are met. If those standards become lax over a period of time it does not give a country a good name.</P>
      <P>The report of the audit review group took a considerable length of time to produce and considerable time has also passed between the report's publication and this debate, in which we are proposing the necessary changes. Those changes will ensure that our country can hold its head high because we will have good practices, good standards of shareholder protection and good standards of auditing that will protect the taxpayer from wilful neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Upon examining the Bill, one cannot avoid the sense that this could constitute an avoidable bureaucracy that will solely benefit professions and civil servants, while costing businesses money, time and effort. It accompanies a large body of company law, ethics legislation, existing criminal law and regulatory standards and it is <Col N="1154" /> hard to understand the purpose of setting up another statutory body. We have already set up the offices of the Competition Authority and the Director of Corporate Enforcement, so why do we have to set up another supervisory body? We should debate that point on Committee Stage. Is this just another strategy to beat and cajole Irish limited companies, public and private, from corner shop upwards, into ensuring corporation malfeasance does not take place? If so, it could be interpreted as going a little too far. If not, and if the Bill is attempting to address &ldquo;Enronitis&rdquo; it is already a bit late, given the impact it has already had on PLCs.</P>
    <P>Although this will have an impact on large private companies, the reality is that in the wake of the global downturn and stock exchange investigations in New York, PLCs have had to implement wholesale reviews to protect their market capitalisation. They have probably gone further than any statutory obligation, because of the exposure of WorldCom, Enron and Tyco, than any legislation. If people want to get around the rules they will do so, and that will always be a temptation. The issues exposed by tribunals in Ireland and through companies hitting the headlines elsewhere go further than any legislation can go.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the fact that one of the biggest losers in this episode was an Irish company, Elan, will ensure a level of internal corporate enforcement that legislation could not achieve. Corporate culture is more malleable than the legal framework around it and a Minister responsible for both jobs and businesses should understand that an editorial in the <i>Financial Times</i> is often far worse for a share than the huffing and puffing of an inspector's report. Nevertheless, we need basic rules of protection regarding the issues I raised earlier.</P>
    <P>If companies are already widely regulated and have large legal and ethical obligations under health and safety provisions as well as environmental and fiscal legislation, not to mention existing company and commercial law, why should they have any problems complying with this Bill? The answer is that nothing is free and the office has to be funded. Professional services like auditors, solicitors, engineers and planners have to be engaged, new standards of documentation must be maintained, an extra head-count is incurred, product and service portfolios are impinged upon, insurance is hiked and the board of management and directors are implicated. In brief, it will cost a lot of private capital to implement this Act's provisions at a time when there is a downturn in the economy and to bring a statutory regime to a situation the market probably arrived at culturally 18 months ago. Is it necessary to have another regulator? </P>
    <P>Many regulators have been established recently and there is a lot of empire-building going on in regulatory authorities. Those authorities could be housed in one body to deal with cross-cutting issues. There could be common legal depart<Col N="1155" /> ments, common investigative departments and common inspectorates for the authorities set up to deal with taxis, airlines, financial services and, now, the accountancy profession. This should be examined in the context of an overall competition and regulatory authority. We do not need empire-building to resolve these issues, particularly new empire-building with IAASA.</P>
    <P>We should encourage questions as to what level of regulation assists business, investment and new entrants setting up, and what level of regulation works against them. An examination of the Bill shows there are positive elements that can be isolated but these could be brought within the remit of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and I am interested in the Minister of State's response to this. The Bill provides ample opportunity for Government to drive efficiencies within its own bodies and the idea of further levies on the private sector or the tax-payer to fund IAASA is possibly unnecessary. There is no reason to have the Competition Authority, the ODCE and the IAASA as stand-alone bodies when both operational efficiencies and effectiveness could be improved by having one overarching body with a clear concise remit,</P>
    <P>This Bill is a compromise. There was much debate on whether one wanted totally independent regulation by the State or whether self-regulation should continue, albeit supervised by IAASA. That goes to the heart of the Bill. I am prepared to give the Minister of State's proposal a chance on the basis of a number of measures dealing with IAASA's powers in the legislation. It will be empowered to intervene in the disciplinary practice of accountancy bodies where it deems it necessary and carry out independent investigations of possible breaches of standards of prescribed bodies or their members and apply to the courts to compel directors of a company to amend accounts not in compliance with the Companies Acts. That is an important power.</P>
    <P>That the work programme of the new body will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on an annual basis under section 13 is important. The chairman and the chief executive of IAASA will be required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts under section 22. That is also an important provision. These provisions alone give me comfort that if the system of supervised self-regulation does not work, it will become apparent after a while, in terms of investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts and examination of annual reports, and the issue can be revisited in the future.</P>
    <P>The composition of IAASA will be crucial to its success. It must be seen to be operating in a genuinely independent way in the conduct of its supervisory function. Section 11 deals with the directors of the supervisory body and there is the issue of the number of directors from various bodies who should be members thereof. Representations have been made in respect of the 13 positions on the body to ascertain who should be <Col N="1156" /> nominated to it, what level of representation the prescribed bodies should have and what level of expertise the body should have. Three nominations from the designated accountancy bodies have been proposed &ndash; two or three are the numbers that have been mentioned. Business representation and expertise that can only come through the accountancy profession and financial directors of companies should be brought to the fore in the nomination process that, ultimately, will have to be brought into play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State has said he is taking account of the representations that have been made in that respect.</P>
      <P>Section 11 states that eight of the directors will be nominees of the designated bodies in terms of the social partners and so on, one will be the chief executive officer of IAASA and this will leave four open ministerial nominees. It is important that there is consumer, academic and small business representation on the body. Perhaps we should not amend this section but rather leave future Ministers with the flexibility to ensure that these needs are met.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is welcome. The Government is concerned that auditors can offer a mix of services in terms of audit and management consultancy and can earn more than they classically would have done from audit, hence allowing the perception to arise post-Enron that they have gone soft on top clients. There may or may not be some truth in this, but it ignores some key global changes that have taken place following the settlement of the Andersen Consulting legal case that ran from 1989 to 1992. These huge accountancy firms have not only had an IPO but they have also tended to spin-off or sell off their management consultancy division. For example, Arthur Andersen management consultancy limps along, but it is unique in so far as its audit section was the worst affected. Ernst &amp; Young sold its management consultancy to Cap Gemini, KPMG has spun off as Bearing Point and PricewaterhouseCoopers has sold its management consultancy to IBM. There have been many changes in recent years, even during the course of many of the unsavoury matters that came to our attention. This has had the dual effect of at the same time increasing the obligations of the mostly publicly funded audit firms and plcs and of reducing their level of services by virtue of the spin-offs made in the run-up to the successful IPOs. Is it still necessary, therefore, to look into how auditors conduct audits in companies of major pubic and private standing? The answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but only as long as the penalties that can be imposed by IAASA, under the regulations of the authority to which the auditing firm belongs, are clear. How <Col N="1157" /> this master audit is done and who does it is a bigger question. Will it be the board of IAASA, which as it is currently constituted, will have only two qualified accountants out of the 13 members sitting on it? The answer must surely be &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but to where does one turn; does one go back to the five? We know that this would fly directly in the face of international best practice where 40% of the board in similar bodies comprise experts from the audit profession. We should not be dependent on a political appointee or a neophyte of some description to conclude whether an audit was independent, judicious or prudent.</P>
      <P>The premise of all company legislation is that all companies are large, complex entities, with significant internal resources governing the maintenance of records and the production of financial statements, and whose directors are considered to be knowledgeable and sophisticated business people. It assumes, further, that the external auditor is one of the big five firms which presents itself once a year to carry out purely audit procedures. This premise does not represent the reality of business for the vast majority of companies registered with the Companies Registration Office. More than 95% of companies are small, owner dominated companies in so far as the directors and management comprise the two persons who were allocated shares on incorporation and who rely on the accountant or the audit to mind them in their efforts to carry on the affairs of the company and to keep the company compliant with mainly tax issues, including VAT, PAYE, PRSI, corporation tax, income tax and filing obligations under the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>That auditors of such small companies are now culpable and liable under this Bill, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud) Act 2001, section 74 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 2001 or the Companies (Amendment) Act 2000 &ndash; being indictable officers for failing to keep the seven statutory registers &ndash; is an over the top response to all of the issues about which I have spoken. Small companies which could not have been involved or would not have had the resources to be involved in the various &ldquo;Enronitis&rdquo; that has gone on, in the tribunals established or in association with the big players in the market could not be charged with the same responsibilities as the major public limited companies or the large private companies this Bill is setting out to tackle. The scandals over the years involved a small number of very large practices carrying out audits of the accounts of publicly quoted holding companies and their subsidiaries and branches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of accountants in small practice are of the view that the audit exemption threshold and the turnover threshold for small companies introduced in 1999 should be substantially raised to a more realistic level. The Minister of State indicated that he is prepared to do something in this regard. The amount of extra work that arises from the recent and proposed legislative changes is making small audit unaffordable, <Col N="1158" /> placing an enormous burden on small business and affecting their competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of State to the following matters. The Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 imposes a mandatory duty on the auditor of all companies to report company law infringements <i>vis-à-vis</i> section 74 reports where the auditor reports directly to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, where the company or an officer has committed an indictable offence. The Companies Act 2001 was used by legislators to create some 400 indictable offences for auditors, who are not company law specialists, to detect and report. The suggestion that auditors are expected to be familiar with the more than 400 possible breaches is impracticable and unworkable at small practice level.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, it is proposed to include in the director's report a statement of compliance with all relevant legislation. The auditor must refer to any breaches of law in his or her audit report. There currently exists more than 400 offences under the Companies Acts. Effectively, the auditor must carry out a legal audit as well as a financial audit. The Bill extends the reporting requirement to breaches of environmental legalisation, employment legislation, Road Traffic Acts, Central Bank Acts, Health and Safety Authority legislation, food hygiene laws and any legislation considered relevant to the conduct of the company's affairs.</P>
    <P>Legal opinion would suggest that if an auditor considers that he is not sufficiently competent to carry out a review, he or she must engage a number of external persons who are sufficiently competent to review compliance with legislation in their respective specialist fields. This type of legislation applies in the United States only to companies listed on the stock exchange whose turnover exceeds $1.2 billion. I do not want to see such a regime applying in this jurisdiction. The Minister of State might get an opportunity at the end of the debate to set out his position regarding the matters I mention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>All companies commence with a small and possibly risky start-up operation. Because of legal exposure felt by both directors and auditors, entrepreneurs with new ideas will set up in, or move their ventures to, less punitive jurisdictions where legislation quite properly sets out the role of the auditor as a watchdog rather than a bloodhound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin and I were recently on a trade mission with the Tánaiste, looking at research and development projects and how they can be commercialised so as to develop into start-up small businesses. The regime all such companies will look at will involve not just the benign nature of the grant assistance they would get to establish business, but also a lot of other issues, including <Col N="1159" /> the regulatory regime in the jurisdiction, particularly in relation to financial and auditing criteria, and the imposition or otherwise that would have on their competitiveness.</P>
    <P>On account of the significant number of orders made by the accountancy bodies against their members engaged in small practice in this country, the professions will possibly have great difficulty in attracting people into public practice to audit the financial statements of small companies.</P>
    <P>Regarding the audit exemption, the obvious and most realistic amendment to the proposed Bill is to increase the limit to a substantial and realistic commercial level. Exemption is permitted under the 1978 company law directive. For a change, the EU does not have a problem with this. Under this directive, small companies are exempted from filing full accounts under the audit requirements. The turnover threshold in many of the jurisdictions with which we compete is &euro;6.3 million. In the United States, which, following the events of 11 September 2001, is most vocal in the area of money laundering, company law permits exemption from the burden of audit for companies whose turnover does not exceed a significantly greater sum than that to which exemption applies in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In the UK, the company law review group chaired by Margaret Beckett MP last year recommended an increase in the order of exemption threshold for small companies to &euro;7.7 million. I do not think we should go that far in this jurisdiction, coming, as we are, from a very low level, but the Minister should have the authority to increase the figure substantially in the years ahead. The accountancy bodies do not have such authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be the view of some people that a significant rise is required to exempt small practitioners from the particular onus of responsibility. I draw attention to one of the submissions I received from the high-tech sector. Peter McManamon of ParthusCeva and chairman of the ICT Ireland taxation working group has described the Bill as one of the most far-reaching items of legislation ever introduced in this country, which is a tribute to the measure we are discussing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>If we only had a euro for every such description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. It is like every election ever held, it is always the most important election in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICT sector supports and applauds the spirit of the legislation, but has expressed concerns in the form of its submission to the Opposition as well as to Government in relation to corporate governance from the accounting perspective. I <Col N="1160" /> would like the Minister of State, in the course of his concluding remarks, to refer to the statements made by people like Mr. McManamon and to offer some hope that the draconian regime proposed, or perceived by people in the high-tech sector to be proposed, will not act as a major disincentive to people, particularly those taking on the role of non-executive directors.</P>
    <P>One of the issues discussed at length in the Seanad debate was the director's compliance statement. The proposed requirement that all company directors prepare an annual compliance statement is impractical, unnecessary and unwieldy, and comes with a heavy price tag. The requirement is also unnecessary given in particular the extent of recent reforms such as the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and other new company and competition compliance legislation.</P>
    <P>The existing measures are working well. They are not long in operation and should be allowed to develop and tackle the remaining compliance problems that exist. To challenge the vast majority of compliant companies with yet more regulation at this time and in this way is ridiculous. The cost of this proposal in terms of personnel who will be available to act as non-executive directors and the hiring of expensive legal and other expertise to put together a compliance statement is going over the top.</P>
    <P>In the US, the requirement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act states that only the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of public companies certify to the Securities and Exchange Commission that accounts fairly present in all material respects the operations and financial condition of the business. This Bill requires all directors of all but the small audit-exempt companies to certify in their annual reports, rather than to a competent authority, that they comply with company and tax law and all other relevant obligations that may materially affect the company's financial statements.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking all directors to sign a compliance statement covering every aspect of the company's operations. That is the perception.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are bringing in an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated he will bring in an amendment but we have not seen it yet. I can deal only with what is in front of me. The way the arrangements are constituted is unfair and impractical. Every director cannot be expected to be fully familiar with every activity of the business. That proposal in the legislation would bring about the situation where a non-executive director like myself, or any Member of the House, or someone outside it, will be expected as part of their day job to employ expertise to ensure&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <P>We have already changed that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1161" />
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as constituted will require that every non-executive director and director of a business will be expected to know and be familiar with all aspects of the business, which only the chairman, the chief executive or the financial director could be expected to know.</P>
      <P>We do not have a serious problem with the establishment of audit committees for large private companies. The fact that an explanation must be given for not setting up an audit committee suggests that those whose names appear in the annual report would be perceived as hiding something. If a private company publishes an annual report which reveals the names of people who do not feel obliged or feel it unnecessary under the turnover limits imposed to set up audit committees, a cloud of suspicion will hang over those private companies. I ask the Minister to look at this issue again to see if it is necessary for those companies which will have done nothing wrong to have the names published in that way. The people involved should be able to explain, perhaps to IAASA, why they have not set up an audit committee. To publish the names gives the impression of something having been done behind closed doors and creates an element of suspicion in relation to those people's activities.</P>
      <P>Recognition of the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; was the subject of much debate in the Seanad. I am disappointed the Minister of State has not indicated in his speech today what the definition of accountant is likely to be in the amended form. Turf accountants were mentioned in the other House as a possible interpretation. We all know that turf accountants are very poor people. A former Member and colleague of mine would be interested in the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; in this regard. He is doing quite well as regards tax compliance under the term, &ldquo;turf accountant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important to set out criteria on who can get involved in the accountancy business and the nature of such involvement. We should have proper controls regarding turf accountants from the point of view of the consumer, taxpayer and auditing profession. I welcome the fact that this matter is being examined.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that fines for those in breach of the procedures of this legislation must be verified by the High Court. I do not see why, if we have a supervisory regulatory body in the form of IAASA, such matters should be referred to the High Court. There are clear-cut disciplinary procedures in place to deal with problems involving an accountancy practice or auditing company which breaches this legislation. There is also agreement on what those disciplinary procedures will be. From my understanding of the Bill those matters will have to be verified by the High Court. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of me in such a debate not to address the aftermath of the Blaney inquiry which commenced in 1997 and which has recently concluded its deliberations. The chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants <Col N="1162" /> described the findings of that inquiry &ndash; which was painful for him and the institute &ndash; as &ldquo;very serious for those affected&rdquo;. The Minister, in welcoming the findings, described them as &ldquo;robust&rdquo; and, as &ldquo;obviously very serious for those concerned&rdquo;. The companies involved appear to have missed the so-called very serious nature of the findings expressed. Deloitte &amp; Touche noted the technical nature of the findings against the firm regarding work for private companies. As it happens, Dunnes Stores, one of the biggest companies in this country, was involved. Mr. Oliver Freeney also sought to play down the nature of the findings. That is a little incredible when one recalls that one of the findings against the firm related to the fundamental issue of the independence of audit work carried out for the above mentioned company.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of accountants are decent, honest, law-abiding people seeking to meet their professional responsibilities. The responses by the people I mentioned earlier do not provide the type of confidence or level of understanding required by the general public of professional bodies and companies charged with working in the public interest, on behalf of shareholders and in providing confidence in our system by ensuring that people obliged to pay tax do so. If there is not a fundamental change of culture in this regard, this House will have no option but to introduce even more draconian legislation to ensure such accountancy practices comply.</P>
    <P>I am interested in hearing what the Minister intends to do about the recommendations outlined in the Blaney inquiry. Has she written to the institute and the two firms involved expressing concern about their comments? Has she inquired what actions they have taken to ensure there is no repeat of the events? In the absence of a clear public statement by these firms, will she indicate to this House at a future date if they will be awarded public work? We must take a serious view of the wrongs which took place in the 1980s and 1990s. This Bill, in my view, offers a framework for the future. However, we must also deal decisively with the past and, in this case, the very recent past given that it is only a matter of weeks since the institute published its findings regarding the Blaney inquiry.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is an important development for the accountancy profession and business. I do not wish to see a situation develop whereby we go from one extreme to the other in putting in place an over-the-top compliance regime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation, the first companies Bill to fall into my purview as Labour Party spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment. This is important legislation. I am not sure I would go as far as Deputy Hogan who intimated it was the most important Bill ever to come before the House. Such characterisations are very frequent nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> I welcome the Minister of State's contribution which outlined in clear form the contents of each section. I would have welcomed his speech being circulated with the original explanatory memorandum. Perhaps we might, as a way of assisting in the analysis of future legislation, look at providing more comprehensive explanatory memoranda of the nature normally provided in Second Stage scripts. The civil servants may not be too keen on that because they would then be at a loss to know what to do on Second Stage. Such explanatory memoranda would facilitate debate.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable debate on these proposals in the Seanad and outside the House. The Minister of State will also be aware that submissions were received by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, chaired by that dynamic Member of this House, Deputy Cassidy, who brings his own expertise to bear on these matters. We had an opportunity as members of that committee to hear the views not only of those interested professional bodies but also of a wider domain of people who will be affected by what might appear, at first reading, to be a very technical set of proposals which will regulate the accountancy profession.</P>
    <P>The genesis of these proposals has already been referred to by the Minister of State and the Fine Gael spokesperson. They are the series of concerns relating back to the beef tribunal and, more importantly, from our jurisdiction perspective, the concerns outlined in the DIRT inquiry report, a parliamentary report on foot of concerns identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General which sought a stricter and more transparent regime of accountability by the auditing profession in particular. That is what is intended to be met by the proposal before us. It is of concern that those domestic pressures which inexorably led to the establishment of the review group on auditing were matched on the international stage by a series of international accounting scandals, notably, Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing and Tyco International.</P>
    <P>There is, not only in this jurisdiction but internationally, a fresh appraisal of the requirements of standards of decency and honesty within the accounting profession. Unfortunately every profession has been under that level of scrutiny in recent times. We have been required to introduce ethics legislation governing public service and politicians. Higher standards and higher levels of transparency are required right across public administration. There is no doubt that serious action is required to give effect to a transparent and fair system of accounting and auditing. It is now an absolute requirement that there be public trust in the professions we register to operate and guard normal commercial activity in the public interest. This legislation, is for all those reasons, to be welcomed but it will require careful consideration on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the course of my contribution, I will touch on a number of issues already referred to by <Col N="1164" /> Deputy Hogan. Like Deputy Hogan, I am a little at a loss because the Minister of State has indicated he intends amending a number of the issues of controversy following the debate in the Seanad but we do not know what they will be. Our points may, therefore, be moot because the Minster of State may have changed his mind on them. In view of this, it would have been helpful if he had indicated the content of the changes he envisages.</P>
    <P>While the objective of rigid, enforceable and transparent standards is something I and the Labour Party strongly support, it must be achieved without incurring the cost of overly cumbersome regulation which would impact on the nature, type and volume of business being conducted in the State or impede the migration of new businesses into Ireland. Some may be surprised that a Labour Party spokesperson would express such views. However, we are pro enterprise and business. We want the highest standards to prevail, but we are not interested in creating bureaucracy for the sake of it, even for the sake of addressing a perceived weakness.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan rightly expressed the view that rather than addressing each perceived weakness in the regulatory structures by creating new agencies, there is a case to be made for having an over-arching agency. When more than one agency is responsible for a defined area of regulation, it creates more paperwork, accounting procedures and bureaucracy while not necessarily creating more transparency. Rather than having one joined up process, issues often fall between cracks. While the Bill will not address this, it merits consideration by the Minister of State and his Department.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a new supervisory authority, IAASA, is the most significant proposal in the Bill. It would provide for the structured oversight of the accountancy profession in Ireland, review of the financial statements of large companies and a new mechanism to improve corporate governance in the State. Members have had the benefit of submissions by various interested parties and those of us who will contribute to this debate have met a number of them. Therefore, we have had the opportunity to reflect on the Minister of State's proposals, weigh them against the submissions and develop our own ideas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may be aware that I expressed a view on a model of regulation to the Oireachtas joint committee. I have concerns about the model presented in the Bill, which I accept is the developed model of the distinguished review group on auditing, chaired by Senator O'Toole, whose recommendations must be given serious consideration. The report of the review group and the Minister of State's proposals essentially call for a dual system of self-regulation with independent oversight and validated standards. That is a laudable model, but I am concerned that as a dual system, it might prove to be lengthy and costly in practice. Investigations carried out by the individual bodies could, as we have learned, take a considerable length of <Col N="1165" /> time and could be costly. Ultimately, they would be subject to the overview of IAASA, which could, under the terms of the legislation, overturn their verdicts and cause a new investigation. This may mean that a practitioner under investigation could be subject to double jeopardy. He or she could have argued and proven the case only to have it set aside in favour of a new inquiry. In that situation, the right of a person to go to court to vindicate natural justice cannot be precluded.</P>
    <P>My original view on this aspect, which has not been wholly abandoned although it has been dented by some of the strong arguments made to me, was to favour IAASA taking over the disciplinary powers from the member bodies in the public interest. Under this model, complaints against accountants would be investigated directly by IAASA and a concept of fitness to practise would be applied, with certificates of fitness to practise issued not by the respective professional bodies but by IAASA. The Minister of State may be aware that as Minister for Health, I acquired some experience of a version of this model in relation to the medical profession. Before he consults recent cases dealt with by the fitness to practise sub-committee of the medical supervisory authority, I acknowledge that the model is not perfect. However, in essence, it is a single layered structure with recourse to the courts after only one mechanism. It could prove to be a more efficient, reliable and safer model. While the Minister of State appears wedded to the dual system set out in the legislation, I propose this model for consideration, although I accept it is unlikely to succeed.</P>
    <P>I now turn to considering how the model set out in the legislation can be improved. The Minister of State referred to the absence of a definition of the word &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. As Minister for the Environment, I became aware of some of the difficulties implicit in having a statutory definition of a professional title. I and my officials in the Department of the Environment gave careful consideration to the registration of the title &ldquo;architect&rdquo; in the Department because many people term themselves architects even when they do not hold a professional qualification. This has long been a source of contention with the architects' profession. Some of these people do not term themselves architects but architectural advisers or an architectural firm. There is difficulty in nailing down specifically a professional title when people can hold themselves to be part of that profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's solution to this is to ask IAASA to provide a suitable definition. It is understandable he should take this option because it is easy to let the new supervisory authority undertake that burden. However, this is a fundamental weakness in the legislation. The Minister of State will have received a submission from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Appendix 1 on page 35 contains a reasonable stab at a definition of &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; and I ask the Minister of State to examine it between now and <Col N="1166" /> Committee State to ascertain whether it can be incorporated in the legislation. Such a definition would greatly benefit the framing of the Bill. It does not need to be set in stone because it can be referred to again, if the authority determines that an amended definition would be more appropriate upon its establishment next year. The Minister of State should examine the definition in the submission in the context of this legislative measure.</P>
    <P>High Court approval will be required in the dual system for fines imposed on members. According to the professional bodies, that is a significant hurdle and burden. Drafters of legislation are mindful of the separation of powers and are concerned not to give any body other than the courts themselves the authority to levy a fine. That is an understandable concern but they are overly cautious in this regard. Many bodies, including those representing the accounting profession, are capable of levying such fines. They have codes, to which members sign up voluntarily, and they accept the disciplinary procedures. It is not analogous to a court. It is possible to do this without trespassing on the separation of powers, which is the motivation for inserting the section. It provides that a High Court <i>imprimatur</i> will be required for the imposition of fines by the professional bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad these issues will be addressed because we are at a loss to know how the Minister of State's thinking has evolved since the drafting of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Following the consideration of complaints by the bodies concerned, they will be considered by the new authority, IAASA. This raises the issue of the composition of the board of the IAASA, referred to by Deputy Hogan. If one is evaluating the competence of a recognised professional, there must be significant input by people duly and properly experienced and qualified to make such an evaluation. The Minister of State proposed to amend the balance of representation of the board so that four of the 14 members would be accountants. The number of board members will increase from 13 to 14 and the number of accountants will increase from two to four. There is also a possibility that a fifth accountant could be appointed as chief executive. That is a significant improvement on the initial proposition given that four or possibly five of the 14 members could be accountants, which is much better than two out of 13. The majority of members should not be accountants but the Minister of State is close to a proper balance and we can tease this issue out on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about section 16(1), which provides for a catch-all ministerial power whereby he or she can amend the number of members as he or she chooses. I am always wary of a catch-all provision at the end of a proposal. A debate is <Col N="1167" /> held to get the balance right, submissions are made but, as is the wont of many Departments, a catch-all provision is lobbed in to provide that the Minister can make his or her mind up and if he or she wishes to amend the membership subsequently, he or she can do so through an executive order without referring to anybody.</P>
    <P>Corporate governance reform is another major area that is addressed in the legislation through a number of significant proposals. The Minister of State indicated he will table amendments and, therefore, we do not know what is his current thinking on them. The first proposal relates to compliance statements. When this was addressed by Deputy Hogan, the Minister of State rejected the points he made. I do not know whether that was because he intends to amend the proposals or because Deputy Hogan misinterpreted the section. I presume the Minister of State has changes in the compliance statement requirement in mind that will make it less burdensome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a number of over the top e-mails on this issue but they are indicative of a concern that this burden will have serious implications on a number of fronts. Under the proposal, company directors will be required to prepare and sign a compliance statement that the company has complied with &ldquo;all relevant obligations.&rdquo;  Deputy Hogan asked how far &ldquo;relevant obligations&rdquo; stretch. If a company is trading internationally, must it ensure, for example, that it complies with the air quality order of Guinea-Bisseau? How does one sign off on such a catch-all statement without hiring an international legal expert to track where one's company is doing business?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I presume the Minister of State will focus on domestic company and tax law. If the compliance statement were confined to domestic law, it would not cause a difficulty.</P>
      <P>The scope of the statements, which will apply to all companies, except those eligible for audit exemption, has also caused concern. I would like the Minister of State to clarify what is involved when he responds. Voluntary companies operating in the arts sector often recruit distinguished business people to lend weight to their boards. The interaction of the business person with the arts company, in turn, often involves little more than attending performances or adding his or her name to the company's letterhead. It would be a significant burden on businessmen to take on compliance statements and they will not do so, which will result in a negative impact on businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned this might have an impact <Col N="1168" /> on emerging businesses, which are sometimes mentored by established business people. They will be discouraged from doing so, resulting in a negative impact on the potential of companies to expand in this jurisdiction. I would like the Minister of State to address that issue by giving assurances that business people will not be driven from signing up for nominal directorships of <i>pro bono</i> businesses involved in the arts sector. We should not put disincentives in the way of such companies. Similarly, we should continue to allow business people to mentor and support developing companies as they have been doing.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the audit committees that are to be established for certain companies under this Bill. There is concern that the role of such committees is to be set out in statute law. The existence of audit committees has been discussed by Deputy Hogan. I do not have a difficulty with the requirement to establish such committees for designated appropriately sized companies. It is a good idea and I support it. A fair point was made in the submission from the professional organisations, however. The Bill defines the requirement for an audit committee and the structure of such a committee, but it has been argued that the notion of outlining the role of such a committee in statute law is going too far. The role of audit committees cannot be set in stone, because it will be an evolving role. There will be new practices. New best practice will come about. One needs the flexibility to change.</P>

      <P>I am arguing that the role of the audit committees should not be set down in statute. The flexibility to change procedure in accordance with evolving best practice, without a requirement to return to the House to change the law, is needed. The Minister of State may wish to embrace this point, which was strongly made by the professional organisations, on Committee Stage. It makes eminent sense to me that such flexibility should exist. We should not enshrine in law something that makes it difficult to agree best practice, which is what is at stake. If one needs to change the law, one will have to compete for parliamentary time and space.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the amount of time I have remaining as it is difficult to deal with a very long Bill in such a short space of time. I endorse the point, without restating it, that the exemption limits for audit committees should be examined. Perhaps the Minister of State will reveal his thoughts in that regard at the conclusion of Second Stage or on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Blaney inquiry was a watershed for those of us who are interested in best practice in the company law area. I refer to people who believe that we have a regulated auditing and accounting profession that is in control of itself, is accountable and in respect of which best practice applies. The jury must be out in terms of the follow through. It is not good that some of the most respected auditing companies in this State can dismiss as a technical fault what was, to any fair-minded person, an extraordinarily strong criticism. There must be a visible accounting for that. Most of us were aghast that the criticism was dismissed in such a manner. The attitude of &ldquo;that's that, next business please&rdquo; cannot be allowed to prevail. Somebody must be held to account. Recognised failure that has been properly investigated, as well as duly noted and published, must have consequences.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill will provide a framework for the future. The professional organisations and the Minister of State should indicate the specific measures that are planned to ensure that the failures of the past, which caused us all great anxiety and concern, are dealt with. Those who are perceived to have acted improperly should also be dealt with.</P>

      <P>We all agree that this complex Bill is necessary. When we examine the behaviour of companies like Enron and WorldCom, we see how auditing services can be seriously abused. It is an incentive to reflect on the idea of self-regulation. I commend all involved on the fact that this initiative commenced before the scandals broke. It is unfortunate that much of this work was delayed because big business was threatening not to come to Ireland if the new regulations were introduced. I appreciate the difficulty of balancing the need for effective regulation with the need to ensure that companies continue to come here to create the jobs we need.</P>
      <P>This Bill will establish the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. The members of the authority will be drawn mainly from financial institutions. The competencies of the supervisory authority will be primarily financial. I would like the Minister of State to clarify whether organisations other than financial institutions will be required to make declarations. Some speakers have already alluded to this issue. What is the status of the law in respect of activities such as employment, equality, drug control, health and safety, waste recycling and insurance? Such areas affect the financial statement in terms of cost provisions and the unsecured liabilities of the company. If a company does not spend money on these areas, it will have an unmet liability. Will the supervisory authority deal with such issues? Does anything other than financial statements fall within the remit of this Bill? Guidelines or good practice can also be seen as obligations. The focus of the Bill is on obligations, but are obligations other than financial obligations included? I am trying to establish the responsibilities of the directors who must sign off on this.</P>
      <P>What is the position in respect of companies that operate in Ireland but which are based outside this jurisdiction? Are they subject to the provisions of this Bill? If, as I suspect, they are not covered by the Bill, are they totally exempt from it? Will this legislation apply to them in any way, in terms of their responsibilities to their employees in this jurisdiction? I hope such companies will not be able to rout this legislation. The Bill should not encourage companies to set up in the North or Britain to avoid the terms of the new regulation. I have highlighted the need to strike a balance between corporate governance and attracting industry. Nobody will dispute the fact that corporate governance has changed to a phenomenal extent in recent years, particularly when one examines the power of companies in light of the concept of globalisation. Many states could be financially overrun by the power of these strong companies.</P>
      <P>I return to the issue of declarations versus competencies &ndash; are directors expected to know every aspect of the company down to how the floor sweeper cleans the floor? The Minister of State is indicating &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I look forward to clarification on that matter as it is at the heart of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" />  I am concerned at the overly authoritarian approach of the Bill. Given the penalties involved, many people would think twice before taking on directorships. At one time directorships connoted a handy time. In many cases, not much more was involved than signing off annually on the accounts, invariably with either little or no responsibility. From the example cited earlier it is evident that bigger companies managed to completely flout not only their legal obligations but also their obligations to their employees and many others as well. I look forward to Committee Stage so that some of these issues can be examined in more detail. I have no doubt that the definitions will create great excitement and that we will have great sport.</P>
    <P>The concept of self-regulation is welcome, whether regarding the Medical Council, for example, or in terms of the health industry or the legal profession. Regulation of the auditing sector is long overdue and, to that extent, I warmly welcome the Bill &ndash; subject to some amendment.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns in regard to the &euro;25 million threshold, given the rate at which prices seem to go up in the retail sector &ndash; a &euro;20 note is gone in an instant. In a short time, perhaps all companies will come within that remit. In his concluding remarks, I look forward to the Minister's response to some of the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put on record my views in regard to the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003. In recent years we have seen financial matters coming to the fore and it is essential that we have an open and frank debate on the Bill. Public confidence has been shattered by recent events. This debate gives us the opportunity to discuss such matters. Ireland was once known as the island of saints and scholars; today it is better known as the land of scandals and tribunals. The world of politics, banking, the church, business, medicine, the legal profession and the Garda have all suffered from an erosion of public confidence in the wake of scandals. We have undergone major socio-economic and political change over the past decade which has had a profound impact on our value system. The Bill is part of that debate, which has to be about change and reform. It must also be about listening which, as legislators, we are obliged to do.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland consulted its members, carried out widespread research and sent in detailed proposals. As parliamentarians we have a duty to listen to them. I thank the institute, particularly its communications director, Ronán O'Brien, for its excellent and detailed submissions on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 2 deals with the supervisory authority. This part contains the various provisions required to establish the supervisory authority as a company limited by guarantee, setting out its members, objects, functions, powers, reporting and funding arrangements as well as its more <Col N="1172" /> specific functions in relation to the prescribed accountancy bodies. It also gives the supervisory authority the power to delegate any of its functions to sub-committees or staff of the supervisory authority and provides for confidentiality of information obtained by the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 4 defines terms used in this part of the Bill. Most of these are self-explanatory. A point of clarification worth making is that the definition of &ldquo;prescribed accountancy body&rdquo; encompasses all accountancy bodies recognised for the purposes of the Companies Acts to reflect the scope of the supervision provided for in the Bill, which extends, alike, to auditor and non-auditor members of these recognised bodies. The Minister also has the power under section 46(1) to prescribe other bodies of accountants for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the appointment by the Minister of directors of the supervisory authority. There is provision for 13 directors, 12 appointed by the Minister, based on nominations from each of the eight bodies referred to in section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>h</i>), with two nominations from the prescribed accountancy bodies, and a further two by the Minister. The chief executive will be an <i>ex officio</i> director. Not more than two directors appointed by the Minister can be members of prescribed accountancy bodies.</P>
    <P>Members of the supervisory authority are not permitted to instruct directors in the discharge of their duties as directors. The term of office of a director will be set by the Minister as being for a minimum of three years and a maximum of five years. The Minister shall, if he or she so wishes, re-appoint directors to the board. The section also provides for the resignation and removal of directors from the board.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we take on board the views of the institute. On 12 October 2003, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, ICAI, called for the two distinct elements of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill before Dáil Éireann to be de-coupled and proceeded with separately and on a different basis. The Bill establishes the new supervisory authority for auditors and accountants, the IAASA, on a statutory basis and amends company law in respect of corporate governance issues. The deputy president of the ICAI, Terence O'Rourke, said he believed the Government should proceed immediately to establish the supervisory authority but revisit the corporate governance issues contained in the Bill. The IAASA has been in preparation for some time and already meets on an interim basis. He suggested that it needs to be established on a statutory basis as soon as possible to allow it and the professional bodies to begin their new working relationship.</P>
    <P>The areas that deal with corporate governance have been the subject of considerable controversy in recent months. In particular, the issue of the compliance statements to be made by directors has given rise to concern within the business com<Col N="1173" /> munity. A number of important developments have occurred in this area even since the Bill was debated in the Seanad. The ICAI has always argued that corporate governance issues should not be addressed in primary legislation except at a very high level. Legislation is simply too inflexible to deal with the pace of development in this area and opens up the prospect of an ongoing need for legislative amendment.</P>
    <P>Significantly both the UK and the European Union recommended the code approach. The latest version of the UK code was published in July. It was updated to take account of global accounting difficulties which is binding on Irish companies quoted on our stock market. The European Union issued its communication paper on the subject in the same month.</P>
    <P>The ICAI is strongly of the view that this is the way we should proceed. The review group on auditing, the RGA, made similar recommendations to those contained in the Bill. As a result of Enron and other scandals, other jurisdictions have adopted practices that will allow them to react to events more easily than the approach to which the Government is committed. In fairness to the Government, those involved have said that the RGA consulted widely but events have overtaken that approach. It would be inappropriate not to respond in a manner similar to our European colleagues and competitors. The measures that are advocated in the Bill are important but they will be equally effective if incorporated in a code, while still allowing the flexibility to amend them in line with global developments. It is more important to get the overall framework correct. The views of the deputy president should be listened to by the Government.</P>
    <P>I have some recommendations regarding the legislation. I recommend that the scope of the supervisory authority be applied to all accountants, which will necessitate a definition of &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. The proposed changes to section 187 of the 1990 Act should be revised in order that it is compliant with the requirements of the eighth directive.</P>
    <P>The prescribed accountancy bodies, the designated bodies and the Minister should nominate persons with the necessary competence, experience and professionalism to fulfil the objectives and functions of the board. The nominating bodies should not be precluded from nominating a person who is a member of a prescribed accountancy body, subject to a maximum of 40% of the membership of the board being members of a prescribed accountancy body. No member of the board should be an employee of any Department or Government agency, any prescribed accountancy body or any designated body.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act should not apply to confidential information which comes before or into the possession of the supervisory authority. Information should only be disclosed as empowered under section 30. In the event that the supervisory authority delegates any of its functions to a third party, the relevant pro<Col N="1174" /> fessional body, the member, or the company should be informed of the person or persons who will carry out the functions of the supervisory authority under sections 23 to 26, inclusive, before that person is appointed to assess if any conflicts of interest exist.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take these views on board. More important, he should listen very carefully to the detailed ideas of those on the front line. We need major reform of accountancy and business practices and if we are serious about it, we must listen very carefully to and take on board the views of the people who are working between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., as well as those who work outside these hours, all of whom make a massive contribution to the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we must ensure there is transparency and honesty in all business. We are moving towards such a society and things have changed. Despite many of the scandals, the reality is that the vast majority are trying to do their best in their jobs for their companies and their country. I encourage people to continue along this track. If people in business want to serve the community, they must do their best to develop the economy and, above all, treat their own staff well, keep their businesses in order and pay their taxes. Then they can make a major contribution to society in a broader way.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to address this legislation and I hope the Government will take on board some of my ideas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill. I welcome the Minister of State's speech and the other interesting speeches we heard. They are a good example of the good work done by the Houses. We note the good work the Seanad has done and I hope the Minister will take on board some of the comments of my colleagues who have already spoken. There is not much contention regarding the purpose of the Bill. The interest will be in the amendments the Minister of State is willing to accept. He has shown himself to be flexible in his approach.</P>
      <P>I am a director of two very small companies. My dealings with chartered accountants and auditors have been quite positive, and this colours everything I have to say. I regard highly the work of the accountant connected with my two businesses and the relationship I have had with that person over the years. It has been hugely beneficial to business. We need to be careful when amending legislation that affects the auditing profession that we do not abolish some of the good things that exist or the positive role the accountancy profession can have within businesses. At the same time, we must ensure they are properly regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of my positive experience with my accountant, I, like many others, was shocked in recent years to hear some of the disclosures about what took place particularly in some of the larger <Col N="1175" /> accountancy firms and larger public, private and limited companies. Maybe the culture that existed was associated with a former Taoiseach, who was an accountant in the past. He possibly embodies in part the culture that existed 20 or 30 years ago, namely, the notion that it was acceptable to bend the rules and the accounts. When we saw how this culture operated in respect of the Dunnes Stores case, it seemed that, in certain circumstances, the auditor in question was providing a cheque book on the same basis that Ray Burke had his &ldquo;walking around&rdquo; money, which was available for various reasons and for dispensing to different directors. This activity was quite shocking and, based on my experience with my sole-practice auditor, I could not have imagined it was taking place in the bigger firms.</P>
    <P>I completed a business degree in university and, at the time, one achieved Brahmin status if one received a call to work in Arthur Andersen. I am not impugning anyone who was working in the company but it was noticeable to those who came through the same education system that this company, which was supposedly the very best and the highest of the high, was engaged in some very questionable practices. Outside Ireland &ndash; I am not particularly aware of its business in Ireland &ndash; it seemed that those at the very highest level were involved in such practices. Therefore, it is important that this Bill be enacted. There is a need for regulation and it is difficult to understand how accountancy bodies could have sanctioned companies engaged in malpractice. It is good that the accountancy bodies are welcoming the introduction of the supervisory body.</P>
    <P>I very much share the sentiments of Deputy Hogan, namely, that we do not, in trying to address the aforementioned issue, set up a new bureaucratic structure in the State and a new level of regulatory authority with a quango whereby we would have very extensive and expensive systems of administration and regulation.</P>
    <P>While shadowing the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have seen very little legislation pertaining to enterprise and a considerable amount related to superannuation, administration, board selection and hugely expensive and cumbersome State procedures. In promoting enterprise, we should be careful that we do not just provide regulation and administration and that we do not fail to free people up. The Minister should be flexible regarding the new authority. We have a number of regulators in the telecoms and broadcasting areas, with considerable staff and very significant budgets. They are very interventionist, which is necessary in many cases, especially in respect of telecoms and electricity providers. The new regulatory body will not be involved at that level. It is a stand-back authority, which, on occasion, will have to provide an independent and legislative framework for investigating certain issues. It should not <Col N="1176" /> be seen as a full-time bureaucracy that has to carry out work to justify its existence.</P>
    <P>On the issue of membership, the Minister should consider the academic institutions as a source of very knowledgeable people in the area of accountancy standards and of people who can have a good feed-in role. When I made one of my submissions, the professions stated that many accountants should be on the board. I query this. The accountants certainly need representation but there are other experienced people who may be appointed on a part-time basis, in the same way that we appoint people to the Arts Council. We do not necessarily need full-time people to make up the body of the authority. The authority needs to be knowledgeable and wise, but knowledge and wisdom can be brought in from other disciplines on an as-needed basis.</P>
    <P>The legal system, another significant financial burden and restriction on enterprise and business, frequently &ndash; I should choose my words carefully &ndash; saps the potential for enterprise activity. It imposes massive costs and causes serious difficulties and delays. I am particularly concerned about the provision in section 35 that a decision of a disciplinary committee will automatically go before the High Court. I hope this will be changed, as the Minister of State appears to have indicated, because automatic recourse to the High Court, given the current delays in taking a case before it and the costs associated with doing so, is madness.</P>
    <P>I hope, when reading through the Bill, the Minister will decide to remove the legal profession from the equation because it involves money and wasted time. We have too much recourse to the law. The Bill establishes another tier of recourse, namely, the High Court, which has another tier above it, meaning we have a three tiered structure. We should remove the role of lawyers to the greatest degree possible. I welcome the Minister of State's apparent indication that he will take certain measures in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have received representations on the need for disclosure by directors, the other main issue of contention, which was also raised by a number of speakers. I am concerned about the obligations imposed on directors, particularly with regard to smaller firms, and agree with Deputy Hogan that we need to increase the level of turnover at which auditor compliance is required. Having read closely the wording of this provision, it is difficult to work out the precise requirements in this regard. The Minister of State put it well when he stated that people are perhaps over-reacting.</P>
    <P>As a director of a small company, I know precisely what will happen if we enact the legislation as it stands. When my annual audited accounts are returned to me, I will sign the various forms and on reaching the page on auditor compliance I will ask my accountant what I am signing. While I will sign when he informs me I am undertaking that the company is compliant, I will not really understand to what the amendment to section 205F of the 1999 Act relates. Directors may be <Col N="1177" /> deterred if they become aware that signing may be an offence. It is necessary, however, to take action to ensure that company directors police to a degree their company's operations.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my earlier point that we should not set up bureaucratic, administrative structures. I accept the reason for legislating to make directors act as a kind of police force in their companies as it means that a bureaucratic system in which the supervisory authority has to investigate every company will not be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue requires clarification. Amending the section to clarify and narrow down the issue of compliance could satisfy some of the concerns, many of which I do not share. Some people who approached me were concerned the provision may frighten off overseas investors. This is not credible because we deal with large companies, many of which operate in markets in which there are serious concerns about corporate governance. Foreign investors prefer to invest in countries with a proper regulatory and business framework in which the rule of law applies and one does not have to bribe anyone or bend the law. A straight environment is a good one for business.</P>
      <P>We need to clarify what is meant by the title of accountant. The Bill refers to auditors throughout. The title of accountant is often confused with bookkeeper by the small businessmen I represent, while accountants often confuse bookkeeper with auditor. The Minister of State said he would allow the supervisory authority to investigate and analyse this issue. My concern is that we may discover that legislation is required to define what is an accountant. We should avail of the opportunity to do this now, which may require the Minister to seek legal advice. Will legislation be required or could we achieve this by ministerial order or by order of the supervisory authority? If legal opinion is that legislation is not required, I would be happy to leave the matter to the supervisory authority to address. It would be good practice to do everything at once. I welcome the Bill and look forward to debating it further on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute on the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003. The genesis of this legislation was the DIRT inquiry, chaired by the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, which seems to have many tails. I have come to the House from a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts which is considering look-back audits and the behaviour of certain banks. The DIRT inquiry, of which I was fortunate to be a member, raised many questions, not least of which was the issue addressed by this legislation. One of the main questions arising from the inquiry related to the independence of a group of auditing firms which <Col N="1178" /> appear to have established an oligopoly with regard to the banking business. Not only were members of this group auditing the banks, but they were also doing consultancy work through other arms of their businesses. The question needed to be addressed, which is what the Bill does.</P>
      <P>One of the most important outcomes of the inquiry was the questions it raised about corporate governance among banks and public companies in general, the independence and objectivity of audit committees and the competence and ability of their membership. I am glad these issues are comprehensively addressed in the Bill. The question of self-regulation &ndash; who will judge the judges or guard the guardians &ndash; also arose at the inquiry. It is good the Bill will put the question of regulation and discipline by the accountancy bodies on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>At the time the question of compliance arose, I suggested to the chief executive of one of the banks that those in his position should have to sign a statement to the effect that their bank or company had complied with tax law. The suggestion was not met with great enthusiasm, which is an issue to which I will return. There is a responsibility and onus, not on the directors of companies, but on whomever is the chief operating officer. They are at the coalface doing the work and should, therefore, take responsibility for ensuring, in as far as can be reasonably expected, that their company operates within the law in all respects.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator O'Toole on the great work he did on the review he undertook of auditing and auditing bodies at the request of the Tánaiste. He invested a huge amount of time and effort in the review and demonstrated the work Members of the Oireachtas are prepared to put into public service over and above the call of duty. He deserves to be congratulated on this and on the report he and the other members of the review group compiled. Many of its recommendations are encapsulated in the legislation. It is necessary to instil confidence in the public that the operation of companies is the best in terms of regulation, systems of governance and the standards that are adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been considering whether the concept of auditing companies could be extended, now that the opportunity is available, although it might be beyond the scope of this Department. Yesterday, the Hanly report was published. The objective of the report is to improve patient care, to have a consultant-provided rather than a consultant-led hospital service, to improve medical education and training and to improve access to services regionally so that each region will have additional suitable services which are not available to them at present. The number of junior hospital doctors is to be reduced from 4,000 to 2,200 while the number of consultants is to increase from 1,700 to 3,600. Various major hospitals are to be put in place in each region in addition to the smaller hospitals. Perhaps there should be a medical <Col N="1179" /> auditor who would examine whether this happens in each area. The auditor could ascertain if patient care has been put in place in a measurable way with regard to the number of consultants. This could also apply to the environment with the appointment of environmental auditors to ensure that the objectives set out by Departments are measured and reported on to ensure they come up to the required standards.</P>
    <P>In many cases the reports received by the Dáil are quantitative. They deal with the pounds, not with quality. The amount of outputs is not measured in the same way as the pounds are measured. There should be some way to measure the quality of the outputs. Perhaps there is a way the audit concept can be broadened, not necessarily in this Bill but in other ways, to ensure that all the services we expect from Government are put in place, that programmes are measured and reported on and that if there are deficiencies, these will be reported in order that we can try to improve them. It is not a stick with which to beat people but a carrot to improve the services. One of the issues that has arisen in the major hospitals is the question of clinical directorates. I am vice-chairman of St. James's Hospital, in which clinical directorates operate. We would be amenable to having an audit of the services of the various directorates. It is something that needs to be developed.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;audit&rdquo; is derived from the Latin for the verb &ldquo;to hear&rdquo;. It is not just a question of pound notes, accounting and adding. It is hearing, listening and reporting. It has come to mean money but that should not be its primary purpose.</P>
    <P>A catalyst for pushing this legislation forward was what happened recently on the international scene with Enron and WorldCom and with Elan in this country. The dotcom industry in 1999 had put values on intangible assets which were astronomical and out of all proportion to their eventual value. That shook the business community and commerce generally and had a huge effect on the stock market. It also affected pensions. Many people who were about to retire were concerned and worried about the pensions on which they would have to live. This Bill is being introduced to ensure, in so far as possible, that the same thing will not occur in future.</P>
    <P>The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority or IAASA will have oversight of accountancy bodies and will examine annual accounts of relevant undertakings, which are public limited companies, large private companies, unlimited companies and partnerships, all of whose members have effective limited liability. I do not know how it will do that. The auditors will perform their audit and, with standards having been improved and made more rigorous, the examination by auditors has changed dramatically and is changing each year. The value of another body examining accounts is questionable. That body should be examining the stan<Col N="1180" /> dards and the work practices of the institute or recognised body of which those auditors are members to ensure that from the bottom-up, not top-down, things are operating properly.</P>
    <P>The IAASA will also be responsible for recognition of a body of accountants for the purposes of its members being able to act as auditors. Members will be aware that there was great disagreement in the early 1990s as to whether a body was sufficiently competent and should be given recognition. The body concerned was the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants. I am glad that this body will now have to apply, after the commencement of this Bill, for recognition. In the meantime, all members of that body will have the right and ability to audit public companies. This will not do anything to the institute or delete or negative its work but it will help to improve the standards of all institutes of all public accountants in the country. There are a number of bodies, institutes and groupings of public accountants and anything that helps to improve their educational, accounting and auditing standards is worthwhile and welcome. I hope all the bodies will improve their standards.</P>
    <P>I have a vested interest in this issue, which I probably should have mentioned earlier. I have an individual authorisation from the Minister. Each individual authorisation &ndash; I believe there are now less than 100 such authorisations &ndash; will be, within three years, subject to the regulation of a recognised body of accountants. I am subject to the regulation of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland at present. It is good that all individual authorisations, which are probably less welcome than the recognition of the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants, are now being dealt with and that everybody who operates as a public accountant will be regulated in Ireland by a body which will be responsible to IAASA.</P>
    <P>The audit committee has to be satisfied that where remuneration for non-audit work exceeds the aggregate of audit and audit-related work, the independence of the auditor is not affected. The Minister told me that contributors today had discussed the question of the audit committee and whether it would be right and proper for all the relevant companies. For a company with a turnover of &euro;25.5 million, having to put in place a fully fledged audit committee empowered and able to do all the things expected in good corporate governance and under the regulations set out in this law, will be very difficult. Being a member of an audit committee is an onerous and very responsible task. It takes a great deal of time and effort to ensure that proper corporate governance is being adopted by the company and to satisfy oneself as a member of an audit committee that one is prepared to stand over the accounts, the auditor's independence and everything else. There is a question about the level. The sum of &euro;25 million was very large ten years ago, but not today. Many companies in Ireland with that kind of turnover have the competence and ability to make money, produce efficiently and operate <Col N="1181" /> legitimately and ethically, but there is a question over having to have an audit committee at that low level. For bigger companies, it is certainly an absolute necessity.</P>
    <P>The IAASA should review procedures in place and insist on changes, where deemed necessary, in disciplinary procedures. It should not be an appeal body for individual cases. I agree that there is the potential for double jeopardy. The IAASA should set out and agree with the accountancy bodies the broad parameters of the disciplinary procedures. Those, along with the constitution, would form the basis of a judicial review for any disaffected person. However, I do not believe that one should be tried twice or that the chance of being tried twice should exist, so long as the procedures are in place. The whole reason for the IAASA is oversight. It should not be for the nitty-gritty at the coalface. It should ensure that accountancy bodies do their work, particularly regarding disciplinary matters. It would be wrong for the IAASA to examine disciplinary procedures regarding problems with individual accountants.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned the compliance statement. I heard the Minister say that changes are coming through on Committee Stage. If someone asked me if I had operated as a Deputy in compliance with company law, tax law, environmental law, competition law and everything else in the book, I would not know, since there are always small items. The devil is in the detail, as a former Taoiseach used to say. Stating categorically that one has fully complied with all the laws of the land, as is our duty, means that somebody could pick one up on it. The directors of many private companies are the spouse, partner, son, daughter or friend of the owner, and the one person who operates that company is the chief executive officer. That is the person who knows whether things have been done right, and that person should be primarily responsible for any compliance statement.</P>
    <P>There is a question about whether a company operating in Ireland from another EU country has an unfair advantage, since it would not have to sign a compliance statement. Should non-national companies which operate here also have to produce one? Even though they do not have to produce audited statements or register with the Companies Registration Office, should they not have to sign a compliance statement, at least to say that they are operating on a level playing field with companies in Ireland?</P>
    <P>I will comment on the question of whether companies should be subject to audit at all and the level at which that should happen. The issue of compliance is probably connected with that of SMEs and big companies, but the level at which they should be audited should be at least &euro;2 million. However, it is not necessarily the case that only that should be taken into consideration. Today I saw the van of a pork sausage and bacon wholesaler. The owner could easily have a turnover of &euro;2 million, yet there would be only one <Col N="1182" /> employee. Is it necessary that he or she be audited, when another company with a turnover of less than &euro;1 million that may have ten employees operating in the business of cash services, for example, a security services company, need not have an audit? The factor should not only be the level of money. It should also include the number of employees or people working for the company indirectly through subcontractors. Both those should be taken into account in deciding whether a company should have to undergo an audit each year.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that this legislation is coming forward. It will improve and enhance corporate governance in Ireland and make legitimate business fairer, more just and more equitable. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 is the most significant legislation affecting corporate governance for many years. Broadly speaking, Fine Gael welcomes the Bill's publication and supports the spirit and intent of the legislation. It imposes several new requirements on Irish companies and their auditors and has major ramifications for the directors of businesses at all levels.</P>
      <P>However, Fine Gael has concerns about the extent of some of the new requirements. While no one would argue that business should not comply with the law of the land, certain aspects of the Bill are draconian. They will impose a significant compliance cost on companies and make Ireland less attractive as a location to set up a business. Though we all agree that it is important to have corporate governance arrangements of the highest quality in place, in this case we have gone a step too far. The Government is imposing regulatory overload on small business. The proposals are, in many ways, very radical and go further than similar legislation in the US or recent proposals from the European Union. Ireland is fast becoming the most regulated economy in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill's provisions will impact on everyone, from the small publican with an empty, smoke-free pub to the large, publicly quoted companies. Fine Gael has concerns that the imposition of the new regulations will impact negatively on the cost of doing business, particularly for small businesses. It will stifle new business growth and lead to an exodus of non-executive directors from the corporate landscape. Some of the Bill's features, such as the director's compliance statement, are unique in the European Union. No other member state has anything like it. The unfortunate result is that prospective inward investors may well go to another country that takes a more pro-business approach. Ireland will be seen as an unattractive place in which to do business. The high-technology group ICT Ireland has said that the proposed legislation on company directors is so serious that it will make Ireland one of the most regulated countries in the world. More importantly, the group also claims that it will <Col N="1183" /> impose significant additional costs on indigenous companies and seriously undermine Ireland's attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>Two specific problems have been identified:</P>
    <P>the obligation on all company directors to prepare an annual compliance statement and the requirement to establish audit companies in PLCs. The IDA has similar concerns about other aspects of the Bill, arguing that if amendments are not accepted the consequences will be frightening. The IDA's big clients are incorporated outside the country but say they are worried that the message being sent out is that Ireland is no longer a friendly place in which to do business, adding that the additional cost of firms being audited in Ireland was of great concern to them. The implications for non-profit-making companies and voluntary agencies will also be enormous.</P>
    <P>There is a balance to be struck between effective regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Unfortunately, while the Bill has many worthy provisions, it does not have that balance right. Fine Gael will introduce a number of amendments which will continue to protect the integrity of the Bill without imposing undue burdens on business. The new requirement for a director's compliance statement is our primary area of concern.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the directors of a company, other than those which are ineligible for the audit exemptions, to make positive statements regarding the company's compliance with company law as well as taxation law and other relevant statutory requirements. Those will cover issues related to employment, the environment, health and safety and many other regulations. Failure by the directors to prepare a compliance statement or to include a statement in the annual report will be an offence. A company's auditors will be required to review the directors' compliance statements and the review will be incorporated in the auditors' report on the financial statements. If the auditors form the opinion that the directors have failed to comply with their obligations under the Bill, the matter will have to be reported to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
    <P>This is a very onerous burden of personal responsibility for directors. It will be difficult, if not impractical, for directors to state that a company complies with all relevant statutory requirements. It will be extremely difficult in such circumstances to attract non-executive directors to boards, and this at a time when it is already difficult to attract people to boards. Everyone agrees that good non-executive directors are of tremendous benefit to any company.</P>
    <P>The European Commission's proposals to modernise company law and enhance corporate government in the EU made no mention of any similar proposal. In fact, this is not required in any other EU country. The only other country to introduce similar provisions is the United States and the provisions in the US are nowhere near as wide-ranging, as they only apply to companies <Col N="1184" /> quoted on the stock exchange and statements only need to be signed by the chief executive and the chief financial officer.</P>
    <P>It is predicted that these onerous requirements will lead to a loss of competitiveness, particularly relative to the United Kingdom, in attracting overseas investment to Ireland. There is no equivalent legislation in the UK and American companies in particular are likely to choose locations such as Scotland and Northern Ireland in preference to Ireland because of these excessive compliance burdens. These proposals will give rise to serious compliance costs and the personal responsibilities will very likely lead directors to seek extensive legal advice and other due diligence before making a public statement on their annual reports. ISME estimates there will be an increase of 40% in audit fees alone, together with substantial costs involved in extra administration and owner/manager times. It also claims that the provisions will have a negative impact on the competitiveness of many companies which are under severe pressure due to Ireland's already high cost environment.</P>
    <P>At present it is proposed that the provisions will apply in Ireland to all public companies, companies with more than 50 members, and to private companies which are not eligible for audit exemptions, companies with a turnover in excess of &euro;317,000. This threshold is ridiculously low and ensures that the vast majority of companies will require directors' compliance statements. It will also apply to other entities, such as charitable companies and management companies for apartment blocks, as the number of shareholders may exceed 50.</P>
    <P>Ideally, these draconian provisions should be removed and Fine Gael recommends replacing them with a report stating that the company has processes in place to address its risk management and compliance responsibilities. If these draconian, anti-competitive provisions remain on our Statute Book, then at the least the turnover threshold for the audit exemption should be raised significantly. Fine Gael recommends a threshold of &euro;3 million, as the current Irish level is significantly below those adopted by our fellow EU states. The EU allows countries to set an audit threshold of up to &euro;7.3 million. The threshold in the Netherlands is &euro;7 million and it is &euro;6.8 million in Germany. The current exemption for UK companies is &euro;1.27 million and it is proposed to increase this to almost &euro;5 million, specifically to benefit smaller companies in that jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Once again we are out of step with the rest of Europe. Furthermore, the threshold should be set by order rather than through constant changes in legislation, The implications of these exemption limits mean SMEs across Europe have less compliance costs than Irish companies, adding to their competitive advantage. In a recent survey conducted among members of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland, an overwhelming 97% of respondents felt that the threshold should be raised substantially. There <Col N="1185" /> should also be exemptions for charitable companies and certain management companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a requirement for an audit committee for all PLCs and large companies. While this may be reasonable for PLCs and other public interest companies, we argue that it is not necessary for private companies. One of the reasons that many companies stay private is that they do not want third parties having access to privileged information. Again Ireland is out of step with the rest of Europe in requiring every company incorporated as a PLC to have its own audit committee, even if it is a wholly owned subsidiary of another parent company. Many Irish companies have quite a large number of PLCs as subsidiaries and each company must now have its own separate audit committee.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to increase the cost and complexity of doing business in Ireland and goes far beyond the EU strategy on the regulation of corporate governance. While it is generally accepted that the principles regarding audit committees may be enshrined in law, the detailed rules on the functions of such committees are more approximately dealt with in a code since it is easier to change, and so can react more rapidly and effectively to the environment in which business operates. One would have expected a requirement for at least some of the members of the committee to have substantial financial expertise.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish the new supervisory authority, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, whose principal function is to supervise how the accountancy bodies regulate and monitor their members. Fine Gael broadly supports the setting up of this authority, but has some reservations about its implementation from a practical point of view. This new authority has 12 members, only two of whom are from the accounting bodies. The function of the authority would require an in-depth knowledge of the workings of the profession and of company legislation. It is not clear who will conduct the review of companies. If it is to be IAASA, some of the members may not have the required expertise to inspect accounts and pass a comment on them. There should be a greater number of accountants on the board. Most boards, such An Bord Altranais, contain a significant number of professionals from that field. The accountancy and auditing professions consider it would be appropriate to review this section and increase their representation on the board. It is unusual for a profession to be so underrepresented on its own supervisory body.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also recommends that we follow the UK example and establish a high level panel that would have the experience to do the job on behalf of the IAASA. While we all want effective corporate governance, this Bill seeks to impose excessive costs and responsibilities on companies and their directors, which go further than seems necessary by reference to international norms. There is a proper balance between proper and effective regulation and unnecessary burdens on <Col N="1186" /> business. Unfortunately, this Bill has not got that balance right.</P>
    <P>The Government is intent on Ireland being the most regulated state in the European Union. This anti-business approach will slow down inward investment. It is likely to stifle entrepreneurship, to discourage our own people from setting up businesses and it will also make it more difficult to attract non-executive directors to many boards. This legislation, in its current format, is all the more surprising because it has been introduced by the Minister's Department. Deputy Harney is a member of the Progressive Democrats and constantly lectures us on how keeping the economy competitive is the central plank of this Government's economic policy.</P>
    <P>The unnecessary excesses in this Bill will add substantially to business costs. More importantly, the red tape and excessive bureaucratic elements of this Bill will discourage expansion of existing companies and the setting up of new ones. Many of these provisions would be totally at odds with at least the proclaimed policy of the Progressive Democrats, a sort of <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude towards business, which would normally create the right environment and the private sector would do the rest. However, perhaps we should not be that surprised, when one considers the amount of stealth taxes the Government has imposed on business in terms of the massive increases in rates, the development charges and planning charges because it has utterly failed to deal with the proper funding of local government. More importantly, and potentially the most serious of all, will be the new carbon tax, which will affect our competitiveness as a nation. This tax does not need to be as harsh as it will be, and it would not be had the Government not totally mismanaged the renewable energy sector over the past number of years. It is too late to rectify the problems created by stealth taxes, but the Minister can rectify the problems with this Bill by accepting Fine Gael amendments, which would eliminate the draconian anti-competitive provisions, while not interfering with the main objectives of the Bill, which my party welcomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Second Stage debate on this Bill. I wish to make a number of comments on this general area and on the Bill. I am a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland and have a keen interest in this area. I was contacted by a number of practitioners in the field during the summer months regarding concerns they had in respect of the Bill, as originally published, which I duly passed on to the Department for consideration. Their concerns can be broken into two issues. One is the threshold that will be set requiring a company to carry out a statutory audit and the other is the level at which companies and directors will have to sign, and express an opinion on, an auditor's statutory statement. These are related but separate issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the limit that will be set requiring the carrying out of a statutory audit applies only <Col N="1187" /> to companies. If a company wants to obtain the benefits of limited liability, responsibilities go with that. If a person, be it a shopkeeper or a small business person, continues to operate as a sole trader, notwithstanding a high level of liability, he or she will not have to carry out a statutory audit. It is up to such individuals as to how they organise themselves, taking into account all the relevant factors.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised with me during the summer, which the Minister might address on Committee Stage, is the matter of unlimited companies. I am not sure if they are adequately dealt with in the legislation. A person operating an unlimited company does not have the protection of limited liability. Such a person could be in the worst of all worlds, he or she would have unlimited liability and may be caught for a statutory audit. While there are a limited number of unlimited companies, that issue should be examined and clarified as this legislation passes through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister has yet to set a figure at which a company will be required to carry out a statutory audit &ndash; he will probably announce that on Report Stage. This is a different decision. In an ideal world such a figure should not be based only on the turnover of a company but on its size. That may prove difficult from a practical point of view, but it would be the best possible solution. For example, if the proprietor of a shop operating as a company has a turnover of &euro;500,000 and a gross margin of 10%, he or she would have only &euro;50,000 to run the business, pay the overheads and, hopefully, obtain a salary. That would be a tiny operation, even though it would have a turnover of &euro;500,000. All any company has is its gross margin. In the retail trade where margins are tight, one can have a high turnover but limited scope to do business. A Fine Gael speaker mentioned that the threshold that should be set requiring a company to carry out an audit should be &euro;3 million.</P>
    <P>In some cases a company with a turnover of less than &euro;3 million could have more than 50 employees, depending on the nature of its business. It will be very difficult to strike a balance, but I hope the figure will be raised to &euro;1 million because otherwise there will be an enormous burden on very small operations, in effect sole traders operating through limited companies, and perhaps employing only themselves and another family member. I do not want to see an undue burden placed on such small companies. I ask that the figure be pitched close to the &euro;1 million level.</P>
    <P>There is a strong new provision in section 43 dealing with compliance statements which directors are required to sign, after which the auditors are expected to sign an audit report on that compliance statement. The level of turnover figure to attract an audit should be totally different. A figure of perhaps &euro;1 million should have to be reached to require a statutory audit, but a direc<Col N="1188" /> tor compliance statement should not apply at that low level of activity. Some companies involving that turnover are very small. I suggest that a turnover figure in the region of &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million would be more appropriate for the mandatory requirement for a compliance statement. Such a figure should be looked at in the context of the filing limits which companies currently operate in dealing with the Companies Office. To debate the audit figure and the compliance figure together is wrong and suggests that one compromise figure would be correct. They are two separate issues requiring substantially different levels at which the relevant statements come into play.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there are some crazy notions, suggesting that directors will be responsible if a sales representative is driving a mile over the speed limit and so on. I know that is not what is required under the legislation, though some people have read it that way. The legislation states that directors will have to sign a compliance statement with the relevant obligations defined in the companies acts, tax laws and enactments within a legal framework in which the company operates and which could materially affect a company's financial statement &ndash; I am reading from the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about this reference to the compliance statement materially affecting the company's financial statement. I will give a well known example, published in the media. Consider some of the large public companies accused of being complicit in illegal dumping taking place on their property. One could argue that if these company directors were required to sign a compliance statement in terms of the Waste Management Act and pollution Acts, they would not be in breach of those Acts. It is, however, necessary for all major companies to operate within the legal environment of waste management Acts, planning Acts and so on. In circumstances where company directors have to sign the compliance statement and liability is contested &ndash; it might not be quantified for a long time &ndash; a serious question mark could be put over the company's accounts. That should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Everyone operates within the legal framework of the planning laws. It should not be required of directors, every time they sign an annual report, to confirm that every shed, property and asset is fully in compliance with the planning laws. They should of course be in compliance, we all agree, but to ask for a specific certificate to be produced may complicate the signing-off of the financial statement. That needs to be considered. There are mechanisms under the existing waste management and planning laws and under other legislation to deal with companies and organisations where there are people in breach of regulations, without the need to bring in such a draconian requirement as a director's compliance statement. This is why the legislation has attracted so much attention. The legislation was meant to be worthwhile and this issue must be clarified. It is <Col N="1189" /> important that we strike a balance between regulation and normal acceptable business practice.</P>
    <P>I recall a previous Minister who was very prominent in Irish public life. He was a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the former name of the Department now sponsoring this legislation. He eventually had a very prominent name, but most people say he was anti-business, pro-regulation and pro-rules. He did not trust business people or professional advisers. Most of what he set out to do was anti-business. When we are passing legislation it is important to assist the consumers, the users of the accounts and the public at large. We should not go over the top and be considered anti-business in our legislation, where it is not necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>It has been noted that some of the biggest financial undertakings in this country are major foreign operations. Many are operating as branches of foreign-registered companies. In my constituency recently, an organisation decided to close down and people wanted to know the company's financial situation. We found out that the company was not incorporated in Ireland though it had been in the country for 40 years. It was a branch of a company registered in the United States of America and therefore had no legal requirement to file accounts in Ireland under the Companies Act. This sort of organisation, of which there are many in Ireland, will not be caught by this legislation, but domestic Irish-owned and Irish-run companies will be caught by these new compliance statements. We are putting Irish businesses in Ireland at a disadvantage in comparison with some major foreign operations in Ireland which choose not to incorporate here. There is no requirement on them to do so. I hope that issue will be addressed.</P>
    <P>Considering the detail of the legislation before us, we must ask why we are considering it now. The background is a report to the Committee of Public Accounts in a previous Dáil term. A review group was set up by the then Minister, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and was asked to examine the following principal issues: self-regulation in the auditing profession, auditor independence, the auditing of financial institutions and the role of the auditor in ensuring compliance with statutory provisions. The group was ably and effectively chaired by Senator O'Toole, a Member of the Oireachtas who did his work quickly. The group began its work in February 2000 and completed it at the end of June 2000. I commend the group on its important work.</P>
    <P>Since then, new issues have come to light which have made the review group and the legislation now before us far more relevant in the eyes of the public. I need merely mention Enron and WorldCom and some of the dotcom failures and fiascos. The public has in recent years seen large-scale financial disasters caused by bad management, bad directors and bad auditing. People now feel that there is a very strong need for such legislation, though they may not have felt that five, six or seven years ago. Those companies which <Col N="1190" /> collapsed, primarily in the US, would have had subsidiaries operating in Ireland. Some of the accountancy firms which audited them operated in Ireland. We cannot therefore pretend such disasters could never have happened here. There is no difference between circumstances in the US and Ireland. We are fortunate that disasters did not take place in Ireland to the same extent. I know people will list one or two cases where there were major difficulties involving Irish companies, but we will not discuss these now.</P>
    <P>There is one reason for all these disasters, and that is corporate greed. Chief executives and boards of directors were greedy. They wanted to increase the level of their business, their net wealth, their turnover, their share value, their options and so on. Greed was the sole motivating force behind the artificially created figures placing an inordinately high value on intangible assets that were not there when the chips were called in.</P>
    <P>It is part of the human psyche that people are greedy. We must therefore ensure that regulations are in place so that such greed does not translate into false financial statements when presented to an unsuspecting public. The auditors have a key role in this regard. Many business correspondents in the US say more damage was done to the corporate culture in that country as a result of the Enron and WorldCom scandals than by various terrorist attacks. Their mismanagement and corporate greed did more damage to their financial credibility on the world stock exchanges than any other action.</P>
    <P>The auditors involved in the Enron case were Arthur Andersen who also operated out of Ireland. That company ceased operating a few weeks after it was caught shredding its audit files and was rendered in contempt of court proceedings. The entire business community simply walked away from the company overnight. The partners and staff involved had to disperse and find new jobs. The Enron case left a true trail of misery for those who lost money and stocks, the employees, the unsecured creditors and the auditors.</P>
    <P>Something which I learned while training as an auditor and accountant is that an accountancy firm has only one asset, its reputation. The value of its office, company cars, staff or money in the bank means nothing if it does not have a good reputation. It is important that we produce legislation which ensures we operate to the highest possible standards taking account of the integrity and credibility of those involved in preparing and auditing financial information. That is the reason this legislation is before us today. It is now more relevant that when we set out on this road some years ago.</P>
    <P>It is important that the recommendations of the review group on the financial institutions are dealt with by the Minister for Finance in the context of the new legislation on the financial regulatory authority to be introduced by him later this year. That particular aspect is not covered by this <Col N="1191" /> legislation. One of the main objectives of this legislation is to establish the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority whose duty it will be to intervene in the disciplinary process of the accounting bodies when it deems necessary, to carry out investigations of possible breaches of standards of prescribed accountancy bodies by their members and to apply to the courts to compel directors of a company to amend accounts which are not in compliance with the Companies Act. The new authority will have a very clear-cut role and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>On the appointment of the supervisory authority by the Minister, I note that she intends to amend the Bill as a result of the debate in the Seanad. I understand the supervisory board will now comprise up to 14 director members of which up to five may be members of relevant accountancy bodies. The vast majority of people on the supervisory board will be non-members of the accounting profession. Perhaps that is good. I firmly believe, from reports produced by professional organisations, that it is not their view that is important, rather it is how it reads to an unsuspecting member of the public that matters. It is difficult for members of the profession not to have a majority on the board but they will accept the increase in representation announced by the Minister on Committee Stage. Having up to five members on the board is a significant improvement on the current position.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that bodies such as IBEC, ICTU, the Association of Investment Managers, the Stock Exchange and Pensions Board will be able to nominate people to the board. Also included are, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Corporate Enforcement. On first reading, all appears fine. I now wonder if there is a possible conflict between the latter offices and issues that might arise at a future date. For example, the first question that will be asked if the IAASA do not pick up on an a audit scandal involving an issue of corporate enforcement or a breach of Revenue or Central Bank regulations is why the Revenue Commissioners, Central Bank and Director of Corporate Enforcement were represented on that body in the first instance. Those responsible for nominating them to the board will investigate possible breaches by them of the law. We should reconsider that in the light of future breaches to ensure members of the supervisory boards are not required to investigate breaches under the headings mentioned. If there is a good, valid reason for the provision to remain as it is, I will accept it.</P>
    <P>Funding of the supervisory board is to be provided on a 60:40 basis by the Exchequer and accountancy bodies. I understand the Minister has agreed to consult the bodies before agreeing to the imposition of this levy. There are a number of other issues which I wished to raise. However, I will have an opportunity to do so if I attend <Col N="1192" /> the Committee Stage debate which is open to all Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fleming and others referred to changes the Minister proposes to make following the debate in the Seanad six months ago. It is a pity the changes were not made before today to allow us to properly debate this matter. The Deputy also said this Bill was introduced as a result of malpractice on the part of greedy managing directors and so on. Does he agree that greed for power can often lead to malpractice? That can happen closer to home than in companies.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be significant legislation for a long time in terms of Irish business. I am not sure if, in the future, we will regret its introduction or will stand back and pat ourselves on the back. Most of the provisions are required to deal with large companies and their auditors and the legislation will help to instil confidence in the system. I fear the major headaches it will cause for small and medium-sized business. Small businesses are the backbone of the Irish economy particularly in our rural villages and small towns. We need to pave the way for them, not put up barriers. In order to keep control of the big dogs, we hurt the small ones. A few bad eggs often spoil the show for others, not alone in the area of corporate governance but also in the area of alcohol, crime and so on. In trying to get at a few, we get at everybody.</P>
      <P>The Bill will cause great hardship for existing small business and may prevent or discourage new start-ups. It may lead to an elitism of accountants and auditors lining their already plump pockets as small businesses try to cope with all the new laws introduced by this Bill and others. For example, the Meath County Enterprise Board has assisted more than 500 new businesses in the last seven years creating almost 1,000 new jobs. These jobs are sustainable because, unlike the foreign multi-nationals, they do not pack their bags and leave when the tax incentives dry up. They stay and weather the storms and do their best. We need to protect such people.</P>
      <P>I am a member of an enterprise board and have met many entrepreneurs whose backs are to the wall trying to survive the first couple of years in business. I fear that Bills like this might make things a little too hard for them. It will increase audit fees and administration costs and will make the option of becoming a sole trader an easy but riskier alternative. It is not good enough to say people can remain as sole traders. That is not fair because it puts their homes and families at risk. We should encourage people to operate limited companies. I would not like us to introduce a Bill that sneakily pushes people into becoming sole traders. It is difficult to control sole traders so we should try to bring people into the loop rather than put them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I accept this Bill is important legislation for our accountants and <Col N="1193" /> auditors. I support its intent, but I would like to hear from the Minister how she intends to ease the burden of smaller businesses. The Bill brings into effect the recommendations of the review group on auditing established following the inquiry of the Committee of Public Accounts into the DIRT scandal. That scandal rocked the country and proved the need for change to regain the confidence of the public. More recent scandals, such as those involving Enron and WorldCom, have added increased pressure for new controls and regulations.</P>
    <P>However, it is important not to go too far in this area. If regulation becomes too draconian, Ireland will lose out and become unattractive to foreign investors. In addition, many Irish entrepreneurs will think again before becoming involved in the risky world of business. The added costs that will come with new legislation will probably render many small companies uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>The Government has done nothing in the past seven years to protect established businesses and industries, such as furniture and carpeting, from ever increasing competition from abroad and increasing costs, be it insurance, electricity, staff and so on. Rather than solve these problems it proposes to add more costs and burdens.</P>
    <P>The gist of the report of the review group is the need for a new model to regulate the accountancy profession. Some change was needed as the existing model is based on self-regulation by the profession. While the majority of the members of the various accountancy bodies, such as the Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, are honourable and decent women and men, bad eggs always seem to emerge. In view of this, a system of self-regulation is not always satisfactory and is certainly not perfect. It can create the wrong perception and leaves room for questioning and doubt.</P>
    <P>Self-regulation happened because it suited those involved. The members of the profession, the customers and the Government were happy with the service being provided. However, change is needed. Doubtless there was much debate on how far the new form of regulation should go, including the question of complete regulation by the State. The form proposed in the Bill is satisfactory. A model which allows the State to play a greater role in regulation while not taking over all aspects of it is sufficient.</P>
    <P>A major benefit of self-regulation was the avoidance of direct cost to the taxpayer. The proposal to establish the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority will allow for an examination of how accountancy bodies undertake self-regulation. I hope the new authority will ensure that the right procedures and processes are in place and that fair, independent decisions are made. This should go a long way to preventing bad practice, either on purpose or through error, and will help to prevent dodgy or creative accounting practices. It should also go a <Col N="1194" /> long way to dispel the concerns of members of the public that they are being exploited.</P>
    <P>The perception of accountants and auditors looking after themselves will be gone as &ldquo;chaps regulating chaps&rdquo; is no longer good enough. Deputies have highlighted that it will still be very difficult to prevent those who do not hold membership of any of the accountancy bodies from portraying themselves as accountants. This is quite common and can lead to many problems, both for the customer and the image of the accountancy profession. I look forward to the Minster of State's views on this. It is easy for a person to pass himself or herself off as an accountant because after a few years studying on an accountancy course and working alongside some fully trained accountant, one could easily perform the functions required by small businesses or personal clients. I studied an accountancy course for a couple of years and am regularly approached by people asking me to do their accounts. I am not fully trained, nor am I a member of any organisation. Most people want to get the job done and as cheaply as possible. They are not aware of the various accountancy bodies and the importance of membership of them. In view of this it is important that people's credentials are checked before they are hired.</P>
    <P>This issue needs to be addressed, especially as the legislation might discourage potential practising accountants from joining a professional body because of the regulations in place. Perhaps a good advertising campaign, similar to the current campaign warning of fraudulent practices in the insurance industry, alerting the public to the dangers of rogue accountants might be sufficient. It would make people aware of the pitfalls and alert them to the fact that the chances of follow-up services are poor if they employ an accountant who is not regulated.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the new legislation is to increase regulation and red tape at a time when we should be looking at ways to reduce the burdens these impose. It is a matter of having regulation at the right price. We want to encourage and help small businesses, not discourage them.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the proposed audit exemption thresholds. A figure below &euro;1 million is too low. It is crazy that consideration is being given to a figure of approximately &euro;317,000 when the figure in Northern Ireland is £1 million and £1.27 million in the United Kingdom, with proposals to increase the limit to over £4 million. We should level the playing field to give domestic companies a fair chance to compete on the European and world stage. I understand the Minister of State is considering a change to the threshold figure, which is to be welcomed. While we wish to send out a clear message that Ireland is taking the lead in this area, we must apply common sense. We do not want to create a situation where Ireland becomes less competitive and less attractive to inward investment.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides for strict compliance statements to be prepared and signed by <Col N="1195" /> members of boards of directors, many of whom act as mentors on behalf of their communities. This provision could lead to a brain drain from the boards. While I understand why it is proposed, it must be asked if it is going too far. Some local credit unions have huge turnovers. If their directors are to be compelled to sign these statements they may prefer to resign. Many of them are not professionals but local community activists with a good solid head on their shoulders. They have chosen to represent their communities on these boards. If they are to be subject to this requirement they will not become involved. There is a need to reconsider this aspect.</P>

      <P>In another life I almost became an accountant. The education system tends to encourage students to follow examination results rather than vocational choices. Eventually I found myself stumbling towards foundation two level examinations for certified public accountancy, at which point I had a road to Damascus conversion and decided on other pursuits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about that. My experience at least instilled in me an ability to read accounts and acquire a fascination with figures, even if these days they are more concerned with election results and football tables.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on auditing and the reaction of the various accountancy bodies says something about the lack of public confidence that has accompanied the presentation of figures, not only in Ireland but globally, including the reaction to the catastrophic events involving Enron and WorldCom. Smaller scale events in this country do not bode well for instilling a sense of public confidence. In view of this, the need to establish the review group and act on its recommendations was unanswerable.</P>
      <P>There will be a need on Committee Stage to ascertain if what is proposed to deal with the review group's recommendations is appropriate in all circumstances. I noted with interest Deputy Fleming's remarks. While I escaped the accountancy profession, many of my friends stayed in it, some becoming gamekeepers turned poachers when they became finance officers with various companies.</P>
      <P>Many accountants are one-person operations, many are in partnerships while others are involved in unlimited liability situations. It must be asked, therefore, if the additional responsibility to be imposed on them is appropriate. There should be a more graded approach to deal with different types of accountancies and accountants. Accountants I know tend to specialise in certain areas. Some are involved solely in the social economy and have no involvement in widespread commercial activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years the State has rightly developed accounting mechanisms to account for how State <Col N="1196" /> money has been allocated, such as the FÁS and community employment schemes. Audits are produced at a cost of &euro;200 to &euro;400 per audit. However, they are often done on a voluntary basis because of the trouble involved for the accountant concerned. It amounts to an additional cost for many of the largely voluntary organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions to deal with the auditing requirements of charities, but there is a need to question if the requirements are commensurate with the scale of activities undertaken by charities or voluntary organisations and the accountants or accountancy firms who choose to deal with them.</P>
    <P>According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, Ireland is likely to have the toughest regulatory regime as a result of the legislation, but that is hyperbole. Even if it were true, what of it? The highest standards are needed, given that Ireland is competing in the global market as it tries to encourage people to invest here. Nod and wink accountancy should not be the norm. If foreign companies locate here, they should account for what they produce and their profits. The review group is to be congratulated in this regard. The Minister of State has adopted the correct approach, subject to my caveat regarding the size of firms.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, earlier discussed the Revenue Commissioners' dealings with banks. There has been a number of controversies in recent years relating to National Irish Bank, the Ansbacher Cayman deal and the DIRT inquiry. These scandals highlighted failures in auditing and accounting. Sometimes banks were audited by the Central Bank, while on other occasions individual accountants advised clients to invest money in different ways to avoid tax. This is the Irish equivalent of the Enron and Worldcom scandals. Money slipped out of the system and double standards operated. The accountancy profession, even through its representative bodies, was found lacking by not asking questions that needed to be asked about proper standards. That is why I am disappointed by the reaction of the ICAI.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of the review group and the Minister that the introduction of the legislation puts Ireland ahead of other jurisdictions in this area. Our nearest neighbour is lagging behind us, even though it suffered as a result of the behaviour of the large accountancy firm, Arthur Andersen, a major contributor to the Enron scandal. The IAASA must act as a proper policing authority to strike off individuals and firms. It is an international scandal that the firm of Arthur Andersen is still operating. I am not sure whether the company still conducts business in Ireland but it established different companies in individual countries while still operating as part of an international conglomerate that observed unacceptable standards. Hopefully, the supervisory authority will demand better standards.</P>
    <P>The reason the authority will not be established <Col N="1197" /> on a statutory footing is beyond me. This will compromise its independence in terms of achieving better accounting and auditing standards. The provision of a limited guarantee mechanism to companies suggests that, on ideological grounds, the Minister of State wants the authority to be regulated as a public private partnership. If the Government intends to go down this road in regard to independent regulators of other professions, such as the legal profession, I am not sure this model lends itself to making bodies more politically accountable to Ministers and the House. This mechanism might be an attempt to make sure there is less political accountability, although it is promoted in such a way as to pretend it has greater independence.</P>
    <P>The use of regulators for many services under competitive pressures highlights an inability of Members to ask the correct questions to ensure those who act as regulators are properly brought to account. The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority was established recently. No mechanism has been provided for the Oireachtas to question its operations, whether that is through the House, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service or the Committee of Public Accounts. The same applies to the communications regulator and other regulators who have been appointed over the past ten years, ostensibly to ensure undue political influence is not brought to bear. However, that has been done at the expense of proper political accountability. I am sceptical, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation by the Minister of State, as this mechanism may remove further powers of accountability from the House, which would be unfortunate.</P>
    <P>While the authority is a partnership between various State bodies and ministerial representatives, a significant number of representatives of the accountancy profession will be appointed. It is only a marginal move away from self-regulation. The authority will comprise 13 members &ndash; I do not know whether that bodes ill for its future &ndash; and many of the appointees will be accountants and auditors. That will make it difficult for the authority to establish itself and gain the public confidence it needs to make sure the profession is going about its work independently and with integrity.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is generally happy a stronger framework will be implemented because it is necessary in terms of international standards and in terms of generating greater confidence in how standards are applied nationally. We are concerned the legislation will be a broad brush stroke, which will disproportionately affect those who do not engage in commercial activity. The structure of the proposed authority and the new mechanism that has been devised undermine our ability to question it effectively and make it politically accountable. Significant representation of the accountancy profession on the authority means it is a halfway house between self-regulation and what might be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> I hope these issues will be teased out on Committee Stage and the legislation will put Ireland ahead of other jurisdictions in terms of setting standards for the accountancy profession. The challenge is to make sure the best standards are implemented and do not have to be revisited so that the legislation remains in place a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to contribute to this debate and to welcome this important legislation, the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003. I have often heard it said that the public sector is wasteful of public funds. Some people claim there is no accountability in respect of how public funds are spent. Since being appointed Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, however, I have realised that the levels of accountability and responsibility that apply to the expenditure of taxpayers' funds in the State are very high. If most private commercial entities were subject to the same levels of scrutiny and assessment as the Comptroller and Auditor General exercises over public entities, I assure the House there would be far less corporate fraud or white-collar corruption. While the system of public accountability is not perfect, it has considerably more merit than some private sector models.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. I hope the authority will function effectively to ensure that auditors and accountants operate to the highest possible standards. An independent regulatory entity that operates effectively and efficiently is an essential prerequisite for the maintenance of the highest possible standards in corporate life.</P>
      <P>The need for this legislation is perhaps a sad reflection of the deterioration in professional standards. The role of professionals as an unassailable and trustworthy bulwark of commercial life has been seriously dented by recent scandals. This is due, in part, to an increase in greed and a general deterioration in ethics and professional standards. In another sense, it is due to increased competition in professional services where price is not the only currency traded. Some clients may prefer to use advisers who are prepared to cut corners and to turn a blind eye. As a society, we need to address and tackle this tendency with vigour.</P>
      <P>Mr. Frank Daly, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, stated clearly at today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that any tax evasion on the part of the banks will be dealt with very decisively in future. The role of financial advisers and the financial institutions in accommodating those who wish to avoid paying tax, for example by recommending ways of evading tax through off-shore bank accounts, will be examined. Those who aid and abet tax evasion on the part of banks will be prosecuted in the courts and may be liable for imprisonment. It is certainly a very solid approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that a great deal of tax evasion has been encouraged and accommodated by financial <Col N="1199" /> institutions was clearly evident today. The Bank of Ireland's off-shore accounts in Jersey were focused on the evasion of tax, which cannot be condoned. I was delighted Mr. Daly put down a clear marker today that any future accommodation of tax evasion on the part of financial advisers or the State's financial institutions will be dealt with in a very decisive manner. Such action is very much needed.</P>
    <P>I hope the new culture of compliance being created in response to the recent scandals can operate in a proportionate and balanced manner. It is important that the new regulations and the system of supervision do not stifle initiative or enterprise. The costs of compliance should not be prohibitive. In this sense, we need to review some of the regulatory controls and requirements that we impose on small enterprises. It is ludicrous to expect a small family company to be subject to the same compliance requirements as a large plc. Balance is needed in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is important that we pursue the concept of effective but simple control. Many small companies cannot afford to employ an in-house accountant and may depend on secretarial back-up. It is critically important that they are not burdened by bureaucracy. Managers should not have to fill out many forms.</P>
    <P>The controls the Government puts in place should be simple. The State is becoming very bureaucratic. People feel that power is being exerted on the lower levels by the higher levels. It is important that we achieve a balance in this regard. The rules relating to VAT, PRSI and PAYE should be simple. The regulatory reforms and accounting procedures deemed necessary for small, private and owner-managed operations should provide for a clear distinction between a company and a family-owned concern. The latter type of operation may not benefit from the protections enjoyed by a company. People who take certain risks in their operations may not be prepared to enter into the company structure.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Frank Daly, said there should be total compliance in respect of outstanding tax arrears. There has been a considerable tax write-off. In May of this year the level of outstanding taxes was &euro;1.3 billion. It will be impossible to collect some &euro;750 million of this figure, as it has been outstanding for more than ten years. The Revenue Commissioners might be best advised to write off this inherited debt, given that good compliance and accountancy procedures are about to be put in place. The commissioners should accept that they will be unable to get the money. Some &euro;1.5 billion in outstanding taxes was owed to the State in May 2002, a figure that decreased to &euro;1.3 billion by May 2003. The difference, which was written off by the Revenue Commissioners, was &euro;178 million. The reduction between 2002 and 2003 was &euro;200 million. There was a difference of &euro;8 million. In a real sense, the difference was not actually the amount that was reduced, but the <Col N="1200" /> revenue that was written off by the Revenue Commissioners. In terms of accountancy practice, one has to face the reality that the system needs to be cleared out.</P>
    <P>I hope the new authority will retain its original objective of maintaining the high level of standards that, I am sure, exists in the accountancy and auditing professions. The authority should ensure that standards are not compromised. That should be the authority's bottom line if it is to achieve its objective.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomes the chance to debate this Bill which, as Deputy Hogan said, is vitally important. It brings into effect the recommendations of the review group on auditing, which sat between February and July 2000 and was ably chaired by Senator Joe O'Toole. The review group was established following the inquiry of the Committee of Public Accounts into DIRT. The group was asked to address a number of issues, including the regulation of accountants and the independence of auditors. The Minister of State spoke about these issues at some length. This is a critical test. The fact that up to &euro;1 billion will be collected as a result of the DIRT inquiry is a great achievement. The Revenue Commissioners and all involved in the DIRT inquiry should be commended. One of my esteemed colleagues was involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>They did a great service for the nation. The Comptroller and Auditor General has also given extraordinary service to a process that will earn up to &euro;1 billion for the Exchequer. The foundation of this Bill has come from the DIRT inquiry. It is clear that lessons have been learned.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to establish the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, which will have powers to supervise the functions of recognised accountancy bodies. The review group concluded that we need to move to a new model of regulating the accountancy profession. The existing model is based, effectively, on complete self-regulation by the profession. Such self-regulation is very hard to control. That model developed over the years for two reasons. The accountancy profession wanted self-regulation and successive Governments and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment were happy to give this responsibility to the profession. There are difficulties with self-regulation.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we have a totally independent body. The Government did not seem to have the inclination or desire to invest the necessary resources to carry out an effective regulatory role. It was perfectly happy for accountants to regulate themselves. The review group on auditing decided that this had to change and, as a consequence, this Bill is before the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party has a number of concerns in regard to the Bill. As my party spokesman pointed out, over 95% of companies are small <Col N="1201" /> owner-dominated companies comprising the two persons who are allotted shares on a company being incorporated. These companies rely on accounting auditors to assist them in the area of tax compliance and company filing obligations. The statutory obligations on limited companies are huge. The Companies Registration Office is doing a good job. It is important that a company be struck off within a certain period if accounts are not filed on time.</P>
    <P>It is an inappropriate response to the DIRT inquiry and scandals such as Enron and Élan, that the auditors of small companies would be culpable under the proposed legislation under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. These scandals involved a small number of large companies &ndash; known as the big five &ndash; which carried out audits of publicly quoted holding companies and their associated companies and branches. What took place was completely fraudulent. The extent to which the principles of corporate governance was ignored is unbelievable. Private investors lost huge sums of money which they invested on the basis of the recommendation and certification of such companies.</P>
    <P>Those major companies with international link chains did a serious injustice to the accounting profession. The majority of accountants in small practices are of the view that the &euro;317,000 audit exemption turnover threshold for small companies which was introduced in 1999 should be lifted to a more realistic level.</P>
    <P>The amount of extra work arising from recent and proposed legislative changes is making audits for small companies unaffordable. This unwelcome burden on small businesses will affect their competitiveness. Deputy Boyle referred to small community enterprise companies. Ballymote Show operates as a limited company. It has to spend up to &euro;500 to audit a turnover of less than &euro;400,000. This is wrong and I hope the Minister of State will take this point on board. There should be some exemptions where the company is a voluntary community-oriented one. A certain limitation could be placed on turnover. Communities have failed to secure grants for pitches because their accounts were not fully compliant. I urge the Minister to examine this area with the aim of securing a derogation for this sector, subject to certain controls, as it has driven the country's success. The work of voluntary community groups is critical to the economy.</P>
    <P>Community enterprise companies are usually limited by guarantee. They are development companies solely for community use and should not require a full audit or certificate of compliance. A limited community company with which I am familiar had to pay &euro;7,000 for an audit. The level of accountancy charges needs to be examined. There is a wide variation in the scale of charges. In the same way as it is hard to extricate oneself from an insurance company, it is also hard to change one's accountancy firm. If one makes an insurance claim one is locked in with the company as no other company is willing to take on <Col N="1202" /> the risk. It is difficult to get documentation released by accountancy firms and, as a result, one becomes locked in.</P>
    <P>All companies start out small, possibly as risky start-up enterprises. Due to the legal exposure on directors and auditors, entrepreneurs will be more likely to set up ventures in less punitive jurisdictions where legislation, quite properly, sets out the role of the auditors as a watchdog rather than a bloodhound. There is a big difference between the two.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party believes that the obvious and most realistic amendment to the proposed Bill is to increase the audit exemption turnover threshold to a more realistic and commercial level. A sum of &euro;300,000 amounts to a weekly turnover of only &euro;6,000 per week. That is a low figure for any business and could be generated from the sale of postage stamps or greeting cards. The EU fourth directive of 1978 did not make a distinction between small companies for accounts filing purposes as against audit exemption purposes. In the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986, the requirements to file a balance sheet defined a small company as having a turnover of not more than £3.17 million, which is a considerable turnover. The 1999 Act ought to have stayed loyal to the definition of small company under the previous Act. This issue needs to be examined by the Minister. There is no parity in regard to the auditing exemption.</P>
    <P>Research into exemption thresholds in other European countries clearly highlights the fact that ours is significantly lower than most of our neighbours. We need to aim for harmonisation with Northern Ireland, let alone Europe. In Northern Ireland the current threshold for turnover is £1 million compared to &euro;317,000 here. A company trading in Newry with a turnover of £900,000 is not statutorily required to have an audit while a company trading across the Border in Dundalk with the same level of turnover is required to do so, thereby incurring additional costs. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who is from Donegal is familiar with the competitiveness issue in regard to Donegal versus Derry. This provision will hardly produce a climate conducive to cross-Border trade or an all-Ireland economy. I understand that a consultation paper has been published in the North suggesting that the threshold be increased from £1 million to about £4.8 million and that this is under consideration. This would put us at a clear disadvantage. The Minister of State might have some preliminary thoughts on this matter. I look forward to it being dealt with on Committee Stage. The Border counties are being put under pressure. There is currently a massive exodus in many areas. I look forward to debating this further and making amendments.</P>
    <P>The proposed change to accountancy procedures is very much to be welcomed. It is important that the role of accountants be clearly monitored. The issue of derogations for community-based enterprises needs to be examined. <Col N="1203" /> This is a visionary Bill which is far ahead of developments in the UK. We should implement the best possible template for future procedures in this area. What happened in the United States with the big five companies clearly damaged the credibility of auditing and total compliance with legislation is paramount.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Purcell, and the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners speak of the accommodation by big banks of tax evasion. A clear message went out today from the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to the matter of the accommodation by State financial institutions. This cannot be tolerated and those involved will be liable to prosecution and imprisonment. This is not half good enough for them because many innocent victims opened accounts that were implicated in the DIRT inquiry and they were accommodated and encouraged by banks to do so. This has led to a huge amount of difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We should recognise the origins of this Bill which springs from the famous DIRT inquiry referred to by previous speakers. We should also recognise the late former Deputy Jim Mitchell who chaired the proceedings at the time. Deputy Rabbitte, former Deputy Seán Doherty, former Deputy Denis Foley, Deputy Ardagh and my humble self soldiered with him. Because of the dedication of the Chairman and the single-mindedness with which he pursued his objective, we crammed into five or six months an inquiry that would probably have taken five or six years in another arena. The total cost was approximately &euro;1 million while the net returns are approaching &euro;1 billion. This is an example of how, in spite of shortcomings in the Oireachtas, its simple, humble Members were able to carry out a function at a much lower cost than would have arisen elsewhere. There was far less fuss and dramatic results.</P>
      <P>We need to remember the efforts of the late Jim Mitchell during the DIRT inquiry and the work he did as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. It was sad that he lost his seat in the subsequent general election and that he passed on. I do not know if there is a salutary lesson for us in this but one would have always expected that there should be some reward for one's efforts. Jim Mitchell certainly did not receive it when he was alive. Let us hope he will be remembered for his work.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts was way ahead of its time in respect of what happened and continues to happen in other jurisdictions. It was way ahead in identifying the kernel of the problem. The reports produced as a result of the DIRT inquiry, now before us, serve as a clear example that we, in this small jurisdiction, were able to recognise the dangers of what had happened and what was liable to happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> We sat in committee over a period of about 18 months considering the Companies Bill 1990. It was most intricate legislation to eliminate mismanagement of an accountancy nature. This obviously did not happen. Despite the best inputs from some of the most highly qualified in the country during the consideration of that Bill, it was regarded as having shortcomings only five years after its enactment. It is intended that the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 will do its job but it can only do so if the conditions and regulations laid down are observed to the letter.</P>
    <P>During the DIRT inquiry a Sunday newspaper released information to the effect that there was something not entirely right regarding the operation of offshore accounts. All members of the Committee of Public Accounts at the time immediately thought back to ascertain if we had asked the right questions and had been present at the time. This is because some time had elapsed when the disclosure took place. We were all anxious to find out if the questions we had asked were capable of drawing out the relevant information and feared that we might have been negligent in some way. We discovered that we had been present at the time and did ask the right questions. However, if the information that should have been available was not available to the person to whom we were putting the questions, we were at odds and serving no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies today. No matter what regulations we make or what restrictions or obligations we place on those carrying out audits, it is imperative that all relevant information is made available at all times to protect the professionalism and competence of the auditor and the company or companies on whose behalf the auditor is operating. Otherwise, the currency of what is being tendered in a report is of no significance.</P>
    <P>As we progress, it is essential that we recognise the mistakes made in the past and do something about them. We should ensure there is continuity when companies change auditors and that information is carried forward, thus allowing a person doing a subsequent audit to refer to information gleaned previously. Not only should there be an exit report, there should also be one that can be stood over and which will stand up to tests.</P>
    <P>I cannot and will never understand how certain events in Indonesia and the Allfirst scandal happened. With modern technology, it is possible to spot within ten minutes a glitch in a system or something that is happening that should not happen. I cannot understand how up to $700 million went offside, as it were, in Allfirst before anybody found out. When this occurred, the Committee of Public Accounts was told by the Governor of the Central Bank that all that could have been done had been done and that, because the operation was outside the country, it was not possible to access the relevant information in time, despite the fact that the parent company was located in <Col N="1205" /> this jurisdiction and that its overseas activities could have had serious implications for the economy.</P>
    <P>The Allfirst affair was the second major warning we got in this jurisdiction in the past 20 years. The other concerned an insurance subsidiary based in the United Kingdom. They seemed to walk away afterwards, apologise and state there was a slight glitch in the system. What about the victims and those who lose money? The imprisonment of the perpetrators does not do anything for them, nor does it recover all of the jobs lost or the reputations that fall by the wayside as a result of somebody's negligence, deliberate or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I still do not understand how, even under this legislation, we will be able to combat a repetition of what happened in Allfirst. While it will be argued that action was taken, it was similar in nature to that taken after a crime. Prevention is better than the cure and we need to be in a position, with the assistance of modern technology, to create circumstances in which it will be possible to detect a person plotting a misdemeanour before it is executed.</P>
    <P>The accountancy and auditing professions perform certain recognised tests in companies and repeated failure to pass such tests is supposed to set off an alarm. A person who wants to carry out a scam must, therefore, play between the posts, so to speak, which means identifying where tests will be performed and on whom, and trying to avoid them in the hope that by the time detection occurs, it will not make a difference.</P>
    <P>It is no good arguing that illegal practices will occur because the credibility of the economy often rests on the ability of the State to ensure they do not happen. An export-based economy such as this requires the highest possible credit rating. We need to be able to show our competitors and trading partners that we have the best systems in place and have learned from harsh experience here and elsewhere. We have learned from such experiences domestically through the DIRT inquiry and had similar experiences overseas with ICI in the United Kingdom, Allfirst Bank in the United States and countless others.</P>
    <P>Companies which employ a firm of accountants or auditors have a reputation, on which their workforce and management have a right to be able to depend. Their accountancy or auditing firm must not tell them what they want to hear when it suits them, but what they should be doing and how to react to a changing economic climate in order to survive and expand healthily. They also have to warn them about pitfalls, snags, traps and snares &ndash; the facilities for doing so are available &ndash; to ensure other unscrupulous operators are not plotting their downfall and hoping to skim off a couple of hundred million euro before vanishing to sunny climes to indulge themselves for the rest of their lives. This is what infuriates victims. It is bad enough to lose one's life savings and be codded, but what really riles them is that they know the person who planned or plotted the <Col N="1206" /> scam is now living in a Caribbean hideaway where the sun permanently shines and he or she can rely on a steady supply of Cuba Libres under palm trees, while they have to rebuild their lives and companies.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the new agency will be able to lay down strict parameters within which business operates will be determined by how well the agency enforces the rules and the frequency of its checks. I hope we do not have to return to this issue in a few years, as occurred in the case of the Companies Act. I am familiar with that episode because I spent 18 months buried out of sight in a committee across the road. The most awful place one can be is in a committee for a long period without anyone knowing, even if one is legislating. The so-called experts will argue this is what we should be doing all the time &ndash; working out of sight and out of mind. If, however, it emerges after such a lengthy exercise that one was unable to prevent unfortunate events, one feels one has wasted one's time in pursuit of one's objective. One then has a serious problem.</P>
    <P>This legislation could be of considerable benefit to other jurisdictions. While other countries have similar mechanisms, I am not certain they work. If they did, why did the scams of recent years occur? A speaker on the Government side referred to corporate greed, which is a feature of today's society. Greed in general, not only corporate greed, is rampant in society. This is a sad development which reflects on all of us. A tendency has emerged for people to compete to make more money faster than ever before. Once one is seen to get away with doing so, everybody else wants to get on the bandwagon and although this is human nature, it does not do us any good. I am sure the Minister and Deputies present can recall many circumstances in recent years where getting greedy was not such a good thing. Ultimately, everybody pays a price.</P>
    <P>The legislation will transfer the powers of the Minister over recognised accountancy bodies under the Companies Acts to the new supervisory authority. I welcome the change from having two Ministers with direct responsibility for this area to a single body with overall responsibility. The potential problem lies in whether the new body will be effective. The tendency nowadays is to create another body every time one encounters a difficulty. As the office of the Ceann Comhairle will inform Members, these bodies are not answerable to the House and Deputies who table questions about them are informed that the relevant Minister has no official responsibility for the body in question. While we have all complained about this, when in power, all parties have created new bodies with specific functions, for which the relevant Minister was not accountable to the House.</P>

      <P>Time runs out, regardless of how <Col N="1207" /> much one is enjoying oneself. The Minister for Finance will have some responsibilities and I hope he will not run away from them in future or deny that an issue is his problem. We have to prevent problems from occurring and tackle them as they arise.</P>
      <P>As regards the requirement on companies to disclose non-audit fees to auditors, this issue was addressed extensively during the DIRT inquiry. It was devised by companies as a method of saying &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to auditing companies and <i>vice versa.</i> Although it should not have created difficulties, we felt it did. I hope this Bill is sufficient to do the job required and that we have learned lessons from the past.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, it will be possible through this legislation to counter the type of thing that happened with Allfirst. We were told that it could not be done at the time and that the type of body proposed in the Bill might not be able to do it either. If we cannot do that, we still have a problem. If it should transpire that the assets of a major player in the international arena can be siphoned from this country by an overseas subsidiary, it will present serious problems which we might have to revisit in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. I cannot claim to have examined the Bill in detail but during a recent visit to the owners of a number of small industries I was given their reaction in strong terms and heard their anxieties about how they will be affected if the legislation is implemented as proposed. The Minister agreed to introduce amendments to the Bill as a result of the debate that took place in the Seanad. Perhaps those amendments or amendments put down in the Dáil will ease the burden on small companies.</P>
      <P>My constituency depends on small companies and these companies depend on being able to compete with their counterparts across the Border. This can be a distance of one or a few miles. That is where these companies have their labour base and anything that affects it is extremely serious. Some days ago I spoke to a person who has been in business for more than 20 years. The company exports most of its products to the UK and further afield. It is already under serious pressure because it does not have access to broadband. I put down a parliamentary question about it but I was told that nobody knows when it will be available. It might come down from the sky but there are no plans to provide it. The company will have to pay for some type of service which will allow it to continue in business. If it cannot get its product specifications onto somebody's desk in Germany or elsewhere when it is needed, it will lose business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This small company in Magheracloone in County Monaghan has worked extremely hard to reach its current position. It wants to use modern technology but cannot because the systems are not available. We were discussing this on the way <Col N="1208" /> to the company office but the issue that caused the company's owner even greater concern was this Bill. He has to travel to the UK, Germany and other countries to promote his product but, if this Bill becomes law, he will have to sign, as a director, that he is responsible for everything. The Minister is shaking his head, but it is important that he makes this clear in the Bill. This is a genuine example of somebody who dreads the Bill's provisions. I have not fully digested its provisions and neither had this company owner because he is so busy dealing with the other aspects of his business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is most important. He and his wife run the business. They employ approximately 40 people, depending on production levels.</P>
      <P>A couple of miles down the road from that company, a young man set up his own company in his father's farmyard. He moved from that to a small industrial estate in Carrickmacross. He built a new factory, for which he received no grant aid. The first imposition he faced was a rates bill of &euro;8,500. He, too, is extremely worried about how he could possibly know the more than 400 regulations with which he must comply. They range from environment to transport. We must ensure that businesses such as this do not have too many impositions put on them as a result of trying to tackle major blackguardism by people in a different area.</P>
      <P>When I was involved with farm organisations, I visited the then Minister for Agriculture to discuss the Finance Bill at that time. Under the Bill, farmers would have had to produce audited accounts. The Minister said he would not worry about that; that he is an auditor and it is not a big job to do that. That was the attitude to accountancy in years gone by. We need to change it and whatever mechanisms are necessary should be put in place. However, they should not be over the top for small businesses.</P>
      <P>Recently, I have had to deal with a number of clients who made a few pounds during the 1980s and were advised by their banks' staff to invest their money elsewhere. Tax levels here were high and interest rates were higher elsewhere. These ordinary people came to my office in desperation. They will have to pay an accountant a large sum of money to reconcile their books and show how much interest and penalties they owe. However, they were innocent parties. They were doing what they were advised to do, although I accept that these matters need to be tightened up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue I wish to deal with is community schemes. Other Members have mentioned this previously. Communities are being asked to provide all sorts of accounts and it is costing them a fortune. Some small groups have to pay up to &euro;6,000 to have their accounts prepared. In the farming sector, up to this year it was possible to fill a simple 111 or 112 form and have it accepted. <Col N="1209" /> That has now become an extremely detailed form. We must be careful not to go over the top and expect small businesses in industry, farming or other sectors to comply with legislation that is directed at other people.</P>
    <P>I understand that the figure covered by the legislation is in the region of &euro;370,000. In Northern Ireland the figure is much higher. People in the Border areas have suffered a great deal of trauma over the last number of years. Could these figures not be arrived at on an all-island basis so that people in the South will not have to meet criteria at a lower or different level from people in the North? I understand the figure in the North is £1 million while the figure in the Republic is &euro;370,000, although I am open to correction. There is cross-Border agreement on tourism and in other sectors. It is important to have a similar structure on both sides of the Border in order that we do not create an impediment that will force people to create jobs north of the Border rather than south. I am aware of one good business in the south Monaghan area that was anxious to build a second factory in the county. It opted for Enniskillen instead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities fund their expenditure, including expenditure on pay, from a variety of sources, including specific State grants, commercial rates, rents, fees and charges for services and general purpose grants from the local government fund. The issue of benchmarking costs, as with all other current expenditure demands, will fall to be dealt with by local authorities in the context of their annual budgetary process. The amount available from the local government fund will be settled in the context of my Department's Estimates of expenditure for 2004, and I will advise local authorities of their general purpose allocations for 2004 as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Benchmarking costs were among issues discussed at a meeting I attended with the County and City Managers Association in May 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the cost to local authorities will be between &euro;160 mill<Col N="1210" /> ion and &euro;200 million? Does he agree that Dublin City Council will face a bill of about &euro;20 million; Cork County Council, about &euro;8 million, and Cork City Council, about &euro;4 million? Is he serious in suggesting that local authorities should fund this enormous financial burden from their own resources? Does he agree that there is only one way around the problem, namely, that local authorities increase charges for refuse collection and development and substantially increase commercial rates, cut services or jobs? What other formula is available to meet the enormous bill if he reneges on funding local authorities for a deal done at national level in which they had no input?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I might agree with the Deputy's first assertion but certainly not his second point. As he well knows, local authority funds come from many sources. In 2004 total expenditure on local authorities will be of the order of &euro;3.4 billion on the current side. We must put costs to local authorities in context. The figure I have for next year is about &euro;140 million. While we should not argue the point, that is the more accurate figure. Local authority managers and many councillors have obviously raised the issue with me. I have no doubt that it is a challenge to the local authority system. I am involved in the Estimates process and will see what the outcome is in the weeks ahead. As soon as we have agreement, I will obviously let the local authorities know the position with regard to assisting them in the normal way to meet all of their costs as much as I can, particularly through the local government fund, which, as the Deputy knows, is the main source of funding from the State for local government. As he is well aware, the fund has increased over the last four to five years by almost 95%, a massive increase. The fund is a key element of the way in which local authorities find the resources to spend on important issues and projects. I reiterate that current expenditure for local authorities next year is nearly &euro;3.5 billion, of which, I believe, around 40% goes on wages and salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that we have 1.28 million households and that the cost of benchmarking will impose a minimum cost of around &euro;125 on each one if it is passed on to them? Will he confirm that he has suggested to the managers of local authorities that they increase development charges on house construction at the planning stage and that there is a proposal to introduce a development charge of anything between &euro;4,000 and &euro;10,000 per house? Does he agree that, if this is correct, it will be passed on to house purchasers and an enormous burden on those struggling to buy their first home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say absolutely to the Deputy that I have not told the local authorities under any heading how they should raise money to pay for benchmarking. That is entirely a matter for <Col N="1211" /> each local authority in its own area, and they have all sorts of options open to them. The second issue which the Deputy raises concerns the planning Acts. It is right &ndash; something I believed the House would support &ndash; that services being provided by the State and public sector through local authorities for developers should reflect the true costs. Equally, there is an onus on developers to work with local authorities to ensure good community facilities are also capable of being provided. One of the arguments we have had in this House for many years concerns the mistakes made in the 1970s and 1980s, when we built huge estates with no supporting infrastructure, particularly of the community kind. Each local authority will examine this in its own way. They are all engaged in it. Obviously, there must be fairness and reality in whatever charges are made but some of the figures I have seen in the newspapers are incorrect in that local authorities have very substantial charges, fees and levies when granting planning permission. The figures are being correlated to produce one total but people are ignoring the fact that almost all of it is probably charged under different headings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall Government policy on rural housing is set out in the national spatial strategy, published in November 2002. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the strategy aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies, ensuring key assets in rural areas are protected to support the quality of life and also ensuring rural settlement policies are responsive to the local circumstances in different areas. It is of particular importance, as the Taoiseach and I have made clear, that we cater for those who have roots in an area and make an economic contribution to it. It is vitally important that there be certainty and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy in the matter through their development plans and in the operation of the development <Col N="1212" /> control system under planning legislation. That is the purpose of the guidelines under the planning and development Act which I intend to introduce to deal with the issue. They are at an advanced stage of preparation, and I hope to issue them as a public consultation document before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The guidelines will also be aimed, through the operation of the planning system, at securing greater public awareness of the issues involved in rural settlement policies and greater consensus on their practical implementation. Given the approach I am taking to the proposed guidelines, I have no proposals to appoint a commission to examine the matter, nor is it proposed to deal with it by amending primary legislation.</P>

      <P>This matter will be brought forward and I will probably then have two choices. Due to the narrow way in which the question is framed and because under the Planning Acts I can bring forward guidelines to deal specifically with this, I can do so on a narrow basis.</P>
      <P>The second question then arises as to whether I need a totally separate planning Bill for other issues and I am not certain about that at this stage. I want to make that clear because there seems to be some confusion about two planning Bills. I am waiting for all the assessments to be done and, as the Deputy knows, I have other matters to consider which are the subject of consultation at present.

Will the Minister take all those views on board before issuing guidelines? Will he consider waste management and infrastructural requirements? He should take these views on board before diving in opportunistically before a local election to catch as many votes as possible without thinking the problem through. Even at this stage will the Minister consider setting up a commission of short duration which would consult all views to create an informed approach to this very complex problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to do something about this matter. The policy was set out under the national spatial strategy and it is quite clear what that policy is. I am going to refine that policy on foot of <Col N="1214" /> all the different elements around the country but the one thing I cannot do &ndash; and any Minister would be foolish to do so &ndash; is to prescribe an absolutist position on one-off housing for the entire country. What is required in Dublin may be very different from what is required in Kerry. This work is done and I do not need a commission to go off and do something else, telling me what I and other Deputies know &ndash; that the differences of interpretation of existing rules in this area are far too wide.</P>
      <P>One difficulty is that in Ireland, a country with a population of less than four million people, we have 88 separate planning authorities. If we were to start off again, we might not have quite so many. Before anyone jumps up to say I am going to get rid of the various planning authorities, I am not, but correlation among them is very difficult.</P>
      <P>We have heard all the views and the position is very clear on one-off rural housing. Those who are born, reared, working, living or moving to an area in order to make an economic contribution to that area should, within reason, be entitled to build a house in that area while fulfilling the normal criteria for anyone moving into a house. My view is that people are entitled to live in the countryside. I do not have any problem with that and providing we get over some of the issues in this area, such as waste management issues which can now be dealt with, we can have a proper rural settlement policy. However, there has been a view in Ireland for far too long that one can object to anything one wants.</P>
      <P>I emphasise one final point &ndash; this is fundamentally different to people arriving from urban centres in Ireland to build holiday homes all over the place. That is not necessarily making an economic contribution to an area and we have some examples of areas where, because of that practice, local people are unable to buy land on which to buy houses because of the way costs are driven up by those building holiday homes. That is a different issue.</P>

      <P>I want to be clear on this. The Minister is telling us today there is to be no change in the law on one-off housing, that there has been no change in Government policy on one-off rural housing since the publication of the national spatial strategy and that there will not be a change in Government policy on the matter. The only thing he is going to do is produce guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can he reconcile the two contradictions in his statement? On one hand he says the situation is very different in different parts of the country but on the other hand he is going to produce guidelines for what he calls consistency. How do we reconcile that? How is he going to produce guidelines for every local authority when situations differ from area to area, which he acknowledges himself? Can he confirm to the House that my understanding of his reply is correct &ndash; that there is to be no change in the law on one-off housing and that there is no change in Government policy <Col N="1215" /> on one-off housing? If that is the case, what on earth was the Taoiseach talking about in Sligo?</P>

    <P>The second point is that people are now moving into different areas of the country, setting up <Col N="1216" /> businesses or working as part of major infrastructural developments, who would like the choice of building in those areas. They should be allowed to build houses.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he is taking to ensure a multimillion euro budget response for the damage resulting from at least 20 landslides in the Inver, Pollathomas area of north Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23694/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as my Department is responsible, I intend to provide the maximum assistance to the people affected by the landslide at Pollathomas, County Mayo, and to the county council in its efforts to restore the infrastructure of the area. First, my Department will recoup to Mayo County Council, 90% of the cost necessarily incurred in providing emergency accommodation for the families who were displaced from their homes. I understand initially some 16 families were housed in emergency accommodation and this number is now reduced to seven.</P>
      <P>I have also received a preliminary assessment of the damage to roads and bridges in the area and I understand that Mayo County Council has carried out interim repairs on the damaged roads and bridges to the extent that most roads in the area are now accessible. My Department is liaising with the county council on the preparation of a programme of works for the permanent reinstatement of the road and bridge infrastructure damaged by the landslide.</P>
      <P>Funding for the carrying out of the necessary repairs to roads and bridges, as an exceptional arrangement, will be provided by my Department under the non-national roads programme. The level of funding to be provided in 2003 and 2004 will be determined when a full assessment of the damage is available, which I am awaiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is a CLÁR and Gaeltacht area, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has indicated that some funding for necessary infrastructural work may be provided by his Department. In particular, he has indicated to <Col N="1217" /> Mayo County Council that some funding can be provided for the reinstatement of the graveyard. The council has now indicated that the protective work in the vicinity of the graveyard has been completed and the graveyard re-opened.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided to initiate an <i>ex gratia </i>scheme of humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship caused to individual householders by the landslide at Pollathomas. The scheme will be administered through the Office of Public Works with aid distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society, as the Deputy will be aware occurred previously in similar such incidents. The aim of the scheme will be to provide humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship and not compensation for losses.</P>
    <P>The criteria for determining eligibility for assistance will be similar to previous humanitarian aid schemes, namely, death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to home, loss of income or extreme hardship. Officials in the Office of Public Works will be in touch with the Irish Red Cross Society and Mayo County Council over the next few days with a view to putting the scheme into place with immediate effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. The response by Mayo County Council was magnificent but it could only go so far. It cleared the bridges and the roads. However, the people have debris in their houses which they would like to clear, but they need skips and bins to do that. They also require an independent assessment and they are very concerned about that. It was announced today that this area is an unemployment blackspot, with 40% unemployment. This area was bleeding but now it has been mortally wounded. Therefore, it is important for the people in the area to receive aid.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the details of the aid that will be given. I am aware that when similar assistance was given to people whose houses were damaged in Dublin, that assistance was in the sum of double figures in the thousands, but I heard a whisper that the assistance that will be given to people whose houses were damaged in this area may be in the sum of single figures in the thousands. The damage in this area requires proper assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Independent colleagues who visited Pollathomas told me that there was a rapid response when damage was caused to householders in Dublin. Local authority officials called to the insurance companies concerned. The Government might consider a similar approach in this case because people in Pollathomas have been told that their house insurance premiums will be increased or that their insurance will not be renewed. When similar damage was caused to householders in Dublin, officials in the local authority concerned said the local authority would carry out the necessary work and, therefore, the insurance premiums of the householders concerned would not be affected. A negotiation was <Col N="1218" /> done in that instance and I ask the Minister to consider doing that in this case.</P>
    <P>An independent response is required in this case. Mayo County Council has gone as far as it can in its response. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, co-ordinated a response in the case of the damage caused to householders in Dublin and perhaps he will do the same for the people in this part of Mayo.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the CLÁR programme, for which the budget is small. In this case, at least &euro;10 million worth of damage has been caused to private property. The roads, footpaths and drains have been looked after, but the people have not been looked after. Some 15 families are out of their houses and they cannot return to them. Would it be possible to consider putting in place a fund that could be released under a protocol to avoid a period of waiting for a response? In this case people have been waiting for a long time for a response and the Minister's reply is the first sign of a national response. I welcome it but I would like more details.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that there was not a national response in this case &ndash; the national response was instantaneous. From the moment this landslide happened, the local authority was in contact with my Department. The events that occurred were tragic and could have resulted in serious loss of life but luckily they did not, something for which we are all grateful. From day one, all these assessments have gone on, primarily between my Department and the local authority. The key people are in place and the information is being assessed. We agreed immediately that we would fund 90% of the cost of the accommodation required to rehouse the people affected. We have worked on the assessments. We are working with the county council to ascertain the exact cost of the reinstatement works to help it to fund those works.</P>
      <P>With regard to the humanitarian aid scheme, I want it to be clear that it is being put in place on exactly the same basis as similar previous schemes, including in the case of Dublin, to which the Deputy referred, and other parts of the country. I want to make it clear that this is not a compensation scheme, nor was any previous scheme.</P>
      <P>The insurance companies involved in this instance have a moral and a legal responsibility in this regard. People have legitimately and properly insured their properties and they are entitled to payment by the private sector on foot of their claims. Anything else would be unacceptable or unthinkable. If the insurance companies involved think that the State will ride in shotgun to sort this out, they can think again. It is their duty to pay out in this instance. They have charged these people for their insurance cover over the years, the people have paid for their insurance and they are now entitled to be paid on foot of their claims.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of research showing that approximately 10% to 15% of all lung cancer deaths here are attributable to exposure to radon gas, he will reinstate the radon gas remediation grant scheme, to assist householders to take protective measures against the gas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23693/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Epidemiological studies have shown that naturally occurring radon gas concentrations add to the incidence of lung cancer. While this evidence is derived primarily from studies of miners exposed to radon gas at work, it is supported by the outcome of a number of studies on radon exposure in the home. There is evidence to suggest that long-term exposure to high levels of radon can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer and that the incidence is higher among smokers than non-smokers.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 1267 of 30 September 2003, it would not be practicable in the current budgetary circumstances to provide for Exchequer funding of a radon remediation grant scheme in respect of domestic dwellings. However, upgraded building regulations, introduced in June 1997, require all new houses commencing construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures. The extent of the measures needed depends on whether a house is located in a high radon area. Over the years, through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the Government has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon.</P>
      <P>The RPII has actively encouraged householders in those areas designated as high radon areas to have their homes measured for radon levels if they have not already done so. My Department's booklet, Radon in Existing Buildings &ndash; Corrective Options, provides advice on a range of appropriate remediation options. For example, improved ventilation all year round would be an immediate and non-costly action to prevent the build up of radon gas in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is extraordinary that due to budgetary constraints, and in accordance with figures from his Department, 200 people will be allowed to die from lung cancer this year directly connected to the inhalation of radon gas in their homes? Will the Minister compare that disgraceful negligence by the Government with the brouhaha surrounding the appointment of smoke police to police an area where it is estimated there will be fewer deaths from the inhalation of secondary smoke by workers in hotels and cafes? Will he explain why the 150 people whom it is estimated will die in the catering and entertainment industry from <Col N="1220" /> lung cancer are more important than the 200 people whom it is estimated will die from the inhalation of radon gas in their homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never make a distinction between deaths caused by any dangerous disease. I would not suggest that one group of people is more or less important than another. Everyone is important and precious.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether I will initiate a new scheme of grants. I am not in a position to do so and there is no point in my giving the impression that I am. Simple measures are the most effective in this regard. I refer to proper ventilation in the home. People should avoid a build-up of radon gas by ventilating their properties. Simply opening the window and letting fresh air in and out is a huge and positive contribution. As the Deputy is aware, the Radiological Protection Institute has made available information to people throughout the country as to where it thinks the hot spots are located. People can take remedial action if they see fit.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have, of course, considerable control over how they use their resources. It is open to any of them to pursue a particular scheme they may wish to initiate.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that 91,000 houses in Ireland have been identified as being at risk, being in excess of the acceptable level for radon gas, and that only 2,500 of these have had remedial action taken? This problem is continuing, but the people affected do not know they are being affected, because of the lack of Government action.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider the Government decision to abolish the grant that was available to householders, which I introduced when I was Minister for energy. Would the Minister consider reintroducing that grant, which would cost much less to the Exchequer than the cost of treating 200 patients who get lung cancer and die each year from this particular cause? There are health and sound economic reasons for providing this grant. I am not suggesting the Minister is not personally concerned about the 200 deaths occurring, but if the Government is not concerned about them, then perhaps it is concerned about money. It would save money by introducing the remedial scheme and deaths would also be prevented.</P>

      <Quest>the proportion of new or existing local authority lettings which have been allocated to people in emergency accommodation throughout the country in the three year period since this commitment was made in Homelessness - An Integrated Strategy; the alterations which have been made in the schemes of letting priority approved by each housing authority under section 11 of the Housing Act 1988; the way in which these reflect the housing needs of people who are homeless as directed in section 9 of the Housing Act 1988, in view of the 2002 housing need assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Under section 9 of the Housing Act 1988 local authorities are required to identify persons who are homeless as a specific category when assessing need for housing. The results of their most recent assessment of needs, undertaken in March 2002, have been published in my Department's annual housing statistics bulletin.</P>
      <P>The adoption of schemes of letting priorities setting out the criteria for the eligibility of individuals for local authority housing is a reserved function of the elected members. It is the case that schemes of letting priorities generally give additional points or priority recognition for persons who are homeless. The allocation of local authority housing is a matter for individual local authorities having regard to the terms of schemes of letting priorities.</P>
      <P>While my Department publishes the number of first time lettings in the annual housing statistics bulletin, comprehensive details of the number of lettings to specific categories such as homeless persons are not available in the Department. I am however aware that significant progress has been made in housing homeless persons. Current indications are that in the three-year period ending in December 2003, approximately 1,400 homeless persons will have been housed in the functional areas of the four Dublin local authorities by the authorities themselves, voluntary housing associations and the Threshold access housing unit. Significant progress has also been made in the provision of emergency and move-on accommodation and day care facilities.</P>
      <P>The proposed introduction of an integrated housing IT system for local authorities and the LINK data system being piloted in the Dublin area will facilitate the effective collection of housing data in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question because despite the unprecedented prosperity of the past ten years, one can walk around the streets in the immediate vicinity of Dáil Éireann and see more and more homeless people in the doorways, side by side with the plush restaurants that have sprung up in recent years. I find it incredible that the Minister for State, in response to my question, <Col N="1223" /> admitted in this House that he does not have the figures of percentage allocations made by local authorities, that are obligatory under the integrated strategy. Does the Minister agree with me that the fact that the Department has not collected data on allocations is an absolutely negligent act? Will the Minister embark immediately on the task of getting the information in order that we can assess the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the strategy? The Minister is saying that he has a strategy but does not know how it is working.</P>

      <P>I request Deputies not to interrupt. The purpose of Question Time is to elicit information from the Minister. Deputies will be allowed to ask their questions without interruption.

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Huge progress has been made in looking after the homeless in recent years. In money terms, the expenditure has increased from something like the equivalent of &euro;12.5 million in 1999 to &euro;43 million last year, with a figure of about &euro;50 million expected this year. There are some 3,700 households on the homeless list. Approximately 1,400 homeless people have been housed in the Dublin area, directly from the homeless list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a doubt about the number of people on the homeless list. Even in the Dublin area, where most of the homeless are located, there are 1,450 homeless households. When one goes to try <Col N="1224" /> to find those people, fewer than 400 are looking for any form of homeless service. It is obvious that many people with different local authorities sign on as homeless, and perhaps are homeless at that time, but the data is not updated correctly, and these people are not coming forward as homeless, or using homeless services. This is why the Department is sponsoring the installation of an IT system to supply proper comprehensive data, so that those on the homeless list can be tracked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of his scepticism about the homelessness figures, is the Minister aware of how these people are actually counted as homeless? Is he aware that for example if two people from the corporation walk around, shining lights in doorways, and see two people, one of whom happens to be sitting up perhaps having a cigarette while the other is sleeping, then only one of those people is counted as homeless? The person sitting up is not deemed homeless. Perhaps that is the reason the Minister of State is out of touch with the real figures on homelessness. Does he accept that local authorities blatantly discriminate against single homeless people? Is he aware that fewer than half of those officially deemed homeless appear on local authority waiting lists and that, as a consequence, many of them will never have the opportunity of getting a house through the system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>

      <P>There are approximately 130 homeless people in County Dublin. That is 130 too many. What is the Deputy asking? Is he saying that homeless people should be given priority for all local authority housing that comes available? Approximately one in four, 30%, of housing which becomes available is given to homeless people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As public representatives we have all met <Col N="1225" /> people in our clinics who complain that the only way to obtain a house is to render oneself homeless and jump the queue. That is the view on the ground. I am a little amused by the Deputy's question. What is the Deputy seeking? Does he wish all accommodation which becomes available to be given to people on the homeless list?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State, as the Minister with responsibility for housing, not ashamed that after six and a half years in Government, the richest period in the history of this State, there are now more homeless people in this country than before it took office? After 15 months in office, if he is not about to tell this House how many homeless people there are and identify the size of the problem &ndash; he wrongly claims that approximately 430 people are sleeping rough in Dublin when the collective agencies set the figure at 5,500 &ndash; should he not resign? Is he seriously telling this House that he has not been able to grasp the size of the problem having spent 15 months in office? Everyone involved in voluntary organisations is capable of giving him that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a straightforward question. Can the Minister of State give me figures on new or existing tenancies allocated to those in emergency accommodation? Is that percentage in line with the commitment given in Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy? That is a simple question. I did not mention the word &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; in my contribution. I referred only to those in emergency accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two serious issues are emerging from this. One is whether we can rely on figures and if they are correct. We appear to have far better statistics on cattle than we do in regard to homelessness. If the Minister of State does not accept or queries the figures he is given, should he not put pressure on the Central Statistics Office to provide more reliable statistics so we can better assess the problem?</P>
      <P>The second issue arises from the Minister of State's assertion that spending on homelessness has increased significantly in recent years. Will he agree that the vast bulk of this increased spending has gone to landlords who provide emergency bed and breakfast accommodation and that very little of the &euro;50 million is being spent on capital projects to directly support the homeless?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled at the Minister of State's admission that he does not accept the figures made available to his Department. How does he propose to resolve the housing crisis when he does not accept the statistics made available to him? Why should he rely on such figures anyway? The Minister of State's Department is charged under the Housing Acts with looking after housing and he has failed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister of State's predecessor left him with a one-off legacy. I thought, as incoming Minister, he would do something about it. The Minister of State has done nothing. What new initiatives does he intend to take to address this serious and escalating problem? This problem is not going to go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Cuffe's question, much of the money referred to was spent in the provision of emergency accommodation and yes there are landlords involved. They provide emergency accommodation which may not be the long-term answer but it is the short-term one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen's question refers back to the specific point. Agencies in Dublin set themselves a rough target &ndash; it is not a firm commitment in any strategy &ndash; of trying to give 30% of their allocations to homeless people or those in emergency accommodation. They are not reaching their target, the current figure is 26% or 27%, but they are close to it. How high would one like them to go? I note the questions asked are identical and from people in very opposite parties. These questions are coming from a specific quarter that is particularly interested in people living in emergency accommodation. We are looking at things in the round. We know that local authorities cannot allocate houses to homeless people alone. Many people in my area have been on the waiting list for years. Some 27% of housing in my local authority area is allocated to the homeless and 20% is allocated to the priority or medical category. We will soon reach the stage where people will realise there is little point going on the points list because one will be jumped by everyone else. We have to divide up our accommodation in a fair way and ensure all categories of people receive accommodation. It is difficult to get a balance between the homeless and those on the medical, welfare and general points system.</P>
      <P>The target for Dublin for providing accommodation for the homeless is set at 30% and we are nearing that figure. On the other points, Deputies are simply throwing abuse at me and not listening. I tried to answer those questions earlier. There has been an enormous increase in the resources being spent on the homeless, from &euro;12 million four years ago, to &euro;40 million today.</P>

The report I commissioned should be available in the next couple of weeks, the NESC report is expected before Christmas while the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is due to report in January. This provides a short time period in terms of having the three essential elements of assessment completed. We will then consider how to proceed on the basis of the evidence available to us.</P>
      <P>It has been constantly said to me, and believed by many, that only approximately four or five developers control the land in Dublin. We now find from the report referred to by the Deputy, of which I am aware, that the land in Fingal is in the hands of 26 or 27 developers, which is different from what we might have thought. Let us have all the evidence before reaching conclusions and when we have it we will devise solutions.</P>

When I have that information, solutions can be considered, whether through the constitutional route, the CPO method or taxation. It is essential to know who is involved; the matter cannot be approached with a scatter gun. I am not in the business of being a Minister to come up with fanciful ideas for the sake of it.

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 40, 44 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, has been the major driver of house price increases in recent years, and increases in the cost of building materials are only one of a range of factors driving these increases. The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time buyers, and in this way to seek to bring moderation to house price increases.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced by this Government to boost supply, such as significant investment in infrastructure, removing planning constraints and promoting the increased residential densities, are having effect. Last year was the eighth successive year of record house completions, with 57,695 units completed, an increase in output of 9.7% on 2001, and an over 30% increase in the housing output in the Dublin area. Ireland is now building at the fastest rate in Europe, with close to 15 units per 1,000 population last year, which is an outstanding achievement. This positive trend in supply has continued into this year, with statistics showing that overall house completions for the first six months were up 16.5% on the same period last year. Completions in the greater Dublin area were up 10.6% while completions in Dublin were up 13.8%.</P>
      <P>House price increases and the impact of these on affordability are a matter of continuing concern. While the rate of house price increases is still problematic, this has moderated considerably since the late 1990s, when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. In order to address problems associated with increases in price levels, the Government has worked to ensure the continuing enhancement of supply. At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is met. Almost &euro;3.8 billion was spent in the first three years of the national development plan on social and affordable housing measures, reflecting the strong commitment of the Government to meeting needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner. We will continue to monitor and review housing developments and policies as necessary, including examining possible measures <Col N="1231" /> aimed at moderating land costs for housing and other essential public infrastructure. Consideration of these issues will be finalised in light of the recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, expected early next year, and the NESC report on housing and land policy, expected by year end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State recognise that he is attempting to delude himself and his listeners? He refers to statistics that no longer have any relevance. Does he recognise that the cost of building materials has had no impact on the rise in house prices?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has overlooked the needs of the first-time home buyer, who has been deprived of the first-time buyer's grant and hammered by VAT increases, development charges and stamp duty? Does he accept that in County Kildare, approximately 5,000 families have no hope of buying a house of their own in the present climate? This is not because of circumstances outside the control of the Minister of State, rather it is because he has failed to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State address the question of the huge take in tax, which is a cause of increased house prices? There have been also been huge increases in the takes from VAT, stamp duty and development levies. Will the Minister of State address that issue? That money is going into the Government's coffers. The maximum loan available to constituents of mine residing 20 miles from O'Connell Bridge is considerably less than that available to the Minister of State's constituents, even though houses are more expensive in my constituency. Will he offer a little hope to first-time buyers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis of Government policy is to increase supply. Ten years ago an average of 21,000 houses were built annually, but that figure has increased to 57,000. Supply will meet demand on the basis of the law of averages and, hopefully, that will happen soon. It is easy to seek increases in grants and availability of houses under the shared ownership scheme. That might solve the problem for individuals but a different segment of house seekers is pushed out of the market. The scheme is continually reviewed. It was amended a few years ago but nothing was achieved because the threshold for eligibility meant a different segment of people qualified. Significant resources are available under local authority social and affordable housing schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I live in County Kildare and public housing becomes available in Cork, I can make an application and it will be considered in the same light as one submitted by someone living in Cork. Does a similar provision apply to affordable housing? Wicklow County Council has adopted a local zoning policy. If a house is constructed in the county, people resident outside the county cannot purchase it. Does this policy apply to affordable housing? I am not trying to catch the Minister of State out and I will understand if he has not given consideration to this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot respond on the policy in Wicklow but, under the affordable housing scheme in Dublin, applicants are awarded additional points if they live or work in the area. I will come back to the Deputy regarding the affordable housing issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Should young people who want to build their own homes be exempt from planning levies? Until last December, the first-time buyer's grant went a little way towards compensating people for local authority planning levies. Should they be set aside in such circumstances? Are the conditions pertaining to affordable housing schemes uniform throughout the State or do they vary between local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two affordable housing schemes are in place and a third, under Sustaining Progress, has not been introduced yet. They cater for different segments of the housing market and different rules and regulations apply in individual local authorities, never mind between local authorities. The first-time buyer is still doing well. The State still provides enormous assistance to him or her.</P>

      <P>Through stamp duty exemptions and mortgage interest relief. People are trying to <Col N="1233" /> create the myth that first-time buyers are not buying houses but that is not the case. Approximately 50% of new houses are purchased by first-time buyers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>

      <P>We are all aware of the numbers on local authority housing waiting lists. Approximately 13,000 people will receive an offer of housing this year but others will join the list.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to help them through the three affordable housing schemes. A <Col N="1234" /> number of people on local authority lists need social housing and will never be able to buy a house themselves. However, the affordable housing schemes will help the remainder to help themselves and they will be removed from the waiting lists. A number of local authorities in Dublin are more proactive in this regard than others and all public representatives should push for the development of land that has been sat on for years by local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has said on a number of occasions that the main thrust of Government action on housing is to increase supply. Why then has the Government reduced the supply of social housing by cutting this year's budget? Apart from abolishing the first-time buyer's grant, increasing VAT on building materials, which, in turn, has increased the price of houses, and reducing the budget for social housing, what new policy initiative has the Minister of State taken to address the housing issue since he took office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. Most people of my generation are acquainted with the problems of some members of the Irish diaspora in Britain. While some Irish people did well there, others did not. Many of the marginalised Irish people in Britain are becoming quite elderly. Some have succumbed to the problems of alcohol, drugs and homelessness. It is certain that a substantial number of Irish people who emigrated to Britain between the 1930s and the early 1990s have fallen on hard times.</P>
      <P>Cricklewood Homeless Concern has been a great refuge and centre of comfort for many over the last 30 years. It was given to the Irish community in London by the Diocese of Westminster and used to provide assistance, in the form of various services, for Irish people who needed such help. A crisis has been reached in that regard, however, because the centre is up for sale. The diocese, which has deemed 31 December to be the deadline for the sale of the premises, has given the first option on it to the Irish community. A reasonable price of about £750,000 has been negotiated. The centre in Cricklewood does sterling work in accommodating approximately 700 or 800 people each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise that we have a responsibility to those persons who went abroad from Ireland. Many of them retain close ties with this country but may not be in a position to fend for themselves as they might wish. The State should make a small financial contribution towards the purchase of the Cricklewood centre. Capital funding <Col N="1239" /> should be provided for the purchase and refurbishment of the building as a home and meeting place for Irish people in London. I ask the Minister of State to examine the desirability of supporting the Give Hope a Home campaign, which has been established to save the premises. The fact that those involved in the campaign are also seeking support from the city of London means that the Irish authorities are not being asked to provide all the funds. It is hoped the premises can be saved by means of a joint project.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State that the amount of money being requested is not large. The Government might not have to provide the full sum of £750,000. The amount being sought is small, given that it will provide a roof for homeless people and those who need to meet others and get some food on a regular basis. I reiterate the fact that those concerned are part of the Irish diaspora. I commend the proposal in the hope the Government will see fit to provide the necessary funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher):</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who is attending a European Council meeting in Brussels. He asked me to address the issue raised by Deputy Costello.</P>
      <P>The Cricklewood Homeless Concern is a voluntary organisation which was set up in 1983 and offers day care and other care opportunities to homeless people and people in insecure housing in the north London borough of Brent and surrounding boroughs. In 2002, about 60% of the organisation's predominately male clients were Irish, 433 out of a total 705.</P>
      <P>In 1983 the organisation was offered the use of 60 Ashford Road through the good offices of the local parish. The building in question is the property of the Catholic diocese of Westminster. Cricklewood Homeless Concern has had rent-free use of the property for almost 20 years. It is the location of the day care centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that following a decision by the diocese to sell the building, the Cricklewood homeless centre was offered first refusal and negotiated a purchase price of £733,800 with the diocese. Repairs and modernisation of the building are estimated to cost in the region of £1 million. I also understand that, to date, the centre has raised £251,000 and that its business plan for the period 2002-07 expresses confidence that sources of funding for the balance of the project will be identified through a fundraising campaign. As part of this fundraising effort a public relations firm has been hired. Its business plan has also concluded that the purchase and retention of the existing building is the most effective and efficient option for Cricklewood Homeless Concern. The purchase of the building is scheduled to be completed by April 2004. The business plan envisages that the repairs and modernisation of <Col N="1240" /> the existing premises will be completed by September 2005.</P>
    <P>The Díon committee is an advisory committee which makes recommendations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the allocation of grants from the Díon fund which comes under the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs. In 2003, 53 welfare agencies working with vulnerable members of the Irish community received grants of almost &euro;2.3 million. Díon grants, in the main, support the employment of professional workers to provide advice as well as practical assistance to disadvantaged members of the Irish community in Britain. Cricklewood Homeless Concern has been supported by the Díon committee since at least 1989. From 1989 to 2002 the organisation received over &euro;500,000 in funding from the Díon fund. In 2003 CHC received &euro;67,634 to support the posts of director and a day care opportunities worker. A commitment was given to continue funding these posts for three years, subject to satisfactory annual progress reports. Building projects and the provision of accommodation are outside Díon criteria for funding. Cricklewood Homeless Concern has not directly approached the Díon committee to seek funding for this project.</P>
    <P>The commitment to fund these posts for the next three years has been acknowledged by Cricklewood Homeless Concern as a great advantage, in that it has provided stability for the organisation. In its contacts with the Irish Embassy in London, it pointed out that this continuous funding from Díon will send a clear message to funders in the UK that Cricklewood Homeless Concern is worthwhile and credible as a needs-led charity providing valuable services to a large number of Irish people.</P>
    <P>Reports of Cricklewood Homeless Concern's plans to acquire these premises appeared this week in the <i>Irish Post.</i> I understand that this was in the context of the launch of an appeal to readers to donate to the capital project. One article seemed to suggest that there are differences between Cricklewood Homeless Concern and the diocese of Westminster on the issue of the sale of the property. I understand from the embassy in London, which has been in touch with diocesan officials, that the diocese wishes to be as helpful as it can. Diocesan officials met with representatives of Cricklewood Homeless Concern last week and are more than willing to meet them again to discuss the situation. The Irish ambassador in London met a representative of the company which is spearheading the CHC fundraising efforts last month. He indicated that he would be happy to support any efforts of the CHC to raise funds.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I wish to express our appreciation of the valuable contribution which Cricklewood Homeless Concern has made over the past 20 years and continues to make on behalf of homeless Irish people in London, some of the most marginalised people in society. The Government will continue to support this valu<Col N="1241" /> able work in every way it can. I thank Deputy Costello for raising the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghaíl:</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus of my concern is educational disadvantage and the anomaly which exists in that regard in the town of Athy which is in my constituency of Kildare South.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the superb work that has been done by Government over the past six years, particularly that of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who nailed his colours to the mast in respect of his commitment to dealing with disadvantage, and the work done by his predecessors, Deputies Woods and Martin. With the provision of &euro;460 million in the current year to tackle disadvantage through a range of different programmes, the Minister has done more than ever before to provide educational supports for those who most need them.</P>
      <P>Strand 2 of the RAPID programme for provincial towns was introduced under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in early 2001. The case for its inclusion was compelling and Athy was duly designated a RAPID town. The town has experienced higher than average levels of unemployment and lower than average participation rates in second and third level education. The most recent statistics available indicate that upwards of 60% of the unemployed male population is classified as long-term unemployed, with a third of unemployed males and 40% of unemployed females being under the age of 25.</P>
      <P>Clearly education is the key to building a better quality of life for the people of Athy and its environs, and to achieving a higher level of sustainable employment in the area. The primary school-going population of Athy is served by three primary schools; the Model School, Scoil Mhicil Naofa, and Scoil Phádraig Naofa, each of which can boast of the services of a totally committed principal and a cohort of teaching staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the launch of Giving Children an Even Break, a programme geared to tackling educational disadvantage at primary level in 2001, two of these schools, Scoil Mhicil Naofa and Scoil Phádraig Naofa, were included in the urban dimension of the programme. Scoil Mhicil Naofa <Col N="1242" /> is an infant and girls school, while Scoil Phádraig Naofa is the local boys national school. Their inclusion in the programme was brought about following a survey by the Education Research Centre, Drumcondra, which involved a survey sheet being completed by each of the local schools. From what I can gather, no visit to the schools took place and the evaluation and recommendations on resources were based on the information submitted in the survey. Additional staff resources were subsequently made available to Scoil Mhicil Naofa &ndash; deservedly so &ndash; while the assistance given to Scoil Phádraig Naofa took the form of a small grant, which amounts to &euro;3,200 for the current school year.</P>
    <P>In a written reply to a parliamentary question in March, I was advised that the staffing details of Scoil Phádraig and Scoil Mhicil were as follows: Scoil Phádraig Naofa has a principal, seven mainstream teachers, one learning support teacher and two resource teachers, one of which is shared. Scoil Mhicil Naofa has a principal, 16 mainstream teachers, four Giving Children an Even Break teachers and learning support teachers, five additional special assistant teachers, one additional special temporary teacher, two resource teachers, one language support teacher and one special teacher for the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>The practical effect of this situation is best illustrated by the circumstances of a family with a twin boy and girl, who this year went into second class. The boy transferred from Scoil Mhicil Naofa to Scoil Phádraig Naofa to join a class of 30 boys, while his sister, remaining in Scoil Mhicil Naofa, progressed to second class where she enjoys a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1. Unless this problem is addressed, this boy and his fellow male students will continue to experience an unfavourable pupil-teacher ratio as they progress through the school.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest for a minute that Scoil Mhicil Naofa is fully resourced &ndash; this is not the case, and I will no doubt have the opportunity in the future to focus on its further needs, which include improved buildings and the provision of a home-school liaison service &ndash; but the contrast between the staffing resources in the two local schools is stark. No wonder, therefore, that there is growing anger among the parents of young boys in Athy who feel, with justification, that their sons' educational needs are receiving less priority that those of their daughters. Credit is due to the teaching staff in Scoil Phádraig Naofa, who have continued to work in adverse conditions but they, like the parents, are rapidly running out of patience in the search for a solution.</P>
    <P>There is talk in the community of legal action against the Department and approaches have been made to the Equality Authority. That is why I am calling on the Minister for Education and Science, through the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to intervene as a matter of urgency to guarantee that there is parity of esteem for boys <Col N="1243" /> and girls within the primary education system in Athy.</P>
    <P>The unfair, unjustifiable and anomalous circumstances that exist must not be allowed to continue, and I invite the Minister to visit Athy to assess them for himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, the issues raised by the Deputy. The school is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a three year programme launched in 2001 to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. It subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage, and the Department of Education and Science's approach is now refined to ensure that individual at-risk pupils are targeted.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre in March and April 2000 at the request of the Department of Education and Science. All the schools identified as having pupils enrolled with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
      <P>Scoil Phádraig Naofa is benefiting from the allocation of supplementary grant aid towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned over the three year period. The school was allocated a total of just over &euro;3,200 for the 2002-03 school year.</P>
      <P>Schools categorised as urban in Giving Children an Even Break with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement reduced pupil-teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and 27:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth class. The school referred to by the Deputy was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
      <P>The future of Giving Children an Even Break and other programmes will be determined in the context of a broader review of the range of initiatives to address educational disadvantage. I listened very carefully to Deputy Ó Fearghaíl's very genuine contribution and I assure him that I will, at the earliest opportunity, bring the issues he raised to the attention of the Minister, who has just returned from his visit to China with President McAleese.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes a joke of this House that the Minister was on radio and television every day this week vilifying those involved in the bin tax campaign but will not respond to the issue in the House when it is raised. No wonder we have no credibility or respect. I note that the members of the media have left and are probably gone home.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to what I consider to be misinformation and propaganda by the Minister regarding the campaign against bin taxes. I want to respond to his vilification of those opposed to this tax. He claims that the bin tax was the result of a democratic decision by Dublin City Council. This is a complete distortion and he knows it. The city council was blackmailed and threatened with abolition if it did not pass the Estimates that included the bin tax. A clear majority of councillors opposed its introduction but they were bullied, threatened and blackmailed by the Government into capitulation. Is this the Minister's version of local democracy? The Government will not even pay rates to the city council on Government-owned buildings in Dublin city, yet it threatens the council. This brought about the crisis in the city's finances in the first place.</P>
      <P>The Minister's second deliberate distortion is his claim that 80% of householders in Dublin are &ldquo;happy to pay this tax.&rdquo;  Many of those in Dublin who paid the bin tax only did so after repeated intimidation, harassment and bully boy threats of legal action by the law agent acting for the city manager. Threatening letters were sent to thousands of householders, which read:</P>
      <P>I wish to inform you that under legislation recently passed by the Oireachtas, Dublin City Council will no longer be obliged to collect household waste where the householder has failed to pay all relevant waste charges and arrangements are being made to discontinue collection in your case.</P>
      <P>If . . .  not paid within 14 days, we will be engaging the services of a Debt Collection Agency for appropriate action.</P>
      <P>The City Council also has the option to seek a decree against you which we can . . .  refer to the Sheriff for execution or . . .  register the Decree as a Judgement Mortgage in . . .  the Registry of Deeds . . . . </P>
      <P>We will . . .  seek full legal costs in relation to any Court proceedings and for the payment of interest . . .  on all amounts due.</P>
      <P>I have had many calls from decent, law-abiding people who strongly oppose the tax but who are fearful of court cases and debt collection agencies harassing them. Many paid up as a result. Is this the Minister's idea of &ldquo;happy to pay the tax&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's next distortion is his claim that a handful of individuals are orchestrating the campaign. I attended the march to Mountjoy Pri<Col N="1245" /> son on the jailing of Deputy Joe Higgins. A conservative estimate of the number in attendance is 4,000. Last Saturday, I marched with 2,000 trade unionists under the banner of the Dublin Council of Trade Unions and SIPTU. SIPTU, our largest union, advertised in the national papers against the unfair taxation and against the imprisonment of peaceful protesters. To mention just one of many local meetings, 400 to 500 decent Cabra householders met in a Cabra sports centre to oppose the bin tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has some neck to misrepresent the outrage of PAYE workers in low income communities in Dublin. The Government is out of touch with working class people who have borne the burden of taxation for decades while rich tax dodgers were well represented in the Minister's party. There is now even greater outrage because decent people and mothers of babies are being jailed in Mountjoy Prison for peaceful protest while millionaire tax cheats lie at tribunals and so-called tax exiles pocket millions and evade justice.</P>
    <P>This outrage and the Minister's policy of non-collection of household waste has led directly to the escalation of the crisis. In Dublin, the bin tax is on a flat rate and is clearly inequitable. It is not based on ability to pay and is not an incentive to recycle. One pays the same amount whether one leaves out two tea bags, two black bags or two full bins. It has nothing to do with the environment, but is a mere money-making exercise to pay for the shortfall of funding from central Government, which will not pay its own rates. I call on the Minister who did not bother coming to the House to listen to the debate to send out the message to his managerial lackeys that they should stop the non-collection policy and return to the courts to free the peaceful protesters.</P>
    <P>A feature of the bin tax propaganda is the repeated attempt by the Minister and others to make householders feel responsible for the bulk of waste production. Householders account for a small proportion of all waste produced and 15% of waste going to landfill sites. A favourite slogan of the Minister and the pro-bin tax lobby is that the polluter pays principle should be applied to householders. All the evidence is that householders are waste receivers, rather than polluters, and would have much less material of which to dispose if commercial and retail outlets cut down on packaging and the proper recycling infrastructure was in place, which it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>He never shrinks from his responsibility and must preside over the implementation of legislation agreed democratically in the Houses.</P>
      <P>At a time when we are faced with ever increasing amounts of waste, it is right to place the issue of waste charges in context. Direct user charges for household waste collection services are widely applied throughout Europe, particularly in the context of increasing awareness of the financial and environmental cost of waste generation and encouraging waste reduction and recycling. It is logical that such principled support for waste charges should be built into EU policy and legislation. The polluter pays principle, one of the cornerstones of EU environmental policy, is, therefore, reflected in waste legislation at European level and domestically. The bottom line is that charges serve an important environmental purpose. They have been in place in many areas for some time and their introduction in Dublin in recent years brings domestic waste management practice into line with EU norms.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside these environmental imperatives, it is noteworthy that at no stage during the current debate have those opposed to waste charges offered any credible alternative solution as to how we can tackle our waste management problems. The fundamentalists of the anti-bin charge lobby have a comfortably simplistic view of how to deal with domestic waste. They believe waste management should be undertaken by local authorities with no involvement from the wider community and society, and that local authorities can remove householders' waste at no cost to anyone and without having to dispose of it. Waste does not evaporate. This escapist view may fit in with the ideologies of the Socialist Workers Party and its friends but would fail disastrously to meet the needs of householders and society in general&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>Householders want an efficient and sustainable waste management service which will improve the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put in context the issue of collection of waste and non-payment of charges. A judgment of the Supreme Court in 2001 found that local authorities did not have the power to refuse to collect waste from households who had failed to pay their waste charges. Instead, the court held that local authorities were obliged to continue to collect the waste from such households and pursue the outstanding charges through the normal debt recovery mechanisms. The implications of this judgment were stark as it meant the law, as it stood in relation to waste charges, was only enforceable by pursuing every single defaulter through the legal process. With local <Col N="1247" /> authorities facing growing challenges in terms of modernising waste infrastructure and practices, meeting social housing needs and delivering roads, water, sewerage and other infrastructure, it would be grossly wasteful to have the resources of local authorities and the courts tied up in this way. It would also have been entirely inequitable for the vast bulk of the people who paid their waste charges to have to continue to subsidise the minority who did not, while the matters involved became tied up in the courts. Local authorities should not be forced to provide a service for those who refuse to pay. That is not just my view but the democratically expressed view of the majority of the Members of both this House and the Seanad in passing the relevant legislation introduced earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about that for which the legislation provides. It does not impose an obligation on local authorities to refuse to collect waste from defaulting householders but provides them with the power to do so where necessary. It is a matter for each local authority to decide when and how to use that power. We should also be clear that the utilisation of this power did not result in the events we have seen in Dublin in recent weeks, as the Deputy's motion suggests. They were the result of the actions of a small group of people who not only refuse to obey the law by paying their waste charges but also refuse to accept the consequences of their action, as provided for in law passed through the democratic process, or abide by orders of the courts. To have the authority of the Executive, Legislature and courts challenged in this manner is unacceptable in any democratic society.</P>
    <P>I am glad the protests at local authority depots in Dublin in recent days have been discontinued and the local authorities have been able to get on with providing the service for which between 75% and 90% of the citizens of the four Dublin local authorities have paid. I hope good sense in this matter will continue to prevail in the days ahead.</P>

      <P>Tá fógra faighte ag na hoibrithe i monarcha MDR ar eastát tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair go bhfuil leachtaitheoir ag dul isteach ansin ag deireadh na míosa. Tá gach cosúlacht ar an scéal anois go mbeidh 40 post eile caillte ar an eastát. Ní seo an chéad uair a d'ardaigh mé an cheist seo i mbliana agus tá súil agam gur seo an uair dheireannach a bheidh mé ag déanamh cáis do fhostaíocht sa chondae, agus go speisialta sa Ghaeltacht, anseo sa Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá a fhios mhaith ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil 1,000 post, ar a laghad, caillte ar an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dobhair le cupla bliain anuas, ceann des na heastáit tionscail ab fhearr a bhí ag <Col N="1248" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta. Ar an eastát tionscail tá monarcha málaí plaisteacha imithe, tá monarchana Dianorm, Qualtran, BMR agus RMT ar shiúil agus tá Comar Yarns ar tí a bheith druidte. Inné tháinig an scéal go bhfuil MDR ins an bhád céanna.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ag déanamh dochair móir do shaol na Gaeltachta agus do fhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil an oiread san des na monarchana druidte, go bhfuil an oiread san postanna caillte, nach bhfuil aon fhostaíocht le fáil ag daoine óga ar an eastát anois agus go gcaithfidh siad an baile a fhágáil agus dul go dtí páirteanna eile den tír agus den domhain le fostaíocht a fháil.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé seo isteach ar gach gné de shaol na Gaeltachta. Tá sé ag cur isteach ar shiopaí, ar thithe ósta, ar óstáin agus ar thithe tabhairne agus ar gach gnó eile. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil plean forbartha déanta amach don eastát. Lainseáladh an plean sin beagnach bliain ó shin. Iarraim ar an Rialtas, ar an Aire Stáit agus ar an Aire Gnothaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta go ndéanfaidh siad gach iarracht an plean sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Táimid ag cailleadh postanna lá i ndiaidh lae agus is beag post úr atá ag teacht isteach.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil postanna á gcailleadh sa Ghaeltacht tá siad á mbunú i áiteacha eile ar fud an domhain. Mar shampla, tá Qualtran ag dul go dtí Meicsiceo, Comar Yarns ag dul go dtí oirthear na hEorpa, cuid acu ag dul go dtí an cian oirthear agus cuid eile ag dul go tuaisceart na hAfraice. Tá freagracht ar an Rialtas de thairbhe na postanna sin a gcailleadh ins an tír seo agus iad ag dul go dtí áiteacha eile.</P>
    <P>Deirtear linn go mbeidh postanna úra lán aimseartha a mbeidh scileanna agus ard oideachas riachtanach fána gcoinne ag teacht ach tá siad íontach mall ag teacht agus táimid ag cailleadh i bhfad níos mó ná mar atáimid a fháil.</P>
    <P>The unemployment crisis in County Donegal is not confined to Gaeltacht areas. Jobs have also been lost in other parts of the county, including the Finn Valley, Ballybofey, Stranorlar, Letterkenny, Milford, Dungloe and Inishowen, as well as in the Fruit of the Loom company. Indeed, when the Central Statistics Office published its findings yesterday, we were not surprised to learn that Donegal is top of the league as far as unemployment is concerned. The unemployment rate in Donegal is 15.6%, twice the national average. Since the census took place in 2002 the situation has further deteriorated, making Donegal the national unemployment blackspot.</P>
    <P>During the boom years 350,000 new jobs were created in this country but few of them came to County Donegal. These are facts that cannot be denied. The official figures speak for themselves. Donegal has given this Government and its predecessor plenty of loyalty. Most of the county's Deputies have supported the Government but that loyalty has not been returned. Urgent action is required. Donegal demands and is entitled to a positive response if the situation is not to deteriorate further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> Donegal must be declared a high priority area. Attractive incentives should be offered to prospective investors and industrialists. The county cannot afford the continuous haemorrhaging of jobs. Unless the problem is urgently addressed, Donegal will become an industrial wasteland. I do not wish to be pessimistic but the situation is critical ní amháin sa Ghaeltacht ach ar fud an chondae. Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil an tAire Stáit anseo agus go bhfuil sé ag éisteacht. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé in ann dóchas de chineál éigin a thabhairt, chan amháin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach do mhuintir an chondae ar fad. Sin iad na figiúirí &ndash; tá an ráta dífhostaíochta is airde sa tír againn agus is cinnte go gcaithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh ina thaobh.</P>

      <P>Tuigim go maith mar Theachta ón cheantar sin gur buille eile é seo do Ghaoth Dobhair agus do na bailte timpeall uirthi. Is mian liom mo chomhbhrón a chur in iúl dóibh siúd a chaillfidh a bpost sa chomhlacht seo.</P>
      <P>D'oibrigh úinéirí agus foireann go dian ón am a bunaíodh an comhlacht i nGaoth Dobhair roinnt blianta ó shin. MDR Leictreonach Teo., an Irish-owned company, has been manufacturing printed circuit boards in Gaoth Dobhair since 1988. I vividly recall the situation at that time as I had responsibility for the Gaeltacht and I worked closely with the company when it was established there. It was established to purchase the assets of Ciorcaid Graifeach Teo., which had gone into liquidation. Le tacaíocht ó Údarás na Gaeltachta, d'éirigh le MDR ardchaighdeán a bhaint amach í gcúrsaí déantúsaíochta PCBanna agus bhí sé ar a chumas cláir a bhí an-chasta le déanamh a dhéanamh. Faoi dheireadh na bliana 2000 bhí margadh maith ann agus tháinig méadú ar obair an chomhlachta. Faraor, ag tús na bliana 2001, tháinig cor chun donais sa margadh leictreonaic agus thosaigh go leor de na custaiméirí a bhí acu ag ceannach PCBanna sa Chian Oirthear.</P>
      <P>Arising from this downturn MDR began to focus on complex boards in small batch quantities but sales continued to decline and employment in the company fell from 71 to the current level of 39. Over the past year approximately 30 of these employees have been working short time. A number of PCB manufacturers in Britain and Ireland have closed in recent years as manufacturing moved to the Far East. In an effort to ensure the company's survival, discussions were held with two potential purchasers at the beginning of 2003 but without success. Due to severe financial difficulties the board of the company decided to nominate a liquidator. Shareholders' and creditors' meetings will be held on 29 October with a view to making this appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of jobs in recent times on the Gaoth Dobhair Business Park is a major cause of concern to me, to the Minister who is absent from the House on business and to the Government. It has been discussed at various times in the House. Employment in the business park reached a peak of 1,338 in 1998 and remained stable until the <Col N="1250" /> year 2000. In the last three years employment has decreased to a level of 750. However, on a more positive note, it is worth mentioning that 288 new jobs were created in the Donegal Gaeltacht in 2002 in Údarás na Gaeltachta assisted industries and this good work is continuing in 2003. In Gaoth Dobhair itself this year there has been good news on the jobs front, in Athscríbhinn Ceilteach Teo., a medical transcription company which was officially opened recently, and the coach builder Euro Iompú Teo., which has announced an expansion of its business. Bia Gaoth Barra Teoranta has commenced business and is providing much-needed employment in snack food manufacturing. These and other cases are the result of the ongoing efforts of promoters and businesses themselves, and of Údarás na Gaeltachta's continuous work in industrial promotion.</P>
    <P>In early 2002, my colleague, the then Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Coughlan, set up a working group to address the issues of the serious level of job losses in the Donegal Gaeltacht and the vulnerability of some jobs in other Gaeltacht areas. This report, which is widely known as the the Bonner report, was presented late last year. On foot of the recommendations contained in the report, Údarás na Gaeltachta has over the the past year initiated a major job creation action plan.</P>
    <P>A key objective of the plan is to approve 200 jobs per annum for the Gaoth Dobhair area, with the aim of achieving peak employment again in five years. Extra staff resources in Údarás na Gaeltachta have been assigned to the Donegal Gaeltacht and a special team is helping to guide the implementation of the action plan. While recognising that the traditional manufacturing sector is under severe pressure nationally, it is important to bear in mind that there are still opportunities for new businesses, as well as the expansion or consolidation of existing enterprises. I have referred previously to the potential attaching to ventures that are Irish language based and I have asked an t-údarás to ensure that opportunities in this important sector are fully explored and developed.</P>
    <P>The initiatives being pursued by an t-údarás include: targeting new sectors of the economy; upgrading building and telecommunications infrastructure; and greater emphasis on high skills and on the resources of the Gaeltacht itself, including the Irish language. Particular attention has been paid to the strengthening of third level educational resources. In this regard, the recent establishment by NUIG of a number of courses in an t-údarás premises in the business park has been a positive development. Only last week Deputy McGinley attended the launch ceremony for broadband. Gaoth Dobhair Business Park will have broadband by the end of the year. This is important infrastructure to entice services to the area.</P>
    <P>This is a major blow to the industrial estate and <Col N="1251" /> to the three parishes of Gaoth Dobhair, the Rosses and Cloughaneely. The industrial estate has served the area well in the past but, unfortunately, the downturn in the world economy and the fact that we do not have a competitive edge against eastern Europe and the Far East has created serious problems. It is the Government's responsibility to create an economic atmosphere that is conducive to investment and I am aware from my term of office as Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht that Údarás na Gaeltachta <Col N="1252" /> has never lost an industry on the basis of having insufficient funds.</P>
    <P>Is buille trom é seo do Ghaeltacht Thír Chonaill agus tá dualgais ar an údarás agus a chuid foirne a ndícheall a dhéanamh agus tá a fhios agam agus ag an Teachta McGinley go bhfuil na hoifigigh sin amuigh lá i ndiaidh lae ag mealladh daoine ón taobh amuigh agus an taobh istigh fosta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 17 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>Reflecting our high levels of economic growth from a relatively low base in 1990, Ireland has the highest levels of emissions growth within the EU, reaching 31% in 2001 over 1990 levels. The European Environment Agency has identified us as among nine of 15 member states, and the EU as a whole, significantly challenged in achieving Kyoto targets.</P>
      <P>Equally however there has been significant progress in Ireland in decoupling emissions growth from economic development. Emissions per unit of gross domestic product in Ireland are now 62% of what they were in 1990, compared to 78% for the EU as a whole. Our performance in this regard is second only to that of Luxembourg. It is also the case that the substantial reductions in emissions achieved by some member states since 1990 followed significant and abrupt structural changes occurring for other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kyoto obligations arise in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. Ireland has embarked on a challenging programme to limit the growth in greenhouse gas emissions through vigorous implementation of the Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000. This comprises a systematic programme towards meeting these obligations, and sets a ten year policy framework for achieving the necessary emissions reductions. This strategic approach across all sectors is in line with that adopted in <Col N="1254" /> other EU member states for ensuring that Kyoto obligations are met.</P>
    <P>A progress report on the implementation of the strategy was published in May 2002. While this shows that measures in place or in progress are capable of achieving approximately 20% of the reductions required to meet our Kyoto Protocol obligations, continuing emissions increases due to volume growth in the economy mean that implementation of the strategy must be intensified.</P>
    <P>I have therefore initiated a review of implementation of the strategy to ensure more focused and intensive implementation. This process will incorporate an update on greenhouse gas emissions projections, together with a particular emphasis on cross-cutting economic instruments to achieve Ireland's Kyoto target. These include taxation, and emissions trading and other flexible mechanisms which have been and are being developed at EU and international level since the national strategy was formulated. I intend to publish the outcome of this review later in the year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that full implementation over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations will be fully met.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that an average of ?1 in every ?4 of local authority budgets comes from commercial rates and that over the past decade the average cumulative increase in commercial rates has been almost double that of inflation; the areas from which the funding will be found to pay for the cost of benchmarking to local authorities, which will be approximately ?160 million in 2004 and ?220 million in 2005, since there is no correlation between the amount of rates levied and the profitability of a business; and the areas in which he expects local authorities to get that money.</Quest>

      <P>Rates may be levied on occupiers of liable property according to the valuation of that property as determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate adopted by the local authority elected members. Rates are an allowable legitimate business expense against taxable income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While in nominal terms rates income, as with other local authority income and expenditure, has increased over the past decade, it is noteworthy that rates income as a percentage of local authority overall current income has fallen from 27% in 1993 to 24% in 2002. Over the same period, overall current and capital expenditure of local authorities has increased from &euro;2.1 billion in 1993 to &euro;6.5 billion in 2002, an increase of 223%. Rates in 2002 contributed to an estimated 11.6% of <Col N="1255" /> overall local authority expenditure, or about &euro;1.16 in every &euro;10, compared with 17% in 1993.</P>
    <P>Regarding the costs of benchmarking, as outlined in reply to Question No. 1, local authorities fund their expenditure, including expenditure on pay, from a variety of sources, including specific State grants, commercial rates, rents, fees and charges for services and general purpose grants from the local government fund. The issue of benchmarking costs, as with other current expenditure demands, will fall to be dealt with by local authorities in the context of their annual budgetary process. The amount available from the local government fund will be settled in the context of my Department's Estimates of expenditure for 2004 and I will advise local authorities of their general purpose allocations for 2004 as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Although the current system of funding has served the local government system well in recent years, given the changes in the economy and the increasing demands on local authorities going forward, I have decided that an independent wide-ranging review of the funding of local government should be carried out. I have invited consultants wishing to carry out the review to make proposals on the matter by 7 November and the review will be commenced as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>For a number of years, the Irish Government has sought access to Sellafield by Irish experts and, in February 2000, staff of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland were granted permission by the United Kingdom authorities formally to visit the site. Based on their examination of the safety documentation, in December 2000 the RPII produced a report on the storage of liquid high-level radioactive waste at Sellafield. This set out a number of conclusions and recommendations for BNFL and its regulators. The report is freely available from the RPII.</P>

It is also one of a number of issues that has been raised in the context of discussions with the UK following the provisional measures award of the UNCLOS Annex VII Tribunal of 24 June 2003. Discussions on this proposal are continuing. I will raise this issue again when I meet with my UK counterparts shortly.</P>

      <P>The cross-departmental team on homelessness is, under the aegis of my Department, charged with monitoring and overseeing the implementation of the Government's integrated and preventative homeless strategies. The homeless preventative strategy is a cross-departmental response designed to ensure that services are put in place to target groups most at risk of homelessness and to ensure early intervention <Col N="1257" /> before people at risk become homeless. In its monitoring of the implementation of the homeless strategies, the cross-departmental team continues to pay specific attention to risk and trigger factors for homelessness, seeks to ensure that these are adequately addressed by the responsible agency and are appropriately reflected in periodic reports on the issue to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.</P>
      <P>The following are measures undertaken to date to address the needs of such persons. In the three year period from 2001 to 2003, between 1,400 and 1,500 homeless persons will have been housed by the local authority and voluntary housing sectors and the Threshold housing access unit in the four Dublin authorities alone. More than 1,000 additional emergency beds have been provided. Designated accommodation has been provided for street drinkers and drug users. A specialised unit &ndash; the homeless offenders strategy team &ndash; has been established within the probation and welfare service to address the housing needs of homeless offenders. Protocols have been drafted by health boards for the discharge of homeless persons from hospital and mental health facilities as well as medical facilities being improved. A 48 bed foyer has been provided under the Department's capital assistance by the voluntary sector in Dublin which will cater for the needs of young people leaving care or who are otherwise at risk of homelessness.</P>
      <P>There has been direct provision of educational programmes for homeless persons, provision of information, staff training and referrals to other programmes. In the light of the growing number of non-nationals given leave to remain in the country, guidelines to assist local authorities in housing them are being examined. The deficiencies in the availability of comprehensive information on homeless persons and their needs are being addressed by the introduction of the LINK system which, with the financial support of the Department, is being piloted by the homeless agency at present.</P>

      <P>The OSPAR Commission, established under the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the north-east Atlantic, met at ministerial level in Bremen on 25 and 26 June 2003 and discussed a wide range of issues relating to the protection of the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the question relates to the Commission's review of the OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances which, along <Col N="1258" /> with four other strategies, was adopted at the previous OSPAR ministerial meeting in 1998. This strategy essentially provides that by the year 2020, discharges of radioactive substances are to be progressively and substantially reduced to levels where the additional radioactivity concentrations in the marine environment above historic levels resulting from such discharges are close to zero.</P>
    <P>The OSPAR Commission, at its meeting in June, reviewed the progress towards implementation of the strategy having regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the national plans for implementation of the strategy submitted by each of the contracting parties to the convention. The meeting agreed on the period 1995 to 2001 as the reference period for establishing the baselines in respect of discharges, concentrations and doses against which progress in implementing the strategy can be measured. It also agreed that, provided national plans are implemented as forecast, the overall level of discharges will be reduced by 2020.</P>
    <P>The meeting also noted that there is scope for the evolution of all national plans over time and for confirmation from the individual contracting parties concerned that they will ensure the continued evolution and implementation of their national plans so as to achieve the objective of the strategy in accordance with the 2020 timeframe. However, the commission agreed that, given the intermediate nature of the national plans and the need for their refinement and revision over time, it was not possible at this stage to make a final assessment as to whether the combined effects of the national plans would achieve the objective of the strategy to the extent required by the 2020 timeframe. The commission has agreed on the need to determine by 2006 a methodology for assessing progress of the plans towards implementation of the strategy and for updating national plans.</P>
    <P>The meeting noted the concerns of a number of the contracting parties, including Ireland, about discharges of technetium-99 from Sellafield and their view that these should cease immediately. Ireland will continue to participate actively in OSPAR to ensure that the objective of the strategy is delivered in full and on time.</P>

      <P>It had also, in my view, been satisfactorily demonstrated that a systematic approach has been adopted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to the archaeological resolution of the Carrickmines site, involving a major commitment of resources, and that this, subject to the further archaeological work to be completed, will preserve the main archaeological elements of the site either by record or <i>in situ.</i>The order and joint consent were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 3 July 2003, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and may be annulled by order within 21 sitting days.</P>

      <P>On 19 August 2003 I announced a review of the retail planning guidelines in the context of the floor space cap on retail warehouses contained in them. The guidelines prescribe a maximum floor area of 6,000 square metres gross retail floor space for large-scale single retail warehouse developments. This cap is being reviewed, taking account of the need to ensure effective competition in this sector of retailing and ongoing developments in retail formats while ensuring proper planning and sustainable development. Central to this review will be the potential impact of the national spatial strategy on the guidelines and the need to ensure that cities and towns have the range of retail facilities that supports their attractiveness and competitiveness for investment and population growth.</P>
      <P>To assist in carrying out the review, I invited interested parties to make submissions to my Department. The closing date for receipt of submissions was 3 October 2003, by which time 64 submissions had been received by my Department. It is my intention to assess all submissions received and these will be taken into account fully in considering whether any changes are needed in the guidelines. The review process will be carried out over the coming months.</P>

      <P>My Department has been actively engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, IMVRA, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland, MRAI, and other stakeholders with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative, PRI, to implement the European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs.</P>
      <P>Necessary enabling provisions to facilitate implementation of the directive requirements have been incorporated in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. In accordance with those, Part VA of the Waste Management Act 1996, as inserted by section 44 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, explicitly provides for producer responsibility for the free treatment and recovery of ELVs, the mandatory deposit of ELVs by their registered owners at authorised treatment facilities and the issue of certificates of destruction in respect of ELVs deposited at authorised treatment facilities for scrapping.</P>
      <P>On foot of the enactment of the necessary enabling provisions, my Department continues to engage with the relevant stakeholder groups on the detailed mechanisms for the operation of the free ELV take-back arrangements required by the directive, including how such arrangements will be funded. Such detailed mechanisms will be provided for in regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to implement the proposed ELV take-back scheme by means of a PRI which would involve the establishment of a collective industry-based company similar to the Repak <Col N="1262" /> model which operates for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. In accordance with the usual arrangements for PRIs, responsibility for funding the free take-back scheme would in the main fall to the motor industry, and the imposition of Government levies on new and used cars is not proposed.</P>
    <P>The timing of the commencement of free ELV take-back is dependent on the conclusion of the discussions with the relevant stakeholder groups. It is my objective that these discussions will be concluded as soon as possible to facilitate early implementation of the proposed take-back system and to ensure that, by the time the Directive becomes fully operational in 2007, Ireland has a system in place for the recovery and recycling of ELVs capable of meeting the targets and standards set out in the directive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing coming through the new affordable housing initiative under Sustaining Progress, as well as through existing schemes. The announcement in July 2003 of the immediate release of two sites in Dublin, and agreement to a proposal relating to two further sites in Meath and Kildare was a critical step in ensuring early delivery of affordable housing under this initiative. Arrangements are now being put in place for the establishment and transfer of title of these four sites and implementation meetings have been held with all relevant local authorities. This initiative, combined with <Col N="1263" /> Part V arrangements, will build on the progress made in delivering existing affordable housing schemes to boost the supply of affordable housing over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Government is working with the parties to the pay agreement to define the precise terms of the initiative, including the eligibility criteria to apply to the target group. It is the intention that the initiative will be targeted at those who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but find that they are unable to do so in the current market.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has indicated, the Government is looking at the potential to release further State land for this initiative and a series of meetings have been held with other Departments in this regard. A review of local authority land is also under way and the results of this analysis will be reported to Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>We are working on the models for delivering the initiative to ensure that it does not have an impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances nor detract from the funding available for existing social and affordable housing programmes.</P>
    <P>We must be pragmatic about the timescale within which these issues can be addressed. The timescale for the delivery of units on each site will be dependent on the individual site characteristics, including its planning and servicing status. We are committed in our support for this initiative and I believe that, with the shared resolve of the Government and the parties to the pay agreement in respect of the issues which undoubtedly have to be resolved, we will meet the challenge set in Sustaining Progress and achieve measurable progress by the mid-term review next year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Construction Industry Federation and others regarding delays being encountered in the provision of necessary waste recovery and disposal infrastructure. In this regard, the national development plan, NDP, sets for the first time on a national basis an ambitious investment target for the provision of infrastructure to meet anticipated recovery and disposal requirements across all waste streams, including construction and demolition waste, as proposed in the local authority regional waste management plans. Under the NDP it was intended that, of the &euro;825 million to be invested, &euro;571 million would be secured through public private partnerships.</P>
      <P>While delays were experienced in completing the waste management planning process, the focus has firmly moved on to plan implementation. Since November 2002, I have allocated &euro;22 million from the environment fund towards the provision of more than 70 local authority recycling projects. I intend to announce further allocations as projects are developed. In addition, several local authorities are actively developing public private partnership contracts for the provision of key large-scale waste management facilities. Having regard to the recent progress achieved in the implementation of the regional waste management plans, I am confident that further significant progress towards realising the investment targets set in the NDP will be achieved over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The National Construction and Demolition Waste Council, NCDWC, was established in 2002 on foot of a recommendation contained in the report of the Forum for the Construction Industry with regard to the recycling of construction and demolition waste, C&amp;D. The council, which comprises relevant stakeholders in the construction industry, including the Construction Industry Federation, was given the objective of achieving specified C&amp;D recycling targets set out in the 1998 policy statement, Changing Our Ways. In its first annual report published recently the council outlined details of a voluntary industry Initiative which invites all construction industry players to commit to specific actions aimed at increasing C&amp;D recycling. This new initiative will take effect from 1 January next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 24 July and 26 August 2003 I wrote to the British Minister for Energy, e-Commerce and Postal Services, Mr. Stephen Timms, MP, concerning widespread reports that both the Health and Safety Executive Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and the Environment Agency in Britain had expressed serious <Col N="1266" /> reservations about the structural integrity of the roof on the building at Sellafield which houses storage tanks containing the radioactive waste stream known as medium active concentrate, MAC. I had also raised this matter in May 2003 when I met with Minister Timms's predecessor whom I had asked for a report.</P>
      <P>Minister Timms has informed me in response that while the HSE is content that it is currently safe to continue using the building at which the MAC is stored, it has concerns about the acceptability of using that building for the storage of significant quantities of MAC beyond 2006. He also informed me that in 2000, HSE became concerned about the longer-term structural integrity of the building and, as a consequence, required BNFL to carry out surveys of the building structure to an agreed specification. According to Minister Timms, both BNFL and the HSE, as a result of this work, have a greater understanding of the structural condition of the building. He also tells me that HSE continues to keep a close interest in BNFL's ongoing commitment to monitor the condition of the building as well as the waste stored there. In his letter, the Minister reiterated British Government policy on the confidentiality of security sensitive information.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland also raised the issue of the structural stability of the roof with its counterparts in Britain. The information obtained by the RPII from the Health and Safety Executive Nuclear Installations Inspectorate was essentially the same as that conveyed to me by Minister Timms. The inspectorate also informed the RPII that, for security reasons, it was not in a position to provide any information about the building other than what is already in the public domain.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the British authorities are concerned about the long-term use of this building and the information which I obtained from Minister Timms raises significant questions. I will be meeting Minister Timms within the next few weeks to discuss the Irish Government's concerns about Sellafield and I will be raising this particular matter again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continues to take a proactive role in opposing the risks to health and the environment associated with the operations at the Sellafield nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government states that we regard the continued existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable threat to Ireland and that it should be closed safely, and we are continuing to use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to work towards the removal of this threat.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken a demonstrable initiative in pursuit of this policy objective through its separate legal actions in relation to the Sellafield MOX plant, under the OSPAR Convention and also the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS. These actions challenged operations at the Sellafield MOX plant on economic, legal, environmental and safety grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OSPAR tribunal issued the award on 3 July 2003. Although the award did not grant Ireland a right to gain access to the confidential information withheld from Britain on public consultation papers because the tribunal deemed that <Col N="1268" /> the information sought was not environmental information, it did establish an important international legal precedent. Ireland has a right under the OSPAR convention to access to information on the marine environment, Britain has an obligation to make such information available and Ireland has a right of redress under the convention to vindicate its rights to such information.</P>
    <P>The provisional measures award and order of the UNCLOS tribunal of 24 June 2003 recommended that Ireland and Britain enter into dialogue to improve co-operation and consultation between the two Governments and to report to the tribunal on the matter on specified dates.</P>
    <P>In compliance with the tribunal's order, Ireland and Britain submitted separate reports to the tribunal on 12 September 2003, setting out the progress to date on discussions towards progressing the tribunal's recommendation. Exchanges between the two Governments at official level are continuing and a further report to the tribunal is due to be made on 17 November 2003. Following this, the parties are scheduled to meet the tribunal to make submissions in respect of resumption of the substantive proceedings.</P>
    <P>That order also directed the suspension of the substantive hearings in the case until questions of EU competence were resolved with the European Commission and, in any event, until not later than 1 December 2003.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of EU competence, the European Commission, following an exchange of views with Ireland, issued a reasoned opinion to which Ireland has responded. We are awaiting further developments with the Commission in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to the legal actions, Ireland has also responded critically to various British public consultation processes concerning the regulation of its nuclear industry covering such matters as the management of radioactive waste in Britain; a review of British energy policy and the British strategy for discharges from nuclear installations. Ireland has also been involved in stakeholder talks with regard to the development of the new nuclear decommissioning authority that is being set up in Britain, and will continue to use its influence in whatever way possible to ensure the highest safety and environmental standards are adhered to whilst continuing to campaign at every level for the ultimate safe closure of the Sellafield plant.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 69 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>One of the key targets in the national anti-poverty strategy is the provision of sufficient and appropriate emergency accommodations for rough sleepers by end 2004 in conjunction with the provision of appropriate outreach services to enable them to access the services available to them.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the homeless forum set up in each city and county to monitor the implementation of the homeless action plan which they drafted to detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services would be provided to homeless persons. Significant progress has already been made in the provision of services for rough sleepers since the publication of Homelessness &ndash; an Integrated Strategy in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Initiatives which have come on stream in the Dublin area include additional outreach teams to make contact with people sleeping rough and assist them into accommodation, the Dublin City Council nightly bus service which takes people from the streets to available accommodation, a hostel for young drug users and a long-term supported housing project for street drinkers which was opened earlier this year. Appropriate provisions are also being put in place in other local authority areas throughout the country to cater specifically for persons sleeping rough and street drinkers. My Department recoups to local authorities 90% of the accommodation related costs of these facilities while the care/support cost are provided by the health boards.</P>
      <P>As part of the assessment of homelessness in the Dublin area undertaken by the Homeless Agency and the ESRI in March 2002 and published in Counted In in 2002, the agency, in conjunction with the voluntary homeless service providers, undertook a one night street count of persons sleeping rough. They found that 140 persons were sleeping rough in the entire Dublin area, of which 79 were in the city centre even though 312 persons had indicated in the course of the assessment that they had slept rough during the previous week. A more recent one night count undertaken in April 2003 under the aegis of the Homeless Agency found some 86 persons sleeping rough in the entire Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty of carrying out an accurate count of persons sleeping rough is generally acknow<Col N="1272" /> ledged. I am, however confident that the implementation of the LINK data system, at present being piloted by the statutory and voluntary homeless service providers in the Dublin area together with the continued efforts of outreach workers will, ultimately, provide the basis for a more accurate counting system.</P>
    <P>The achievement of the NAPS target in relation to persons sleeping rough remains a Government objective and the review of this key target will be considered in the context of the overall review of the strategies that will be initiated by the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the comments contained in Focus Ireland's annual report. Accord<Col N="1273" /> ing to the assessment of housing need carried out by local authorities in March 2002, there were a total of 3,773 homeless households in the country at the time of assessment compared to 3,743 households in 1999. The great majority of these were in homeless accommodation ranging from emergency to long-term supported housing rather than on the streets.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's homeless strategy, local authorities, together with health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, are required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness. These plans are now being implemented under the aegis of the local homeless fora and significant progress is being made in meeting the accommodation and care needs of homeless persons. A wide range of additional accommodation has been provided, ranging from emergency night shelter to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation that is more suited to their needs.</P>
      <P>Increased levels of day care facilities as well as specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough as well as homeless offenders have been put in place. Further facilities will be provided as part of the full implementation of the homeless action plans.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional funding has been made available to support the implementation of the homeless strategies. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from &euro;25.4 million to &euro;50.8 million over the period 2001-05. Current funding for accommodation related homeless services by local authorities has increased substantially from &euro;12.6 million in 2000 to &euro;50 million this year. Funding continues to be made available to the voluntary sector for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons under the Department's capital assistance scheme.</P>
      <P>With a view to ensuring that progress is made, the cross-Department team on homelessness continues to monitor the implementation of the homeless strategies and a review of the strategies will be initiated by the end of 2003.</P>

      <P>Grants of up to 85% of cost, subject to a maximum cost of &euro;7,618 per house, are available for the provision of new group water schemes and for the upgrading of existing schemes. Grants of up to 100% of cost <Col N="1274" /> are available for the provision of essential water treatment and disinfection equipment in the case of existing group schemes dependent on quality deficient private sources.</P>
      <P>Group sewerage scheme grants of up to 75% of cost, subject to a maximum grant of &euro;2,031 per house, are available for the provision of common or shared wastewater disposal systems. The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee is overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme by local authorities to test a range of new, small scale wastewater collection and treatment systems, based on DBO procurement. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the committee envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside the catchment of the new treatment systems. The confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the results of the pilot programme.</P>

      <P>The system of funding put in place under the Local Government Act 1998 involved the establishment of the local government fund which contributes to the current funding needs of local authorities and provides grants towards non-national roads. This year I provided some &euro;626 million in general purpose allocations to local authorities and &euro;434 million for non-national roads grants. The general purpose allocations represent an increase of some 84% on the corresponding allocation for 1997. The 2003 non-national road grants of &euro;434 million represent an increase of over 92% on 1997.</P>
      <P>While the funding arrangements introduced through the local government fund have served local authorities reasonably well, I have decided in light of changes in the economy since 1998 and the increasing demands on local government to commission a major independent review of local government funding. Applications have therefore been invited from consultants wishing to undertake the work and I have arranged for copies of the request for proposals, including the terms of reference for the study, to be placed in the Oireachtas Library. The closing date for receipt of proposals is 7 November 2003 after which consultants will be appointed as soon as possible. It is anticipated that the review will take about a year to complete.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's position on the increasingly common practice of local authorities moving away from the provision of social housing and relying ever more on voluntary housing agencies to fulfil this service; if his attention has been drawn to the plans by local authorities to sell or hand over to housing associations their housing stock in the coming years; if he has discussed this matter with local authorities or local authority managers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in the provision of social housing is reflected in the national development plan where it is indicated that the sector should complement the role of local authorities in social housing provision. Approved housing bodies provide social housing in partnership with the relevant local authority. It is a matter for individual local authorities to decide on whether, and to what extent, to support proposals by approved housing bodies for the provision of voluntary housing with assistance under my Department's capital funding schemes for voluntary housing projects having regard to housing need. The Government has increased social housing provision by expanding both local authority and voluntary housing output very significantly.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total social and affordable housing output under the local authority housing programme, taken with housing outputs from the voluntary housing sector and other social housing measures, as well as vacancies arising during the course of the year, will meet the needs of some 13,000 households this year. This includes an estimated 1,700 houses provided by the voluntary sector. My Department will continue to strongly support the provision of social and affordable housing by the voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>These are no proposals with my Department from local authorities for the transfer of their own housing stock to approved housing bodies. While I am aware that there has been a public reference to this matter in the case of one local authority, no specific proposals have been made to my Department. Such an approach would raise complex issues which would require detailed consideration both at local authority level and by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases in which the European Commission has initiated legal action or announced that it intends to take legal action, arising from the failure by this country to implement EU directives for which his Department has responsibility; the steps he is taking to ensure that all of these directives are implemented in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23605/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently seven cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action, or announced that it intends to take legal action, in areas for which my Department has responsibility.</P>
      <P>The first case concerns the Dangerous Substances Directive (1976/464/EEC). This directive has been substantially implemented by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990 and by related Acts and regulations, such as the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996.</P>
      <P>Water quality standards for phosphorus were made in July 1998 and water quality standards for a range of other dangerous substances were made in January 2001. Monitoring by the EPA indicates that the main threat to water quality in Ireland is eutrophication due to excess inputs of phosphorus and, to a lesser extent, nitrates and that dangerous substances are generally not a problem in Irish waters. It is envisaged that the directive will be further implemented in the context of implementation of the Water Framework Directive (60/2000/EEC).</P>
      <P>The second case concerns the Nitrates Directive (1991/676/EEC) and the designation of areas as vulnerable zones and development of action programmes to protect water quality in these areas. Regulations made in May 2003 identify the whole territory of Ireland as the area to which the action programme will be applied. The detailed provisions of the action programme and related research and monitoring programmes are being developed as a matter of urgency and will shortly be the subject of consultation with the main farming organisations and other stakeholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third case relates to a number of waste issues, including progress in the licensing by the EPA of municipal waste landfills, and the regulatory control of waste activities by local authorities and the EPA. Ireland's defence, which has been submitted, is based in part on the fact that rel<Col N="1277" /> evant requirements of Council Directive 75/442/EEC have been fully transposed under the Waste Management Act 1996 and subordinate regulations, and that the process of licensing municipal landfills is virtually completed.</P>
    <P>The fourth case concerns a Commission application to the European Court of Justice seeking the application of a daily fine in order to enforce a previous judgment of the court issued in September 1999 in relation to Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, particularly in relation to peat extraction. Environmental impact assessment and planning regulations of December 2001 addressed the legal implications of the ECJ ruling. My Department announced proposals for the protection of over 100 raised bogs on 18 December 2002. The Commission has acknowledged that this was an important step towards making Ireland's new system of protection fully operational. Public consultation on the sites is now completed. The greater proportion of the sites, which were not appealed will be designated by way of statutory order in the near future and the remainder of sites under appeal will be designated when the appeals process is concluded. A defence is being prepared.</P>
    <P>The fifth case refers to the Zoos Directive 1999/22/EC which concerns the keeping of wild animals in zoos. In this case, the European Communities (Licensing and Inspection of Zoos) Regulations 2003 &ndash; SI No. 440 of 2003, which were made on 19 September 2003, complete the transposition process.</P>
    <P>The sixth case concerns Ireland's reporting requirements under Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer. Ireland was notified in October 2003 that this case was being referred to the European Court of Justice and a defence is being prepared.</P>
    <P>The seventh case relates to the &euro;20 fee for the making of a submission on a planning application which requires an environmental impact assessment, EIA. In January 2003, the European Commission issued a reasoned opinion to the effect that the fee is contrary to the public participation provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on EIA. On 22 July 2003, the Commission issued a press release in which it stated its intention to refer this case to the European Court of Justice. No official communication has been received from the Commission to date.</P>
    <P>In addition, a court judgment has been received in respect of the protection of designated shellfish in waters, in accordance with Article 5 of Council Directive 79/923/EEC. Any necessary follow-up in regard to action programmes made by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and notified to the Commission are a matter for the relevant Department.</P>

      <P>The investigation into unauthorised disposal of wastes on a former quarry at Laffan's Bridge near Killenaule, County Tipperary, was carried out by my Department's internal audit unit in association with its environmental inspectorate. An overview of this internal investigation was provided to me by the Secretary General of my Department and has been made publicly available. A copy is being sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The investigation looked into specific allegations relating to waste disposal practices in Kilkenny national monuments depot and, in particular, the composition of the waste stream involved, the duration of the unauthorised practices and the disposal site involved. The investigation tentatively estimated the volume of waste dumped at the site to be some 3,400 to 4,000 tonnes and also that some of this was generated by third parties.</P>
      <P>It is for the environmental regulatory authority concerned, Tipperary South Riding County Council, to prescribe any appropriate remediation measures in relation to the site concerned, and my Department will continue to co-operate with the council in this regard.</P>
      <P>Following on from the discovery of the unauthorised disposal of wastes at the site near Killenaule, my Department issued formal guidance on the waste management regulatory regime for my Department's non-office locations so as to ensure that appropriate waste management practices are being followed at all such locations.</P>

      <P>Section 48 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2000 provides that a planning authority may, when granting a planning permission, include conditions requiring the payment of a contribution in respect of public infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in the area of the planning authority and that is provided, or that it is intended will be provided, by, or on behalf, of a local authority. The Act provides that the basis for the determination of development contributions should be set out in a development contribution scheme which is made by the elected members following a public consultation process. Local authorities have until 10 March 2004 to adopt such schemes.</P>
      <P>Development contributions are not a new charge. The provisions in the 2000 Act, which came into operation on 11 March 2002, replace the provisions of section 26(2) of the 1963 Act which allowed planning authorities to attach conditions to the grant of planning permission requiring the payment of development contributions. These contributions support the provision of necessary infrastructure such as waste, waste water and roads, needed to allow development to proceed.</P>

      <P>The available information for disabled persons and essential repair grant schemes is published in my Department's annual and quarterly housing statistics bulletins. Local authorities were requested in early October to submit to the Department a comprehensive return on the level of activity and current situation on the schemes in their area as of 30 September, including the number of unapproved applications on hand. The responses of local authorities will be collated and made available as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the funding of the scheme, local authorities were notified of a combined allocation for the payment of disabled person's and essential repairs grants on 5 June 2003. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the schemes in their areas from within this allocation.</P>
      <P>Authorities were requested to contact my Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements to facilitate the possible reallocation of funds and to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available.

I also have contact, from time to time, with individual county and city managers on matters concerning their authorities.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I had an introductory meeting with a group of managers representing the City and County Managers Association on 17 July 2002, which touched on local government, housing, heritage, planning and the then forthcoming national spatial strategy and two plenary meetings with the county and city managers on 28 November 2002 and 29 May 2003. The meeting in November 2002 concerned the launching of the national spatial strategy and the role of managers in implementing it.</P>
      <P>The items discussed at the May 2003 meeting, which had a joint agenda drawn up by my Department and the managers, included the better local government reform programme, funding of local authorities, affordable housing and waste management. The Protection of the Environment Act 2003 and the Local Government Act 2003 were referred to in the discussions on waste management and local government respectively.</P>
      <P>It is in the nature of these meetings that they are business-like and forward looking.

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Parliamentary Question refers to media reports in August 2003 which suggested that the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield would close in 2010. Following these reports, I immediately wrote to Ms Patricia Hewitt, the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, to seek clarification on the matter. Ms Hewitt has since informed me that neither British Nuclear Fuels Limited nor the British Government has made any such announcement and that the British Government's position on the Thorp reprocessing plant is as set out in her Government's White Paper of July 2002 on Managing the Nuclear Legacy.</P>
      <P>Ms Hewitt also pointed out to me that British Nuclear Fuels Limited expects to complete its existing order book for reprocessing spent fuel at the Thorp reprocessing plant by 2010 and that operation of the Thorp reprocessing plant beyond completion of the existing order book would be dependent on there being new contracts for reprocessing further spent fuel at the plant. She also informed me that any new reprocessing contracts for the Thorp reprocessing plant would require British Government approval.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government has taken, and will continue to take, a proactive role in campaigning against reprocessing operations at Sellafield. An Agreed Programme for Government has stated that we regard the continued existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable threat to Ireland, that it should be safely closed and that we will use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to remove this threat.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I would welcome the closure of the Thorp reprocessing plant and I will continue to keep the pressure on the British Government to close the plant safely. I am arranging to meet with the recently appointed UK Minister for Energy and the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the coming weeks to discuss Ireland's concerns about Sellafield, including the reprocessing activities at the plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 119 of 17 June 2003.</P>
      <P>Progress in the implementation of the main infrastructure programmes under the national development plan for which my Department has responsibility has continued to be satisfactory through the first half of 2003. In the case of non-national roads, progress is well ahead of the midterm target of the national development plan. Completion figures for housing have generally increased for the first six months of this year in comparison with the same period last year. In August 2003, I launched the latest three year investment programme for water services which contains over 700 water and sewerage schemes at various stages of development and will contribute significantly to bring our water services infrastructure up to a world standard.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns expressed about the shortage of waste infrastructure and the impact that this can have on competitiveness and economic growth. Progress has been made in implementing plans to speed up the delivery of this infrastructure. For example, close to 500,000 households &ndash; about one third of those in the State &ndash; now have a segregated collection service for recyclables and the on-going rollout of this service continues apace. I am confident that the delivery of waste infrastructure will accelerate, assisted by a major waste awareness and communications campaign recently launched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the interest of bodies such as the Institute of Engineers and the CIF in timely and effective implementation of national development plan infrastructure programmes. I am satisfied that good progress is being made on a number of measures, while recognising that increased effort is needed to advance programmes in other areas. The mid-term review of the national development plan is nearing finalisation and I <Col N="1285" /> look forward to its recommendations for the delivery of the plan going forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make solar energy systems mandatory in new or existing buildings. Part L of the national building regulations on the conservation of fuel and energy relating to housing was upgraded for new houses commencing on or after I January 2003. I will publish Part L proposals for non-domestic Buildings, for public comment early in 2004. My Department's technical guidance document on Part L sets out three options for showing compliance for housing. One option &ndash; the heat energy rating method &ndash; makes specific provision for passive solar gain. Solar gain through windows and other glazing can be taken into account and contribute to meeting the overall requirement in terms of annual energy use.</P>
      <P>EU Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings, dated 16 December 2002, requires that, for new buildings with a floor area greater than 1,000 m2, explicit account must be taken at the design stage of the potential for use of renewable energy. The proposed building control Bill will transpose this EU requirement by the due date of 4 January 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> Under this directive a more comprehensive rating system for buildings, new and old, will be required. This methodology, which will be aligned with that in fellow EU member states, must also give credit for active solar systems such as active solar thermal, photovoltaic and geothermal energy based systems.</P>
    <P>While my Department is responsible for elements in the context of the building regulations, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has overall responsibility for energy matters, including solar energy policy. I understand Sustainable Energy Ireland, a statutory agency operating under the aegis of his Department, has a number of programmes to stimulate the wider voluntary exploitation of, amongst other things, renewable energy in buildings. I also understand SEI is funding a research project in the area of solar energy systems to help inform what policy, institutional and technical measures might be deployed in support of solar energy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>A wide range of measures have been put in place at national, regional and local level to implement the national spatial strategy, which is a 20 year planning framework designed to enable every part of the country to achieve its potential.</P>
      <P>At national level, my Department is leading and overseeing the process of embedding the national spatial strategy into the policies, programmes and activities of Departments and agencies, with a view to ensuring that all relevant activities support the national spatial strategy and that the strategy directs the spatial aspects of public sector programmes, including the determination of investment priorities.</P>
      <P>A particular emphasis is being placed on the pending mid-term review of the national development plan so as to ensure further alignment with national spatial strategy objectives. An inter-departmental steering group, similar to that which oversaw the preparation of the strategy, has been established and is now working to oversee its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> At regional level, regional authorities, working in conjunction with their constituent local authorities, are making good progress on developing regional planning guidelines to roll out the national spatial strategy in more detail at regional level. The guidelines which will emerge from this process are expected to be in place in all regions by the spring of next year.</P>
    <P>At local level, planning authorities, in consultation with relevant public agencies and the public generally, have, or are in the process of, putting in place local development frameworks and plans at the gateway and hub level to support the achievement of a critical mass of development at strategic locations. These will be coupled with complementary policies for the sustainable development of the more rural parts of the country. Work on preparation of the development frameworks referred to is well advanced in some gateways, while other gateways and hubs have been advised to advance their plans as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In adopting the national spatial strategy, the Government decided that the strategy will be an important factor in the prioritisation of capital investment, and in the allocation of sectoral investment, which in the case of my Department includes investment in water services, non-national roads and social housing provision. My Department's expenditure programmes will support the implementation of the strategy over its 20 year life.</P>
    <P>More specifically under a circular letter issued recently, local authorities were advised that in addition to compliance with previous eligibility requirements, projects being proposed for funding in 2004 out of the EU co-financed scheme of grants for improvement works on non-national roads had also to facilitate the implementation of the national spatial strategy and, in particular, had to contribute to improved accessibility to the gateways, hubs and other centres identified in the strategy. Similarly, local authorities have also been asked in their assessment of needs under the water services investment programme to identify any outstanding water services requirements necessary to give effect to the objectives of the national spatial strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The blue flag scheme is operated by the Foundation for Environmental Education, an international non-governmental organisation based in Denmark, and is administered in Ireland by An Taisce. A local authority which wishes to apply for a blue <Col N="1289" /> flag for a beach makes application to An Taisce which provides advice and guidance with regard to the scheme, the criteria on which decisions are based and aspects of beach management which may require improvement in order to secure or retain a blue flag. My Department provides grant-aid to An Taisce as a contribution towards the administration expenses of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The total of 79 blue flags awarded in 2003 in relation to 73 beaches and six marinas maintained the high number of blue flags awarded in Ireland in 2002. My Department requested a report from An Taisce as to the options and measures that might be pursued for increasing the number of blue flags awarded to areas in Ireland. I understand that An Taisce is currently undertaking research in the matter and aims to have its report completed by mid-November 2003.</P>
      <P>The blue flag scheme is mainly directed towards developed, resort beaches which have, in addition to excellent water quality, appropriate infrastructure and services. As a complement to the blue flag scheme, a separate environmental award scheme called the green coast award is now being operated on a pilot basis to recognise beaches which have excellent water quality and which are also prized for their natural unspoilt environment. The scheme is being applied at this stage to the east coast of Ireland and forms part of the clean coast project which is operated by An Taisce in partnership with the keep Wales tidy project. The project commenced in July 2003 and is substantially funded by INTERREG with additional financial support provided to An Taisce by my Department. It follows an initial pilot scheme which operated between Wexford County Council and the keep Wales tidy project.</P>
      <P>The potential for an increased number of environmental awards is being enhanced by the major investment programme under way to upgrade sewerage networks and wastewater treatment facilities. My Department's updated programme for investment in water services in 2003-05 relates to 491 wastewater schemes with an estimated capital value of &euro;3.4 billion, including all of the schemes needed for compliance with the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive. In addition, the programme now includes the schemes necessary to ensure the provision of wastewater treatment at every agglomeration of over 1,000 head of population equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC, my Department is promoting and funding, at regional level, the establishment by local authorities of interauthority projects to develop river basin monitoring and management systems and to provide the bulk of the baseline data required for implementation of the directive and for development of river basin management plans. Three such projects have already commenced and a further three projects are planned. The river basin management projects will cover all inland surface waters and groundwaters as well as estuaries and coastal <Col N="1290" /> waters out to a distance of one nautical mile. These projects will identify all significant impacts on water quality and quantity, set quality objectives and identify and put in place the necessary monitoring and management measures to achieve those objectives. These projects should lead to improved water quality in coastal areas which in turn will have a significant positive effect on the quality of bathing water in those areas.</P>

      <Quest>the measures the Government has taken to comply with its economic commitments to the right to housing contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and the reason, with specific reference to housing, the Government has not accepted the provisions of Article 31 of the Revised European Social Charter 1996 which came into force in 1999.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's ratification of the Council of Europe's revised Social Charter did not include the provision on a right to housing. The inclusion of Article 31 in our ratification was withheld, pending clarification as to whether the article seeks to confer a legal right to housing which would be justiciable in Irish courts.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing social housing in Ireland is the Housing Acts 1966-2002. While the legislation does not confer any statutory right to housing, the range and extent of measures implemented under the Housing Acts demonstrates the State's long standing commitment to ensuring that housing needs, especially social housing needs are adequately addressed.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council examined the broad issue of social and economic rights in their November 2002 report An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise. They emphasised the complex philosophical, political, legal and practical issues involved in the identification, creation, legislation and vindication of rights, especially social and economic rights. Accordingly, in Sustaining Progress, particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that standards of public services are identified, monitored and achieved. This requires further substantive improvements in the delivery of quality public services, including housing, and also requires a renewed focus on setting and achieving standards for the delivery of such services and monitoring progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> The Government considers that the most appropriate way of addressing housing needs is to continue the various programmes and fiscal incentives currently in place, to secure the necessary level of funding to support them, to review their operation on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are meeting their objectives and to put in place new programmes or measures as required.</P>

    <P>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen): On 24 June last, the tribunal established under Annex VII of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea delivered its Order No. 3, on the suspension of proceedings on jurisdiction and merits, and request for further provisional measures. The order directed the suspension of the substantive hearings in the case until questions of Community competence were resolved with the European Commission and, in any event, until not later than 1 December 2003.</P>
    <P>In ruling on Ireland's request for further provisional measures in the case, the tribunal affirmed the operation of the provisional measures prescribed by the ITLOS tribunal on 3 December 2001. The tribunal, concerned that co-operation and consultation between the two Governments may not always have been as timely or effective as it could have been, recommended that Ireland and the United Kingdom enter into discussions with a view to establishing secure arrangements, at a suitable intergovernmental level, for co-ordination of all the various agencies and bodies involved and to review the whole system of intergovernmental notification and co-operation.</P>
    <P>In compliance with the tribunal's order, Ireland and the United Kingdom submitted separate reports to the tribunal on 12 September 2003, setting out the progress to date on discussions towards progressing the tribunal's recommendation. Exchanges between the two Governments at official level are continuing and a further report to the tribunal is due to be made on 17 November 2003. Following this, the parties are scheduled to meet the tribunal to make submissions in respect of resumption of the substantive proceedings.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of Community competence, the European Commission, following an exchange of views with Ireland, issued a Rea<Col N="1292" /> soned Opinion, to which Ireland has responded. We are awaiting further developments with the Commission on this matter.</P>

While processing the application it was found that one animal, tag number DVK451213, had not calved since September 1998. The herdowner was informed on 12 September 2003 that this animal was deemed ineligible for payment under section 24viii of the terms and conditions of the scheme, as it did not appear to be intended for rearing calves for beef production. He was advised of the option to appeal this decision but has not done so to date. While the animal will be counted for stocking density purposes it has been deleted from the claim and the application has been processed for advance payment on the nine remaining animals. A 1% late application penalty will apply as the application was lodged after the closing date of 27 June 2003. Payments are commencing this week.</P>

      <P>The Government remains committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. As I have said previously, a wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy, have to be considered before a final decision is taken on a new programme of decentralisation. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility. Given the wide range of considerations, it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will take a decision on this matter. Until that decision is reached I am not in position to state which locations will be included or excluded from the programme. However, all of the submissions and representations received by my Department, including those on behalf of Newcastle West, Listowel and Kilrush, will be given consideration as part of the deliberative process.</P>

These action plans have been available on my Department's website since August. I understand that the CSPVG is continuing its work with a view to completing it first assessment within the timeframe set out in Sustaining Progress. Responsibility for action plans for the rest of the public service rests with my colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Children, Education and Science, and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 19.22 of the public service pay agreement in Sustaining Progress provides that the payment of the final two phases of the benchmarking increases and the three general round increases is dependent, in the case of each sector, organisation and grade, on verification of satisfactory achievement of the provisions on co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation, maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement.</P>
      <P>Section 26 sets out the verification arrangements. These include the adoption of action plans and the establishment of performance verification groups, PVG, in each main sector. In relation to sectoral verification of progress the steps set out in the agreement are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary General responsible for the sector will submit the reports to the PVG together with his or her assessment of progress achieved. Before reporting to the PVG, the Secretary General will inform the appropriate national council of the assessment of progress which he or she intends to convey to the PVG. Where the Secretary General considers it likely that his or her report on the assessment of verified progress achieved would not warrant implementation of a pay increase, the matter will be discussed by the relevant national council before the report is <Col N="1297" /> finalised and if he or she still intends so to report will convey any union side comments to the PVG.</P>
    <P>The PVG will decide on the basis of the reports submitted to it if the level of progress achieved during the period warrants the payment of the relevant pay increase(s). It will be open to the PVG, if it considers it desirable, to request the Secretary General to reconsider the report, or aspects of it before a final decision is taken by the PVG. In this event, the Secretary General will inform the relevant national council of the response he or she intends to make and will include any union side comments in the response to the PVG.</P>
    <P>If the PVG decides in any case that the making of a payment is not warranted, the relevant Secretary General will refer the matter to the relevant national council for discussion before he or she takes a final decision. In the event that a trade union considers that the decision made by a Secretary General is not in conformity with the terms of the agreement, it may have recourse to the provisions of paragraph 19.9 of the Public Service Pay Agreement, which deals with breaches of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides that progress can be assessed at sectoral, organisational and grade level. If the issue of a payment being withheld arises, whether that should apply at sectoral, organisational or grade level will depend on the circumstances giving rise to the decision not to make the payment.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides that the assessment will be made on five occasions under the agreement and, if it arises, the amount withheld will be the increase due on that date. Of course if previous increases have been withheld they too can continue to be withheld if a breach of the agreement has taken place.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has primary responsibility for policy in relation to service charges levied by local authorities. I am advised that the levying of waste charges gives effect to the polluter pays principle, which is reflected in both EU legislation and our own Waste Management Act 1996. The EU Commission has made it clear that the Waste Framework Directive 75/442 requires, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, the application of waste charges to all waste producers, including households, and that it would be prepared to take infringement procedures against Ireland under Article 169 of the treaty in the event that household waste charges were not imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not customary for me to indicate in <Col N="1298" /> advance what tax changes will be made in the annual budget. In any event, if there were an increase in the rate of VAT, it would be used to fund general expenditure, and not earmarked for any special purpose.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for research matters at both national and EU level lies with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>On 18 September 2003, the European Commission announced proposals for a so-called preparatory action aimed at encouraging research in the area of security. The safety and security of EU citizens is clearly a matter of central importance to the Governments of the member states. Any effort to improve the security of citizens must be seen in that light. In making the announcement, attention was drawn by Commissioners Busquin and Liikanen to the perceived need for a more structured approach to this issue at EU level, to genuine security needs of citizens across the EU and to the importance of ensuring value for money in relation to the funding of security research.</P>
      <P>I understand that a further communication from the European Commission on this matter is imminent. This, together with the proposals already announced, will require careful examination and will be the subject of negotiation at EU level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Beginning with the adoption of a new constitution for Chechnya in March 2003, the Russian Federation has made a concerted effort to build the basis of a new political system in the republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A technical mission from the OSCE's Office of <Col N="1300" /> Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, which travelled to Chechnya in the context of the constitutional referendum in March 2003, did not issue a final statement on how the referendum was conducted. However, while irregularities were acknowledged, its overall impression could be described as positive. The mission was impressed, in particular, that so many people turned out to vote despite the ongoing difficult security situation in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the March 2003 constitution, a presidential election took place in Chechnya on 5 October 2003. Neither the OSCE nor the Council of Europe monitored the election.</P>
    <P>On 26 September, the EU Presidency, on behalf of the Union, issued a statement on the election, expressing its concern at &ldquo;the indications of intimidation of candidates&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;allegations of manipulation of the electoral process&rdquo;. The Presidency recalled the importance of independent media in ensuring a free and fair election. Following the election, the EU issued a further statement on 9 October, noting again &ldquo;the lack of real pluralism of candidatures for the presidency&rdquo; and the absence of independent media, as well as expressing serious concerns regarding the conditions in which the elections were held.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the terms of these declarations. We are not confident that the election on 5 October met international standards. In this, it represents a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. We acknowledge the right and responsibility of the Russian Government to oppose terrorism and crime, and to protect its citizens. In this context, I strongly condemn the terrorist bomb attacks, which have caused significant loss of life in Chechnya and in neighbouring republics in recent months. However, the fight against terrorism, in the Russian Federation as elsewhere, must be conducted in accordance with internationally accepted human rights standards. Unfortunately, as I have often noted in this House, there continue to be credible reports of human rights violations committed by Russian troops against Chechen civilians. Such occurrences can only hinder prospects for long-term peace and reconciliation. I can only encourage the Russian Government to intensify the efforts it has made to eliminate such incidents and to bring the perpetrators to justice.</P>

      <P>To date two sessions of the UN <i>ad hoc</i> committee to consider proposals on a comprehensive and integral international convention on promotion and protection of the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities have taken place. These sessions were held in New York from 29 July to 9 August 2002 and from 16 to 27 June 2003. On both occasions Ireland was represented by officials from my Department and from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the second session of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee, the EU expressed its support for an international convention whose purpose should be to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities. The fundamental principles to be followed are: non-<Col N="1304" /> discrimination, equality of opportunity, autonomy, participation and integration. The EU also tabled a paper setting out in more detail elements for such a convention. Ireland participated actively in EU discussions on the proposed convention and supports the EU common position I have described. It is expected that work will begin early next year on drawing up a draft convention for consideration by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee. I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to participate actively and constructively in all meetings at EU and UN level on this matter.</P>

      <Quest>if it is the intention of the Government to give development assistance in Uganda solely to non-governmental organisations rather than to the Ugandan Government.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's programme of development assistance in Uganda is focused on poverty reduction and is having a very real impact on the lives of the poorest people in Uganda. Uganda has a very fine record in the area of poverty reduction. According to the World Bank, the number of people living in poverty has been reduced from 56% of the population in 1992 to 35% in 2000. No other country in Africa has achieved such dramatic development progress. No less importantly, Uganda has also led Africa in the fight against HIV-AIDS and is one of only two countries in the continent where the infection rates have fallen significantly. In addition, Uganda has introduced universal primary education and has doubled the number of children attending school.</P>
      <P>Our programme provides support to Uganda through a mix of modalities, including through non &ndash; governmental organisations NGOs, and it is our intention to continue doing so. NGOs have an important role to play in the development process, including a clear role in the welfare and development area through their interaction with communities. However, while they are a significant part of the process, they cannot substitute for others, including government aid programmes. No one would argue, including virtually all NGOs, that they are capable of building or sustaining the national-level policies and programmes on which successful development rests. The view of all donors and of the UN is that there can be no development without government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Support for the development of good governance is a key component of our Uganda programme, underpinning as it does the entire development partnership. It is based on a good governance strategy, involving a number of co-ordinated interventions across a range of governance areas including human rights, democratisation, and anti-corruption measures. In addition, our funds are protected by an overlapping series <Col N="1305" /> of accounting and audit controls which ensure that all our funds are fully accounted for and are spent as planned and on schedule.</P>
    <P>The Government has been assured that all Ugandan troops have now been withdrawn from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Ugandan authorities have been extending full co-operation to the EU and UN peacekeeping operation in the DRC. In addition, the peace process in the DRC has made significant headway, with a transitional government now in place and in the process of establishing its authority, and all reports indicate that the situation there has considerably improved. The appeals and pressure applied to the Ugandan authorities by the donor countries with aid programmes in Uganda, including Ireland, have in my view been instrumental in contributing to this outcome. Our aid programme, and the government to government relationship which it involves, gives us an access to the Ugandan authorities and a leverage which we would not otherwise have. More recently Uganda, the DRC, Burundi and Rwanda pledged at a meeting at the UN on 26 September 2003 to respect one another's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence and refrain from interfering directly or indirectly in one anther's internal affairs. They also pledged to prevent direct or indirect support to armed groups operating in the eastern part of the DRC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>The consolidation of peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will continue to be a priority for the Government during Ireland's Presidency of the EU. In the past two years, substantial progress has been made by the parties to the conflict to permanently resolve their differences and to bring about just and lasting peace in the DRC. All foreign forces have withdrawn their troops from DRC territory and the Inter-Congolese Dialogue has culminated in the signing on 2 April 2003, of the Final Act of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and the establishment of the transitional Government. In July, the new Government of the DRC met for the first time and in August the interim Parliament was officially inaugurated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Final Act, the parties comprising the <Col N="1306" /> two main rebel groups, the Government, the unarmed opposition and representatives of civil society, have agreed to establish a transitional power-sharing government for two years, to be followed by elections. In March 2003, the Security Council passed Resolution 1468 which welcomed the agreement reached by the Congolese parties at the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and called for the establishment of the transitional Government without delay. The Irish Government fully supports the establishment of the transitional Government in the DRC as part of the process of national reconciliation provided for under the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. During our membership of the UN Security Council, Ireland was an active supporter of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue to which we contributed &euro;127,000 to the Office of the Facilitator.</P>
    <P>The Government has also provided substantial humanitarian assistance in response to the enormous suffering caused by conflict and natural disasters in the DRC. Development Co-operation Ireland DCI has delivered almost &euro;5 million in emergency humanitarian aid for the people of the DRC since 2000. In addition, under DCI's multi-annual programme scheme, an estimated &euro;1.1 million is being provided to Concern for a three year development assistance programme in the sectors of health and livelihood security.</P>
    <P>For Ireland and our EU partners, the principal priority going forward into the Irish Presidency is to consolidate the progress made so far by assisting the Transitional Government in institution-building, constitutional reform and strengthening the rule of law. In this respect, the release of &euro;205 million in European development funding to the DRC is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Ireland and its EU partners will continue to encourage the Transitional Government in Kinshasa to consolidate its authority throughout the territory of the DRC and to hasten the process of creating an integrated national army and police force. Specifically, as regards the envisaged integrated police force, the EU is currently exploring how it might best assist this process.</P>
    <P>In July 2003, the External Relations Council reiterated the EU's determination to deploy all its instruments in support of the political process under way in the DRC. To this end, the EU is committed to providing support for the work of the Ituri Interim Administration and the Ituri Pacification Commission, support for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process and the launch of a local reconciliation process. Ireland fully intends to sustain the positive engagement of the EU in the DRC and the Great Lakes region during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the EU will continue to help foster good relations between the DRC and neighbouring countries. An important event during Ireland's Presidency will be the Great Lakes Conference, which is currently scheduled to take place in June 2004. The conference will focus on peace, security, democracy and development in <Col N="1307" /> the Great Lakes region and will be held under the auspices of the African Union and the UN.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of Ireland's commitment to the DRC, we will ensure that the EU Special Representative to the Great Lakes Region is utilised to the full in promoting EU policy in the region. We will also seek to have the mandate of the Special Representative renewed during our Presidency. In addition, my Department continues to avail itself of bilateral meetings with regional and pan-African parties to stress Ireland's support for the peace process in the DRC and to encourage others to fully support the transitional institutions in that country. Without doubt, the scope for such opportunities will increase during our Presidency of the EU and we stand ready to respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also continue to voice strong support for initiatives aimed at ending the culture of impunity generally in the region and bringing to account all those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts of genocide.</P>

It has been assigned a band two rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. Projects listed in sections six and seven will not be authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning at this time. Budgetary provisions in 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progression to tender and construction of these projects in conjunction with the band rating individually assigned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the precise level of funding allocated to primary building projects is being determined in the context of the ongoing 2004 Estimates campaign.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I am negotiating with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to put in place a multi-annual capital funding envelope for the next four to five years. I consider that the provision of such an envelope for the schools building programme will provide greater clarity for all education partners concerning the progress of projects within the programme. The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2003 schools building programme was published on 22 January 2003 and amounted to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, several hundred schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme <Col N="1309" /> and of course all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
    <P>An innovative feature of this year's programme is the introduction of a devolved building initiative for small rural primary schools. Twenty school communities will benefit from this pilot initiative. The feedback from schools on this initiative is very positive and most of the 20 schools will have commenced construction works before the end of this year.</P>

As this is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the school transport scheme, it is not open to my Department to sanction an extension of service as requested. As a rule post-primary school transport routes are planned so that as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than two miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.

    <P>These figures refer to those classified under &ldquo;science&rdquo; in the ISCED, one-digit, field of study; ISCED stands for international standard classification of education systems. Under this classification, &ldquo;science&rdquo; covers those enrolled in the life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics and statistics, and computing.</P>
    <P>A number of important steps have been taken to arrest the decline in interest in science which is a problem not just in Ireland but in most developed countries. In particular, important progress has been made in regard to: curricular reform and inservice support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology and physics and chemistry, revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003-04, and work under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All of these developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers. Three days of inservice training was provided for all primary teachers to support the implementation of the primary science programme, supported by a national team of 24 trainers.</P>
    <P>Some 1,700 second level biology teachers, 900 chemistry teachers and 1,000 physics teachers received inservice training for the leaving certificate revised syllabi, and a national programme is now being implemented for the revised junior certificate science syllabus.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made in relation to: resourcing, with substantial grants issued to primary schools in 1999, 2001 and 2002 at a cost of &euro;10.376 million over three years; an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate; a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment allied with the recent announcement of a once-off grant scheme, likely to cost in the order of &euro;12 million to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative, and a new Scope initiative in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education; provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path; reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in <Col N="1313" /> the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science, and initial reports on teacher training undertaken; awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges linking with schools; foundation, bridging and progression measures to promote access to third level education; quality assurance initiatives in third level, including the sciences; and the development of a national framework of qualifications by the National Qualifications Authority as an important step in developments to improve access, promote flexible assessment and accreditation processes, and enhance mobility across the further and higher education and training sectors.</P>
    <P>This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forfás and industry. My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.</P>
    <P>While the effect of these measures may only be felt in the longer term there are already some signs of improvement. At leaving certificate level there are three main science subjects, biology, chemistry and physics. Biology remains a popular subject with 40.3% of the cohort sitting the examination in June 2003, an increase from 39.8% in 2002.</P>
    <P>The uptake of physics and chemistry has been a cause of concern for some time. The decline in uptake of these subjects started in the 1980s and continued until recently. There has been a reversal of the trend in 2002. In the leaving certificate examination in June 2002, 15.6% of the cohort took physics, up from 14.1% in 2000, and 11.7% took chemistry, up from 11.1% in 1999. In 2003, 15.7% took physics and 11.9% took chemistry.</P>
    <P>At junior certificate level there is one science subject and the uptake of this subject has been consistently high: some 85.7% of the cohort took it in 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools are institutions that are privately owned and managed. Secondary schools that are recognised for purposes of the Education Acts 1878 to 1998 may qualify for grant aid.</P>
      <P>Grant aid towards voluntary secondary schools that are participants in the free education scheme is structured on the basis of teacher salary payments and capitation grants towards the recurrent costs, with additional financial assistance towards services such as caretaking and secretarial. The day to day running of schools is a matter for school managerial authorities. The rates of these grants have been increased substantially in recent years, and a number of new grants such as the school services support grant have also been introduced. Schools have considerable discretion as to how this funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils and schools. In the case of voluntary secondary fee-paying schools, that are not within the free education scheme, different funding mechanisms apply including the block grant mechanism that is in place to meet the particular needs of Protestant schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution of religious congregations towards education provision has long been a feature of the Irish education system. The level and extent of the funding provided by the religious congregations is a matter for the congregations themselves. Traditionally, members of religious orders devoted some of their salaries to the general education costs of their schools while others worked in a voluntary capacity in school administration. As schools are not required to submit returns of voluntary contributions received by <Col N="1315" /> them, my Department has no basis on which to estimate the total amount of such contributions.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Insurance Costs.</Title>
    <P>117. </P>
    <P>Ms Enright asked the Minister for Education and Science the assistance given by his Department towards the cost of insurance at schools, both primary and secondary; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [23767/03]</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned. <i>Per capita</i> grants towards the operating costs of primary and voluntary secondary schools may be used for this purpose. <i>Per capita</i> grants have been increased significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the capitation grant has increased from &euro;57.14 in 1997 to &euro;111.58 in 2003. This represents an increase of 95% in the capitation grant over that period.</P>
      <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant now amounts to &euro;266.49 as against the rate of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997. For disadvantaged schools the increase has brought the <i>per capita</i> grant to over &euro;300. In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of &euro;25 per pupil that was introduced for schools in September 2000 was increased to &euro;63 per pupil in November 2001. It was further increased to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by &euro;10 per pupil from January last bringing the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to &euro;127 per pupil.</P>
      <P>This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, or &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that has been approved for voluntary secondary schools. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives.</P>
      <P>For example in a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum and annual grants of &euro;236,761 &ndash;&euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools &ndash; towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In this context, the Tánaiste has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish <Col N="1316" /> insurance market. The Government considers that these measures, taken as a package, constitute a programme that is capable of delivering very real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of post-primary education provision, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own postprimary education centre. These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme. The catchment boundaries were determined following consultation with local educational interests and the intention was that certain primary schools would feed exclusively into each centre. A relatively small number of primary schools are shared between two or more centres. There are no specific regulations governing the determination of catchment areas.</P>
      <P>The revision of catchment areas is addressed by my Department as the need arises. It is the practice in my Department to consult with local educational interests where any such adjustments are being contemplated.</P>

      <P>The 2003 school building programme was published on 22 January 2003 and amounted to &euro;342.9 million &ndash; four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level across the country including schools in County Kildare. In addition, several hundred schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
      <P>An innovative feature of this year's programme is the introduction of a devolved building initiative for small rural primary schools. Some 20 school communities will benefit from this pilot initiative. The feedback from schools on this initiative is very positive and most of the 20 schools will have commenced construction works before the end of this year. I hope to build on this initiative in future years.</P>
      <P>The cost of the 2003 building programme, published on my Department's website, provides details of the level of commitments to be met in 2003 and the estimated amount available for new projects.</P>
      <P>I am seeking a multi-annual capital funding envelope for the next four to five years in the context of this year's estimates process. The provision of such an envelope for the school building programme will enable my Department to provide greater clarity for all education partners and other interested parties concerning the progress of projects within the programme.</P>
      <P>The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in the agreed programme for Government.</P>

      <P>It is a long-standing legal requirement that all fishing vessels wishing to engage in commercial sea-fishing must have a sea-fishing boat licence. This requirement is set down in section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, as amended and restated by section 4 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vessels targeting wild and farmed bivalve molluscs are licensed in what is called the Specific segment of the Irish fleet. These vessels, such as mussel dredgers, were exempt from the application of EU fleet policy but come within a recently introduced EU policy on fleet management. This means that these vessels, which had already required to be licensed, must in future comply with replacement capacity requirements in order to be licensed. These vessels were, in fact, already subject to an equivalent replacement <Col N="1320" /> capacity requirement under national licensing policy as a moratorium on the licensing of further such vessels, other than following replacement, has been in place since April 1999.</P>
    <P>Full-time aquaculture service vessels, including vessels which target mussel seed, are exempt from the replacement capacity requirement as they do not come within the new EU policy but still require to be licensed and must comply with strict national licensing criteria.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria against which projects are assessed under the sports capital programme can be summarised as follows: the extent to which projects increase active participation and result in improved standards of sport &ndash; high priority is given to projects which are essential or integral to sports participation and to projects in disadvantaged areas; the financial viability of the project &ndash; higher rating is given to projects with a significant local contribution and those which demonstrate that the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds and an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; and the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools, the local authority <Col N="1322" /> and the national governing bodies in order to prioritise proposed improvements and facilities.</P>
    <P>All applications are treated on their merits and highest priority is afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation. High priority projects include those which are essential or integral to sports participation or performance, for example pitch development, floodlighting, dressing rooms and showers.</P>
    <P>Following the assessment process each application receives a score, which decides its order of priority within its own county. Recommendations, based on conclusions from this process and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution, are made to me, and I make the final decision on projects and grants to be allocated under the programme.</P>
    <P>A copy of the guidelines, terms and conditions which applied to the 2003 sport capital programme is available on my Department's website, <i>www.gov.ie/arts-sport-tourism</i></P>

      <P>One of the stated main objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.</P>
      <P>For the 2003 sports capital programme, following consultation with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, DCRGA, it was decided that disadvantaged areas were those that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by DCRGA, including RAPID 1, RAPID 2 and CLÁR areas.</P>
      <P>Projects identified as being located in RAPID or CLÁR areas were permitted to have a lower minimum threshold in respect of local funding &ndash; 20% as against 30% &ndash; in order to qualify under the terms and conditions of the programme. Extra marks were also awarded to such projects during the assessment process ensuring them a higher placing in the order of merit within their respective counties for grant allocation purposes. Further marks were also awarded to projects endorsed by RAPID area implementation teams.</P>

      <P>The health service performance verification group met on 10 July. At this meeting the group reviewed the health service modernisation action plan submitted by the health service national partnership forum. The group proposed a number of amendments to the plan and sent it back to the HSNPF. The forum endorsed the revised plan on 16 July. It was published on the website of the Health Service Employers Agency at www.hsea.ie on 29 July. Recently it was laid before Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The completed plans from chief executive officers of the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority and other relevant health service agencies, as well as the sectoral report on modernisation in the health service, are due to be completed by early November.</P>
      <P>The full action plan is as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Sustaining Progress</P>
      <P Just="Center">Health Service Performance Verification Process</P>
      <P Just="Center">Action Plan Reports by Heads of Organisations</P>
      <P>Sustaining Progress provides for the establishment of performance verification groups in respect of each sector of the public sector to oversee the attainment of the objectives set out in the agreement. The performance verification process requires that heads of organisations within the health sector prepare and submit progress reports on the attainment of objectives set out in the action plan agreed for the sector by the national partnership forum and approved by the PVG.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heads of organisations are required to submit <Col N="1326" /> such progress reports to the Health Service National Partnership Forum, which in turn is required to submit them, in addition to an overall report on the health sector, to the secretary general of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Assessment of verified progress is undertaken by the PVG for the sector and organisations and grades within the sector, following receipt of the reports and an assessment of progress achieved by the secretary general.</P>
    <P>Payment of phases 2 and 3 of the pay awards of the Public Service Benchmarking Body and the general pay provisions of Sustaining Progress requires formal verification of progress. If a PVG decides, in any sector, that the making of a payment is not warranted, the relevant secretary general is required to refer the matter to the relevant national council for discussion before he/she takes a final decision.</P>
    <P>The full text of the specific provisions of Sustaining Progress in relation to Modernisation of the Health Sector, section 23, and to Modernisation of the Public Service, section 20, and the performance verification process, section 26, is as follows at Appendix 1.</P>
    <P>The progress report now requested is in respect of the period commencing on 1 July and should be submitted not later than 31 October. The template for reporting has been approved by the PVG for the health service and the HSNPF. It sets out relevant commitments/actions contained within the agreement and is formulated to ensure a necessary measure of uniformity in reporting formats.</P>
    <P>The reporting format requires response to a series of questions drawn from both the health specific and broader public sector elements of Sustaining Progress. The required report is in respect of your organisation only. Elements of the agreement, which are being progressed at national level, are not included in the action plan report.</P>

      <P>Good progress has been made in the implementation of <Col N="1332" /> the national roads upgrade programme provided for in the NDP. Over the period 2000 to 2003 Exchequer investment will total approximately &euro;3.8 billion and 32 projects &ndash; a total of 240 km, including 64 km of motorway and 34 km of dual carriageway standard, have been completed to date.</P>
      <P>In addition, work is under way on 18 projects totalling 180 km, including 145 km to motorway-dual carriageway standard. Another 16 projects &ndash; a total of 145 km &ndash; are at tender stage. In relation to the five major inter urban routes, the position is that by the end of the year approximately 30% of these routes will be upgraded to motorway-dual carriageway standard with work under way on approximately another 12%.</P>
      <P>The increased cost of the programme provided for in the NDP has impacted on the pace and momentum of implementation. Delivery of some projects will take longer than originally anticipated. Project completion dates will depend on the funding levels available in the years ahead, including from additional sources, and on construction and land costs.</P>

      <P>National Car Testing Service Limited is required to meet a range of performance standards for service delivery.

A primary objective of these standards is to optimise test integrity and consistency across the testing network.</P>
      <P>My Department oversees a monitoring programme to ensure that the company delivers the car testing service to the required standards. It includes detailed monthly operational audits of the company's performance; quarterly controlled checks to ensure that consistent test results are obtained across the NCTS test centre network; each month reviewing the performance of a sample of vehicle inspectors as they carry out tests; carrying out spot checks without any advance warning on a representative sample of cars that have just undergone the NCT; carrying out detailed interviews with a representative sample of customers to assess customer satisfaction levels; and a comprehensive annual review of the company's overall performance.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, customers can be confident that there are no variations in the standards of the test no matter where it is conducted on the network. Due to these safeguards test outcomes represent the actual condition of vehicles presented for test.</P>
      <P>The failure rates for vehicles on first presentation for the NCT at the Drogheda and Dundalk test centres for each year since testing commenced in 2000 together with the relevant national failure rate are set out in the following table:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court on 23 January in the cases of L <Col N="1335" /> and O, which held that no automatic residency rights obtain in respect of non-national parents of Irish born children, the Government decided that the separate procedure which had then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child would not apply to cases which were outstanding on 19 February, that is, cases where applications were lodged but where no decision had been made.</P>
      <P>In relation to outstanding claims to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child, numbering approximately 11,000, and future claims for leave to remain in the State from the non-national parents of Irish born children the Government decided that every such case would be examined and decided individually.</P>
      <P>In respect of every person, including a parent of Irish born children, who has no legal entitlement to remain in the State, a letter issues under the terms of section 3(4) of the Immigration Act 1999, informing him or her of the Minister's intention to deport. The person is allowed 15 days in which to opt for one of the following: make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he or she should not be deported that is, be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leave the State before an order is made; or consent to the making of a deportation order.</P>
      <P>If the person opts to make representations as to why he or she should not be deported, a range of factors specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, is taken into account in making a decision the case. These factors include the person's individual family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations. In the case of a parent of Irish born child, particular regard is given to the Supreme Court judgment in the L and O case and the subsequent judgments in this area.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity of the task which the individual consideration of each of the outstanding Irish born child cases will involve, it was agreed that additional staff resources would be provided, by way of a levy on Departments, to process these cases. These staff will be coming on stream from next month to begin work on case processing. At this stage it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of how long on average it will take to process cases, as some will be more complex than others.</P>

    <P>With regard to the issue of work permits, I <Col N="1336" /> assume the Deputy is referring to those applicants for residency who do not enjoy an existing legal basis for residing in the State which enables them to work in the State. If the applicant is a current asylum applicant the position is that such persons are prohibited by law from entering employment in accordance with section 9(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996. Therefore the issue does not arise.</P>
    <P>In so far as the remainder of such persons are concerned, the course of action proposed by the Deputy would involve the granting of permission to work in the State to persons who do not have permission to reside in the State. Consequently I could not agree to such an approach.</P>

      <Quest>if he has considered the potential cost savings to the State, as well as the potential for generating tax revenues to the Exchequer, of allowing asylum seekers to work pending determination of their refugee claim as is the case in the Canadian immigration system; and if, on this basis, he will consider abolition of the direct provision system in favour of a work permit system for asylum seekers.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Question No. 501 of 1 July and Question No. 302 of 12 February. They clearly set out the rationale behind the policy of not <Col N="1338" /> allowing asylum applicants to take up paid employment pending a decision on their applications.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons present policy should not be changed: it would not be possible under present legislation; have a major negative impact on the Government's asylum strategy; it would be a major pull factor leading to a large increase in asylum applications &ndash; as happened when the Government, as an exceptional measure, decided in 1999 to allow certain asylum applicants to enter into employment; it would undermine the present legitimate entry process for immigration and employment &ndash; some 36,225 work permits have been issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment so far this year as at 30 September; it would have potential implications for trafficking; and it would have a negative impact on our ability to accommodate asylum applicants and to provide them with decent levels of State services.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Government has recently introduced extensive amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 which will provide a more comprehensive framework for the fair and expeditious processing of asylum applications. These amendments are based on the experience of operating the Refugee Act gained over the past few years and, in particular, in dealing with the high level of unfounded and abusive applications for asylum and the high number of no shows at interviews which are tying up large amounts of resources which could be better used to provide support to genuine refugees.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that allowing asylum applicants to take up paid employment would greatly undermine the effectiveness of these amendments. To date the Government's general asylum strategy has given rise to greater efficiencies in the State's asylum processing system and a significant reduction in the timescale for processing asylum applications.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to abolish the system of direct provision which meets the day-to-day needs of asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>I am aware of speculation in the media and elsewhere about the possible closure of Fort Mitchell place of detention and, indeed, other prisons and places of detention as part of measures to control prison costs generally. The position is that the efforts of the prison service to control costs in prisons are currently very much focused on reaching agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on a range of measures designed to significantly enhance the operational efficiency of prisons. The Prison Officers' Association is due to ballot its members on the proposals very shortly.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the existing cost structure of the prison service is unsustainable. In the absence of agreement, the Government will decide urgently on measures which it has recently discussed to significantly reduce costs in the service. I do not believe it would be helpful or appropriate to outline at this time the measures which will be considered by Government if agreement cannot be reached with the Prison Officers' Association by the end of this month. I very much hope agreement can be reached very soon and that the necessary progress can be made on the basis of consensus.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, that 24-hour foot and mobile patrols are carried out by Garda personnel working the regular three-relief system in each division throughout the Dublin metropolitan region. Each district is divided up into a number of foot beats, based on population and crime trends. Community police units which work between the hours of 8 a.m. and 2 a.m. the following day augment these patrols. Other uniform patrols include divisional crime task force and divisional traffic units. Plain clothes personnel also patrol in each district. All foot and mobile patrols are regularly examined with a view to ensuring the optimum level of Garda service.</P>
      <P>In addition to regular uniformed and non-uniformed patrolling of the city centre, a new city centre policing initiative was launched on 9 June 2003 by the Assistant Garda Commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region. This initiative provides a high visibility policing presence in specific target areas in the north and south inner city centre areas. It targets issues of concern such as public order, assaults, street theft, shoplifting and drug addicts. Another initiative, Operation Boulevard, which targets anti-social behaviour in the environs of O'Connell Street, is also in operation.</P>
      <P>In May of this year, the National Crime Council published its report Public Order Offences In Ireland. Based on analysis of public order offences in Dublin, the researchers found that over half were concentrated in 18 streets in the centre of the city. These streets typically included the main entertainment areas and thoroughfares of the city centre, and were centred on the O'Connell Street-Grafton Street axis of the city centre.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my response to Question No. 265 of 2 October 2003, the parents' permission to reside in the State is based solely on parentage of an Irish born child. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the Government decided, <i>inter alia,</i> that the general policy of allowing such persons to be joined in the State by other family members would no longer apply. The circum<Col N="1342" /> stances of this case do not warrant a departure from that general policy. I should add that on the basis of information available in my Department, including information obtained from the German authorities, the accounts given by the persons in question regarding their residence prior to their arrival in this jurisdiction contain significant inconsistencies. There are also serious inconsistencies related to their children.</P>

      <P>The number of legally resident nationals of the Democratic Republic of Congo who registered with the Garda in 2002 was 669. This figure excludes persons who have been in the State less than three months, female spouses of Irish nationals and persons under 16 years of age. It also excludes persons who are in the asylum process or who have failed the asylum process and who have not been given residency in the State on any other basis. In the same year, 270 nationals of the Democratic Republic of Congo applied for asylum in this State. There are a wide variety of circumstances in which a person may apply for residency in the State. It is also the case that a person who is legally resident on one basis may apply for residency on another basis. Generally this arises because of additional benefits which may accrue as a result of that latter permission. Consequently, it is not possible to determine in respect of each Congolese national the number of separate applications made without the deployment of a disproportionate amount of resources.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they consider a new station to be required in Ballincollig. In that connection, as a first step in the process, the Office of Public Works needs to secure a suitable site. When that has been achieved, consideration can be given to addressing the Garda requirements. As with all such projects, I should point out that progress will be achieved as quickly as overall priorities within the Garda building programme and the availability of financial and other resources allow.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>The equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-06 has been established to support the development of quality, affordable and accessible childcare to meet the needs of parents who wish to remain in, or return to, the labour force or to undertake training or education to enhance their employment opportunities. The programme which is funded by both the Exchequer and the European Union has a total budget of &euro;437 million to distribute over the life of the national development plan. Each application for funding under the capital grant scheme is assessed on its own merits. The maximum level of funding for private providers is &euro;50,790 or 65% of the total cost, whichever is the lesser. However, no limit applies to community based or not-for-profit groups. Due consideration is given to the size of the development and the proposed service on offer to ensure that value for money is achieved and also that all other elements of the programme criteria are satisfactorily addressed. In addition to capital grants, the programme also has scope to consider applications for staffing supports from community-based child care services. These services, however, must be located in areas of significant disadvantage or have a particular focus on disadvantage. While there is no average allocation awarded under the programme, consideration is given to issues such as opening hours, duration of service, number of weeks, whether the service is catering for babies, etc.</P>
      <P>Since the commencement of the programme a total of &euro;85,669,204 has been committed to 737 projects under the staffing measure. The grants were, in the main, allocated over a three-year period. Of this total, funding of almost &euro;2.2 million has been committed to 88 projects for a one-year period. In the same period, capital funding totalling &euro;110.7 million was committed to 1,064 projects from both the community-based child care services and private child care providers. The total funding approved to child care providers since 1 January 2003 is &euro;36.1 million with the average grant amount of &euro;99,300.</P>

These medical professionals have informed the governor of Castlerea Prison that their conclusion is that this person is not suffering from any form of psychosis and that there is no medical reason or need for him to be moved to the Central Mental Hospital. The director general has also advised me that this person is currently accommodated in the special care unit of Castlerea Prison where he has access to daily recreation if he wishes to avail of it and not an isolation cell as the Deputy has stated. He was also offered a move to the main landings or the grove area of the prison and I am informed that he has declined each of these proposals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The hardware and software of the electronic voting and counting system has been subjected to an extensive testing regime by a range of inde<Col N="1348" /> pendent Irish and international test institutes and companies and by my Department. All tests have confirmed that the system operates satisfactorily, is secure and maintains the integrity of votes cast. The use of the software referred to has been specifically evaluated by an independent software company who have confirmed that it is suitable for purpose. My Department is considering additional security measures, both technical and procedural, which will ensure a high level of security in the use of the system. The computers which will be used for the election setup and the counting of votes are stand-alone and will not be connected to the Internet or to any internal or external network. The computers will be security hardened before delivery. In the even of a power failure the voting machine will be connected to a battery until power is restored. Votes cast will be secure at all times. Cost comparisons of a national poll carried out with the present system and the new system will not be available until after the first use of the new system countrywide next year.</P>
    <P>I refer also to the reply to Question No. 202 of 9 October 2003 in relation to the integrity and security of the system. The Council of Europe is at present considering the standards required for an e-voting system which would make use of the Internet and telephones. Some countries have concerns about the security of such systems especially in relation to the secrecy of the ballot. The system to be used in this country is not such a system.</P>

      <P>Part B, fire safety, of the building regulations requires that a building shall be so designed and constructed that there are adequate means of escape in case of fire from the building to a place of safety outside the building, capable of being safely and effectively used.</P>
      <P>My Department's technical guidance document B, or TGD-B, provides advice on compliance with part B. Section B 1 of TGD-B &ndash; means of escape in case of fire &ndash; provides guidance on appropriate means of emergency egress for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Part M of the building regulations requires that buildings to which the regulations apply must include adequate means of access for people with disabilities. This is generally secured by provision of a ramp, as an alternative to steps, at the entrance. In the event of a fire or other emergency, exits other than the entrance may also be used.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the provisions of the building regulations relating to access and egress of people with disabilities are adequate. However, I have recently published proposals for major amendments to the fire safety provisions of Part B of the regulations and the related TGD-B: for public comment, by 28 November 2003. I would be willing to carefully consider any proposals made for amendments in the emergency egress provisions relating to people with disabilities.</P>

Officials in my Department have met with Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works to progress the development of the site, and arrangements are now being put in place for the establishment and transfer of title of the site. A model for the delivery of affordable units for this site is now being developed in consultation with Dublin City Council, and it is being designed to comply with the requirement not to have an impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances. It is envisaged that Dublin City Council will have a central role in ensuring delivery of affordable housing at both the Jamestown Road and Infirmary Road sites given their considerable experience to date in delivering affordable housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Governments waste management policy statements Changing Our Ways and Preventing and Recycling Waste; Delivering Change make it clear that as a matter of equity, and to directly incentivise waste prevention and recycling, the level of waste charges imposed on households and business, should desirably be based on usage. In addition, Government policy is based on ensuring that waste charges move towards recovering the full costs of collection, treatment and disposal.</P>
      <P>In keeping with Government policy on waste charging, it is expected that all local authorities will move towards introducing weight/volume related charging to the fullest extent possible within the three-year target period up to 2005. Already, &ldquo;tag a bag/bin&rdquo; systems are in place in some local authorities and progress is being made on weight-related systems in a number of areas. In parallel, very significant progress has been made in the roll-out of segregated collection services for recyclable waste with approximately one third of all households in the State now having access to a service of this nature. I expect that further progress will be made in expanding the provision of such services over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of ensuring that the 2005 objective in relation to weight/volume-based charging is achieved, my Department has requested a report from each local authority concerning the extent to which such services are already in place <Col N="1354" /> and the proposals for their provision within the timeframe envisaged. Where appropriate, the relevant local authorities have been asked to liaise with the private waste collectors in their areas in order to obtain the necessary information.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council has responded to my Department's request for information, outlining details of the different levels of charges currently applied by the council which vary in relation to the size of bin chosen and, in certain circumstances, the type of dwelling. While the response also indicates that consideration is being given to the introduction of a third smaller bin and that the council is looking at the most effective and equitable manner of dealing with waste collection for apartments, it does not address the general issue of use-based charges which, I understand from contacts between my Department and the council, is the subject of ongoing consideration.</P>
    <P>I will be reviewing the council's response along with those of the other local authorities once the full range of responses has been received. I will also be taking into account the findings of research into the effects of weight-based charging in Cork currently being conducted by the ESRI.</P>

      <P>The aim of the Second European Round Table on Poverty and Social Exclusion, is to assess the effectiveness of the open method of co-ordination which has been adopted by the EU in progressing towards the goal of making a decisive impact on poverty and social exclusion and to identify priorities for the future development of the process. I will be chairing the first plenary session of the event and my Department will be <Col N="1355" /> represented in working sessions of the conference.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is an issue which affects all EU member states and is a policy area where the exchange of ideas and best practice, as provided for in the open method of co-ordination process, can be of great benefit. The conference will provide an opportunity to consider the homelessness issue in that context.</P>
      <P>The national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, submitted to the EU Commission in July of this year reflects the Government's continued commitment to addressing housing and accommodation needs and to ending homelessness. The overall objective in this regard set out in the national action plan is to enable households experiencing poverty and disadvantage to have available to them housing or accommodation which is affordable, accessible, of good quality, suitable to their needs, culturally acceptable, located in a sustainable community and, as far as possible, in a secure tenure of their choice. A number of key targets in this area have been set under the plan.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the office for social inclusion, has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the measures contained in the national action plan and the achievement of the targets set out in the plan. The primary responsibility for policy in relation to housing and accommodation and homelessness rests, of course, with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Since the homeless strategy was launched in 2000, that Department has overseen an improvement in both the quality and range of services for homeless persons, and is continuing to further develop and enhance these services.</P>

The submission includes proposals relating to the rate of payment of carer's allowance, the carer's allowance means test and the concurrent payment of carer's allowance with other social welfare payments.

      <Col N="1356" /> The development of the range of supports for carers is a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations already in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to note that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, included a question in 2002 census to identify the number of carers providing full-time care and attention. The analysis of this portion of the census, which became available yesterday, is as follows: 40,526 people provide 43 hours or more unpaid personal help per week, or over six hours per day; 23,366 people provide 15 to 42 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between two and six hours per day; 84,862 people provide one to 14 hours unpaid personal help per week, or up to two hours per day.</P>
    <P>There are currently 21,700 carers in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit which means that almost 34 per cent of the 64,000 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than two hours per day, are in receipt of a specific carer's payment from my Department.</P>

      <P>In response to a previous question from the Deputy in relation to the scheme it was stated that, at that time, 75,730 applications had been received up to the date in question. The figure in question, however, related to the number of awards actually made. This error is regretted. Information on the number of applications received will be available from the health boards later in the year and will be conveyed to the Deputy at that time.</P>
