      <P>The war in Iraq is obviously damaging the international business climate. Oil prices are rising, markets are in turmoil and this will impact on the Irish business sector. This is happening at a time when Irish business is suffering from the highest inflation rate in Europe. Is the Taoiseach happy to see inflation increase by 1% in February? This is the highest monthly increase in five years. Is he happy with the annual rate of inflation of 5%, two and a half times the European average? VAT has been increased in two consecutive years and there has been increases in ESB charges, telephone bills and VHI contributions. Will the Taoiseach explain the actions the Government will take to reduce this inflationary trend so that the word does not get out that Ireland is a high-inflationary area? It is difficult to persuade companies to invest in a high-inflationary area. This is all before the impact the Iraqi war will have.</P>

      <P>The war in Iraq is a tragedy. In his question, the Deputy correctly said this will have an impact on business and lead to a slowdown in the world economy. We are still projecting GNP growth of 2.25% this year. Inflation is still too high. We have had several meetings between Departments, agencies and bodies that can help us to drive down prices. Competition is obviously a factor in this. While there are some direct tax charges, our business, employment and direct taxes are lower than in most countries. Our overall tax burden is certainly not in the upper reaches among OECD countries, never mind EU states. We accept that it will be a challenge to drive down inflation. Price stability remains a key part of our fiscal policy and this will only come about through more competition in the market, trying to get better price controls and our fiscal policies. We will continue to operate all those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today is a crucial day for the partnership agreement. If it is agreed, we will work with the trade unions and employers across a range of issues and take a range of measures to try to improve on this. The issues we will be engaged in <Col N="1130" /> range from housing to salaries. Our overall policy attempts to sustain progress in a difficult international climate and hold employment and taxation at current levels. We will try to be ready to take up growth again and be in an competitive position when the international climate improves. While we are not in a great position, our position is not bad &ndash; it is certainly better than most countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that 2% of overall inflation is directly attributable to the Government's actions and reflects its inability to control price increases? The Taoiseach referred to the partnership agreement, which is based on open and honest engagement with all the social partners. The letter of determination of health expenditure for 2003 refers to a non-pay inflation factor of 2.8% while health inflation was running at 8.8%. Is that honest and open in respect of both sides? Will that gap be filled by empty wards, surgery cancellations and empty beds?</P>
      <P>The partnership agreement also refers to the fiscal policy that contributes to non-inflationary growth. However, local authority funding has decreased by 2% this year. That means that every local authority will have to charge increased commercial rates and service, water and refuse charges, while local authority rents are increasing at an enormous rate. The Taoiseach has not answered the question. The Government is directly responsible for 2% of inflation and he has failed to control prices in his own area. The stealth taxes that are creeping in throughout the country are causing grave concern and a great deal of frustration for the electorate. This is before the impact of the Iraqi catastrophe ever hits our shores. The Taoiseach might explain what measures the Government will take to reduce inflation in the coming months.</P>

      <P>We will continue both in Government Departments and agencies to follow the policy of price stability and we will try to get inflation as low as we can, although I recall when I was Minister for Finance, there was no inflation and I was called on to stimulate the economy and generate more activity in it so that there would be inflation. We do not want inflation at the level it is today. We want to control it and drive it down as best we can. There are no orders in place to control prices but if we can generate more activity and competition in the economy, that will be of assistance.</P>
      <P>I want to correct the Deputy on the health inflation figures. He outlined an overall figure but, even if he was correct, there was a 12% increase in the revised volume of the health Estimate.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree a majority of Irish people believe that the war in Iraq is an illegitimate war that might have been avoided, the case has not been proven and they cannot see what the connection is between the al-Qaeda network and the terrible atrocity of 11 September and Iraq? Does he accept the people are concerned about the ordinary people of Iraq; the duration of the war; the future of frightened children; the implications for the region and the manner in which the conflict is likely to inflame the Arab world; the implications of this stoking of enmity between the West and the Islamic world; and, above all, the emergence of a new doctrine of pre-emptive war under the present leadership of the United States?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will accept a majority of the people understand the Government had a difficult decision to make and the United Kingdom and the US are good friends of the country. However, they are distressed by the manner of the handling of the crisis by the Government and, above all, by the doctrine, articulated by the Tánaiste, of the present leadership of the US. She says it is America, right or wrong. What position will the Government take on the new doctrine of pre-emptive war? When given the opportunity at the United Nations, where will the Government stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our thoughts and concerns are with the Iraqi civilian population who bear no fault in any of this, including, as Deputy Rabbitte said, the children, women, the elderly and displaced persons caught up in the conflict, particularly in the unfolding battle at Basra. Considerable uncertainty remains concerning the direction and duration of the war and the precise needs of those directly affected. We will continue to do all we can on the humanitarian side. Yesterday I outlined our contacts with GOAL and the UN. Thankfully, the UN took many preparatory steps to avoid difficulties in the event of war and, at the same time, it worked hard to avoid war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Rabbitte stated, we have tried for many months, particularly since last September, to work with the UN to see if a peaceful resolution could be achieved. Last Monday week, unfortunately, those efforts failed and it was only then that we had to consider what position we <Col N="1132" /> would take. We decided not to be involved or to participate in any way in this conflict because we could not do so without a UN resolution. Our position is now to work as best we can and to the fullest extent with the UN on the humanitarian aid issue. We can do many things in this regard, which have been outlined.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there will be a role for the UN. That has been agreed by practically everybody and we will be able to play a role in that. Hopefully, the war will be short but nobody knows. The policy of this country since 1955 has been to play our international role in foreign policy under the collective security of the UN. That remains the position. There is no doubt this has not been a great conflict for the UN but it has had major successes and is playing a key role in many other parts of the world. Nobody should forget that. Unfortunately, this has been a bad experience but we must build on that, see where the difficulties and fault lines were and continue to work collectively, with the Security Council at the centre, to promote peace, justice and security in the world as best we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach one question. He was in the House yesterday when I traced the origins of the doctrine of pre-emptive war from 1992 through to 1997 when half a dozen people who are now in President Bush's Cabinet authored the document, Project for the New American Century, to the letter they wrote to Bill Clinton in 1998 demanding that he should invade Iraq and discount the UN. I spelt that out in considerable detail yesterday. What is the position of the Government on the new international doctrine of pre-emptive war sponsored by the people surrounding President Bush? Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the humanitarian programme is within the charge of the United Nations? Is the &euro;5 million, which the Government has come up with, in excess of the &euro;23 million global budget, because the statement from the Department of Foreign Affairs seems to imply that it is not?</P>

      <P>&mdash;but I will repeat my answer. The Government supports a system of collective international security, with the UN Security Council at the centre exercising primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. I am not answerable for pre-emptive strikes by anybody. I stand for and believe in the United Nations and I want to see it fully complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what Deputy Rabbitte said yesterday, but I must remind him that the the Clinton Administration &ndash; which was a good friend to Ireland &ndash; was in place for a large number of UNSC resolutions directed against Saddam Hussein.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the enormity of what is happening in the Gulf region, there are issues at home which need to be addressed. Is the Taoiseach aware that, despite the economic slowdown, there has been no relief in the housing market and that property developers continue to fleece prospective house owners and young couples in particular? Is he aware that last week a property developer gazumped house prices from &euro;198,000 to &euro;214,000 over a three day period? How does the Taoiseach suggest young prospective house owners can ever hope to achieve the goal of home ownership? What steps do he and his Government propose to take to address this <Col N="1134" /> scandal, which has been continually highlighted and condemned? No serious action has been taken to put an end to gazumping?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of Threshold's assertion that, even if current housing output targets are achieved by local authorities in the current year, they will still only just reach a level to reduce overall lists by some 1,400 per annum because of the increasing number of people coming onto the list out of necessity? This means that it will take some 30 years before those currently on lists will be addressed. This condemns many tens of thousands of men, women and children to unsuitable and unsatisfactory living conditions and, in the most severe cases, to living on our streets. Given these facts, what does the Taoiseach say to the countless number of people living in terrible living conditions, those who have to contend with outrageous rent demands and those facing massive mortgage demands which, even with double incomes, they cannot meet? This is all a result of the Government's failed policies on housing since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing supply is the key to holding prices down and helping people to become home-owners, which is the Government's stated policy. A record level of housing was delivered by the previous Government and, hopefully, this year some 55,000 houses will be provided, 12,000 of which are social and affordable housing. I know the Deputy agrees and that he merely forgot to say that was a record in the history of the State, but I am sure he will say so in his reply.</P>
      <P>If we continue to maintain the level of housing supply, including affordable housing, from the changes that have been made in Part V of the Housing Development Bill and if we continue to develop the successful voluntary housing sector, it will be a great help. The voluntary housing agencies started small but a number of them are now providing quality housing to the less well-off and marginalised people, which has been a help. I agree with the further development of the voluntary housing sector to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>We should continue to increase supply. Land is another major issue because it is it rather than house prices which are causing costs to escalate due to the enormous speculation in the area. This is being looked at by the constitutional committee and we are also examining the Kenny report to address aspects of the situation.</P>
      <P>The Government will introduce a private residential tenancy board, which is already working on an interim basis, for the private rented sector. The Private Rented Sector Tenancy Bill will be before the House in this session which will be important for controlling rent and improving and maintaining standards and facilities for people in rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Record numbers of houses are being built in the private sector, including affordable housing. Local authority lists have been maintained at a good level and there are record numbers of units <Col N="1135" /> in the voluntary housing sector. If we can continue to maintain that situation over a number of years, we will make a major impact on housing lists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is not I who forgot, but rather the Taoiseach who has forgotten his Cabinet's facilitation of property developers by reneging on its responsibility to provide a percentage of affordable housing in developments. The Government facilitated this in legislation, passed since the resumption of this year's work in the House. He has also forgotten to respond to my question on gazumping and the disgraceful situation in Tallaght last week, where house prices rose by &euro;15,000 or &euro;16,000 over a three day period, placing beyond reach homes for which many young people, who are now left sitting high and dry, had organised finance.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has also forgotten figures, released by his own Department, which show a 23.5% increase in the number of families on the housing waiting lists between 1999 and 2002, yet disgracefully, there has been a drop of &euro;57 million in the allocation to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the provision of social housing. How does the Taoiseach square all of that with the nonsense with which he responded to my question? He has answered neither my question nor the needs of the people who demand this Government takes action.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 39, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There are a substantial number of questions relating to Northern Ireland and my visit to the US. As the primary focus of my visit related to Northern Ireland matters, it seemed appropriate to take the questions together. In response to requests from Deputies, however, I propose to take the majority of questions relating to the US visit separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the two Governments and the pro-Agreement parties over recent weeks and months aimed at achieving the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement culminated in intensive discussions at Hillsborough on Monday and Tuesday, 3 and 4 March. These were genuinely constructive talks during which all the parties displayed a willingness to move forward to acts of completion to finally <Col N="1140" /> implement the Good Friday Agreement under all headings and in all its aspects. The goal we had set ourselves heading into the talks was one which the people of Northern Ireland fully deserve five years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, a durable, stable and final outcome that brings an end to the instability and difficulties of the past. That is the prize on offer.</P>
    <P>We achieved a substantial amount of progress in the talks on a range of outstanding issues and, as a result, the Governments presented the parties with proposals for the resolution of key areas that are essential if we are to establish the trust and confidence necessary to ensure the full implementation of the Agreement. It is fair to say that we all now have a shared understanding of how that goal can best be achieved. Throughout this process, the consistent approach of the two Governments has been to provide absolute clarity and certainty about what all sides will do to embed the necessary confidence and trust in this process. It is only with such a store of confidence and trust that we will be able to realise the full and irreversible implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Our discussions were protracted and difficult because we are dealing with complex, sensitive issues. To achieve our goal, all sides will have to take difficult steps. I believe all sides genuinely want to achieve finality. Our approach is based on achieving real consensus. The parties understandably want some time and space to consider further what needs to be done and to consult their memberships before making final decisions. Given the significance of what we are trying to achieve, this is a reasonable request and one which we are happy to facilitate. It is important that all the parties fully understand what the two Governments are putting forward and that they make their judgment in the round, based on the totality of those proposals which include human rights and equality, criminal justice, normalisation, policing and the institutions.</P>
    <P>Following the process of consultation and reflection our intention is to meet with the parties again in early April and publish the Governments' joint proposals. The two Governments commend these proposals to the parties. I am continuing to meet the parties. I met representatives of the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party recently and I will meet again on Friday with Mr. David Trimble for further consultations. Contacts are also continuing at official level. I do not believe that it would be fair to the parties, nor would it be helpful to the overall process, to identify specific details of our proposals at this point. What Prime Minister Blair and I endeavoured to do in the course of our discussions with the parties was to close gaps across all the outstanding aspects of the Agreement so that our proposals, when published, would reflect the purpose that we set ourselves last October, acts of completion on all sides.</P>
    <P>Working towards acts of completion is the responsibility of all the pro-Agreement parties <Col N="1141" /> and the two Governments. We know what is required of each of us, including an end to paramilitarism and a new beginning for the institutions based on stability and sustainability. We have tried to achieve an accommodation that is acceptable to all sides. That is the only way we can bring matters to a successful conclusion. I understand that people are anxious to know what is contained in the joint proposals at an early opportunity. However, I ask everyone to be patient and to await publication of the joint proposals before making a judgment on what is being proposed rather than doing so on the basis of erroneous, partial or selective leaks which may concentrate on one or other aspect at the expense of the entire package.</P>
    <P>To facilitate consideration of our proposals, there will be a short delay of four weeks in the Assembly elections. We are conscious of the need to offer the electorate an agreement that is in full working order and that enjoys the prospect of providing peace and political stability for the years ahead. We hope that, on polling day, the people will clearly see what is on offer and will reward the pro-Agreement parties who have delivered for them the real opportunity for a peaceful and stable future. The purpose of the two Governments' efforts in recent months has been to restore the devolved institutions and to achieve a normal society in Northern Ireland. The lack of trust and confidence between the parties has been one of the main causes of the instability of the institutions in the past.</P>
    <P>What we are working for, in conjunction with the parties, is to address that deficit and bring about the conditions for the earliest possible restoration of the institutions. Devolution has been good for Northern Ireland and a large majority of people want to see effective and accountable government restored as soon as possible. If, as a result of our endeavours, we restore the required trust and confidence and place the Agreement on a new and secure platform for the future, there should be no reason for the kind of stop-start operation that the institutions had to endure in the past. I record my appreciation of the Prime Minister's outstanding commitment to the process at this time. I also take this opportunity to thank the House for its support for our efforts to secure agreement on a way forward.</P>
    <P>I met Geraldine Finucane and the Finucane family on 13 February and reiterated the Government's support for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. After 14 years, it is time the Finucane family find out the truth of what happened and that all the issues of concern are examined. I believe that the work of Judge Cory will assist in this process and I look forward to his report later this year.</P>
    <P>Over the St. Patrick's Day period in Washington I took the opportunity to fully brief President Bush, Ambassador Haass and our friends in Congress on the outcome of recent discussions. We also discussed the situation regarding Iraq, which we debated in the House last week. I am <Col N="1142" /> extremely grateful for the continued support of the US Administration, Senate and Congress for our efforts in relation to Northern Ireland. We will receive strong encouragement from President Bush and our US friends to successfully and comprehensively finish the job.</P>

      <P>All Members share the Taoiseach's sentiments in respect of his intention to secure a normal, or as normal as possible, society in Northern Ireland following the implementation in full of the Good Friday Agreement. If, arising from the discussions on 3 and 4 March, the Taoiseach believes all the parties are fully committed to the process, why would it be the intention of a party or parties to facilitate erroneous or partial leaks of the talks at Hillsborough? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that all the parties to the discussions are committed to the process and that no further concessions will be given, beyond what was agreed on 3 and 4 March?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that the parties had reached a shared understanding of what needed to be done in terms of acts of completion. For that reason the elections were postponed for a number of weeks so the parties would be able to sell these explanations to their constituencies. Does he agree that decision time has been reached, there are no further concessions to be given, there will be no further delays, the elections will take place on the new date as intended and we will proceed with that business as soon as possible?</P>

      <P>The date of the election has been settled. I was anxious that it would be settled legislatively so it could not be changed again and people could not come back seeking further extensions. Legislation is going through Westminster. It might not have passed all Stages but it is certainly well advanced. It will set the date. Dissolution will be on 28 April and the election will be held at the end of May. That is provided for in the legislation and there will be no change to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny asked about people being committed to the process. I can only assure him that all the delegations and leadership groups I have been dealing with have assured me that they are committed. Given the importance of this issue we are not just dealing with small numbers of leaders &ndash; the delegations have been quite large, representing a cross-section of elected representatives. A wide section of the SDLP, Ulster Unionist Party, Sinn Féin, the Women's Coalition and others have indicated to me that they are fully committed to the process. They also know that we have been dealing with the issues for some time, and particularly since mid-October. We have dealt with them during the winter and have listened to what everybody has said. We have had much discussion and have tried to be as flexible as possible. It was not a case of both Governments dictating what they thought was best. In the past few weeks we have been finalising that <Col N="1143" /> work but discussions are continuing. We have tried to be helpful and positive to people. We have had very useful meetings with the parties. I am meeting the UUP again on Friday, having met with its representatives previously, including in Washington. I met the SDLP less than a fortnight ago and I met with Sinn Féin representatives on Monday. These meetings were helpful and positive. We recognise that some issues are particularly sensitive. The meeting with Sinn Féin on Monday addressed a number of issues of concern to it.</P>
    <P>It is true that a great deal of progress was made at Hillsborough about which Deputy Kenny asked. There was a shared understanding among the parties of the key issues that are central to moving forward. We recognise that not everything was agreed at Hillsborough and we hope that we can close the gaps in those areas during this period. That is why we are still meeting the parties. We are trying to clarify things and close the gaps even more, so that all the parties can be fully satisfied that when we present our proposals we will have completed satisfactorily the five or six months of discussions. We will continue to have meetings at official level until the end of the month, which is getting close. The parties are using this period to reflect upon the Governments' proposals and they are in continuing contact with the Governments on aspects of the proposals. We are happy to provide clarification where necessary. We certainly do not wish to open up the text that has already been agreed. There is no point in opening up something that upsets a balance in some other area that we have put together delicately over the months.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to go to Hillsborough in early April when we will present our comprehensive proposals. They are known to the parties because we have been upfront about them. The party negotiating teams know the proposals in their entirety and when clarification is sought on any point, I make sure the other parties know also. Therefore, there is an even-handed approach to this and nobody can see any bad faith in it &ndash; not that anyone would feel there is. I want to make absolutely sure that everything is on an even keel.</P>
    <P>The stakes in this are high and have not been higher since the Good Friday Agreement of five years ago. I want to avoid any misunderstandings on any aspect of the agreement and that is why we are being so careful. Each time I meet with a group and clarify matters, I also meet with the other groups to make sure they know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach can take it that he has the support of the House for the work that is going on. In fairness, the British Prime Minister has devoted an inordinate amount of time to the process and has shown great resilience and patience when, obviously, other matters are on his mind also. The Taoiseach said that the stakes have never been higher and that he wants to be absolutely upfront about this so that all the par<Col N="1144" /> ties know exactly what is involved in the negotiations and the presentations to be made early next month. Sinn Féin has said that sanctions could still wreck the talks and the conclusion of the agreement. If all parties are upfront about this, are absolutely aware of what is contained in the proposals and understand that the stakes have never been higher, why has Sinn Féin not been upfront with the Taoiseach and the other parties in view of last week's arms find on the Ormeau Road in Belfast? Six handguns, an assault rifle, timer power units and 2,000 rounds of ammunition were found. Is the Taoiseach happy that all parties are being upfront with the Governments in regard to the conclusion of the talks? Is he happy that this arms find is not one of a series still waiting to be discovered? Can we take it that, in so far as the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister's private discussions with Sinn Féin in particular, and other units that might have paramilitary tendencies, are concerned, they are absolutely clear that an end will be put to this once and for all? Is the Taoiseach happy with that, given that he has said the stakes were never higher and the parties are fully aware of all the details of what is involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny's question is a fair one. I have been dealing both with the political leaderships and wide-ranging delegations and I can only reflect to the House what has been said. Needless to say, I am worried when I read about arms finds such as the most recent one. The only correction I would make to what Deputy Kenny has said is that the 2,000 rounds originally reported, rose to 6,000 rounds yesterday when the case was mentioned in court. To be frank about it, I do worry about those things &ndash; and to be even &ndash; from wherever they come. I do not want to direct it in any one spot, but this particular issue is clearly linked to the Provisional IRA. That is why it is so important that we get to acts of completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that we have all tolerated quite a lot over a long period. I am also conscious that the case Deputy Kenny mentioned is before the courts, although there are many other cases in the courts as well, so I would group them together rather than being selective. Last year we saw pipe bombs which were almost exclusively used by loyalists, although some dissident republican groups may also have used them, but certainly not the Provisional IRA. As we move into the summer period I would like to see progress that ends all these matters. We welcome the useful work that has gone on in loyalism recently and anything we can do to facilitate more dialogue and understanding in that jurisdiction we will do with the loyalist groups as well. We want to hold out the hand of friendship so that we can come to acts of completion and move on into the democratic process. All the aspects that make up this agreement will be published shortly so we can then move on and, hopefully, dissidents will play no <Col N="1145" /> more part. That is the aim and while there are some concerns, hopefully we can achieve that.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Kenny in wishing the Taoiseach well in his endeavours. The Taoiseach said it was thought advisable to separate the Northern Ireland questions and those concerning President Bush. I am not sure that I understand that. Who makes that decision? Yesterday, for example, the questions concerning President Bush were ahead of the questions on social partnership, while today they are behind the social partnership questions. Who makes that decision and what is the rationale for doing so?</P>

      <P>On the Northern Ireland situation, can I take it from what the Taoiseach said that the Government's view is that the elections will proceed at the end of May, irrespective of whether the Executive is restored?</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the remarks of the President of Sinn Féin the day before yesterday when he said that the document that we believe is to emerge from the two Governments is still negotiable. Is that the Taoiseach's understanding? What is his response to the remarks from Mr. Adams that sanctions are still a &ldquo;deal-breaker&rdquo; as far as Sinn Féin is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's first question, I asked the same question this morning, lest it had anything to do with me, but was assured that it had nothing to do with me. I know the Deputy is not saying it had. I assumed that one set of questions would follow the other. It certainly was not me who decided that. I want to make that absolutely clear.</P>
      <P>On the question of the position on the ongoing negotiations, I do not see that we are in negotiations in terms of changing the documentation. The documents are complex. There are serious decisions to be made by some of the parties. The document is there. We are clarifying and explaining our logic, why we believe that the balance is right and listening to and teasing out some of the issues. It is not a question of us rewriting it. The questions put by Mr. Adams the other day were fair in terms of explaining why we came to this decision and the clarification in that regard. It would be wrong to say it is a negotiating session, but it is an important phase in explaining the logic in the overall sense. It is not closed in the sense that we are saying we are not listening to anything. That would be wrong. I hope to do that with Mr. Trimble and with some of the other parties this weekend and, hopefully, we will try to finish in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the date of the election, I reiterate what I said, I am not returning to this issue. That is finished. I was reluctant to move off <Col N="1146" /> the issue. I did so reluctantly only because it made sense in terms of our running out of space. Some parties looked for a particular amount of time and other parties looked for another period of time. Without spelling out exactly who said what, the cumulative position meant that what was sought was not logical to achieve. It was only on that basis that we moved on. I only agreed to do so on the basis that it would be legislatively done and not by an order, letter or an exchange of letters, but by way of legislation whereby primary legislation would be passed by the Commons with no change made to it. That is now being done. That was the agreement on this. I am not returning to any discussion on that regardless of what happens on the presentation of our paper. In other words, I wish to be absolutely clear on this because the records of these debates are analysed with a fine-tooth comb by many parties. If we get to a successful agreement, then all is well and we will move on. If we do not get to a successful agreement and all is not well, we will still move on into elections. That is my position. I am not going to open that discussion again. I am glad to clarify that matter for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>On the issue of what are considered the sanctions, I do not want to go into all the details, but in reply to the Deputy, I would like to make this point in response to what has been said outside this House. I believe that what we are trying to do in this area is compliant with the Good Friday Agreement and not outside it. I have given and will continue to give the detail of those arguments in a very clearly thought out way to the various parties, but I do not accept that they are outside the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Can I sign my name again to an agreement and say that not to have a procedure to deal with institutions that have managed to collapse four times in five years is a good day's work? I do not think I would do that in any negotiations, not to mind negotiations as important as these. I would like to drop the word &ldquo;sanction&rdquo;. If I act totally out of order in this House, there are rules. I am held to account by Standing Orders and there are the procedures of this House decided by my colleagues, who through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and other mechanisms will decide whether I am an appropriate person to do what I am doing. Those rules have been used in this House many times. In Northern Ireland, the system should be no different. There must be a system and a procedure where we can monitor and where there is accountability and examination and where if there are breaches, they are examined. I would like to move away from a position where they are examined in a way whereby one person can decide it not a good idea and that person can say &ldquo;I am getting out&rdquo; and the system collapses. That is what has happened four times. To stick with that position makes no sense. It would be irresponsible not to address the issue.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, I would like to be able to give all the points of how I put this case forward and argued it, but that would be unhelp<Col N="1147" /> ful, and I hope he will forgive me for not doing that. All I am doing is spelling out that I think there must be a system of accountability whereby if there is a breach or a difficulty, let us put it no stronger than that, there is a system that deals with that and all the cards do not fall down every time that happens. That is all we are trying to do. I hope this is not something that will be misunderstood. I will not use the words of anybody else because I do not want to get into that. I believe that answers all the Deputy's questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that reply, which I hope is helpful in the context of things in terms of where they stand now.</P>
      <P>Will legislation be required to deal with the suggestion that there is likely to be a provision in the document to involve some procedures in relation to the position of what are called &ldquo;on-the-runs&rdquo; or &ldquo;OTRs&rdquo;? Does the Taoiseach consider that legislation will be necessary to give effect to that? Are we to understand that these regulations will apply to people on the run in this jurisdiction who are responsible for serious crimes? I specifically ask him if the terms of whatever agreement emerges are likely to apply to people still wanted in connection with the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to bring completion to these issues. We have to look at all the outstanding issues. In the two areas the Deputy mentioned there are outstanding issues. We must try to come to an understanding on those issues, on the OTRs, on-the-runs, in particular. We will have to deal with them in this jurisdiction and outside it. The Deputy asked specifically about dealing with them in this jurisdiction. We will have to make necessary arrangements. I cannot recall whether that will require legislative arrangements or if it could be dealt with by way of regulations, but it will affect us. It will require proposals. The Garda Jerry McCabe issue is outstanding and we are considering it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the forthcoming elections in the North will bring people there much further forward, given that all the main competing parties are sectarian-based? They draw and seek support from one side or other of the religious divide and therefore much of the campaign will be a contest between groups on different sides. Also, on each side groups will score points off parties on the same side to strengthen their position. Does the Taoiseach agree it is likely that the campaign will be very sterile? Does he agree that a new departure is needed &ndash; a mass party that could straddle the sectarian divide and address the acute problems working people face apart from sectarianism and the troubles? I refer to homelessness, poverty and crises in the health services. Such a departure is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" />During the Taoiseach's discussions with the British Prime Minister at Hillsborough, did he get any insight into Mr. Blair's willingness to continue discussions which have gone on for almost ten years since the ceasefires with organisations which have or had unofficial paramilitary militias linked to them or which have hidden dangerous weapons? Mr. Blair's patience in that regard contrasts with his rush to war in Iraq due to problems which are largely similar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On sectarianism and breaking down barriers, we are trying to help organisations which seek to alleviate the plight of working class people in Belfast and elsewhere in the North and I agree with Deputy Higgins that this is a major part of the problem in the North. Both communities have similar difficulties but they are not close to each other and there is no trust or confidence. Good work is being done by the political parties and other organisations to foster better understanding and co-operation. They are trying to deal with the interface areas and to solve problems of exclusion and unemployment, problems any area would have if it did not enjoy economic regeneration in recent decades.</P>
      <P>Everything we have been doing through our agencies is aimed at assisting all organisations in the North. We are not focused on any one organisation but on all the political parties. I am particularly anxious to give loyalist groups the benefit of our knowledge and expertise, even if those are not perfect. I do not want to mention individuals but many of them are doing excellent work. They do not have many elected representatives but those they have are doing good work and we will work with them.</P>
      <P>Regarding the arms issue, the British Prime Minister set out last October in his acts of completion speech what he understood to be necessary to deal with these issues and to bring trust and confidence back to these communities. I made a similar speech soon afterwards and both speeches agreed more or less in most areas. We have since moved to negotiations on a package which covers those issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins knows my position on this issue &ndash; that I do not want to see arms being used and I want arms put beyond use. The situation in Northern Ireland has been tolerated because by and large arms have been silent there for the past eight and a half years. A period was allowed for progress and while there have been breaches, those have been thankfully few. We want to move to a position where we do not have to deal with this any more.</P>
      <P>I draw no relationship between Northern Ireland and what is happening elsewhere in the world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" />Has the Taoiseach any sense from his discussions with Mr. Trimble ahead of the elections that Mr. Trimble and his party are as strong as is necessary in their support for the full implementation of the Agreement? Are they tempted to play the Orange card coming up to the elections to avoid being outflanked by the DUP? What has the Taoiseach said to ensure the Agreement does not fall asunder due to the expediency of electoral politics?</P>
    <P>In the Taoiseach's discussions with the US President, has he had any sense, implicit or explicit, that America's continued support for the peace process is in any way conditional on Ireland co-operating with the US-led invasion of Iraq? Have the use of Shannon or the provision of overflight facilities been mentioned in connection with American support for the peace process?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for his ongoing support on this issue. I also thank Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny in this regard.</P>
      <P>To take the last question first, there are no connections or insinuations whatsoever but the Americans, and particularly Ambassador Haas, have been enormously helpful. The Ambassador leaves his post in a few months but happily for us he has been very helpful.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Ulster Unionist Party, it is concerned that it has moved considerably since April 1998 and that it has not been rewarded for that movement. On the contrary, it feels it has fallen into traps which have played into the hands of others such as the DUP. Since October the UUP has worked honestly with the two Governments and other parties to achieve what we all want; it is committed to that goal. I met several party representatives ten days ago and I meet the party leader again this week. They are totally committed to finding a comprehensive agreement and to genuine acts of completion which will open up a new way for everyone to work together.</P>
      <P>That is the key issue &ndash; this is not a matter of anyone winning or losing. We have had five years of trying to deal with the issues and I hope the pro-Agreement parties will be rewarded in the elections. Then we will be able to move on constructively. All the parties are trying to achieve this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there are already adequate safeguards and sanctions built into the Good Friday Agreement to help ensure all parties fulfil their obligations? I take that view because he does not seem to agree that the elaborate new structures of sanctions &ndash; which my party and I view as being constructed outside the Agreement &ndash; are contained in his current position and that of Mr. Blair. Does the Taoiseach recognise this is far from helpful and that these new sanctions will be turned into further obstacles to progress? Will the Taoiseach confirm, for instance, whether new legislation will be required to give effect to the new proposed sanctions process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" />In our efforts to resolve the crisis in the peace process and restore the political institutions there is, as some Members have stated, an ongoing concern about the commitment of the Ulster Unionist Party, in particular Mr. Trimble, to the future stability of the institutions. Will the Taoiseach share with the House the contact he has had with Mr. Trimble and the nature of their engagement in this regard? What assurances are there that a new Assembly, which we hope will be in place sooner rather than later, will not be subjected to the same topsy-turvy approach as the last one?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach share the disappointment of the police ombudsman's office in the North in relation to the failure of the Northern Ireland Office to grant her additional money to progress inquiries into certain serious matters which have also been the subject of address to him in the House in the past? What steps does he propose to take to encourage the facilitation of the police ombudsman's office in order that she would have the wherewithal to progress the various areas of inquiry she has highlighted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's remarks on the word &ldquo;sanctions&rdquo;. It should be dropped and removed from the political agenda. Is he aware of the grave lack of confidence and trust among many people in the North, particularly the Northern minority but also the wider public, in relation to Mr. Trimble's commitment to the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement? The Taoiseach stated that he met members of the Finucane family. What commitments did he give them in relation to Pat Finucane's murder and the subsequent investigation into it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the questions in reverse order. Deputy Finian McGrath asked about my meeting with Geraldine Finucane. We are doing all we can with Judge Cory to get the process finished, which we hope will happen later this year. We are still committed to a full judicial inquiry and that will continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>On the questions on Mr. Trimble asked by Deputy Finian McGrath and Deputy Ó Caoláin, as I have stated to Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny, I am committed to trying to work with everybody regardless of what has happened in the past at different times, on different issues and in different circumstances. Our purpose is to try to get everybody to work together. That is not to say there were no difficulties in the past, there were and I have had arguments and debates with many of the political leaders. Going forward, however, we have to work together. I can only tell the House what all the leaders have told me, namely, they are committed to the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin asked what rules will apply, which is a fair question. I am satisfied the mechanism will be in compliance with the Good Friday Agreement and will be applicable to all the political parties. Its underlying aim is to provide stability. There are no automatic sanctions and provided all paramilitary activity ceases, the <Col N="1151" /> application of sanctions should not arise, no more than it would arise in this jurisdiction. All we are trying to do in this respect is ensure a form of monitoring is in place and we do not have the instability we had in the past when the institutions collapsed for possibly important or frivolous reasons.</P>
    <P>We have to arrive at a position of stability where there is a monitoring mechanism and outside events do not bring down the institutions. My genuine message to Deputy Ó Caoláin is that this is all we are trying to achieve. There is no hidden agenda. The mechanism was not designed to push Sinn Féin out of the process, although I fully understand the Deputy's concern in this regard given his experience. It is designed to make sure we get stability in the institutions and is, as far as I am concerned, compliant with the Agreement. It is a workable mechanism in which the Government will be involved. If there was anything else involved, I would not recommend it as strongly as I do.</P>

      <P>I also oppose the proposal for the late sitting because of the number of my colleagues who want to contribute to the debate on the dismantling of the Freedom of Information Act. I make no apologies for returning to the fact that the last coalition of the willing between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrat Party must have made some shameful decisions that they do not want probed under the Freedom of Information Act. They certainly did so on the handling of the public finances and the matter to which Deputy Burton referred &ndash; the secret deal between Deputy Michael Woods and the religious congregations that so exposes the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The Green Party opposes the proposal for the late sitting. It is ironic that as we wish the new Information Commissioner and ombudswoman well, her job specifications are being changed before she even takes up her appointment. The Government must take account of the Opposition's views on this matter and not continue belittling the changes it is making to the legislation. It is poignant to say that it is considering putting nuggets of mass information verifiably beyond use. This must be re-examined.

      <P>The reason for the urgency is that the Bills are expected to be published in 2004. Some 78,000 crimes were detected under Operation Encounter this year. In some cases they report that women examined by a doctor were so drunk that they could not remember being raped. We need the introduction of these Bills as urgently as possible.</P>

As Minister, we discover that he does not propose to publish it until 2004. What has happened to the priority that was being given by the Taoiseach to dealing with the problems of transport in Dublin? Why has it slid two years in his schedule of priorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister last night, we can see that the question is whether we need freedom of information as a protection against the abuse of power. To find out one answer to this, we could read yesterday's newspaper reports of the candid views of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, about the second Nice referendum. Speaking in Poland, the Minister of State said that he had his retaliation ready before the votes were counted in case there was a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. What was this retaliation? If things went wrong, he would blame &ldquo;<i>The Irish Times, The Irish Times, The Irish Times.</i>&rdquo;  He intended to blame the media. The Government has sought to present its dismantling of the Freedom of Information Act as being of interest only to a small group in the higher echelons of the media, but this is a big lie.</P>
      <P>All through history, hubris has been a deadly disease of exaggerated pride and self-regard that takes hold of those who have been in power for too long for their own good. Its hallmark is overweening presumption &ndash; presumption was one of the sins in the old Catechism and is a fatal flaw in anybody who exercises power in a democracy. The current proposals on freedom of information have this hallmark in spades. The power elite that dominates this Government is showing many distinct signs that it has succumbed to this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government regained office in June without any signal to voters of an intention to change the law in this area. The vote count was barely complete when it embarked on the process of dismantling the Freedom of Information Act 1997, without any public notice of an official review or any mandate on those engaged in the review to consult widely. No consultation paper was pub<Col N="1169" /> lished at the conclusion of this review. Not a single case has been presented of positive damage to the efficient, as distinct from the convenient, operation of Government from the working of the 1997 Act over the past five years. We have now heard from the high level review group of civil servants, the Information Commissioner, a variety of journalists from the NUJ, the national newspaper proprietors and organisations representing the voluntary and community sectors. In none of these presentations, nor in any of the speeches from Ministers or the Taoiseach, have we heard one example of a Government decision being perverted or delayed or of an increase in the cost of a Government action or the failure of any Government activity as a consequence of the implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>What we have heard is the loss of the Government's power to dominate the release of information through the use of spin. This is about the people in the &ldquo;west wing&rdquo;&ndash; the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance &ndash; and their enormous fear that an enterprising journalist, community association or individual will write a letter saying that under FOI they want the information about the cost of the stadium in Abbotstown, about the issue of rail safety, about the siting of dumps in their vicinity or information on their records. The Government fears that small silent capacity of an individual journalist, a Member of this House, a community association or an individual citizen to question the 71 or 82 &ldquo;spinmeisters&rdquo; employed by the Government. Instead of the guys in the west wing saying the speech is locked, there is uncertainty about how the spin will go. The spin comes out on day one but three days later we can read the truth under the Freedom of Information Act. For a Government so determined to lock down every piece of information, the Freedom of Information Act represents an inconvenience to the efficient running of its control of spin.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes far beyond the recommendations of and the amendments suggested in the official review by the high-level group of civil servants. When they addressed the joint committee, four out of five of the members of the review group made it very clear that their review was an input into the consideration and review of the operation of the Act. As dedicated public servants, they are competent people to provide such input. However they had no mandate to offer consultation or to undertake consultation. They were simply giving input on the basis of a particular expertise and experience of the Act. That expertise and experience is all on one side of the fence, which they acknowledged at the hearings. Their experience is as senior civil servants who were asked to give an expert view. While they gave that view, they did not consult anybody because those were not the terms of what they were asked to do.</P>
    <P>This Bill introduces far-reaching amendments way beyond what they suggested. When one puts their evidence together with the superb presen<Col N="1170" /> tation to the committee by Mr. Kevin Murphy, the Information Commissioner, one sees that anybody with serious experience at government level, within the Civil Service or with political experience would have to be extremely concerned at the wisdom of expanding the definition of Government that is included in the Bill. Mr. Murphy carefully and appropriately warned that he could foresee costly litigation in future as a result of the widening of the definition.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach came to the House to explicitly insist that the changes in the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill would have no bearing on the search by a citizen for personal information. This assurance was repeated by the Taoiseach this week, by the Minister last night and by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in one of his more verbose and over the top confident comments as the lawyer of brilliance that he is. While I do not want to use the words &ldquo;lying&rdquo; and &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; about the Taoiseach it is one thing to impose difficulties on people like journalists and politicians; it is another totally reprehensible thing to intervene where people are searching for personal information in the most difficult and at times traumatic personal circumstances. This would take away from them some of their hard won rights to search for information.</P>
    <P>The assurances given by the Taoiseach that there is no change in the ability to access personal information have been repeatedly exposed as a sham by organisations representing victims of abuse, adopted people, medical journalists and most importantly by the Information Commissioner, who set out specific areas where proposals in the Bill would hinder such personal searches either by the individuals concerned or their relatives.</P>
    <P>Why should the Government do this? There are about 30,000 people still alive who were incarcerated in institutions by the State. There are some 40,000 people who were adopted through legal adoptions since the enactment of the Adoption Act 1952. There are probably another 10,000 subject to informal adoption and fostering arrangements. Thousands of people have been through the care system. There are people who need access to the medical records of their children who died and whose organs were retained, which was the subject of the Dunne inquiry. There are identifiable groups in the State who number considerably more than 100,000 with the most serious personal reasons for wishing to access their personal information. The Government proposes to limit that right.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the supposedly most brilliant lawyer in the Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, give sham assurances that there are no changes. I know the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon are all people of good will and general human kindness. I wish they could have come and listened to Colm <Col N="1171" /> O'Gorman from One in Four speaking to the joint committee. I wish they could have listened to their colleagues, Deputy Conor Lenihan and the chairman of the committee, Deputy Fleming, jumping to assure One in Four and its representative, Mr. O'Gorman, that the Bill would be amended to take account of the restrictions being put on the search for information.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, threw dust on that in a way that I found insulting in the extreme. He reassured the House that the legislation would stand and there would be no change, simply because he says there will not be change. However we have it on the expert authority of the Information Commissioner, the organisations and representatives of people affected, a leading medical journalist from the <i>Irish Medical Times,</i> Mr. Bowers, who is well renowned as an investigative journalist, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, and the organisation The Wheel, representing hundreds of voluntary organisations, that there is a significant change in the right of people to personal information.</P>
    <P>I do not know it the Minister has had the opportunity to have contact with people who have been searching for information. I have a copy of a file of a person who was incarcerated by the State in a series of institutions. It runs to more than 100 pages. The individual, now in his or her 50s, was beaten, sexually abused and starved. The individual has had to live with this trauma all his or her life. A couple of years ago, the Taoiseach made an apology on behalf of the State to people who were abused in institutions. Some of these people are now looking for information about themselves, the institutions and their policies and the Departments that interacted with the institutions. These files contain the story of a life. One will see how a three year old child was judged by a doctor or by the courts to be disruptive and deserving of a 13-year sentence in a place like Letterfrack.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to change access to records from records that relate to the person to records that contain direct information about the person. I am sorry the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not in the House. If he were on the Opposition benches he would be making the most vocal case to say that the changes in the Bill limit the future right of people to access complete files. Many institutions and religious orders say they did not keep information about people. Many orders have destroyed the information they did keep. People embarking on a search of records will be told no information is available, as it was never kept. All one will have is the word of a person that one was in an institution for seven or ten years. Other than a name on a school roll book there is apparently no other information. People will no longer be able to access records about the dealings of the Department of Education and Science with an institution. Two weeks ago a meeting was held between a number <Col N="1172" /> of organisations that represent former residents of institutions. They decided they might return the apology the State gave them, partly because of what this Bill, among other things, is trying to do. This is a source of shame for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes sweeping revisions in procedure and gives dramatic new powers to Ministers and senior officers to refuse access to papers. One massive legal flaw associated with the new far-reaching definition of the term &ldquo;Government&rdquo; has already been uncovered by the Information Commissioner. In evidence to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, he outlined an appalling vista of continuing litigation directly arising from this clause in the Bill. How hubris prone is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who clearly does not like any bad reflection on his legal brilliance however much he is in error?</P>
    <P>In pursuing these changes, the Government and its apologists have tried to present opposition to the measures as the narrow exclusive concern of the media and those engaged in politics, and of no concern to ordinary people who, we are told, prefer Manchester United versus Arsenal to political debate. How wrong the Government is. An amazing range of public interest bodies, voluntary and community groups have expressed alarm at the consequences of the proposed changes and want the entire Bill to be dropped or delayed until full public consultation has established the proper limit to changes.</P>
    <P>The shadow hanging over this Bill is the advice and conclusion of the late Chief Justice, Liam Hamilton, at the beef tribunal. He said:</P>
    <P>I think that if the questions that were asked in the Dáil were answered in the way they are answered here, there would be no necessity for this inquiry and a lot of time and money would have been saved.</P>
    <P>Like all of those prone to hubris, the Government refuses to learn from history.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Government now proposes to shelter from public view the briefing papers for parliamentary questions and legislation. Accountability to Parliament will be limited by whether a question is reached on the Order Paper, what questions are asked if it is reached and whether the answer sets out to mislead by withholding key information. This is the tactic that led to the beef tribunal. This is a certain recipe for the appalling vista outlined by the late Chief Justice. Information is withheld and suppressed and this will undoubtedly lead to abuse and persistent cover-ups. It is a case of returning to the bad old days and proof positive of how little the leading figures in this Administration have learned from the events of the past decade.</P>
    <P>Everyone is concerned about the appalling war in Iraq. The Government appears to have dragged us along on the coat-tails of the &ldquo;coalition of the willing.&rdquo;  We seem to be one of the 15 willing states that are unable to state so publicly. Military overflights and landings at Shannon can <Col N="1173" /> be revealed through the mechanism of parliamentary questions and through the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. Military flights affect three Departments, namely, Defence, Transport and Foreign Affairs. Military landings and overflights particularly concern our relationship with the United States and Britain. Under the new legislation it will be possible for the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs to certify such information as being outside the Freedom of Information Act. This was confirmed to members of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. This certification, that will not necessarily be published and cannot be appealed to the Information Commissioner, may in turn lead to a change in the current practice where, either through questions in this House or other mechanisms, we can get this information.</P>
    <P>In our debate at the committee, we heard how a routine communication from an ambassador in Germany about reports in the German press on the Church of Scientology were deemed to be outside the Freedom of Information Act by the Department of Foreign Affairs as it reflected on relations with another country. This was done even though they were in the public domain. How much more sensitive will the Department deem the question of military use of Shannon Airport by the US or other countries? This would earn a five-star, most sensitive rating and this would be proper. In this Bill, the Secretary General of the Department will now have the power to put this into the certification process making it exempt from freedom of information requests.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the question of how this information will be dealt with. Members will have no right to see the supplementary papers if we table a parliamentary question. Instead, we will be left with the spin masters who will tell us what they choose to and no more. We will probably have to use the United States freedom of information legislation to find this information. I profoundly disagree with the United States policy on the war but the US is a great democracy, which has had a Freedom of Information Act for 40 years. The Act evolved partly as a result of the country's experience in the Vietnam War. It is a good Freedom of Information Act and our Act was highly influenced by it. Irish legislators and journalists may have to apply under the US Act to find out about American military movements through Shannon Airport and overflights of Ireland. The Minister will reply that the Government will continue to voluntarily provide the information because the Government retains the right to provide information whenever it wishes.</P>
    <P>However, the information will not be provided as of right. As citizens, we will get information in the context of &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo; spin and speeches and not as a right in a free country. Ironically, the amended legislation will inhibit our right to information but we may be able to obtain the information under the US Act or the limited British legislation in this area. The Freedom of Information Act 1997 <Col N="1174" /> has been good for Ireland. It has been part of the positive changes that have opened the door and let in the light. The country has done well not only economically but also culturally and the self-confidence of its people has grown. The Northern Ireland peace process has also played a role in this regard. A new culture of openness and sensitivity and a greater willingness to debate has evolved as we attempt to find a serious way to address the problems that face us.</P>
    <P>The Government parties, having won their second term in office, have decided that this culture is threatening their &ldquo;Masters of the Universe&rdquo; domination of everything in the State and they have decided to come down on it. A reasonable review of the Act would point out that the people should be consulted first to ascertain what went right or wrong with the legislation. For instance, a serious review of the Act would examine the position of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the legislation. Why can our soldiers, correctly, access personal information under the Act while our gardaí are not trusted with similar access to information about themselves? A review of the Act should examine not only the areas where the Act has worked well but those areas where more information would assist individuals shine a light on administrative procedures and establish where the Government and public bodies are getting it right and wrong. How else are we to progress if we do not have informed debate?</P>
    <P>However, the Government parties, unfortunately, have run badly scared of that prospect. They want to tie down the local and European elections in a year's time and then they want to tie down the next general election because they hope to be in Government forever. Muzzling the Act is one of the ways in which they hope to achieve that aim. It is a determination that they will come to regret.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Boyle, Finian McGrath and Cowley. Sinn Féin strongly opposes this disgraceful Bill. This legislation is designed to gut the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and to prepare the ground for another five years of bad government by also making it secretive and unaccountable government. The Bill is being railroaded through the Oireachtas so that the Government can prevent the five-year rule on Cabinet information under the Freedom of Information Act from coming into force on 21 April next. It wants to keep the deliberations of the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration totally secret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I only learned yesterday afternoon that it is proposed to ram Committee Stage of the Bill through the committee over two days next Tuesday and Wednesday. There will not be proper time to prepare our own amendments or to scrutinise <Col N="1175" /> Government amendments. I put on record my strongest objection to this deplorable procedure.</P>
    <P>Public access to information should be a basic right and not a privilege granted by the State. Government information belongs to the public and the Government is a trustee of that information on behalf of the public. State secrecy hides bad decision-making, inefficiency and corruption. The Freedom of Information Act 1997 was a long overdue attempt to address the tradition of secrecy that had survived in the State from the time of British rule. The State had continued to incorporate that British culture of civil service secrecy, thereby protecting the incompetent and the corrupt.</P>
    <P>FOI has been of immeasurable use to victims of institutional abuse, blood infection scandals and parents who were seeking to find the truth regarding the retention of the organs of their deceased children. During the last general election campaign the Minister for Finance denied that the Government was aware of impending cost overruns or was planning to cut back on spending. Using the Freedom of Information Act, journalists were able to get copies of letters showing that, contrary to what the Minister was saying, the Department of Finance had directed other Departments, in February 2002, to cut &euro;13 million&mdash;</P>

      <P>Using the Freedom of Information Act, journalists were able to get copies of letters showing that, contrary to what the Minister said, the Department of Finance had, in February 2002, directed other Departments to cut &euro;13 million from their budgets so that money could be diverted into initiatives of the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform for announcements to be made during the general election campaign. With respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, the Minister for Finance has never struck me as being particularly interested in open and accountable government. Deputies may recall that, in February 1999, the Minister remarked that the Taoiseach was sometimes too forthcoming in making himself available to journalists. This Bill has the fingerprints of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, all over it.</P>

      <P>FOI legislation is an important tool in combating the corruption which constitutes a serious threat to a democratic system. An open system of government and an informed electorate act as preventative measures to public officials who may be inclined to dis<Col N="1176" /> regard the law. Claims that the changes proposed are necessary because the Civil Service is becoming burdened by nuisance FOI requests do not make sense as there are protections contained in the Act, whereby the authorities can refuse such requests on the basis that they are &ldquo;frivolous or vexatious&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The high level group was established on 26 June 2002 to look at the FOI legislation, with particular emphasis on the issue of Cabinet confidentiality. There is something deeply suspicious about the fact that this group was asked to address the FOI issue within weeks of the formation of the new Cabinet. We can only conclude that the Government is motivated in its actions by fear of embarrassment over decisions taken at Cabinet meetings during the term of the last Dáil. The five-year limit for Cabinet records corresponds with the maximum life span of a Government, which means that records relating to a Government currently in power could not become subject to disclosure under the current legislation.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Act for the five year rule was due to commence on 21 April this year and the Government, because of its second term in office, was due to be affected by it. If the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition Government was returned to power in five years' time &ndash; perish the thought &ndash; would we be asked to increase the restriction from ten years to 15 years? Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will clarify that matter. The reasons put forward to justify the introduction of change in the five year rule are not credible. The explanation given by the Taoiseach recently that the five year rule was impractical and dangerous because of sensitive negotiations relating to the peace process was misleading and downright unacceptable. Section 24 of the existing Act relates to the North and specifically prevents disclosure of records where their release could adversely affect matters relating to the peace process.</P>
      <P>In both Sweden and Finland, the laws governing cabinet confidentiality are based on the principle that every citizen is entitled to access all materials, with the exception of those related to foreign relations, and has the right to ask any public authority to be shown any document kept in its files, regardless of whether the document concerns them personally. There is no evidence that this has adversely affected the effective operation of government in those countries. If there are examples of Cabinet decisions which have allegedly been hindered and adversely affected by the Freedom of Information Act, it would be helpful if the Minister would outline them. However, no such evidence has been presented to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most worrying aspects of this Bill is the proposed amendment, in section 12 (1)(<i>a</i>), to section 20 of the Freedom of Information Act, which provides that the Minister shall refuse a request where a Secretary General has issued a certificate stating that the record contains matters <Col N="1177" /> relating to the deliberative process of a Department. Under this amendment, a Minister could be prevented from releasing a record under the Freedom of Information Act if the Secretary General of his or her Department or of another Department declares that the record contains matters relating to the deliberate process of a Department. Why will a Secretary General be able to certify a record of whatever nature relating to the deliberative process of any Department, whereas a Minister may declare a record exempt only if he or she is convinced that the record concerned is of sufficient sensitivity or seriousness to justify doing so? For example, it would allow a Secretary General from the Department of Finance to certify documents from the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The Information Commissioner concludes that this would also apply to the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioner, the Information Commissioner, the Ceann Comhairle and the chief executives of the numerous public bodies covered by the Freedom of Information Act, including county managers. The Information Commissioner also stated that the amendments proposed by the Government &ldquo;could create serious legal and other problems in the future and which have the potential to result in costly litigation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has stated: &ldquo;The secrecy and speed with which the Government is proceeding with steps to dilute and undermine a very important piece of legislation is an alarming and depressing signal about the value the Government places on transparency and accountability.&rdquo;  Last week, Colm O'Gorman of the One in Four group, which represents people who have suffered sexual abuse, expressed his concerns regarding the effect of these amendments when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. He said individuals will, as a result of the proposed changes, only be able to access files which directly contain information about them and not files which are relevant to their case. He went on to say that access to relevant files is essential for those who wish to validate traumatic childhood experiences. I recently had the opportunity to address a meeting organised by the SOCA &ndash; Survivors of Child Abuse &ndash; at which that very point was made and which I wish to reaffirm. The Irish Freedom of Information Act has been used abroad as a model for those societies making a transition towards greater democratic governance. That it is now being dismantled is a true reflection on the direction in which the Government is taking this State.</P>

      <P>In moving the Government's Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] last night, the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;The purpose of the Bill is to allow the Government to carry out its work, no more and no less.&rdquo;<Col N="1178" /> In this one sentence, the Minister encapsulated from where he and the Government are coming. It is indicative of an appalling attitude and a pathetic philosophy. It indicates to me, Members of this House and the public that the Government is concerned about government for the purpose of government alone. It does not see itself as a servant of the people. In challenging that, we must reject everything this Bill purports to stand for. The Government stood for election without seeking a mandate for this legislation. It did not seek to consult the central public servant who has responsibility for the operation of the Freedom of Information Act and it hand-picked and took recommendations from a higher civil servants' group, added to those recommendations and chose to consult no other sector in society. That is where the Government's attitude towards government and citizens' rights lies.</P>
      <P>In the rushed hearings we have had on this Bill to date, the Government's position has been exposed on many fronts. The original position, that this was merely about changing the timeframe for the release of Cabinet information, has been shown to be fraudulent. If it was the case that the five year rule was uncomfortable for the Government &ndash; I will address why it might be &ndash; why do we not have a one line Bill before us which changes that provision in the Freedom of Information Act for one, two, three, four or five years? Why are there the other changes, all of which diminish the right of the citizen to seek information and contribute to the workings of society? Can the Government point to one provision in this amendment Bill that improves the right of an Irish citizen to access information on the workings of Government? It cannot, because none exists. The Government is not in favour of that type of change.</P>
      <P>The Government includes two members of the Progressive Democrats Party. Where stands the junior partner in Government on this issue? How does this legislation sit or stand with the declaration by other members of that party that the party stands by the Republic? What republic is being supported with this legislation? How are the rights of citizens being enhanced, improved and protected? They are not.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a member of lesser standing in terms of his proximity to and duration in the party. The party either has principles or it does not. Its contribution to this Government and the previous Government has been a history of introducing legislation that has done nothing to enhance the rights of citizens. To call itself a liberal party in the tradition of European liberal parties is a disgrace. It has not introduced a single liberal reforming measure and everything it has supported with the Fianna Fáil Party in Government has had the opposite effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can understand that with the Fianna Fáil Party. Its philosophy has always been founded on the mushroom theory. It knows that Irish politics works on the basis that the less information people have, the less trouble they can cause. <Col N="1179" /> However, that is not the society that many of us aspire to achieving. It is another reason that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats should no longer be in Government and no longer have the confidence of the people. Look at specific provisions in the Bill that have come out of nowhere. They have not come from the Information Commissioner or the higher level civil servants group. They originate from a Government policy fermented in the mind of the Minister or a select group that involves the Minister, which does not seem to have wanted to get the opinions of anybody else on freedom of information.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions have already been discussed in detail. During the committee hearings I described the provisions regarding certifying the existence of a deliberative process to be not unlike dribbling with the ball to the corner flag in a soccer match. It is about time wasting and trying to create a further distance between somebody who wants and needs information and making that information available. If the Government considers this an improvement in the workings of government, it is living at a further remove from reality than many of us thought.</P>
    <P>The use of language in the changes proposed in this Bill is almost Orwellian. It seeks to diminish the right of personal information being made available by changing the words &ldquo;relating to&rdquo; to &ldquo;contain&rdquo;. With regard to Cabinet papers, it changes the conditional clause &ldquo;may refuse&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall refuse&rdquo;. It takes the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;, which contains the option of information being made available, to &ldquo;solely&rdquo;, in order to limit the type of information that would be made available. This legislation insults our intelligence. It is produced by a Government that lacks any integrity. It demands to be torn up rather than rushed through the various Stages using the mechanisms of this Parliament. If this Government had any sense of shame and was not interested in simply riding out the next four years until the next election, it would be embarrassed by this legislation, but it is not.</P>
    <P>Why the change from five to ten years? What are the issues the Government does not want people to be reminded of? Is it a case, as the Tánaiste said with regard to previous controversies, that the public forgets? Is it the Hugh O'Flaherty nomination to the European Central Bank, the advice that was given to the Government about slashing the rate of capital gains tax or the advice that was given to the Minister about the type of tax decreases he was introducing and the effect they would have on the wealthy and less wealthy in society? Is it about the introduction of the special savings investment scheme or the residential and institutional redress scheme? These are issues that can be informed through public debate but we are being denied the information. This legislation is being rushed through at the last minute to cover the embarrassment of <Col N="1180" /> a Government that does not want to be accountable to the people.</P>
    <P>One of the main effects of introducing this Bill is that information that has come into the public domain as a result of the existing Act will no longer be available due to the restrictions being put in place under this legislation. This information has helped inform public debate, which is the essence of democracy. We are discussing this while the world is living under the shadow of a vicious and unnecessary war. We are talking about our nation's shameful role in assisting and abetting that war. We are talking about how public debate has been informed by knowing that X amount of money has been paid to allow X number of planes to overfly Ireland and to refuel using Irish facilities. It is clear that the provisions in this Bill, either through the certification of the deliberative process or the fact that international security and defence affairs come under particular scrutiny in the Bill, mean that information will no longer be in the public domain.</P>
    <P>This is the Government's attempt to put into legislative form the type of information giving we see from the Taoiseach every day in this Chamber. We see the Taoiseach's deliberative process, his tortured use of the English language and how he uses words to go on and on without ever saying anything.</P>

      <P>Without access to information and without individuals being able to ask questions and get information to challenge those of us who seek to represent them, we do not have a democracy. We have some type of oligarchy. By even suggesting legislation of this nature the Government belittles all of us and shames the concept of an Irish republic. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and his party, when they meet in a number of weeks, will consider the contributions they have made to Irish democratic life in recent years.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this legislation. It is appropriate that we are having such a serious debate on the right to freedom of information this week. In the past 12 hours alone we have seen the lies and untruths that are told about the slaughter and war in Iraq by sections of our media and by governments. This type of information is an insult to citizens in the EU and throughout the world. Governments are lying to their people and they are being aided and abetted in that by sections of the media. That should be a warning about the right to freedom of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a democracy we must always be on guard to protect this basic civil right. One should always be suspicious of those who wish to curtail it. Any government, public service or Department that prevents its citizens learning information concerning civic society loses the respect of the people. I voice my disapproval of, and utter dis<Col N="1181" /> may at, this Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. People are now wondering what will be next from the Government. Why was there no proper and thorough consultation with the interested parties to ensure that the changes are sensible, practical and open?</P>
    <P>There is nothing to be gained from this Bill except a major step backwards. Is that what we want? Do we want more silence, secrecy and cover ups? This is not what the people want. We should stand up and be counted in this important debate. It is a serious stain on our democracy and on all democratic institutions. It is a step back towards the dark ages. Anybody with a hint of interest in civil liberties must speak out. Censorship and secrecy will never win, as we know from our recent history. Open government is good government and is essential for democracy. We need to see our State institutions and bodies operating in a new spirit of openness and transparency. This is the way of the future and, instead of closing the hatches, we should be developing it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy covering the seven-year period 2001-08. The strategy aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions &ndash; under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research &ndash; to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>My Department also has responsibility for the work of the local drugs task forces, which were established in 1997, in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. Currently, there are 14 local drugs task forces: 12 in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Bray. In total, the Government has allocated over &euro;51 million to implement the proposals contained in the two rounds of plans of the task forces since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the extent of cocaine use, while comprehensive data is not available, provisional <Col N="1182" /> figures would suggest that cocaine seizures have increased substantially, particularly in 2002, and the Garda authorities have expressed concern at the apparent recent increase in cocaine use, especially in the Dublin city area. The increase would appear to coincide with an increase in the availability and use of cocaine in Europe generally, as a result of increased production, particularly in Colombia, and a consequential drop in the street price.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am aware that the Eastern Regional Health Authority has reported that its services are beginning to notice an increase in those presenting with problems related to cocaine use, although it should be noted that the numbers involved are still relatively low.</P>
    <P>Services for cocaine users primarily involve counselling and, in this context, the Deputy should note that additional counsellors and outreach workers have been recruited by the three area health boards of the ERHA in recent years. In addition, the Northern Area Health Board has recently established a treatment clinic, dedicated to cocaine misuse, in the north inner city.</P>
    <P>The national advisory committee on drugs has commissioned a national population survey, which is due to be completed this summer, and this should give us a more reliable picture of drug use nationwide, including cocaine. The committee has also undertaken its own review of the available information on cocaine use and will be giving a presentation on this review next month to the interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair.</P>
    <P>In the context of the national drugs strategy, while I am confident that any extra measures that may need to be taken to tackle cocaine use can be addressed, I can assure the Deputy that I will be keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Is it not a fact, however, that the statistics for Dublin's south inner city area show that one in six clients is now presenting with both heroin and cocaine addiction? One south inner city service has seven pregnant women attending, four of whom are using cocaine. In north city locations, including Ballymun and Darndale, there is increasing evidence of cocaine use among clients of the existing services. There were ten barring orders in community pharmacies in January and February this year involving people who have been very aggressive as a result of their cocaine use. My question concerns resources. The Minister of State has said that he will examine the resources if the services require them, but they are needed now. Community groups are crying out for such services as they are under extreme pressure. Is it not a fact that the community resources budget available for fighting the drugs problem this year is &euro;7 million less than the figure allocated by the Cabinet sub-committee on drugs? The Minister of State has not been provided with the money to fight this problem in the community. Cocaine poses an increasingly serious worry in Dublin and right around the country.</P>

      <P>Some of the figures the Deputy mentioned may well be correct. The general use of cocaine is increasing and in certain parts of Dublin addicts are not all using it as their primary drug. I accept that people who are on other drugs may be using cocaine as well. At the same time, according to Garda statistics, cocaine offences are relatively few, although they are increasing from a very low level. Cocaine is different from heroin in that there is no treatment for it.</P>

      <P>With heroin there is, at least, the methadone substitute which acts as a form of treatment when prescribed. There is no treatment for cocaine addiction, apart from non-residential counselling. Those services are being provided but we can only do so much in making people aware of the dangers and helping them to face up to their own responsibilities. Some people who have used drugs feel cocaine is a clean, harmless drug but it is very dangerous and can cause severe, long-term psychological damage. We are providing services, however, and it is something that is of great concern to us.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State rightly said, one-to-one counselling for cocaine addiction is extremely intensive.

We have set an ambitious target in trying to have the legislation published by the end of 2004. There is no room in that timeframe for any margin of error. We have outlined a programme. We will publish the consultation paper this summer. We hope to conclude the process of consultation by the autumn, to prepare a general scheme of the Bill and submit it to Government for approval for drafting by early next year and to publish the draft Bill by the end of 2004. That is a tight timetable. It is an improvement on the one we outlined previously. We have prioritised this Bill within the Department and we hope to work to that timetable.</P>

The report of the consultation process should be made available to the public and to the Members of this House. It would help the consultation process if we knew what was in the consultation document at this stage.

What would be the value of that? There have been at least two previous examinations of this issue by the Oireachtas. Many of the main topics that will arise are well known. Deputy Burton, the Deputy's party colleague, prepared a report on this issue a few years ago. Many of the issues would be well known. It is a case of grasping them and proceeding to something about them. We hope to publish the consultation document, to engage in the consultation process over the summer and to have it wrapped up by the autumn. If there are any documents the Deputy would like to see, I do not believe there is a difficulty in that regard.</P>
      <P>Some consultants reports are legalistic. I do not know if publishing many of them would add to or confuse the position. We want to publish a reader friendly consultation document which we hope will allow the public to zone in on this issue. We are not hiding any other documents, but we would like the consultation document to be the summary of the various reports we have received and the exercises on this issue carried out in the Department.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the RAPID programme is a focused initiative by the Government to target the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. My Department, supported by Area Development Management Limited, co-ordinates implementation of the programme.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the huge investment of time, local knowledge and commitment by members of local communities and area implementation teams in drawing up the plans in each of the RAPID areas. While it would not be possible for me to quantify the cost of the consultation process, this process was supported by my Department in the amount of &euro;2,280,595 since the establishment of the programme in 2001. This amount includes support to local areas and administration costs associated with the support team in ADM. In addition, a local co-ordinator was appointed to work with each area to prepare and develop the plan. While this cost is carried by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, I understand that the total cost of the 45 co-ordinators is approximately &euro;2.2 million.</P>
      <P>While the scale of the proposals contained in the RAPID plans is large, nevertheless, progress in implementing the plans has been slower than anticipated. While the Government remains fully committed to RAPID, the delivery of the programme may require adjustment. What I am currently looking at, therefore, are options to bring about greater progress under the programme and I am in discussions with my Cabinet colleagues as to how best this might be achieved.  </P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate it is a matter for each Department to advance and report on progress in relation to specific proposals in the plans. I understand that ADM has forwarded a report to each RAPID area outlining the updated position of all proposals from the plans, including short-term proposals or test cases, as referred to by the Deputy. These short-term proposals-test cases were pursued as a possible mechanism to speed up implementation of the programme. Approval was sought on a number of actions across all areas that were considered possible to fund and progress in the short-term. However, the outcome to date of this exercise has not led to significant further progress.</P>

    <P>As regards my Department, proposals from the RAPID plans fall to be considered under the young people's facilities and services fund, the <Col N="1187" /> community development programme and funding for local drugs task forces. In the case of proposals relevant to the young people's facilities and services fund, proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in light of the overall funding position for 2003.</P>

      </i>A number of proposals in RAPID plans relate to the community development programme. I am pleased to inform the House that my Department announced allocations of funding to six new community development projects in RAPID areas yesterday. Projects in Bluebell, Dolphin House, Inchicore, Merchant's Quay-Usher's Quay, Longford town and Tipperary each received a renewable one year contract for funding of &euro;60,000. A number of proposals from RAPID plans are also being pursued through the local drugs task force plans.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State took the time to come to my area to discuss this issue with members of the community. He will be aware from that night that people are frustrated with this process. I know from answers he has given to other Deputies on this issue that he has mentioned a review. Approximately 1,000 hours have been spent on the consultation process in my area, but people do not see any material gain emerging from it in the area. The Minister mentioned the amount of money spent on this process, but nothing of substance has emerged from it in these areas to date.</P>
      <P>In terms of a review of the programme, I accept that the Minister is trying to get value for money, but every Department tends to say that issues are under review. My office is coming down with reviews and consultation documents, as I am sure is the Minister's. People are concerned that this will be yet another review, an excuse to fob them off. They are looking for answers. We were told before the election that this process would be rapid and that it would result in real achievements and movement in areas of high disadvantage, but we have not seen that.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the test cases. Will he give a timescale within which they will be reviewed by his Department and people will see real movement in this regard? When will the larger projects come on stream? People in the Minister of State's area were asking about the Lourdes project &ndash; they were looking for something as simple as a bus, which will be costly to repair. If those people look for a health centre will the Department of Health and Children fund that? </P>
      <P>That situation is mirrored in every other area involved in the RAPID scheme and we are seeing no progress. I do not blame the Minister, who is new to the job, but surely we should not have to go through this process again.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will know from the meeting we attended in Tallaght that I am not happy with this process. We are literally getting paralysis by analysis at this stage in terms of consultation. On one hand there seems to be a public demand for consultation but I often find that people know what needs to be done on many issues and believe we should just go ahead and act. In taking responsibility for RAPID I immediately identified weaknesses in the process. However, many people involved in the voluntary and community pillars and social partnership disagree with me. They like the methodology which was created. I took a different view with CLÁR; I decided we should get on with it and to a certain extent that has paid dividends.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's specific question, I am advised that &euro;451,000 is allocated for short-term actions but that is still not adequate. When I mention reviews I am looking for a mechanism which will make this happen: that has always been the weakness in the scheme. When this was mentioned as a way of implementing CLÁR, which was to be implemented according to the RAPID formula, I decided not to go that way. I am looking for methods to ensure better delivery of the existing plans, not recreating the wheel.</P>
      <P>I can give definite news on one programme within the ambit of my Department, the selection of CDSPs for progression. Of those CDSPs put forward 80% are either in CLÁR or RAPID areas. A conscious decision was taken to give RAPID and CLÁR priority. They comprised only 60% of the total number of groups which were ready to go but they make up 80% of those getting the go-ahead.</P>

      <Quest>when community and voluntary groups which made applications under the scheme for training and support in the community and voluntary sector can expect their applications, placed in the first half of 2002, to be dealt with; his views on whether it is fair to such groups that the last information they received from his Department was a letter on 18 December 2002 pointing out difficulties in dealing with 540 applications; the number of these applications which can hope to benefit from the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the strong response to the advertisement for this scheme, with 540 applications received, it has been decided that in order to deal expeditiously with the assessment of this large number of applications, and in the interests of achieving a demonstrably independent assessment process, consultants should be recruited to make a final assessment of all applications received and to make recommendations to my Department at the earliest date possible. My Department issued a request for tender for <Col N="1189" /> recruitment of a suitable consultant for completion of this task on 6 February 2003 and the recruitment of such a consultant is expected in the coming weeks. One of the considerations to be taken into account in appointing the consultant will be the time frame involved to assess the applications.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as the consultant will make an independent assessment of the applications, the number of applicants that will benefit from the scheme cannot be predicted at this time. All applicants will be advised of the outcome of their application as soon as possible following the conclusion of the assessment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed by this answer. These groups were asked to make their applications by 25 June last. They received letters on 18 September advising them that 540 groups had applied and a consultant would be appointed to deal with the applications. Is the Minister of State saying a consultant has not been appointed yet? When appointed he or she will have to go through all those applications. Does the Minister of State realise these are community and voluntary groups which understood before the last election that this was a mechanism which would get around the decrease in CE schemes? Those groups are now being hung out to dry and the Minister of State says he has no idea how many of them will benefit. Surely a budget has been allocated and there is some information as to whether 200 or 400 of the applicants can hope to benefit.</P>
      <P>These people need some guidance and understanding. They belong to community and voluntary groups which were led to believe this was one way they could survive but now many of them are on the brink. I was at a meeting on Monday night when this letter was handed to me in order that I might find out what is happening. That is why I put this down as a question. We need answers now and appointing a consultant to extend the time is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Those comments are not fair. The Deputy knows well this scheme is linked to other schemes arising from the White Paper such as the scheme of support for federations, networks and voluntary bodies. That was being processed first last year but ran into problems and we received legal advice that what we were doing could give rise to legal challenge. We had to advertise that first scheme again and we sought a consultant in order to have a demonstrably independent system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A budget of &euro;600,000 is ring-fenced for the scheme this year. Individual applications may be made for a minimum of &euro;6,000 and as much as &euro;127,000 but we expect most applications to be in the lower end of that range. We hope to make good progress on this and to make allocations by early autumn or so. There was a delay but it was <Col N="1190" /> caused by legal problems which arose with the sister scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the scheme must be covered legally and that the Minister of State wants openness and transparency but the time factor is significant. We were promised that consultants would be appointed to deal with this and I did not disagree that that would be the right way to operate; I had no hang-up with that. However, it is now March and consultants have still not been appointed. They will have to study the brief when appointed before getting around to the applications. It will be autumn before allocations can be made, as the Minister of State said, but in reality the money will not be spent. This is a way to save money and that is the bottom line. This procrastination, by whatever means, is part of the difficulty in which voluntary and community groups find themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered this question. We were advised that the sister scheme ran into legal trouble and it has been re-advertised. We have not been dragging our feet. Legal difficulties arose and that is why we and the community and voluntary sector want a scheme they see as being independent. The &euro;600,000 has been ring-fenced and we hope to make the allocations.</P>

      <P>No such cards have been issued by my Department to political activists or political advisers and there are no plans to do so. For the sake of completeness, my private secretary was issued with a departmental credit card in July 2002. The total paid in respect of transactions on this card in 2002 was &euro;1,172.46. The private secretary to the Minister of State was issued with a departmental credit card roughly three weeks ago. As no bills have yet been <Col N="1191" /> received for this card nothing has been paid to date.</P>
      <P>The question of a membership fee does not arise. No tax has been paid on either card. I am informed that the practice is that the tax, which amounts to &euro;40 per annum, is paid in April of each year. The use of credit cards is only one of a number of payment methods used by the Department which include payment by cheque and electronic transfer. All expenditure paid for in this way is processed in the normal way and accounted for under the appropriate heads.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>Conscious of the concerns expressed in this House and elsewhere that the legislation be brought forward as soon as possible, I have instructed my Department to prioritise preparation of the draft Bill, with a view to publication during 2004. Under the revised target for the next two years, I hope to proceed as follows. As my Department has concluded its consideration of the consultants' charity law review, the next step will be to identify the key issues in relation to an appropriate regulatory framework. This is consistent with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to enact a reform of the law which would ensure accountability and protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.</P>
      <P>The intention is then to include the key issues in a reader friendly consultation paper. As the reference document for the public consultation process, it will be publicly available and will also be posted on my Department's website. Our aim is to have the consultation paper ready by the summer and the consultation process concluded by late autumn. Preparation of the general scheme of the Bill would follow with a view to its submission to Government for legislative drafting by early 2004 and publication of the Bill later in the year. The timescale is an ambitious one, all the more so since the legislation will be of considerable complexity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is more or less the same as the one we considered earlier. I <Col N="1192" /> previously raised with the Minister the fact that the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests do not have a list of charitable organisations. The only such list available is the list of organisations which have successfully applied to the Revenue Commissioners to be considered for tax relief. Would it not be prudent for the Department to begin drawing up an informal register of the various charities prior to publication and enactment of the legislation? I have no idea of the true figure for the number of charities operating here &ndash; I have heard estimates of as many as 20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years, a problem has been that no single Department has overall responsibility for charities. A number of Departments and agencies have partial responsibility for various aspects of supervision, for example, in terms of accounting standards. These include the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners, the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, the Attorney General and the Garda Síochána. The problem the legislation will set out to address is how to draw these various bodies together under one umbrella. Considerable work is ongoing in the Department, initially focused on the consultation document and later on the drafting of the Bill. Gathering the information to which the Deputy refers will be one part of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the ongoing war in Iraq, the issue of charity has become very important. Charitable organisations will try to raise as much funding as possible and I hope the Irish people, as well as the Government, will support their efforts. People involved in the charitable sector have told me they can do things here that cannot be done anywhere else and that there are opportunities to exploit the system. It is important, therefore, that the relevant legislation is introduced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In Northern Ireland subscribing members of the Presbyterian Church, to which I belong, can receive tax breaks as churches there have charitable status. This does not appear to be the case here. Given the ongoing difficulties facing the churches, such benefits are important and should be considered when the legislation is being drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation on charities currently in place is decades old and various attempts have been made to address this area over the years. For example, the Costello report was published about 12 years ago and Deputy Burton, when she was Minister of State, commissioned a report six or seven years ago. Neither of the reports resulted in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole approach to charity and fundraising has changed significantly in recent decades. Although some groups continue to raise funds using collection buckets, frequently this is no <Col N="1193" /> longer the case and large corporate events have become widespread. For this reason, the law needs to be modernised.</P>
    <P>Various agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners and the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, have responsibility for aspects of the charity sector. The reason we are discussing this issue and the Government committed itself to introduce new legislation on it in the programme for Government is that it is needed. This has been recognised for many years.</P>
    <P>As some of the other points Deputy O'Shea made may well be covered in the consultants report, we will provide him with a copy to assist him in his work in preparing for developments later in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Costello report was published 25 years ago. This shows the sense of urgency with regard to the need to address our failure to introduce legislation in this area. I understand four or five Departments have been given responsibility for producing a charities Bill. Like most Members of the House, I am anxious that the process be speeded up.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider other avenues for expediting legislation to address the ongoing concern about the lack of charities legislation on the Statute Book? I have two suggestions. The comprehensive report carried out on this issue by the Law Society, which I have raised in the House on other occasions, could form the basis of a Bill. Alternatively, the Government or a Department could request the Law Reform Commission to produce a report that would form the basis of a Bill to be presented to the House in the short-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that responsibility for the legislation has been transferred from one area to another &ndash; in the past two years it has been transferred between three Departments. The White Paper on supporting voluntary activity suggested that responsibility be transferred from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the then Department of Social Welfare. The recent reorganisation of Departments has resulted in responsibility being transferred from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I am not sure of where responsibility for this issue lay previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Society produced a highly interesting report which influenced thinking in the Department on the issue and the Law Reform Commission will also consider the matter. However, I am not sure when we will receive its report. As well as receiving the Law Society report, the Department commissioned consultants to produce a report. Together with the Costello and Burton reports, these reports are influencing our thinking on the consultation document. We need to press ahead and ascertain the views of the pub<Col N="1194" /> lic later in the year, after which we will try to produce legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the constructive attitude displayed in the Minister of State's comments. Does the Department have access to the list of charitable organisations held by the Revenue Commissioners? My basic question is whether there are obstacles to obtaining this information in terms of revenue or data protection legislation. Part of the consultation process will be with the community and voluntary sector and implementation will be through the implementation and advisory group. When the Department is dealing with the community and voluntary sector a great deal of information will come in then but it would be a worthwhile exercise if the Minister placed advertisements in the papers and asked groups which consider themselves to be charities to make themselves known to the Department. That could have a useful input into the consultation process also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The strategy aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions &ndash; under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research &ndash; to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>Since the strategy was launched in May 2001, considerable progress has been made by Departments and agencies in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. The interdepartmental group on drugs, IDG, which I chair, meets regularly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set for them and any obstacles to the implementation of any of the actions are brought to light at these meetings, which take place monthly or six weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six monthly progress reports on the strategy are provided to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the most recent of which was presented <Col N="1196" /> in September last. A further progress report is currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>In terms of progress, I would like to highlight a few areas: considerable headway has been made as regards increasing the number of methadone treatment places. The number of places at the end of December 2002, the latest date for which confirmed figures are available, was 6,449, which is just on target in accordance with what was laid down in the strategy; in relation to the regional drugs task forces, nominations have been sought from the various sectors, including statutory, community and voluntary. In addition, the national drugs strategy team has prepared guidelines on their operation in consultation with the relevant sectors and agencies. It is hoped all the task forces will have their inaugural meetings shortly after Easter; guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drugs policy have been developed and issued to all primary and post-primary schools; the Department of Education and Science, which is now represented on all local drugs task forces, is recruiting extra support staff to enable the delivery of substance misuse prevention programmes in all schools in the next three years. Schools in the local drugs task force, LDTF, areas will be prioritised in this context; the Department of Health and Children has established a cross-sectoral committee to develop an on-going national awareness campaign. This campaign, which is due to be launched in late April-early May, will target a number of groups including young people; and, in addition, the Department chairs a group tasked with the development of a protocol for the treatment of under-18s. I understand that good progress is being made in this area.</P>
    <P>Under the research pillar of the strategy, the Deputies will be aware that the National Advisory Committee on Drugs is currently overseeing a three year research programme on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug use in Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to the research actions in the strategy, it should be noted that: the homeless population research study has been commissioned and a draft report is expected in autumn; it is planned to commence work on the Traveller population research shortly; a longitudinal study on treatment outcomes commenced in November; and a review of the harm reduction mechanisms for injecting drug users in an Irish context is under way.</P>
    <P>The NACD has also commissioned a number of other studies, including an all-Ireland population survey on drug use, the results of which are due this summer, as well as an estimate of the number of opiate users in Ireland, which is due next month.</P>
    <P>My Department also has responsibility for the work of the LDTFs, which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. Currently, there are 14 LDTFs &ndash; 12 in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Bray.</P>
    <P>In total, the Government has allocated more than &euro;51 million to implement the projects con<Col N="1197" /> tained in the two rounds of plans of the task forces since 1997. The Deputies should also note that a further &euro;11.5 million has been allocated to projects under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, more than &euro;68 million has been allocated to support approximately 350 facility and services projects in LDTF areas under the young people's facilities and services fund. The main aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>The first annual report on the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, which will cover the period 2001-2002, is currently being drafted and it is hoped to publish the report by end May this year. The annual report will examine the nature and extent of the drug problem in Ireland and the progress being made in achieving the objectives set out in the strategy.</P>
    <P>Under the strategy, each Department and agency must prepare and publish a critical implementation path, CIP, for each of the actions relevant to their remit. My Department is co-ordinating the publication of a composite CIP for all the various actions. While most of the Departments and agencies involved have drawn up paths for their actions, a small number have taken longer than anticipated to do so. This is due to a number of factors, including the need to consult with relevant staff and other interested parties and the need to commit the resources necessary to implement the actions. This process is now almost complete and it is also hoped to publish the composite CIP within the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody else I welcome and support the national drugs strategy and its 100 action points but the core issue is that the money is being allocated from the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, which consists of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister opposite, Deputy Noel Ahern, the Ministers for Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government, Education and Science and so on. The Minister of State needed &euro;23 million but he is already &euro;7 million short as we start the year. Where will he make cuts in the strategy? The local drugs task forces have committed expenditure of &euro;16 million &ndash; equal to the total budget for the drugs strategy for this year. A document from the Minister of State's Department stated that if the cuts apply <i>pro rata</i> to the local drugs task forces, 45% of all projects will be affected by cutbacks. The Minister of State recently met Citywide and other community groups and was told that some workers on these community schemes were on short time.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State committed to spending that money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Cabinet sub-committee approval was given to round two of the local drugs task force plan last year. If all of those plans had started on 1 January we would have needed all of the money but many of them still have not started. It is estimated that just under 60% of the projects have commenced and that approximately 90% will be up and running by mid-summer. The local drugs task forces that got approval for their plans will not start the following day, there are problems with sponsoring agencies and staff to be overcome. The vast majority of projects, however, will be running by the middle of the year and that will take off some of the pressure.</P>
      <P>We have transferred some money from the capital side to the current side and, as the year goes on, I hope the Minister will look favourably at the drugs side if any other savings arise within the Department. We are not planning any cuts and hope we will be able to fund all the plans that were approved last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the regional task forces? Is the national drugs strategy improving the position? I accept that there are 100 different proposals to be implemented but what is the overall outlook? The national advisory committee on drugs is carrying out a three year research project. Has there been any preliminary feedback yet? If not, when does the Minister of State expect the final results of the research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are currently gathering information about the regional drugs task forces from the statutory and community sectors and it is hoped they will have their first meeting by Easter or shortly afterwards. They will then move forward, although some of them have said that the major problems is alcohol, not other drugs.</P>
      <P>The strategy has been a success from the point of view of what we set out to do which was to tackle the problem. Good progress has been made in the aims laid down for all the Departments and agencies but it is hard to know if we are solving the problem. I will not come in some day and announce the drug problem is solved, we all know that. It is difficult for drugs task forces to quantify the effects of any action they take or to say that there would be more drug users without their strategy. A great deal of good is being done in diverting young people into alternative and useful lifestyles such as sport or arts. The gardaí have been successful in confiscating drugs but we cannot give every young person a guardian angel. We can teach people about the dangers and pitfalls and make them accept responsibility for their own actions. It is hard, however, to report how many people might have fallen into drugs without such a strategy. We regard the strategy as useful and it is making good progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Indicators for the success of the national drugs strategy are needed. There could be cross-referencing of the work of the Department and the national drugs task force with information from other Departments and State agencies. Do the health boards have statistics for the numbers of drug related injuries, illnesses or deaths in their areas? Do the gardaí and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform collect figures for the amounts of drugs seized, their types and the convictions handed down to those trafficking in and using particular substances? </P>
      <P>The difficulty many of us have with the national drugs strategy is that success is only measured in the amount of money put into the project. The number of young people involved in projects at a local level is used as a diversionary tactic. The effect of the strategy across the State should be measured and the Minister of State should give some thought to indicators for measuring such success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not judging success by the money we put in. Many of the indicators mentioned by the Deputy form part of the strategies. Figures for drug seizures and the number of gardaí in drugs task force areas are collected regularly. Targets were set down and they are being met.</P>
      <P>I could tell the Deputy about all the good work being done but he asked if turning it around might solve the problem. It is difficult to quantify but much good is being done and many of the targets are being met. The number of Garda seizures and convictions is increasing. More of the problem is being soaked up but for every seizure, at least the same again gets through. It comes down to the individual and the State can only try to make him aware through every format that he must accept responsibility for his actions and give him the self-confidence and belief to be able to say no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>The involvement of communities is the key to reducing supply. That is where we fell down in the past when communities and their representatives tried to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was uproar a few years ago over drugs being sold just off O'Connell Street but crack cocaine is now being sold on a street synonymous with Dublin. What message does that send to communities that have protested and marched against drugs through the years? That is the wrong message and it will disengage people from the process rather than encourage them towards it. Does the Minister of State agree that the way forward is to encourage people to become involved? In my area, seizures of cocaine have increased by 1,000% over the past two years and that is just a symptom of what is out there. I agree with the comments of the Minister of State. All of us have anecdotal evidence of what is happening in our areas. The position on the ground is that the drugs are becoming cheaper and more <Col N="1200" /> readily available. A new generation is getting involved in drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the question I already put to the Minister of State. What feedback is he getting from community groups on the cutbacks they are experiencing on the ground? Have they not expressed great concern to him that some of those working on local drugs task forces in the community have given notice that they will have to quit their jobs shortly as the money to keep them in place is not available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the reference by the Minister of State to the serious situation with regard to drink in all areas, is he not worried that, with the cutback in Garda overtime, not only will the Garda no longer be able to control the drink issue but there will also be difficulties with drugs? There is serious anxiety among gardaí in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies spoke of communities. I agree the official response probably did not include communities initially but that has been corrected from 1996-97 onwards, when the local drugs task forces were established. Since then, it has been official policy to work with local task forces, on which communities are represented. From my involvement as a member of a local drugs task force until last summer, I am aware that a great deal of local expertise has been developed. The involvement of communities is crucial &ndash; that is the road to success. Previously, many individuals and families suffered in silence, with nobody around to help them except, perhaps, during the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. An excellent local voluntary resource has been built up. I see that as the main success of the policy of successive Governments in relation to the drugs problem in recent years.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy O'Dowd's question, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Local communities are telling me they are hearing from people such as the Deputy and others that there will be a shortage of funds.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we can use the information to which the Deputy refers to good advantage in the next debate on the matter. I have already explained the situation to him. We expect to be in a position to fully meet all the demands on my Department as per the plans of the drugs task forces this year. I agree it will be tight, but that is the situation in which we find ourselves. Yes, there is concern, but I ask Deputies not to fuel that situation or add to it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the commitment in the programme for Government, officials of my Department have held discussions with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism on how best to carry out the survey of the availability of recreational facilities in disadvantaged areas. In this context, the Deputy should note that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism has commenced work on drawing up a long-term strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities throughout the country. As part of this process, a national audit of local sports facilities will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inter-agency steering group will be established towards the middle of this year to oversee the national audit of facilities. This group will be chaired by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and will include representatives from my Department as well as the Departments of Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government, the Irish Sports Council and some local authorities. I understand from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism that carrying out <Col N="1203" /> an effective and comprehensive national audit of local facilities is a major and complex undertaking which is likely to take a substantial amount of time and resources to complete.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for that reply. We are aware of the local sports partnership programme which is being put in place by the Irish Sports Council and obviously we welcome it, but is there not a strong case for the interagency group, about which the Minister of State spoke, to give priority to disadvantaged areas in carrying out this audit? As he rightly points out, the overall exercise is complex and extensive, but surely his Department should focus on measuring the facilities available in disadvantaged areas as a basis for planning the making up of deficits so that young people in these areas are given a chance to develop and make up for what is lost because of the various deficits around them.</P>

      <P>It is already Government policy to target disadvantaged areas. The young people's facilities and services fund was formed a couple of years ago. That fund particularly targets disadvantaged areas and provides facilities and capital projects.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that disadvantaged areas have been lacking in facilities, mainly because there was not an ability to raise the local contribution. That has been greatly helped by the young people's facilities and services fund. If there were a proper national audit, however, it would still show that disadvantaged areas do not get their fair share of such facilities.</P>
      <P>The priority is to undertake that national audit and then to have a long-term strategy which would involve analysing, getting into the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism national capital programme and perhaps laying down specific criteria which commit much of that to disadvantaged areas. That is what I would like to see.</P>
      <P>Much has been done under the young people's facilities and services fund, but there is a need to get the indicators and proof that those areas need more. Returning to the previous questions, it is all well and good asking people to be good citizens but one needs to be able to divert young people into other useful projects in such areas as sport and the arts.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to understand why there would be such an administrative difficulty in finding out the recreational facilities which exist in any part of the country. If the Minister of State gave me two weeks, I would be able to list all the recreational facilities in Cork city. There is such a dearth of recreational facilities that it should not be a major job of work. Local authorities are required to do far more complicated tasks, for instance, in levying a waste charge on every household, and databases can be compiled quite easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State's answer was not satisfac<Col N="1204" /> tory. If there is a logjam at local authority level or even at VEC level, the information out there must be compiled quite easily. That is a matter of political will and does not have to do with any administrative logjam. I would like to see the Minister of State tackle this need for information with a little more enthusiasm.</P>

      <P>My Department will be part of this group but we are not the lead Department. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is the lead agency.</P>
      <P>While individual local authorities or Deputies could do it, in trying to conduct a national audit it is necessary that there be agreement on such parameters as shape and size. There is a commitment in the programme for Government that this will be done. It has not got off the ground. To date, the work is at the consultation stage, but it will happen in the coming months. When they get going perhaps the Deputy will be proved right, that it is not as daunting a task as the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism thinks. There needs to be certain parameters and criteria laid down and that will be part of the work, but we will be part of the group and we will try to push it.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Cowley.</P>
      <P>Open government is good government and it is essential for democracy. We need to see our State institutions and bodies operating in a new spirit of openness and transparency. This is the way of the future and instead of battening down the hatches, we should be developing it further.</P>
      <P>It is not just about the media and the journalists and access to information. I understand how politicians and civil servants get frustrated by the media's off-the-wall questions, which we all must suffer now and again, but we must look at the bigger picture. Freedom of information is in the public interest and in the taxpayers' interest and, above all, it contributes to the rights of citizens and hence my concerns about this Bill.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Ms Emily O'Reilly on her nomination as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. I hope she will be a thorn in the side of officialdom. She is a strong supporter of freedom of information, and I wish her and her family well.</P>
      <P>I worked in the public service for over 20 years. I have always tried to treat the public with respect and dignity. After all, as a public servant I was there to serve the public. As legislators, we can multiply the responsibility by about 500. The public has a right to know and freedom of information helps the wider society. Of course one must be sensitive on certain issues, but we can deal with these through dialogue, debate and proper amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw an example of the public's right to know when Mr. O'Leary appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport yesterday. It is proper and fair that he appeared and answered questions, however, I disagreed with the manner <Col N="1207" /> in which he treated it as a circus and I was a little disappointed with the amount of coverage he got because of his behaviour. It is worthwhile examining people like him, who are politically on the right of Margaret Thatcher, and their attitude to trade unions in general.</P>
    <P>On the question of health boards and disabilities, this Bill, if enacted, can damage the area of questioning the right to services. Even at this stage, I would urge the Government to listen to the people and leave the right to freedom of information. It is essential for openness and transparency and, above all, it is essential for good practice in our society. It is also the sensible way forward for those who believe in democratic values and all who demand justice and fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to speak on this Bill. I am amazed at the speed at which this Bill is going through, considering that we, in west and north-west Mayo, are living in the most economically deprived area and badly need legislation to provide for a tax incentive scheme. Legislation can be brought through quickly when there is a will to do so. Where there is a will, there is a way.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees there was abuse of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, but there is no point in throwing out the baby with the bath water. What is happening is no accident. It is a deliberate attempt to withhold information from the people. The Taoiseach himself said that he wanted open government when the Flood tribunal was established, but this will be a backward step.</P>
      <P>People talk about the cost of the Freedom of Information Act, but let us make a comparison with the situation before the Act was introduced. How much would we have saved in the costs of tribunals &ndash; the Moriarty tribunal, the beef tribunal, the hepatitis C blood scandals &ndash; if the Act had been brought in earlier? Information relating to these would have become available under the Freedom of Information Act, had it existed. We have paid a heavy price for not having freedom of information in the past and now we are about to throw out the baby with the bath water. It should be remembered that in 1997 the Act was brought in because of the beef tribunal. The people had totally lost confidence in the body politic and this was an attempt to put some type of balm on the wounds that existed and to allow for transparency. We were promised openness and we were told these scandals would never occur again. Now, however, we are to go back on all of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we trust the Government when it is obvious that this is an attempt to deprive the public of information, an attempt that will succeed? People will remember this. The day this Bill is passed will be known as &ldquo;spin doctor day&rdquo;&ndash; if the Bill is passed at all, which I hope it is not. The Bill aims to provide a safe haven for Government spin doctors because they are such an important <Col N="1208" /> part of the body politic and of the Government. At the same time, we have a total lack of real doctors. We should sack all the spin doctors and get some real doctors for a change because we need them badly in our health service.</P>
    <P>We will be told how good all this is for us and how it is in our interest not to know what is happening. After all, we are only citizens and these are only decisions that affect us in our everyday lives. They are things we should not know about anyway. Maybe we should not know either about the Government's pet projects, such as more private hospitals, which will drain even more money from our already deprived health services, or making multi-millionaires out of millionaires. After all, it is our money. My prescription is to sack all the spin doctors, because we do not need them, and have truth and openness. This is our protection against the abuse of power by Government. I challenge all those who are promoting this Bill to think about what it is doing and to spell out exactly how much the Freedom of Information Act cost to implement. They talk about the costs, but what about the amount of money that was saved? I would like a comparison. In fact, it has saved us the &euro;700 million we would have been paying for the Bertie bowl.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as the NUJ have come out against this Bill and the Information Commissioner, whose authority will be undermined, has spoken out very strongly, saying it is not a good thing. The new exemptions will drive a coach and four through the effectiveness of the Act. Mr. Murphy maintains &ndash; and I agree &ndash; that there are provisions in the Freedom of Information Act to protect the interests of Government, but what is proposed will automatically suppress all of that. I wonder what will be next &ndash; perhaps parliamentary questions? We should consider all the money wasted in the past that the Freedom of Information Act could have saved for us. The Tánaiste, I am sorry to say, is complicit in all this by being a member of the Government, although it is a contradiction of her stated aim of being a public watchdog. It was she who asked questions about the Bertie bowl, but now she is falling into the trap.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act has worked very well for the public. It is true that it has warts, but the cure for warts is not to kill the person who has them. We do not kill the person or neuter him or her, but get rid of the warts. If there are warts, let us get rid of them. The public demands that this facility be retained. There is so much cynicism around and each of us must deal with that. Working in the community and going into politics, we are all tarred with the same brush, but it is unfair. The Freedom of Information Act allows for openness and transparency to restore the confidence of the public. The amendment of the Act is a retrograde step and I oppose it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that I find myself speaking on this Bill. <Col N="1209" /> As a fairly recent law, the Freedom of Information Act 1997 has all the hallmarks of legislation which was drafted and considered in haste and which now needs to be remedied. There are laws on the Statute Book dating from the 1800s &ndash; those in the area of mental health are in urgent need of updating &ndash; so it is unfortunate that precious Dáil time has to be given over to amending a recent law such as the 1997 Act.</P>

      <P>It was sprung on an unsuspecting Parliament and an unsuspecting public. Over the past two weeks, I partook of the information sessions at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which were appreciated by the Oireachtas Members and very necessary to glean information on the amendments. Certainly, the impression I got &ndash; as did other contributors to the committee's deliberations &ndash; was that the high-level review group saw itself as only one ingredient in the consultation process. There is no doubt that in a republic, where government is for the people and by the people, the public should have been consulted. Exclusion on this feeds the cynicism of the media and, more importantly, the cynicism of the public towards politics. The Government's handling of this issue has done nothing to advance the standing of politics in the public's mind and that is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>All organisations have the right to decide how to organise their business in private and this includes the Government. On behalf of its citizens, it is incumbent upon the Government to explore the many alternatives to and angles of an idea or policy, no matter how fanciful the notions, and have the scope to have these debated frankly and freely with officials. Confidentiality permits this to take place in an uninhibited manner. I do not think that the provisions proposed in the amendment are designed to protect what Deputy Bruton referred to as &ldquo;whimpering Ministers&rdquo;. Politicians are a fairly brazen bunch and do not need protection. In any event, they must go before the people at election time. Rather, the intention is to offer the means to be free and forthcoming, in particular to civil servants who are not public figures. It is not in the interests of our society if the workings of Government are undermined.</P>

      <P>It is not in the interests of our society if the workings of Government are undermined. Advice needs to be clearly detailed and transparent and not subject to transmutation. The way to guarantee this is to have it written down offering the opportunity for prior reflective deliberation. Written advice is clearly understood by all participants in the deliberative process. I accept the bona fides of the Minister for Finance that if the decision making process is not protected by the measures set out in the Bill, the workings of the Government have the potential to be seriously undermined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My biggest difficulty is with section 4, which amends section 6. This relates to right of access to personal records. The most contentious amendment involves substituting the word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; in section 6(5)(<i>b</i>). Despite the assurances of Ministers that access to personal information will not be curtailed I do not believe this to be the case. The amendment as framed would limit access to personal records because these are now defined in a much narrower way. The case for this amendment to be abandoned was made to the committee by, among others, One in Four. If this amendment is allowed to be incorporated into the Act, it will have a profound effect on the information that would be available to victims of abuse. Information which would be important in the redress process &ndash; non-personal information related to people's incarceration &ndash; would be denied.</P>
      <P>The State has begun to face up to its responsibilities in this tragic and sordid period of its history and any measure which would appear to block access to information to assist in the resolution of these cases must be resisted. A government acting in concert with the organisations settling the abuse cases, as the Government would like to describe itself, would withdraw this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The second area of concern to me is section 12 which amends section 19 of the Act and I am particularly concerned about the proposed definition of &ldquo;Government&rdquo;. The definition in the Bill subverts the conventional and indeed constitutional definition of government and would permit a very wide and some<Col N="1211" /> what arbitrary net to be cast into which many groups would now fall and therefore be excluded from the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>There is a public interest in having effective government and a public right to know. These seemingly conflicting interests must be married in a fair way by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Malley for sharing her time with me. The Freedom of Information Act, which came into force in 1998, has made a valuable contribution to our democracy. Confidence and trust in Government is essential in a democracy and the freedom of information plays a significant role in building these. We are committed to providing information and there was never as much information available to the public. Radio, television, newspapers, the Internet and computers mean an unprecedented volume of information is available at the touch of a button. People can get all the information on everything they want. Information is available from politicians, particularly Deputies and Senators. While some may give information more freely than others there are many people in the House who are readily available to disclose every little tittle-tattle that takes place inside and outside, which is welcomed by many people.</P>
      <P>We are also committed to ongoing reform. In politics, business or life in general, most people at times are asked to look at different aspects of their lives and to review, reform and try to improve them. After five years it is sensible to review the Act. We should not make Acts and laws and leave them there <i>saecula saeculorum </i>until the end of time without reviewing them occasionally. It is particularly appropriate to examine its consequences for the nature and effectiveness of governance in this country.</P>
      <P>The major responsibility of a Government is to govern. That should overshadow all other aspects of responsibility. A government will not be thanked on the day unless it comprises reasonable, sensible, responsible people. Where possible it is essential that we be governed in a manner that has due regard for the concepts of accountability and transparency. However, I am sure we all realise the serious need for good government and recognise the number of people that depend on the country being properly governed. We need to live in a peaceful law abiding society. We need to be able to go about our daily lives in peace. Or children need to enjoy their youth and need to be educated. Our elderly need to be able to retire and live in peace and harmony. That is the responsibility of a government. The proposed amendments to the Act are measured and sensible ensuring the Government is able to perform its first duty, which is to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Collective responsibility is a constitutional imperative for members of the Cabinet. It is both reasonable and sensible for the Government to enact changes that seek to comply with that imperative. For a Cabinet to be effective, there <Col N="1212" /> needs to be a full, frank and free exchange of views among its members. Since the foundation of the State every Cabinet has had its differences of opinion. When a decision is reached a Cabinet must, and should, unite behind it. The tradition of frankness will be lost if these exchanges are to be revealed. We will read and hear of divided Cabinets and Government splits &ndash; this is clearly detrimental to authoritative government. People have a responsibility to unite together for the good of the majority and minorities sometimes have to suffer for the good of the majority. We all have differences of opinion no matter what club or organisation to which we belong. It is best to allow everyone to sit down, exchange ideas and come up with a consensus of the majority view. Splits and divisions are not in the interest of relationships. People want stability, particularly at this time when people seek it for our country and our world. If members of a Cabinet have to exchange views, the Cabinet meeting is the time to do so. Protection will be applied, not just to Cabinet discussions but also to non-Cabinet communications between Ministers. This is an extension of the doctrine of collective responsibility.</P>
    <P>The period of retention is being extended from five to ten years. I am sure people will agree this is not unreasonable. While some people seem to think Governments in this country last for ten years &ndash; someone said this to me last week &ndash; there was an election last year. The extension of the period of retention ensures greater democracy and a greater documentary record. When history comes to be written, it is only proper that readers will be able to read the facts of what happened. If we are to have Cabinet discussions that are open to everybody, members of it may not say what they feel or think and future historians will miss the things that went unsaid.</P>

      <P>The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, was crowing about the calling of quorums earlier. During the debate on the Freedom of Information Bill on 11 March 1997, he stated, &ldquo;Government Deputies should hear some of this discussion. They seem to have no interest in freedom of information&rdquo; and he called a quorum. Deputy O'Malley is also concerned about the amendments being introduced to this Act. She will have an opportunity to say she stands behind the Republic, as her father so eloquently did, when the vote on Second Stage is held.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is opposed to the Bill. The main grounds for our opposition to this measure are that the proposals in this legislation run counter to the objective of making the public service and Government more open and accountable to the people, for which the Minister of State says the Government is responsible; the process by which this Bill was drafted is deeply flawed; and the political motivation behind this Bill is cynical and hypocritical.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the rainbow Government published a White Paper entitled, &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo;. The rainbow Government recognised the need to make the operation of the Government and its decision making processes more open and transparent to the citizen. We viewed it to be necessary if confidence was to be maintained in the State and the institutions of the State. Public confidence in the conduct of Government business had been dramatically weakened by scandal after scandal, which are still the subject of inquiry by tribunals set up by this House to determine the facts surrounding certain decisions and activities. If anything, the need to demonstrate an open and transparent decision-making process is greater now than it was in 1996 when &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo; was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enactment of the Freedom of Information Bill 1997 was one of the central recommendations of &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo; and the Act has had far ranging and largely positive effects on <Col N="1215" /> Government and the Civil Service. Most people, regardless of their political affiliations, would recognise that. The Act is widely acknowledged to have generated greater transparency in the conduct of Government business and in promoting a sense of accountability in the public service.</P>
    <P>An evaluation of the progress made under &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo; by independent consultants, PA Consulting, concluded last year that FOI has &ldquo;undoubtedly improved the accountability of the Civil Service to the wider public.&rdquo;  That is good and everybody recognises that. The PA Consulting report contains no references to the excuses that have been put forward by the Government to support the legislation. The only concern about FOI which the independent consultants identified was that the economic cost of servicing FOI was seldom acknowledged and hardly ever quantified. However, they continued: &ldquo;this is not to argue for any diminution in such openness and transparency, but is to suggest that the costs involved need to be acknowledged.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance has done that but that was the only recommendation made by the independent consultants. All Government members should be able to stand up with pride in the knowledge that they are doing the business of the people and making decisions that should be made known in the public interest, except where national security is concerned. There is a number of other exemptions.</P>
    <P>The Long Title of the Act set out the mandate of the legislation. It stated that access should be granted &ldquo;to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy.&rdquo;  This statement created the presumption that disclosure of information would be the norm and that this norm would be departed from only when clearly necessary. The thrust of this legislation runs totally contrary to the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. For example, in section 12, by substituting &ldquo;shall refuse&rdquo; for &ldquo;may refuse&rdquo; in the original Act, the balance has been shifted more and more towards secrecy. Section 12 also provides for a redefinition of Government to include committees of officials and the exemption of the work of such committees from release again runs totally contrary to the spirit of the original Act. This means that Secretaries General are also entitled to refuse a raft of requests for information relevant to decision making without appeal.</P>
    <P>The public think because of comments made by Ministers that what one says at the Cabinet table is recorded and the communications between Ministers are the central issues in this debate. For example, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform used the example of him having a row with the Tánaiste over &ldquo;some daft idea that she has brought forward&rdquo; and he stated it would be recorded on paper that would be available for release under FOI. That is not the case. Cabinet decisions are recorded but Cabinet discussions are not. There is nothing for <Col N="1216" /> Ministers to fear if a row breaks out. For example, if the Tánaiste brought forward a daft proposal, it would have to be subject to &ldquo;an intellectually penetrating analysis&rdquo;, according to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The public expect Ministers to stand up for them and argue the point. There is nothing about which they should be ashamed, nervous or afraid because there might be differences of opinion leading to a decision. Such decisions are subject to the collective responsibility of the Cabinet. The Government is now saying that in crucial areas of policy making it wants to revert to the pre-1997 culture, in which secrecy was the norm and the release of information the exception. The thrust of the Bill is to row back on the spirit and letter of the original Act. This sends a signal that the Government is running scared of transparency and accountability in the way it does its business. It also suggests to people that something is wrong because the Government is afraid to release information relating to how certain decisions were taken.</P>
    <P>Why should that be so? If the Government wants to do its business properly and be open, accountable and transparent, it should stand by the Act. The words of Fianna Fáil Deputies, who were in Opposition then and are now Ministers, are in the Official Report. There was nothing wrong with it according to Deputies O'Donnell and O'Dea. Deputy Woods wanted the Official Secrets Act repealed and Deputy Killeen wanted far more transparency. This has now changed because some people in the Cabinet decided they did not want the public to find out about how decisions were taken. They set up a group of five Secretaries General as a high level group and hid behind their recommendations that the Act should be amended. This decision means that citizens will be denied the full flush of information relevant to these decisions.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the way in which the legislation was drafted. The Government was back in office only a short time when it established a high level group to look at the Act. A group of Secretaries General did not set themselves up as a high level group over a cup of coffee in one of the Departments &ndash; they do not do such things. Therefore, with April approaching, a Government Minister decided that a high level group should examine the Act and that their recommendations should be restrictive because the Cabinet did not want the public finding out about things they did in the run-up to the general election. A small group of Ministers, from the Taoiseach down, effectively run the country and part of the running of the country is the control of what comes before the Cabinet. Therefore, I am quite sure that one of that quartet took advice from a spin-doctor or consultant that the high level group should be set up.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to refer to what happened in 1997 because the words of Fianna Fáil Members are on the record. It is not good enough to hide behind a high level group when none of <Col N="1217" /> the other Secretaries General, the Opposition parties, the people or the Information Commissioner were consulted. Earlier today, I wished the newly-appointed Information Commissioner, Ms O'Reilly well. In that context, if the Government wants to go through with this, it should finish the Second Stage of the Bill and withdraw it. The Bill should then be parked until the new Information Commissioner has had time to reflect on the Act and make her assessment of its validity and the validity of any new proposal. The Government would then have an Act that would go down well with the public because they would see that the Government is not afraid after all, but is amenable to having a new Information Commissioner give her verdict, analysis and views on the Act. There is nothing wrong with that and, if the Government is serious about its business, it should do that.</P>
    <P>I do not know who set up this high level group or on whose instructions it was set up and I probably never will, but the lack of consultation has been indicative of the way the Government has gone about this. Several statements made by the Government underline what it has not done &ndash; The Taoiseach's action programme on regulatory reform, launched in 1999, stated that &ldquo;there should be adequate consultation with interested parties before new legislation is introduced.&rdquo;  That has not been followed up on. In February 2002, the Government's paper Towards Better Regulation, stated that &ndash;&ldquo;one method of engaging citizens in decision making is the use of a public consultation processes.&rdquo;  That has not happened. The recently concluded Sustaining Progress agreement identifies as a key principle the promotion of &ldquo;greater consultation and transparency in formulating legislation and regulation.&rdquo;  The Government says one thing and does the opposite when it gets the chance, thereby giving two fingers to the public in terms of their right to have all relevant information.</P>

      <P>On 4 February, in reply to a question from me, the Taoiseach said that &ndash;&ldquo;suggestions from the Information Commissioner and some of the people who have worked on this will improve the Act.&rdquo;  As we all know, the Information Commissioner was not consulted by the high level group and had to initiate contact with the Department of Finance himself so that he could make comments. The Government was proposing to do something with an Act that is central to the Information Commissioner's remit and he had to ask if he was going to be consulted. On 12 February, the Taoiseach told the House that the high level group &ldquo;went through the Act and got the views of those who worked with it.&rdquo;  Were Deputies McGrath, O'Keeffe or anyone in the Opposition asked? The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The Taoiseach's words, which are on the Dáil record, were not implemented. What does one call that kind of carry-on? Again, the Taoiseach was being economical with the truth when he suggested, in relation to sections 24 and 25 of the Act, that it would allow for sensitive material which affects security and the defence of the State, international relations and matters relating to Northern Ireland to be legitimately withheld. We know that information does not come into the public domain anyway and with good reason.</P>
      <P>On 8 March, the Taoiseach said that the high level group &ldquo;was only asked to look at the limited area of collective Cabinet responsibility and the deliberative process. It was the only change which it recommended.&rdquo;  This is not the case. A review of the high level group's own report shows that it made recommendations about fees, inter-departmental consultation, extension of the Act's operation and a number of other matters.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, together with his soul-mate, Senator Leyden, attacked the decision by the Information Commissioner to publish a commentary on the Bill &ndash; a commentary which Members on all sides of this House and in the Seanad found useful and very informative. In the same debate, the Minister said that the Government &ldquo;was not and is not obliged to consult&rdquo; on legislation. According to him, it is open to the Government &ldquo;to decide to take its own advice&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that odd since the Minister has adopted <Col N="1219" /> an entirely different approach in relation to the Telecommunications (Retention Traffic Data) Bill. This week, in a message posted on his website, he tells us that he has been converted to the desirability of consultation because he says &ldquo;before the new legislation is ready for consideration by the Government, my Department is consulting widely on its content.&rdquo;  It would be interesting to hear from the Minister as to why one Bill merits consultation but another does not. The Minister has argued that if information continues to be available freely, it will reduce the frankness with which issues are discussed. He has also suggested that the plain people of Ireland would not be able for the intellectually stimulating debate which takes place. I do not accept that argument.</P>
    <P>People, regardless of whether they live in Louth, west Cork, Wexford or Donegal, are entitled to peruse the information that led to the intellectually stimulating decisions made by Cabinet. Even if the prospect of disclosure causes a reduction in candour and frankness, the real issue is whether the efficiency and quality of the deliberative process will suffer to an extent that it is against the public interest. The people who operate under the Act as it stands are obviously already careful in the messages they write at the bottom of the pages. One will not get any more of the stuff that appeared in the beef tribunal where certain people were left holding pieces of wood that would not be conducive to good hygiene, if the House recalls that comment.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that potential political embarrassment is more important than the people's right to information. It believes that the papers held by public bodies belong to those bodies and the Ministers, not to the people. People will have to pay to see them. I reject that. This is a cynical and hypocritical move by Government. It rolls back a significant cultural change that was initiated by the rainbow Government. It is the product of a flawed process which ignored all the norms and Government policies regarding adequate advance consultation. It is driven by a purely political agenda which seeks to protect the Government from future political embarrassment.</P>
    <P>Many Members on the Government side of the House have grave difficulties with this Bill. Given that there is such sentiment, the Government might be as well off to take on board the suggestions put forward by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. It should give the new Information Commissioner time to assess this Bill and the validity of the arguments and to make a report. Otherwise, at the conclusion of Second Stage, it should accept the Labour Party suggestion that activity be frozen for one year so there can be adequate time for consultation. The Minister should also take account of Deputy Fleming's comments in the committee report, that the matter required more time and substantial amendment.</P>
    <P>By persisting with this Bill the Government is <Col N="1220" /> putting a pebble in the shoe of every voter. They will be able to walk but it will become extremely painful after a while. While the public might not be aware of all the intricacies of business in the House, it does believe there is something wrong. People believe the Government is trampling on their rights and will restrict openness and the right to information in this Bill. They believe that is wrong. If the Government persists in this way, the public will not forget it. It is a wrong move. The Government should accept the good advice of political colleagues who were elected to the House by the same people who will remove this Government from office in the next election.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. The two main Opposition parties have sought more time to debate this Bill but their tactics have been to disrupt the House and limit the time speakers have to contribute to the debate.</P>
      <P>The finance committee heard submissions on the Bill from interested bodies over the past two weeks. Most of those who made presentations to the committee were convincing in their commitment to the principle of the legislation and in outlining their fears of how it could be affected by the changes the Minister is proposing. The Information Commissioner spoke to the committee and was open in his analysis of the existing legislation. He feels that the Act is working well. He said that any legislation, including the Freedom of Information Act, should be reviewed after five years.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say he was disappointed that, having operated the Freedom of Information Act for five years, he was not consulted, even though his office has a good working knowledge of the Act. He believed, as did many members of the committee, that his office would have had a considerable input into any amendments which would be considered by the Government. However, he accepted the decision. I believe the high level group which reviewed the Act should have consulted the commissioner to get the benefit of his experience of how the Act had worked since its introduction five years ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act has been most successful. According to the commissioner's report last year, there were over 15,000 inquiries under different provisions of the Act. The commissioner believes the introduction of the amending legislation will not make any difference to the level of inquiries. With <Col N="1221" /> regard to the introduction of fees, I am pleased the Minister has decided not to charge fees where personal information is being sought by individuals. Fees would have had the effect of discouraging people who might not have the means to pay them from pursuing their inquiries.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act is seen as a model of such legislation by many countries. Indeed, when the Scottish Parliament was drafting freedom of information legislation last year, it used the Irish Act as a model.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">

      <P>In Poland, people say Ireland has the best legislative ideas in its Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>Few people criticise the fact that, in the case of Cabinet papers, the time limit will be extended from five to ten years. In fact, 15 years might be a better time limit. There is little conflict in opinion throughout the country and among most Members of the Oireachtas about that aspect of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Freedom of Information Act protects Irish citizens and gives them confidence and trust in Government by virtue of the fact that they can access information in relation to their personal files. This Government has significantly extended the application of the Act. It now covers more than 370 bodies, compared with only 67 bodies when it was enacted five years ago. The range of bodies covered includes local authorities, health boards, voluntary hospitals and numerous other State agencies.</P>
      <P>The principal changes in the amending legislation are designed to improve the effective discharge of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the freedom of information legislation was originally enacted in 1997 it followed a detailed consultative process involving a number of individuals and groups. It was based on the principle that citizens own public information and that they have a legal right to access it from Departments and local authorities. While it has taken some time, the extension of restriction of access to Government records from five to ten years is welcome and I would like to see it extended much further. This was one of several recommendations that emerged from the review of the high level group. It is worth recalling its commentary with regard to this matter. It stated:</P>
      <P>It is evident that a five-year moratorium on the release of Cabinet records is far too short. It does not give Ministers the assurance that they require in order to commit views freely to the record, if those views are to be divulged in such a relatively short period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new time limit strikes a balance between <Col N="1222" /> what many people might require and what is in the current Act. Like so many other public services, freedom of information does not come cheap. In fact, we have seen a case where one freedom of information request to the Department of Finance was estimated to have cost something in the order of &euro;10,000 to process. While there is a fee for photocopying and other incidental expenses incurred by the Department, the charge to the individual involved in that request was approximately &euro;600, which left the Government picking up the tab for &euro;9,400.</P>

      <P>In some Nordic countries, such as Sweden, the system is portrayed as being the example of what freedom of information legislation should be like. When one examines it in detail, however, Swedish Cabinet Ministers do not receive any memoranda and when they attend Cabinet meetings they do not commit anything to paper so that people cannot access background information as to why decisions were taken. I would not like to see that happen in this country, which has a strong record of open and transparent Government. I would not like to see that interfered with.</P>

      <P>The Opposition obviously feels upset by some points the Government parties are making but this legislation will improve the Act. There are aspects of the drafting which might have been done differently but, in general, it is good legislation and I commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF" hpid="Dr. Devins Dr. Devins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Nolan for sharing his time with me and I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to the Bill. I fully support the principle of freedom of information, which makes the process of our democracy open and transparent. The Government is committed to freedom of information as evidenced by the fact that in 1997, when the Act first came into operation, some 67 bodies were covered by the legislation. This Government and its predecessor extended the number of bodies covered to nearly 370. The Government is fully committed to extending it by 2005 to all appropriate bodies. To hear the Opposition wail yesterday and today that the Government is not committed to the Act is to ignore the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>After five years, the Government has decided to review the workings of the Act. This is a good idea because certain issues have arisen which need to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>What are they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF" hpid="Dr. Devins Dr. Devins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that, if the Deputy would like to wait a moment. The first issue concerns the workings of Government itself. As Deputy McGrath well knows, we live in a democracy. On one side is the Government and on the other is the Opposition. At the centre of Government is the Cabinet which is composed of 15 individuals all representing different Departments. Each of these people brings his or her own flair, attributes and viewpoints to any issue that arises, but must also represent departmental views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Finance clearly outlined how the Cabinet works. There are frequent exchanges between Ministers and officials, inter-departmental discussions and, on occasions, sub-<Col N="1224" /> committees of Cabinet are set up. All of this is done before the Cabinet comes to discuss an issue. It is not hard to imagine how robust these exchanges may be. Each Minister naturally wants to protect his or her viewpoint and that of their respective Departments. We could imagine the discussion among the members of the management committee of a local development association or a local football club. It is natural and good that frank discussion takes place before any decision is arrived at.</P>
    <P>The difference here is that there is collective Cabinet responsibility. Government must be seen to act as a single entity with a single collective voice. Sometimes, as was outlined last night, Ministers and their Departments may be coming from very different perspectives. These perspectives at times may not be popular but in the long-term they may well represent what is best for the country. If they are inhibited in any way from engaging in frank and full discussions, the decision arrived at by Government may well be a weak, or possibly, wrong one. Freedom of information is designed to bring maximum disclosure of Cabinet discussions to the public's knowledge. If the situation were to arise whereby Ministers or their officials had to keep one eye on the immediate release of what they were discussing, it does not take a genius to deduce that their contribution could be altered or hindered. That could well lead to a media-friendly decision but it would not necessarily lead to the right one. Instead of having an effective Government, we would have a weak and divided one. That is one sure way of leading the country down the wrong road.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not designed to take away the benefits of freedom of information, rather it is designed to strengthen the release of all information. Despite what the Opposition claims, this Bill will result in much more detailed information being released, information that will truly reflect what was said and done at a particular time. That must be in the best interests of democracy.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to the issue of fees. It has been shown that the operation of the Freedom of Information Act costs a considerable amount of money. We heard last night of one request which cost approximately &euro;10,000 to process. We also heard of one individual who early on in the operation of the Act had costs exceeding &euro;100,000 due to the request that he or she made at that time. It has been estimated by the Department of Finance that a single request under FOI legislation generates costs of approximately &euro;400 to &euro;450. The Minister stated that he has not yet decided on the level of charge that he will implement. A charge is necessary, but I ask him to pitch it at a level that will be within the reach of the ordinary member of the public. I also ask him to examine the possibility of introducing a different scale of fees for an individual request, as distinct from an individual representing a media or large organisation.</P>
    <P>There has been a slight misunderstanding in regard to this Bill, in that, it is my understanding <Col N="1225" /> that discussions took place between officials from the Department of Finance and officials from the Information Commissioner's office prior to its drafting.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss something that happened in this House last night. I am a relatively new Member of the House, but I was surprised at the behaviour of certain Deputies last night. In our democracy, parties in opposition should oppose the Government, but they should do so in a constructive fashion, not in a destructive way. Yesterday they started off by opposing the Order of Business which is their right. They then called a vote on the Order of Business and, again, that is their right. However, it was what happened next that really surprised me. Having had a vote using our electronic voting procedures, they then called for a manual vote. Again that is their right, but it was obvious that this was a form of filibustering. What was achieved, however, was simply a waste of time. Then they repeated the whole procedure on the next item on the Order of Business. As if this was not bad enough, the Labour Party this morning engaged in another form of time wasting and all of this was done in the context of the leader of the Labour Party and the leader of Fine Gael Party stating this morning that they did not have enough time to discuss this important legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government has set aside three days of parliamentary time to discuss this Bill. It already has had 28 hours of discussion in the Seanad and Committee Stage is due to be taken next week. How can they complain on one hand of not having enough time to debate the Bill when on the other hand they are actively using every parliamentary device to waste time? This sort of behaviour would not be tolerated in a classroom of national school children. It shows the paucity of constructive ideas that the Opposition has in relation to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this Bill. I pay tribute to the contribution of the outgoing Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy. In my time in this House, I found him to be extremely helpful, co-operative and efficient in the running of his office and I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of Ms Emily O'Reilly to the position. She has a sharp intellect and her experience in journalism is vast. Is the Government changing the Freedom of Information Act because it knows that she will also be a formidable ombudsperson? Is it afraid that her skills will unearth and allow documentation to be released that it does not want to be released? Is that why it wants to restrict the Bill's provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" />I wish to comment on what Deputy Devins said. He is a new Deputy. Unfortunately, he was not here in 1995 to 1997 when his colleagues were in Opposition. If he reads the record of the Second Stage debate on the Freedom of Information Bill, as it was then, he will find that one of the Deputies who came into this Chamber this evening and had the cheek to complain about a quorum being called, called for a quorum in 1997. That is Deputy Woods. He called quorums on the previous occasion. Therefore, what kind of hypocrisy does his complaint this evening display? I will quote later what he said about the Freedom of Information Bill in 1997. It is easy to come in here as a new Deputy and point out all sorts of things, but Deputy Devins will find out very quickly that the scripts that are handed to him will blow up in his face and he will soon change his tune about what he is saying.</P>
    <P>We are back to the old ways of Fianna Fáil and the old days when its approach was to cover up, conceal and mislead the public. It got away with that at election time, but it will not do so again. If Members opposite believe that this item is passing through this House without the public noticing it, I can genuinely tell them that of all the Bills that went through this House in recent times, I have received more queries in my office on the proposed changes to the Freedom of Information Act than on any other Bill. The Members opposite should not underestimate what the public are thinking in relation to this. They should not be too quick to go through the lobbies to support what the Government said.</P>
    <P>I will give Members a sample of what was said in 1997 in relation to all of this. I will start with the great man who frequently writes for the newspapers, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea. In 1997 he was in opposition and very anxious to impress. He was tigerish and anxious because he hoped Fianna Fáil would get into Government and, because he was such a loyal supporter, that he would be made a Minister. He was wheeled out for the debate on the Freedom of Information Bill and, according to column 280 of the Official Report of 11 March 1997, he said:</P>
    <P>It is a grave disappointment. It is a minimalist, carefully hedged-in Bill which, if interpreted a certain way, will make very little practical difference to the administration of this country.</P>
    <P>He went on to say about section 19, the main section being amended by the new Bill:</P>
    <P>This is excessively restrictive. Surely documents which contain analysis, interpretation or evaluation of purely factual material should also be accessible. In addition, there is no valid reason that projections based on factual information should not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The case is made. That is what Deputy O'Dea said in 1997, although he will trudge through the <Col N="1227" /> lobbies tomorrow to support the Bill. There is a word for someone who does something like that which begins with &ldquo;h&rdquo;&ndash; hypocritical. Is that not the word? Deputy O'Dea has moved on from his old position and because he is in government he will row in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods was also ferocious in opposition and jumped for every ball. He was like a little tiger, running at everything. He also hoped to become a Minister again &ndash; we could talk about his performance in that role &ndash; so he too was very aggressive. In 1997 he said:</P>
    <P>While I am glad this Bill has been improved somewhat in the progress through Committee Stage in the Seanad, its provisions remain deeply flawed and thoroughly inadequate. On careful examination, which I strongly recommend to citizens and the media alike, it turns out to be little more than window dressing exercise in freedom of information.</P>
    <P>He went on to say it was a thin pretence at action designed to camouflage the Government's internal confusion and inability to agree on anything of substance or any resolute plan of action. That was great stuff from Deputy Woods. He went on to say: &ldquo;Despite all the bluster and hype which surrounded its introduction, it is little more than a damp squib, another fine example of the mountain being in labour and bringing forth a mouse.&rdquo;  He certainly had a turn of phrase in condemning the Freedom of Information Act as not doing enough. What will he do tomorrow evening? He will trudge through the lobbies again to support restrictions for a Bill he said was too restrictive. He talked of changing the Official Secrets Act but he will go through with this tomorrow.</P>
    <P>We then come to Deputy Killeen, for whom I have great respect. I have worked with him on several committees and his contributions are thoughtful. I hope he is listening because if anyone will take a stand, and I have seen Deputy Killeen take a stand before, he might be one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies with the guts to do so. He also spoke on 11 March 1997 and, in column 295, he said:</P>
    <P>While I support her [the Minister's] campaign I am worried this is going nowhere and troops are rallying in opposition to it. I do not see any of them on the Government benches but some interests are opposed to the direction in which the Minister is heading. There is a temptation to believe we are deluding the public and engaging in a PR exercise which is not likely to go anywhere.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Government parties have failed to grasp the opportunity to create and support a level of openness in the operation of the public service and the running of the State which is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> Again, the previous measure did not go far enough for him, but will he go through the lobbies now and support restricting that legislation? I do not think so because I recognise him as a man of integrity.</P>
    <P>Another speaker on 11 March 1997 was Deputy O'Donnell of the Progressive Democrats, who were anxious to get into bed in government with Fianna Fáil. She was also anxious to make a name for herself and in that debate, in column 273, she said:</P>
    <P>Governments tend to preserve their interests and have gone to enormous lengths to retain information, the release of which would have prejudiced their being in Government. The collapse of a Government must be avoided at all costs and that applies to all Governments. Therein lies the real difficulty with this legislation.</P>
    <P>She was referring to what had come out at the beef tribunal and the need for a Government to preserve itself, saying this measure did not go far enough. She also said, in column 274: &ldquo;I am confident that this or future Governments will be forthcoming with sensitive or explosive information when their skins are at stake.&rdquo;  In other words, she thought Governments would look after themselves and that this measure would not work. Will she go through the lobbies? She also said it was important that real work continue on the repeal of the Official Secrets Act.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for Deputy O'Donnell, who took a stand here on Third World aid. She had great difficulty getting funding for such aid from the Government of the time and, from the attitude of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; or Minister for everything, as he calls himself &ndash; to Third World aid, I see the reason. That attitude leaves a lot to be desired. Will Deputy O'Donnell troop through the lobbies tomorrow and contradict her past stance on freedom of information? Will she take the shilling and go through the lobbies? I do not think so because she is a person of integrity who knows her own mind. I look forward to seeing what happens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Devins raised the issue of fees. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe requested information from the Government on appointments to prison committees under the freedom of information legislation and was told initially it would cost &euro;800, although that was subsequently watered down. While that request was being processed, guess what happened. The great Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for goodness and all things, had a trawl carried out in the Department and he found a letter which Deputy O'Keeffe had sent some years before. He ran off to the press with the letter with the instructions that they should publish it without telling Deputy O'Keeffe its contents. What did it cost the officials to find that letter? What about the integrity of a Minister acting in that way? Was he worried about what would surface in the answer to <Col N="1229" /> Deputy O'Keeffe's request or was it done out of malice or for political gain? That is just one example. It is great to hear from these people who are full of integrity and taking the high moral ground. One looks forward to seeing what they will do.</P>
    <P>There was no consultation on this Bill. I recently learned that the local authority in my area received a request from a nursery seeking information on quotations sent to the council over the past five years for planting shrubs and trees and the ages and heights of those plants. As it happens, the council has done an enormous amount of planting over the past few years but what was the nursery looking for? Commercial information, which has nothing to do with the ordinary information people seek. The nursery should not be given that information. That is the kind of information which should be restricted to stop abuse of the freedom of information legislation. While I can understand that other parties who submitted tenders for a particular job should be entitled to see the contract awarded to the winner following a tender process, it would not be right to permit a general trawl of all information. These are the kinds of matters on which the Government should impose restrictions rather than issues on which there should be access to information.</P>
    <P>The only reason for the legislation is that the first batch of information from the previous Government's deliberations would otherwise come on stream in a month. The Government is afraid that in the years preceding the next election we will have a constant drip of information concerning all the terrible decisions, including the O'Flaherty appointment, taken by the previous Government.</P>

      <P>It will be a dark day for democracy if the Bill is passed. Since being returned to office last June, the coalition Government of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party has shown a lack of bona fides in dealing with the issue of freedom of information. It made no promises or threats regarding the Freedom of Information Act before the election. Immediately after returning to office, however, it established a secret committee as part of a decision to emasculate it. The high level group was set up with clear terms of reference and instructions and directions on what it was to produce. There was no independent review or consultation with the people whose rights were to be restricted. The Minister's bona fides and those of the Government are nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated last night that the purpose of the Bill is to allow the Government to carry on its work, no more and no less. The main purpose of the Bill is to restrict the rights of the public to access to information about this Government. This is part of a long-term strategy of a tarnished and dis<Col N="1230" /> credited Administration which, simply put, believes it can blandly deny its record of maladministration and, in due course, gain some hope of being re-elected in the next general election.</P>
    <P>Both the background and the process are flawed. The process the Government initiated last June ignored the fact that the Act provides for reviews. Eight sections of the original Act deal with the powers of the Information Commissioner, two of which cover the issue of review. Section 36 deals with a review of the operation of the Act and investigations by the Information Commissioner, while section 39 deals with the publication by the commissioner of commentaries on its practical application. What happened? The Information Commissioner was not even aware that the secret Government review was taking place. I cannot think of a more sinister development in our democratic system.</P>
    <P>The end result was that a document was produced which, according to the Government, formed the basis on which the Bill was drafted. Even this is not true as the Bill goes far beyond the recommendations of the high level group. There was an unacceptable review process, no consultation with citizens' groups whose rights are being affected and utterly flawed parliamentary procedure. A gunboat approach was taken which involved trying to jackboot the Bill through the Seanad and the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable comment about the Ministers presence in Cheltenham while the Bill was being debated in the Seanad. I have no problem with the Ministers travelling to the event and would love to have been there myself &ndash; I declare my interest in horseracing &ndash; but why was the Bill listed to be taken in the Seanad during the same week. The reason the Government stands indicted is not the Ministers' attendance at Cheltenham but the arrogance and contempt it showed for parliamentary procedure in listing the Bill while Ministers were absent.</P>

      <P>Essentially, this Bill amounts to a contest. We are debating it in the context of a contest between the current Government of the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats parties and the citizens of Ireland. In legal terminology it is the Government versus the people. The 1997 Act was enacted, as its Long Title proclaimed, to enable members of the public to obtain access to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the public interest. The purpose of the Bill before us is to substantially restrict the rights of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the media is understandably exercised about the Bill, the emphasis of this debate should <Col N="1231" /> be on the rights of the public. The Bill constitutes a serious diminution of the democratic rights of the people. It is absolutely clear their rights are being substantially restricted and reduced.</P>
    <P>In presenting the Bill, the onus of proof is on the Government to show the need for these changes. Some attempt has been made to produce evidence to support the extension of the five year rule. However, there has been no attempt to support all the other severe restrictions or produce evidence of imperfections in the current Act. Effectively, the Government is taking us back in the direction of the dark ages by trying to reintroduce the cloak of secrecy under which Fianna Fáil Governments operated in the past with such dire results, in other words, the tribunals. This is not the right way for a democratic system to develop. It is unjustified and a retrograde step. The Bill is political and designed for solely political purposes.</P>
    <P>That the Government is determined to reinstate the cloak of secrecy is highlighted in all its actions. When, pursuant to his statutory powers, the Information Commissioner correctly produced an excellent document with which the Government did not agree, the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform dismissed it with supreme arrogance. The opinion of the very man appointed by statute to comment on the Freedom of Information Act was dismissed on the basis that he was not entitled to comment or carry out his statutory duty.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Paul McGrath noted, the Minister tried the same approach with me because he did not want the kind of information I sought on prison visiting committees under the Freedom of Information Act to emerge.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to speak on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. Before commenting on it, I take this opportunity to wish Kevin Murphy, who has announced his retirement as Information Commissioner and Ombudsman, a happy and fruitful retirement. He has done tremendous work in his role in both offices in recent years. As a member of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I have met him on various occasions in the past five years. He was always highly independent in the <Col N="1232" /> performance of his duties and did good, objective work on behalf of the people. I wish Emily O'Reilly, his successor, every success in the new and challenging job ahead. In the changing times in which we find ourselves, the role will grow in significance in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I wish to make several brief observations on the Freedom of Information Act. In the four years from 1998 to December 2001, there were 44,307 freedom of information requests, the vast majority of which were addressed to Government&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whatever about this side of the House, I have not captured too many Members on the opposite side, but we are used to that this afternoon.</P>
      <P>From 1998 to the end of 2001, some 44,000 requests were made under the Freedom of Information Act. A total of 26,000 of those requests were made directly to Departments, 7,000 were to local authorities, 10,000 were to health boards and the health sector generally and the remainder were to voluntary bodies and third level institutes of technology and colleges.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that of the 44,000 requests for information, 23,000 were of a non-personal nature and 20,000 requested personal information. Almost half the requests under the Act, therefore, have been made by people seeking personal information and I welcome the fact that people are using the legislation effectively. I would like that to continue in the years ahead and I am sure this legislation will facilitate that.</P>
      <P>Speakers referred to the time available for this debate in the Dáil and the Seanad. As indicated previously, we had a record number of hours of debate in the Seanad to date. Three days were set aside for Second Stage in the Dáil this week. Next Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and even Friday, if people want to deal with it over a four day period, have been set aside for Committee Stage. That will provide ample time for every possible view to be aired in the course of that debate before the Bill comes back here for Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation was published on 26 February and is due to be completed in the House in mid-April. That is six weeks, which is a reasonable time to consider an item of legislation. Some speakers said the Bill has been rushed through the House but the Finance Bill, which is the largest item of legislation in the course of a year, was <Col N="1233" /> not given as much time for debate in the Dáil, the Seanad or in committee as the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. There has been ample time for full debate, for every technical detail to be teased out and for decisions to be reached. That is the reason we will make ample time available on Committee Stage next week and as chairman of the committee, I will try to ensure it is a balanced and fair debate for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Aside from all of that, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service held two full days of hearings, which is most unusual in respect of legislation which had commenced its passage through the House. We spent about ten hours on one occasion and up to ten hours on another discussing this issue, and we laid before the House today a report entitled, Report on Hearings Relating to the High Level Review Group on the Freedom of Information Act, 1997: Report to Government and Related Matters. That is a 300 page report produced by the joint committee over the past fortnight, and I challenge any Member of this House to produce a similar voluminous report covering every aspect of an item of legislation and lay it before the House before it has concluded its passage. It is wide of the mark to say that this House, as the national Parliament, has not involved itself in a deep consultative process. People are either not aware of the facts or they do not want to accept them, and there is a bit of both in this situation.</P>
    <P>We held extensive hearings on 13 and 19 March with the five Secretaries General appointed by the Government to conduct a high level review. We then had a full afternoon hearing with the Information Commissioner. We heard from an expert on freedom of information legislation, a Dr. McDonagh. We had a detailed presentation from the national newspapers and also from the National Union of Journalists. On our second day we had a detailed presentation from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, a large voluntary organisation representing the voluntary sector called The Wheel and the One in Four group, which has widely publicised its concerns &ndash; also through our committee. We dealt with a number of other items of correspondence submitted to our committee. Representatives from all those groups had an opportunity to make a presentation which was followed by a detailed question and answer session with each of the groups over the two day period.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the debate in the past week or so and I believe that all the information required to effect the satisfactory passage of this legislation through the House is now in the public domain. All the points on this legislation have been aired publicly and through the Oireachtas committee. I thank all the members of the joint committee from all parties in the House, the Independents and the Technical Group for their assistance and co-operation in ensuring the orderly conduct of the committee during what were unusual hearings. As a committee we felt it <Col N="1234" /> was appropriate to do that and it has been a beneficial exercise for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The high level review group was discussed at the committee. There is an absolute misconception about the group due to ignorance &ndash; the Secretary General told the committee that its report was only part of the process being operated by the Government to draw up the new legislation. The five members of the group were asked to draw on their personal experience. It was neither intended nor expected that they would engage in wide consultation. They were simply asked for their input. There were other inputs as the process continued.</P>
    <P>There were discussions with the national newspapers at the committee. They benefit from the Freedom of Information Act financially because it generates news for them which they have every right to do. The NUJ, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the other organisations I have mentioned specifically highlighted items of particular relevance to their individual areas of activity &ndash; they represented sectional views.</P>
    <P>Ms McDonagh, a legal expert in the area, covered many topics and what she said was very important. On changing the protection of Cabinet and Government records from five to ten years, she said that length of time was in line with international trends, pointing out that many countries had 15, 20 and 30 year rules. At ten years, this State will still have one of the shortest periods for release of any country which has legislated for this area.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I am concerned about the disservice done to the Office of the Information Commissioner by certain Members in the last two weeks. In particular, I am gravely concerned about the disservice done by Deputy Kenny a short time ago. He complained, as did many other Members, that Mr. Kevin Murphy was not involved in the full consultation process when he was expert in the area. That is a direct attack on the independence of his office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, appeared before the committee on 13 March. He was asked if he should have been consulted and this is how he answered:</P>
      <P>If my office had been asked to appoint somebody to the high level group, I would have refused because there cannot be mixing between an independent office and a Department of State. There is a very strict dividing line between an independent body, whether the Ombudsman's office or the Information Commissioner's office. If the high level group had written to me to say it was thinking about something and to ask me if I had any views on it from a technical point of view, I would have been very happy to oblige, but I certainly would not have allowed myself or any of my staff to be a member of the high level group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Murphy continued:</P>
      <P>As regards being aggrieved, there is no statutory obligation on the Government to consult me but I see my role as one of supporting the Houses. Therefore, when the Bill, which is a very technical and complex one, was published, I asked myself if I could help the Houses in any way by giving it factual information. That is what I did.</P>
      <P>Mr. Murphy published a report for the benefit of the Members of the Oireachtas. He had no authority to make a report to the Government or any Minister, he was answerable only to these Houses. He was asked about the reason he had not been consulted and replied:</P>
      <P>We have to be careful of the distance between myself and the Civil Service. I certainly do not see myself as having a right of consultation and equally it works in reverse. I do not see myself as having to clear anything with Departments. I cannot expect to have the best of both worlds. If I do not consult them I can hardly turn around and say they must consult me.</P>
      <P>He was independent. It was an insult to his office for Members to demand that he be consulted. Members have no right to tell an independent officer how to do his or her duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>It is akin to being a judge &ndash; no Member would dare come into the Oireachtas and tell a judge how to perform his or her duty. The person concerned was appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Oireachtas and no one here should have told him how to do his work. It was an insult and a diminution of his <Col N="1236" /> authority for Members, including Deputy Kenny, to say he should have been consulted as if to say he was subservient to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are Mr. Murphy's words &ndash; he was adamant that he did not consult Departments, that he was independent of them and that he did not expect Departments to consult him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I have full confidence in him and equal confidence in Emily O'Reilly who I hope will get the support of this House and be approved by the President in the near future.</P>
      <P>There are sections of the Bill that should be improved before it is enacted. The proposal to substitute the word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; for &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; sounds like a small change but it will have a major impact, particularly on those seeking records from institutions. There has been a High Court decision on the matter. I ask the Attorney General's office to ensure the wording will allow the same access to information in future as in the past. The wording must be improved because it is difficult to implement the interpretation given in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 deals with Government records and includes anyone &ldquo;who is a member of any other class of person as may be proscribed&rdquo;. That is an inappropriate definition of &ldquo;Government&rdquo; and I ask the Attorney General and the Department to revise it. If the Department wants to include cer<Col N="1237" /> tain classes of people, they should be included as officials, they should not be included in the term &ldquo;Government&rdquo; which is specified in the Constitution and unnecessarily confusing from a legal point of view.</P>
    <P>In relation to fees, I expect the Minister will introduce regulations to ensure there will be no fee for persons seeking their own personal records. I also believe that old age pensioners and students should not have to pay a full fee. They should only be required to pay a modest token fee, if any. Correspondingly, commercial organisations should have to pay an appropriate fee in relation to the cost of providing the service, with a graded variation in fees as between different bodies.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion on the deliberative process. People seem to know very little about the existing Freedom of Information Act. There are currently 370 bodies, each with information officers. On a regular basis, information is refused on the grounds that it is part of the deliberative process. This Bill simply proposes that, as well as those 370 existing freedom of information officers, Secretaries General would also have the right to state that specified information is within the deliberative process and should not be released. There is no reason a certificate should not move from one Department to another, just as records do.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to have the legislation amended in this regard. I do not agree with the idea of certificates being issued in secret. When a certificate is issued, it must be reported to the Information Commissioner and a public record of such certificates must be maintained, so that people will know whether a particular issue is covered by a certificate from a Secretary General. Also, when a certificate expires, there must be formal notice of that fact. The existing Act provides for Ministers to issue ministerial certificates, exempting certain items of information, which are reported to the Information Commissioner. Those certificates are referred to in the commissioner's annual report so that the number of such certificates issued is known. I would welcome the introduction of a similar control mechanism in relation to any certificates issued by Secretaries General in future.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provision in section 15, whereby access to information may be refused if it is likely to be the subject of an inquiry to be conducted by a person who has held judicial office or is a barrister or solicitor. I consider that definition too narrow in that it perpetuates the concept of the legal profession sewing up such investigations. I hope that will be amended on Committee or Report Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <P>
      <Col N="1238" />The Freedom of Information Act is one of the most wide ranging and important Acts enacted by this House in recent times. Few measures have impacted as much on the public and public administration as this Act. It is important to have some regard to the history and evolution of this legislation and its impact in terms of a sea change in the way public business is transacted in this country. This is a product of what people now regard as the Haughey era, when the administration of public affairs was contaminated in the eyes of the public at large, whose perception was that much public business was carried on behind closed doors in a way that did not benefit the public. The response to the demand for open and transparent administration came from the public and it behoves the Oireachtas to respond.</P>
    <P>I was proud that my party, in the election of 1992, put forward a twin platform &ndash; justice in economics and ethics in public administration. The justice and economics aspect was designed to attack the golden circles which, as we have discovered more fully in recent times, considered themselves exempt from the tax laws of this country and to restore confidence in the manner in which our public business is carried out. There were three pillars to the ethics in Government platform: the Ethics in Public Offices Act&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>Which had to be amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy made that interjection. It relates to the next point I was about to make. That ethical platform was fought, tooth and nail, by Fianna Fáil in this House and in the negotiations in which I participated with that party. Since then, the Electoral Act which I had the privilege of bringing through this House as a Minister, has been assaulted by Members from the Deputy's party and by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on behalf of the partners of the Deputy's party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because it was deficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister announced that the Electoral Act was fundamentally flawed &ndash; that it was unconstitutional to put ceilings on the amount of money that could be slushed into political parties. As Deputy Fleming has confirmed, his party amended the legislation as soon as it had the political clout, because it wished to continue its slush funds and business supports. It set out to eviscerate the fairness implicit in legislation which sets limits on expenditure. I thank the Deputy for reminding me of his party's assault on the ethical platform which my party proudly <Col N="1239" /> established as a basis for rebuilding public confidence in the way public business is carried out in this country.</P>
      <P>Each of the Acts to which I have referred had a major impact. As I said, the impact of the Electoral Act was to put ceilings on the amount of money which could be given to political parties and candidates, to cap expenditure&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is touchy in relation to those matters &ndash; with good reason. I recall viewing a Fianna Fáil website which claimed that the Electoral Act, against which that party had fought tooth and nail, was actually its own idea. The truth is sometimes alien to that outfit, as I am becoming increasingly aware. The reality is that Fianna Fáil assaulted that Act before the last election, so that it could have a good run at spending the war chest it had built up again. Now, it has moved on to the last pillar, the Freedom of Information Act. It is quite amusing, on the part of people who have fundamentally principled opposition to these measures, who negotiated them downwards as far as possible and who want to assault them, to try and cloak themselves in the notion that, really, they are just being practical. The inference is that others do not really understand the nuanced changes which are being made, minimalist though they are, and that, if we really read and understood the documentation, those of us who drafted and negotiated the original legislation in the first instance would embrace the Government's point of view and all would be well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to spell out exactly what this Government is proposing in relation to the Freedom of Information Act. I am glad my friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is present. We have debated this issue on local radio in our home county. Obviously, the message he is being given to present locally is the same message Fianna Fáil is presenting across the country &ndash; that what is proposed in the present Bill is minimalist small change. The claim is made repeatedly by the Minister of State and others that there is really just one issue involved, that is to extend the Cabinet exemption from five years to ten. All the rest is regarded as technical adjustment on the basis of experience. That is not true. In reality, <Col N="1240" /> the Government is proposing sweeping changes that will fundamentally alter the balance of this legislation in terms of its implementation and the rights of the public as guaranteed in the current Act.</P>
    <P>There is a smokescreen, of which we have seen more varieties in the past few days than Saddam Hussein has managed to put up around Baghdad, that suggests the Government actually has a legacy of extending freedom of information to a plethora of outfits and organisations, as if it was not intended from the outset that the Act would apply to all those organisations. The truth is that this Government does not give a fig about the extension of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to all the semi-State bodies, quangos, local government, the health boards and whoever else. The one outfit which this Administration is interested in is itself. It is interested in protecting itself, its own record and that of its immediate predecessor over the past six years. The urgency about this measure is that the five-year limit is about to kick in and the Bill must be enacted quickly. I do not know the reason for that urgency. There must be something terrible in those files that we must have this enacted to implement this extension.</P>
    <P>Let me spell out why this Bill fundamentally alters the balance of the 1997 Act and deal with some of the points made by Deputy Fleming and others. First, there is the issue of widening the definition of Cabinet papers to include material primarily created for Cabinet. The new definition includes material primarily created for Cabinet. My colleague, Eithne Fitzgerald, the former Minister of State who brought the original Bill through this House and who worked assiduously to get the best possible Act in the world in place, looked to best practice in places like Australia and elsewhere. She looked at that particular definition and saw that the original definition, which she adopted and the House accepted, exempted papers that were created solely for Cabinet. The original definition was such because the experience in other countries which had freedom of information legislation, including Australia, was that it was too broad a brush to talk about papers and materials created primarily for Cabinet because, in the case Australia, anything that wafted its way in the vicinity of Cabinet suddenly acquired this protection from disclosure. At the time that was explained and debated, and yet now that principle will be wound back. This protection, which was for the narrow definition of prime documentation for Cabinet, will now have a broader definition and potentially will exclude a huge amount of additional work.</P>
    <P>Similarly the Cabinet papers protection is being extended to cover committees of officials working to Cabinet and to interministerial correspondence, that is, Ministers writing to each other about issues that are related to Cabinet. The broadening exclusion grows.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" />It is my understanding that the committee of Secretaries General wanted these exemptions to be very tightly drawn but in the Bill, as published, they would find a massive shelter for a range of documents which should properly be available for public scrutiny. That is a factual reality. This new, simple re-definition of Cabinet papers, Cabinet discussions, interministerial documentation and correspondence and Cabinet working groups, which may not be constituted of Ministers at all, will broaden the scope of these exemptions significantly. This was known to be a broad exemption in the original Act, but now we are going back to that.</P>
    <P>The other new provision on the deliberative process was one which was mentioned by the speaker immediately before me, and this is a particular cause of concern. The Bill provides a power for a Secretary General to issue a certificate simply stating that the deliberative process is ongoing. That simple declaration by a Secretary General that the deliberative process is ongoing will be enough to suspend an appeal process in relation to a request for information. There is significant scope to drag on the deliberative process for months or years and to hide under that clause documentation from release forever. That is a simple fact.</P>
    <P>The power to issue a certificate from a Secretary General stating the deliberative process is ongoing will effectively suspend the appeal process. I want Deputies to hear the following because the information provided by the previous Deputy was wrong. The conclusive certificate process in the original Act was limited to extremely sensitive and serious security issues and was hedged in with important safeguards about clearance from other Ministers and the publication of the number of certificates, as has been mentioned. It was understood that this would be a very narrow limitation. No such safeguards are provided in the Bill. Routine policy information can be put beyond the appeal process and the operation of the public interest test simply does not apply. These are fundamental alterations and fundamental changes. We must acknowledge that and deal with them.</P>
    <P>On the issue of charges, I welcome the comments from the Government benches that this is a step too far and it should be rolled back. A mandatory minimum charge for information is contrary to the very Title of the Act, the Freedom of Information Act. In another existence, my friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, would be vocal about charges for access to information. If he were still sitting on Wexford County Council and there was information required from a citizen, he would be in the vanguard of demanding the right. He would know that poor people should not be disadvantaged and one's access to information should not be determined by one's ability to pay for it. Fundamentally it is a flawed principle and runs counter to the concept of freedom of information. I <Col N="1242" /> expect a great many Members on the benches opposite to agree with that.</P>
    <P>The charges will have a twin effect. They will deter the less well-off from applying for information and also do something else which is important for us to focus on for a moment, that is, reduce the amount of information that is released by statutory and non-statutory Government bodies as a normal course.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 has been to change the culture of openness in public administration. Due to the fact that everybody knows that virtually every document is available and will be available under the FOI Act, most of them are released as a matter of routine without having to go through the legal process of applying under the FOI Act. One can get most information and there is a culture which encourages an openness in documentation and access to information as a matter of routine.</P>
    <P>The issue of charges will change that culture because it will be seen as a mechanism for raising revenue. There will be a positive disincentive to release or make available information as a matter of routine outside of the parameters of the FOI Act. Finance officers will encourage FOI officers not to release information unless the charge is paid because it will be a source of revenue, and not to do any work unless it is paid for by the applicant. That is an unwelcome and dangerous move. It runs counter to a new culture which had been inculcated at local and national levels in the normal transaction of public affairs in an open way. The growing culture of openness will be assaulted by this provision.</P>
    <P>As I have very little time, I want to mention the Labour Party's proposal. As the House will be aware, I could go through all the sections of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill with which I have difficulty, such as sections 12 and 13 and section 25 on the briefing for parliamentary questions. For instance, the briefing for parliamentary questions will be exempted in the Bill which will make it more difficult to get background information on issues. They will return to the principle that the Deputy did not ask the right question, instead of a culture of asking what the Deputy wants to know because he or she has a right to know it. However, we will debate all of these matters in committee and no doubt I will have the opportunity to make an input.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party produced its own Bill, which did not seek simply to crush the Government's proposal. I accept that no legislation is perfect. I supported some of the changes in the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995. It was an extremely complicated Bill to enact. We learned by experience. Every Bill is capable of improvement. I have no difficulty in revisiting the Freedom of Information Act: it was always envisaged that we would do this. The Labour Party and I are proposing that we do this in a way that is in keeping with the principle of FOI, that is, in an open and transparent way. We should simply freeze things as they are for one year, extend the period of pro<Col N="1243" /> tection of current Government papers for a further year so that the provision will not come into effect in April, thereby removing the current urgency, and listen to those who have an interest, including those, as Deputy Fleming said, who have voiced 300 pages of opinion in two days, but also the many more who wish to speak. I am not a member of the committee, but it is my understanding that the committee unanimously accepted that it would like more time for submissions.</P>
    <P>Can we not reasonably regard this House not as a rubber-stamp for the Executive but as a real Parliament with a parliamentary agenda? We should allow members of the public, whatever their opinions, to make their own inputs into our deliberative process. We should freeze things as they are for now to allow for proper debate, for the will of all parties on the finance committee to be heard and for a proper decision, one on which we can all agree, to be made in a measured way in a number of months. The Government's proposals have divided us over the last while, but we should not be divided in this way.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute and express my gratitude to the outgoing Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy. His successor, Ms Emily O'Reilly, must be elected by the House but the warm welcome her nomination received from all sides augurs well for her. I wish her well in the difficult and challenging job she will have to do on behalf of the public.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Pat Carey.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Howlin's assertion that no Act is perfect or incapable of being amended. Unfortunately, I have not been in the House as long as the Deputy, but I have detected in recent months a tendency among some of his colleagues to feel that certain Acts are incapable of being amended &ndash; that they are perfect in all circumstances and can never be changed. That may come from the fact that some Ministers in some Governments were only in power for a very short period, and woe betide any Government that subsequently dares to change their Acts. I welcome Deputy Howlin's view, which is more enlightened than the view of some of his colleagues. Some of them seem to think they have proprietary rights over an Act &ndash; it is theirs and can never be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act 1997 has worked very well. It has served the public well and contributed enormously to public life. I agree with Deputy Howlin that it forms part of the three-cornered pillar of ethics and electoral legislation. However, that is as far as our agreement goes, because the two other Acts he mentioned were like this one: good for the most part, but fundamentally flawed. The FOI Act recalibrated citizens' rights in a very positive way. The key word in this debate is &ldquo;rights&rdquo;. Let us examine the rights of the citizen. The right to information <Col N="1244" /> is but one of dozens enjoyed by our citizens. Their rights are enshrined in our Constitution and in legislation. They have the right to life, the right to liberty, the rights to freedom of association and freedom of expression, the latter of which we are exercising here. Rights such as these are not generally available in Iraq, but they are very important and we have come to rely on them and expect them in the House and outside it.</P>
    <P>Citizens also have the right to good government and the Government itself has rights that are enshrined in the Constitution. The Constitution confers huge rights on the Government and on Ministers and each day as we debate and pass legislation in this House we are conferring rights upon the Government: to act in the interest of the people and the common good. Perhaps the most overarching and powerful right of any Government is that of depriving people of their liberty and their property, but that is all in the express interest, as set out in the Constitution, of the common good.</P>
    <P>I make these points to emphasise that it is not only the citizen who has rights. The Government also has rights and that point has been lost within this debate. The rights of the Government are in the interest of the common good. The essence of this debate is to identify where those rights can overlap and be in conflict with each other. Once we recognise that, we should then decide how legislation should be used to interfere with those rights in the interest of the common good.</P>
    <P>There was debate between Deputy Howlin and Deputy Fleming in relation to the powers and duties of the Information Commissioner under the Act. I have looked at the report of Deputy Fleming and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Section 39 of the Act states:</P>
    <P>The Commissioner may prepare and publish commentaries on the practical application and operation of the provisions, or any particular provisions, of this Act, including commentaries based on the experience of holders of the office of Commissioner in relation to reviews, and decisions following reviews, of such holders under <i>section 34.</i>The key words in that section are &ldquo;[t]he Commissioner may . . .  publish commentaries . . .  of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I compliment the commissioner on his work and wish him well in his retirement. He has given great service during his tenure. The comments I am about to make do not apply just to this commissioner, but to all commissioners, including the incoming commissioner, whom I also wish well in her work in the future. It is important that while the commissioner has the absolute right, as recognised by Deputy Fleming, to comment on the operation of the Act, the commentary should be, as set out under section 39 of the Act, about the principal Act &ndash; the Freedom of Information Act 1997. I do not know whether it is entirely appropriate for the commissioner or any public body set up by the Oireachtas to comment on proposed <Col N="1245" /> legislation, unless it has been given express power in the legislation to do that. I do not wish to go further in relation to that point&mdash;</P>

      <P>Any legislation which serves to undermine the efficient and effective work of government is bad and we should stand up and have the courage of our convictions to amend it.</P>
      <P>I would like to give a small analogy that might help the House in our debate. Last Monday Limerick City Council debated certain aspects of the Freedom of Information Act as opposed to the Bill now before the Houses of the Oireachtas. An organisation under the auspices of the council which received funding from it had certain financial difficulties and meetings were arranged between council officials, members of the body and councillors acting in their own independent right. Subsequently, the minutes and documents arising from the meeting were the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Many of the documents contained very progressive and even radical ideas which, if they had got out into the open at the time, would have been held up to scorn and ridicule and could have been abused by opposing political forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The councillors who had attended the meeting spoke extremely eloquently of the fact that had they known the documents would become public, not alone would they have never produced the documents but they would never have even <Col N="1246" /> attended the meeting, thereby undermining the whole process being undertaken by the council. I make this point to illustrate the fact that if local authority decision-making is undermined to such an extent by the Freedom of Information Act 1997, we can only speculate the detrimental and adverse effect which the Act is having on the Government's decision making process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I pay tribute to the outgoing Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. I had few dealings with his office as Information Commissioner but in his role as Ombudsman, I found him and his staff most helpful. I have no doubt that the incoming Information Commissioner, Ms O'Reilly, who was referred to in one of the newspapers today as &ldquo;no shrinking violet&rdquo; will equally perform the task with diligence and integrity.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent, if I borrow a phrase from another theatre, we are almost enshrouded with the fog of war in this debate. This is unfortunate because in many ways a very good debate is taking place about the importance of freedom of information. Much time was spent and much lobbying was done by groups of all hues, including trade unions, non-governmental organisations and political parties, to have this legislation introduced and enacted. Everybody was positive in the approach to try to implement that policy as best as possible.</P>
      <P>I have huge respect for Deputy John Bruton. When he made his acceptance speech as Taoiseach on 15 December 1994, he said:</P>
      <P>In the same way that I seek simplicity in the office of Taoiseach I seek simplicity in government and national policy. Good government is a public service and it should be kept simple. This is a Republic. Public office is a privilege that must be paid for in hard work and long hours. [The following is the piece that always stuck in my mind] The Government must go about its work without excess or extravagance and as transparently as if it were working behind a pane of glass. The same holds for national policy.</P>
      <P>I was trying to trawl through editorials from <i>The Irish Times.</i> Progressively, over the term of the office of the Government of which Deputy Howlin was a distinguished member, whether intentional, there was a tendency for journalists and others to be critical of the way that Government was not able to operate behind a pane of glass. In some ways the longer it was in office, the more stained or opaque the pane of glass became. Perhaps it had no other choice but to operate that way.</P>
      <P>About one year after Deputy Bruton became Taoiseach on 16 November 1995, Deputy Harney spoke in the Dáil as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised with the Taoiseach the other day the proposed appearance of the DPP on a live radio programme and how irrelevant this House is becoming. This morning I read in a <Col N="1247" /> newspaper that the Taoiseach had received a letter from the British Prime Minister. When I sought information here yesterday on the response from the British Government the Taoiseach did not give me that information. If the Taoiseach and the Government withhold essential information from the House and brief the media on it, they will further undermine the House, their authority and the role of Deputies. I ask the Taoiseach for an explanation as to why I was not given the information I sought during Question Time yesterday.</P>
    <P>No Government has a monopoly on the lack or flow of information. When at the time Deputy Harney reminded the Taoiseach that his Government would be as transparent as a pane of glass, former Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn said: &ldquo;It is stained.&rdquo; I do not think there was a deliberate attempt to stain it. Towards the end of the rainbow Government, Fintan O'Toole, who is also no shrinking violet, commented on its intentions, particularly in the area of reform of the Constitution around the time of the McCole case. In the course of an article he said:</P>
    <P>Yet the commitment to changing the Constitution to allow for the revelation of cabinet discussions in certain limited circumstances (such as those presented by the McCole case) was to the say the least rather shaky . . .  So long as that promise remains unfulfilled the attitude that has marked the Government's stance on the McCole case &ndash; that the conduct of the State is none of the public's business &ndash; will be underpinned by the Constitution of what is supposed to be a democratic state.</P>
    <P>I merely use those to try to calm passions. There are certainly aspects of the Bill that clearly need reform. While I have never been in government, nor am I likely to be, it strikes me that the deliberative process that seems to have exercised so many excessively ought to be looked at. There would be issues relating to areas such as health, transport or education policy that would go through Government over a significant number of years. It would be wise not to broaden the debate too widely, otherwise no Government will come to any conclusions.</P>
    <P>In preparing for this debate I read the submission from the National Union of Journalists and the document presented by the Information Commissioner. While there are some arguments to suggest that refinements are required in the Bill, huge changes are not needed. In some respects I have greater confidence in Government and Departments complying with the terms of a Freedom of Information Act than I have with the downstream bodies. There have been examples in various committees here. I was a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science in the last Dáil, which discussed the question of issuing school league tables. Surely that is a freedom of information issue. There are <Col N="1248" /> certain implied rights and some believe parents and students ought to be entitled to this information. Some of those&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was about to make a point about the release of information by downstream bodies such as schools and universities, etc. I listened to the debate in the Upper House and some of the most vigorous and vociferous contributors that criticised the Government for the way in which it proposes to change the FOI Act were involved in teacher unions that steadfastly resisted any proposal to release particular items of information. We cannot have it every way; we need to get things in perspective.</P>
      <P>While I hate to draw on my experience with the Convention on the Future of Europe, the right of the citizen to information is part and parcel of the European project and is something I hold dear. When one looks at member and applicant states, one can see that Ireland's release of information, and promotion of this, is at the high end of the spectrum. I do not think we ought to pat ourselves on the back for doing this. While it is right and good and important for government that it should happen, let us not be so critical as to suggest &ndash; as has been done &ndash; that what we are proposing is part of a right wing conspiracy. I do not believe this is the intention.</P>
      <P>As regards the increase in retention of papers from five to ten years, most Members of this House and other interested parties will be around to participate in the debate when it happens. I believe consultation on this issue is ongoing. There are Members of the House that are more familiar with the process than me. We occasionally receive reports that are informed by the users' network on freedom of information. Those people have recommended the extension of the Freedom of Information Act. As far as I can recall, approximately 600 agencies and bodies now come under the remit of the freedom of information legislation and this is a sign of progress.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House. As Deputy Howlin says, no Bill is beyond amendment. A balance should be struck between those who say this is an awful Bill and those who say it is just about right. The truth usually lies somewhere in between.</P>

      <P>Citizenship, the concept of empowered and politically involved citizenry, has been a cornerstone of republican philosophy since the 18th century. James Madison, a man often referred to as the father of the American Constitution, one of most inspirational documents in republicanism, wrote, &ldquo;A people who mean to be their own governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.&rdquo;  People should not be shut off from knowledge. It is the function of Government to serve the people, not for the people to serve the Government. How can the Government claim to be at the service of the people when it is willing to deny them access to information? What has it got to hide?</P>
      <P>Members of the Government, including Ministers, have suggested that the opposition to the erosion of this right is media-inspired. They suggest those of us opposed to it are acting at the behest of journalists too lazy to carry out investigations themselves. The Freedom of Information Act is not simply a media tool; it is a tool for the people that opens the processes of Government that have been kept secret for so long.</P>
      <P>The Act before the House will broaden the definition of a Cabinet paper. It could be argued that it broadens the definition of a Government by including the various spin doctors, media handlers and hangers-on that form part of the Taoiseach's court. Other restrictions on the type of information that can be released and the context in which this can be done amount to a large step backwards in the political evolution of this State. Some of the counter-arguments put forward by the Government in support of the restriction of information Bill before the House are particularly unsavoury. Perhaps the most nauseating and insulting argument put forward by the Government is that freedom of information costs too much. Freedom of Information, they say, is not free. Surely real democracy involves people receiving information and making up their own minds.</P>
      <P>What price is an informed and politically active citizenry worth? Several Deputies have mentioned that one question cost &euro;10,000, and this is certainly too much. If we believe in this legislation it should not be based on extremes, although this argument has been put forward. If Deputies want a cost-based analysis, the changes now proposed to the Act would have prevented the disclosure of details of the imperial-like extravagance of the Bertie bowl. Requests under the Freedom of Information Act showed the deep disquiet in the Civil Service at the cost and the nature of the proposal. These revelations led to the independent review that showed how much the stadium cost. Without it, this State, already committed to paying out millions under the Minister for Finance's free money scheme, might be bound to one costing almost &euro;1 billion for a stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Freedom of information is not only a principle worth defending &ndash; it pays for itself. It has been written that this is a Government that knows the <Col N="1250" /> price of everything but the value of nothing. A Government that cannot pass a budget without cutting tax for the well-off is now whining about the few thousand euro necessary for free and open Government. We must ask ourselves what will be hidden behind this legislation. Are we going to have to wait much longer to see what the ministerial colleagues of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, wrote to him in the lead up to his assault on the section 5 provisions of the Planning and Development Act? Recent reports in the media have suggested the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was not alone in the Cabinet in putting the interests of developers before the homeless. Reports in the media recently suggested that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, wrote on behalf of Treasury Holdings. It is in the interest of the Minister that this information be put into the public arena. People are concerned about changes to legislation.</P>

      <P>Without the Act, we would not have seen the letters from the Minister for Finance to his colleague at the Department of Health and Children that Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to earlier. We would not have known that the annual fund set up by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to be raised from the licence fee, but made available to private broadcasters, was set up against the strong advice of his own officials. In 2000 the Information Commissioner made available the inspection reports of nursing homes, a valuable resource for any citizen seeking nursing homes for relatives or who suspects poor treatment of a family member. I thank Mr. Murphy for the work he has done as Information Commissioner over the years and wish Emily O'Reilly the best in her new and well-deserved appointment. Her open opposition to the legislation before the House today is all the more noble considering she knew the Government was sitting in judgment on her application for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" />The Freedom of Information Act was a major step forward in tackling the ingrained culture of secrecy and censorship in this State. RTE will cover my party's Ard-Fheis this weekend for the first time in history. Less than ten years ago it was illegal for Sinn Féin representatives to speak on RTE or any other Irish broadcaster for fear of what we might say and the damage we might do to the establishment of this State. Perhaps, looking over our growth in political strength over the last ten years, the fears were somewhat justified.</P>
    <P>The Government fundamentally fails to understand that these are not its documents. These are not its papers, as they are the property of the people and the Government does not have the right to deny them access. No Government does. This legislation is flawed and I call on Members on the Government benches to reconsider their vote on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I compliment the former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Eithne Fitzgerald, on the immense time and effort she put into the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The House has lost out because she has not been returned since. The principle of freedom of information is simple. It is understood or it is not. It is implemented or it is not. A bit like one's virginity, once lost it is lost forever. While the Government lost its political virginity a long time ago, it is very much losing the principle of freedom of information now because once FOI is watered down it is lost forever. Putting issues on the long finger and suggesting records will be available in ten, 15, 20 or 30 years hence completely destroys the concept of freedom of information, as applied in other countries. This is a real loss to government.</P>
      <P>During my time in local government, meetings were only held <i>in camera</i> on rare occasions. I cannot recall in 11 years when a meeting of Dublin City Council <i>in camera </i>was justified. Nine times out of ten meetings held behind closed doors dealt with conferences attended by members and it would have been more beneficial if those meetings had been held in public. It is regrettable that this step in being taken in this legislation.</P>
      <P>On his election in 1790, John Philpott Curran stated:</P>
      <P>It is the common fate of the indolent to see their rights become a prey to the active. The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance, which condition, if he breaks servitude, is at once the consequence of his crime and the punishment of his guilt.</P>
      <P>We will lose the principle of eternal vigilance with the passage of this legislation. It will be a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somerset Maughan stated, &ldquo;If a nation values anything more than freedom, it will lose its freedom; and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more, it will lose that too.&rdquo;  Other principles are held in much higher regard <Col N="1252" /> than freedom of information and the passage of the Bill will mean a loss to the public.</P>
    <P>The trend around Europe is the introduction of more freedom of information legislation. Sweden has had FOI legislation since 1766 while it is been in place for a slightly shorter time in Ireland. Nonetheless a firm principle has been established, particularly in northern European countries. Many countries guarantee freedom of information in their constitutions. The Swedish constitution states in chapter 2, under fundamental rights and freedoms, that it is guaranteed that government is open and transparent. It has often been said that one can read the post of any Government Minister the day after it is received That principle could be added to the menu of human rights in Ireland and lead to better government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey dismissed the notion that a right wing conspiracy is at work in Ireland. Nonetheless the Government is promoting this legislation even though it has relied heavily on corporate donations to get into office and to fund its mandate. There are dangerous forces at work in terms of the funding of the Government and the rolling back of exemplary legislation that has been promoted over several years.</P>
    <P>I refer to the issue of a fee. I am critical of the concept of paying to receive information. The European Commission has overturned the principle of a fee to makes one's voice heard in the planning process. I have no doubt other international institutions would be critical of the imposition of a fee to receive information. It is a contradiction of the concept. Many local authorities use the fee as a way of reducing the number of requests they receive. I am concerned the Government might impose significant fees to prevent information entering the public domain. The principle of freedom of information is important. One gets it or one does not and if we lose the principle or put it on the backburner or the long finger, all citizens will suffer.</P>

      <P>The golden era of information accessibility, introduced in 1997, is under severe threat due to the Government resisting the FOI, and the very notion of freedom of information has become ossified. This is one of the most retrograde, high-handed and contemptuous Bills ever placed before the House. Only one in ten people trust politicians to tell the truth when in a tight corner, and only 16% trust Governments to put the country's needs above those of their own parties. These figures should worry the Government, since no Government can operate effectively without the trust of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Freedom of information legislation was meant to be the antidote to this, addressing the public's disillusion and disaffection with politics. It signalled a new relationship between citizens and Government but, as a result of this Bill, public trust in Government will sink without trace. New barriers will be erected between the public and their right to information on decisions affecting <Col N="1253" /> their lives. Accountability and transparency have been emasculated to the nth degree.</P>
    <P>The extension of a moratorium on the release of Cabinet papers from five to ten years, together with the restrictions placed on the nature of the material that can be released to the public, underlines the paranoia of the Government as it attempts to suppress information and keep the public in the dark.</P>
    <P>At the annual FOI conference in Dublin Castle last October, the Information Commissioner stated, &ldquo;I am fully satisfied that the provisions of the FOI Act, as they stand, are more than sufficient to protect all the essential interests of government.&rdquo;  This, in light of his experience, provides the real reason for non-consultation with him in the framing of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Cynicism among the public regarding party politicians, which has resulted in paltry turnouts at recent elections, will be further fuelled, with consequent damage to the democratic process, by this regressive denial of people's access to the truth. The crowning insult to the intelligence of the electorate is the attempt by the Minister to portray this legislation as being in the public interest, when certain types of information will be automatically withheld from Deputies, members of the public, print and audio-visual media and other interested persons. Does the Minister consider such types of information subversive? The pre-FOI culture among civil servants dictated the release the minimum amount of information on any issue only when it was unavoidable. It is therefore unsurprising that when a high level committee embarks on a review of legislation governing such information release, the tendency is for it to suppress it and protect its patch to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a fee of &euro;20 per single application, together with the restrictions enshrined in this amended FOI Act, amounts to a contradiction in terms, since the limited information available would be virtually worthless and a waste of money and effort. The value of the FOI Act was clearly demonstrated when the Government's duplicity and its misleading of this House was clearly exposed in letters emanating from the Department of Finance on 26 February and 17 April 2002, which ordered over &euro;32 million to be pared from departmental budgets which had been Voted and approved by the Oireachtas. The game plan for the next general election is already in advanced preparation and nothing is being left to chance, up to and including the suppression of details of the Government's operation from its citizens. Clear democratic standards will only be maintained if there is a commitment to openness, freedom of information and an aversion to the hideous practice of Government secrecy &ndash; none of which this Bill enshrines. The Bill is more suited to a repressive tin-pot dictatorial regime and should be abandoned forthwith.</P>

      <P>In any review which has the expressed intention of establishing the true facts, <Col N="1254" /> it would be expected that all interests would be consulted and their input sought to ensure the review was full, proper and as comprehensive as possible. Therefore, it is regrettable that, in the review of the Freedom of Information Act, all this consultation and seeking of views are absent. The review and the subsequent Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 &ndash; the terms of which are based on the very select committee &ndash; have to be seen as suspect and the reasons for the introduction of the amendment Bill have to be seriously questioned.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the person charged with the operation of the Freedom of Information Act &ndash; the Information Commissioner &ndash; was not asked for his input before the Bill was framed. In his evidence to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, the Information Commissioner made the extraordinary revelation that he only became aware of the existence of the high level committee on the grapevine. A Government that likes to give the impression it is founded on the concept of openness and transparency should have informed the commissioner of its intention to review the Act. His input should have been sought and he should not have been subjected to the humiliation of finding out about the review in that manner. If this review was an open, honest and transparent attempt by the Government to improve the Act for the benefit of all citizens, the Information Commissioner's input should have been sought, even if only for his technical expertise in operating the Act.</P>
      <P>The extension of the terms of the Act to working groups and committees in support of Cabinet is regrettable. Working groups are generally comprised of professionals. Is the Government telling us it does not trust the professionals' advice? Is it saying it wants the opportunity, in secret, to ignore such professional advice if political expediency dictates? I cannot imagine a situation where a professional would have so little confidence in the advice he or she offers that he or she would be afraid of that advice becoming public knowledge.</P>
      <P>We will shortly have a new Information Commissioner and I ask the Government to withdraw the Bill to ensure that her views and those of her office can be ascertained in relation to their technical expertise in operating the Act, before proceeding further. The Government's protestations of openness and transparency are not enough &ndash; actions count, not words. In its handling of this issue, the Government's actions do not live up to the grand ideal.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution to this Bill which has generated a certain amount of controversy in the media. I agree with the Minister for Finance <Col N="1255" /> that many inaccurate and unfair claims have been made about the Government's proposals in recent weeks. I am sure the Minister was not entirely surprised by the reaction in certain quarters and he is to be applauded for his vigorous propositions for the improvements he is making to the Freedom of Information Act. Since the introduction of the original Act, the Government has shown a clear commitment to its implementation and extending its remit. When it was first enacted, freedom of information extended to just 67 organisations or bodies. Some five years on, its provisions have been applied to another 300 organisations. The Government is to be congratulated on this achievement and on its pledge that the Freedom of Information Act will be extended to the remaining suitable bodies by the end of 2005.</P>
      <P>In light of these accomplishments over the last five years, it is absurd to suggest that the Government seeks to impose a culture of secrecy in public life. There could be no more vibrant contradiction of this claim than the frankness and candour the Minister brings to performing his duties in public life. Like all Members, I welcome the contribution freedom of information has made to our public life. However, after five years of operation, it is natural to assess its impact and judge whether there is a need for any changes. It is in that context that it is important to say that the Freedom of Information Act cannot be the benchmark of deciding the conduct of Government affairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister has rightly affirmed his commitment to effective government. This commitment is the driving force and primary motivation behind this Bill. All Governments have a duty of collective responsibility. The Constitution clearly states that the Government shall meet and act as a collective authority. No Cabinet that aspires to effective government can ignore that duty and it is reasonable and sensible to review any legislation that it may feel is undermining that public duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech in the House last night, the Minister correctly identified the work of Government as being complex. In order to be effective, free debate and an exchange of views are essential. Once a decision is taken, differences are set aside and collective responsibility is assumed. Providing unfettered access to the debate that preceded decision-making undermines collective responsibility. I will not list all the pitfalls that exist under the existing legislation &ndash; the Minister did that most capably last night &ndash; but, for the sake of collective responsibility, the Minister is correct to extend the exemption period for records from five to ten years. He is also acting responsibly in extending the remit of exemption to communications between Ministers and also the work of officials and advisers in Government. There is a strong case to be made that, by extending the exemption from five to ten years, we will have more records available to us. There is clear con<Col N="1256" /> cern that there will be less written documentation if the present regulations persist.</P>

      <P>This Bill gives the House an opportunity to debate some of the problems with transport and transport infrastructure. It is regrettable that its proposers are not represented in the House but that is their prerogative. It is probably another one of their efforts to gain cheap publicity at the expense of the Government. The main Opposition parties and Members on this side of the House will have to keep the debate going.</P>
      <P>When discussing transport, it is important to include all forms of transport &ndash; road, rail and air. The Bill proposes to establish a board which would run the entire transport infrastructure of the country. This would be detrimental to the sector. None of us would support handing over the running of road and rail transport to a board. There should always be ministerial responsibility for every Department and all infrastructural projects.</P>
      <P>It is also necessary to continue the roads programme. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, are committed to delivering the proposed infrastructural projects on time. There is a need to take a long hard look at some of the costings for projects and the overruns that occur. If this is not done, we will end up spending enormous amounts of money on projects that are way over budget. The value to the communities they will serve is important but some are over budget. We see this every day in public projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably time to examine the mechanisms used. There has been much talk about the port tunnel recently. I had the pleasure of visiting the project and seeing the work being done. When it was explained by the NRA and those working on the tunnel, I understood where the costs were arising. Acquiring the property needed for the <Col N="1257" /> structure and the ancillary facilities that have to be provided have led to the extra costs. In the case of Luas, the proposed metro and other projects, however, it is time to take a close look at the cost of compensation for the property needed for the provision of these services in the city.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to put many of the proposed national road and motorway projects out to tender as large contracts such as the Kinnegad to Kilcock road is the proper way to proceed with these infrastructural projects. Make them as large as possible in order that there will be maximum tendering. In many cases we will discover that along the way rock or other such materials might become available which help to reduce the costs and inconvenience to those living in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>Infrastructural projects will always cause problems for some but we cannot continue with a transport network that cannot serve our needs. In this regard, it is worth looking at rail transport and rail freight transport. If there is to be any shake up in the sector, it will have to be done by the private sector. Iarnród Éireann will have to be asked to make available to those who want to become involved in rail transport the necessary background information and the necessary rail time, that is, the times that railway lines are left unused. A number of lines are only used for half the 24 hours in the day. I hope this will be examined.</P>
    <P>The Bill has much to recommend it but the Minister who has taken over this brief is entitled to have an opportunity to deliver before his stewardship should be questioned, which is what the Bill does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be churlish not to acknowledge the efforts of the Green Party in bringing this legislation before the House. Nobody can deny the contribution its Members make to ensuring the issue of transport is always to the forefront of policy debate. Everybody is committed to a transport policy, even if we differ as to how it should be introduced.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to improving our transport system was demonstrated by the establishment of the Department of Transport last June. Responsibility for roads and public transport was brought together from two separate Departments. The Department of Transport now fulfils many of the objectives set out in the Bill. I do not believe the establishment of the type of authority proposed in it would bring about the necessary reforms. The RPA has the task of developing the Luas and the metro while the NRA has the task of developing our road system. At a time when it is necessary to focus on our transport needs the last thing that is needed is institutional upheaval. It is time for action, not more legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NRA and RPA are in place. The latter is not long established and we should give it time to work. I welcome the Minister's commitment to the establishment of an independent regulator for <Col N="1258" /> public transport and his intention to appoint a regulator for transport outside the Dublin area. All Members are committed to accountability but the Bill before the House would remove virtually all policy formulation from the Government of the day. The Department must remain responsible to the House for the strategies assigned to the agencies. It should be noted that the existing bodies are accountable to Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is considering the introduction of a special infrastructural Bill which will deal with issues of land ownership with regard to critical infrastructure. The appeals process, while necessary, can be unduly time consuming while our infrastructural needs are urgent. We also must not forget that time is money in this case. I compliment the Minister on his work since taking office. I have no doubt of the seriousness of his commitment and that of the Minister of State to our transport needs.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the NRA's funding for Cork city and county. A sum of &euro;130 million has been spent in Cork city over the last five years while &euro;350 million has been spent in Cork county on roads projects. These include the Jack Lynch tunnel, the Blackpool bypass, Ballincollig bypass, Watergrasshill, the South Link Road and Mallow Road roadworks, to name a few. In addition, the Youghal bypass will be opened by the Minister next week.</P>
    <P>The rail service in Cork is also improving, with 67 new mainline rail carriages being assigned to the Cork-Dublin line. The Cork-Cobh line will receive four new carriages and I am hoping the long awaited development at Kent Station will begin. Perhaps the chairman of the CIE board is listening because we are waiting a long time for that development to start. He assured me at a recent meeting that he had plans to get it started as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I must also acknowledge the work of Bus Éireann in Cork. I have spoken in the House on several occasions about the improvement in public transport in Cork. Since 2000, for example, it has received 54 additional new buses. I believe almost all the Cork bus fleet has been replaced by now. There are also new park and ride facilities and bus priority lanes. Much is happening in this regard in the Cork city and county area. Without the NRA and the commitment of the Department, through CIE, to getting work done and improving transport infrastructure, Cork would be in a sorry state.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I congratulate the Green Party on having introduced it. Public transport is an issue that the Green Party has pushed since the party's inception and I recognise that the issue has always been at the forefront of that party's policy. Many years ago on the city council the Green Party always discussed public transport needs at length.</P>
      <P>The idea of a National Transport Authority sounds good but the Bill is somewhat flawed because I do not see how it will deliver much of what is required. I do not see how it will deliver what the NRA or the RPA are delivering and, even though we may criticise those bodies, I see a significant improvement taking place in Dublin's public transport over the next few years.</P>
      <P>We have always sought a three-pronged approach to traffic in the capital involving better public transport, roads and traffic management. We are heading in that direction although I would agree that progress has been slow. We should not divert ourselves from what is happening at the moment, however. For example, we will have the Luas on-line along with significant improvements in the DART service, which were announced a few days ago. Similarly, significant improvements will be taking place in Dublin Bus which deserves to be congratulated on the work it is doing. The number of people using buses has increased because people's perception of the bus service has improved enormously in the last few years. In addition, investments are being made in the suburban rail system which needs to be improved.</P>
      <P>The M50 continues to be developed in addition to the Dublin Port tunnel. Some members of the Joint Committee on Transport recently visited the port tunnel which is an exciting engineering project. I would recommend anybody to have a look at it because it is fantastic and will make an improvement by reducing the number of trucks using the city centre. Getting trucks out of the city centre has been a goal of everyone who has been elected to Dublin City Council over many years and now we will see that coming about with major improvements as a result. Once we get 6,000 to 7,000 trucks out of the city centre every day by using the tunnel we will be able to introduce many more traffic management improvements.</P>
      <P>Quality bus corridors and the work that Dublin City Council is doing to co-ordinate traffic lights constitute part of the improvements taking place in the city's traffic management system. There is a will on the part of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, to try to deliver on the significant investment that has been put in place both by the current Government and the previous one, in order to bring about improvements in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one way or another, approximately 30 different groups are involved in traffic management in <Col N="1260" /> Dublin city. I did not believe that figure at first, until I saw them all listed. That is a ludicrous situation and some people may say that I am arguing for an umbrella body such as the proposed national transport authority. The Minister has proposed the idea of an independent regulator who will be able to do much of what is required. We need co-ordination so that people will know what is happening. One of the main criticisms is that nobody knows what is going on, even though a great deal is happening. The general public would be more positive if it was told about the investments that are being made and the consequent improvements that will take place in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Green Party for introducing the Bill. I know what it is like because I did it when I was in Opposition. A lot of work goes into it and one does not have the backup of the Civil Service. I congratulate the party for starting a debate on the issue.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming this Bill and I commend the Green Party/Comhaontas Glas for having introduced it. While I do not have the same experience of the House as the previous speaker, I know that the preparation of a Bill &ndash; particularly without the support the Government parties have &ndash; is an onerous task. While commending the Green Party on the Bill, I must question certain elements of the legislation. For example, the Bill abolishes the functions of the existing agencies, in particular the NRA and the RPA, without replacing them. Section 4 authorises several roles for the proposed authority but at the same time it removes powers from both of the authorities to which I referred, without apparently replacing them. In addition, there are no financial provisions in the Bill. We are all aware of the massive investment and progress that has been made in transport infrastructure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy's co-operative approach. Having worked in the constituency with him for some time, I know that his input is always positive. I thank him for that further education in the ways of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may not be directly related to the Bill, I would make a point concerning the financial activities of the NRA. Without going into the figures, we are all aware that massive investment is being made available to the NRA for the significant work it is undertaking. However, massive cost overruns appear to be a consistent theme of every contract undertaken by the NRA. It is something that we will have to examine and keep a close eye on. I know the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="1261" /> McDaid, are introducing measures in this regard. I would refer particularly to the port tunnel where there has been a significant cost overrun. While there are particular circumstances pertaining to that project, nevertheless the cost overrun is extravagant.</P>
    <P>I referred to the progress being made nationally with regard to investment in transport infrastructure projects. The constituency of Dublin North, which I have the honour of representing with Deputy Sargent, is a good example and probably presents us with a microcosm of what is going on nationally. The constituency includes Dublin Airport where a massive expansion is taking place. The port tunnel entrance is approximately a mile from the constituency boundary. The M1 motorway, which hopefully will be opened in the next few months, will provide a motorway facility from Whitehall church to a few miles south of Dundalk. Significant ongoing investment is being made in the suburban railway infrastructure, development of quality bus corridors is ongoing throughout the city and into the county and taxi deregulation in recent years has had positive effects. The one element of transport infrastructure deficient in the constituency is a sea port, but there is one only a few miles from it. All these areas of infrastructure have been the subject of massive investment and progress. This progress has also created a great expectation among the public of an improvement in services.</P>
    <P>I commend the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, on introducing this Bill. However, I have no difficulty in opposing it. With so much ongoing work in progress, I do not consider that a change in the structures in which our transport infrastructure is administered is appropriate at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to participate in this debate. I thank the Green Party for bringing this Bill before the House. However, it has many shortcomings. As a city Deputy, I recognise, as I am sure does every other Deputy, that there are severe transport problems in Dublin and in many parts of the country. Traffic jams are evident even in villages. If one were to travel from Dublin to Athlone, Limerick or Cavan, one would encounter traffic jams.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the shortcomings of public transport. I am a great believer in the saying, &ldquo;If it ain't broken, don't fix it.&rdquo;  The NRA has done a tremendous job in regard to our roads. I compliment, Michael Tobin, the chief executive officer of the NRA, on that. He has always made himself accessible and available to Members of this House. He has come before committees of the House and explained what the NRA is doing and he keeps us very well informed of its work. The same could be said of John Lynch and Joe Meagher, the managing director of Iarnród Éireann, who meet Members of this House on a monthly basis to update them on what is happening in regard to the bus and rail services.</P>

      <P>No, I have no interest whatsoever. I am a former employee of Telecom Éireann. I never worked in CIE and I have no interest to declare in it. I compliment a person when he or she does a good job. It is right and proper to acknowledge that in the appropriate place. That is all I am doing.</P>
      <P>Investment is important and we must invest in our roads and other infrastructure. The Green Party should explain to its colleagues in the European forum in particular the importance of having in place a proper road infrastructure because there is a perception that the Green Party is anti-development. I ask its members to support measures to allow us to build roads. Groups with whom the Green Party is associated sometimes appear to make frivolous objections to road building. It is necessary to have good roads in that there is no point in having good buses or cars if we do not have good roads on which to drive. That seems to be a major problem for the Green Party. It may have valid reasons for objecting to proposals, and we all object to proposals from time to time, but it is important that the party takes account of that point.</P>
      <P>The Bill introduced by the Green Party appears to indicate that we do not have a proper public transport service, in other words, that the service we have is completely inadequate, but that is not the case. I do not know if the party got information which I got from Iarnród Éireann lately &ndash; I have no vested interest in this but I have a vested interest for my constituents &ndash; which outlines that it is spending &euro;400 million on the DART service from Howth Station to Dún Laoghaire. That will involve improving all the stations, extending the platforms and making them more accessible and user friendly for people with disabilities, which is a welcome development. Many improvements are taking place.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann's customer base increased by 13% or 14% in the past year. That indicates it is providing a fairly good service to the public. I compliment the company on that.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on taking the right approach. He is not lying back but taking the bull by the horns and making decisions. That is what government is all about.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. Like my colleagues, I compliment the Green Party on bringing forward this Bill, if for nothing else than it promotes debate in this House on the important issue of transport policy. Unfortunately, during Private Members' time we have not had that sort of debate. Recognising its great interest in issues of public transport and transportation infrastructure, it surprises me that the Green Party does not have a representative on the transport committee as this is currently probably the greatest single area of <Col N="1263" /> public policy incorporating the biggest investment this country has ever seen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It disappoints me that the Green Party does not have an input into that committee, although there may be reasons for it.  </P>
      <P>My main difficulty with this legislation is that it simply seeks to remove major areas of responsibility from the Department of Transport at a time when the Government has specifically identified transport as the main issue of public policy. Such was its commitment to this important issue that a great deal of reorganisation was commenced at the formation of the Government to set up a completely new Department of Transport specifically to isolate all the various areas of policy, departments and organisations which deal with this issue and bring them under the responsibility of a single Minister. In that regard, like my colleagues, I compliment the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, on many of their courageous and, if at times unpopular, initiatives in relation to transport issues.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this Bill is completely mistimed. We are in the process of spending over &euro;7 billion on transportation infrastructure. To reorganise the whole transportation infrastructure, no matter how well intentioned and laudable that might be, is impracticable in the midst of the largest ever investment in infrastructure.</P>
      <P>For the reasons stated by my fellow colleagues, there is an unfortunate overlapping of responsibility in the proposed structures set out in the Bill in terms of the Department of Transport, which would not work in practice. I do not mean to be overly critical of the Bill, but it contains seven sections, extending to five pages. While I recognise that the Deputies opposite do not have available to them the resources of the parliamentary counsel in the Attorney General's office for the drafting of Bills, to have a seven section Bill passed by this House to administer a multiannual budget is unfortunate to say the least.</P>
      <P>While I respect the right of the Green Party to make proposals and to differ vehemently with Government policy, I vehemently defend the Government's right to make policy in this area. The Government was elected with a definite mandate on transport issues and the Government intends to follow through on that mandate whether it is popular or not.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, while I compliment the Green Party for introducing the Bill, it would be better served by concentrating on the real issues of public transport policy, such as public private partnerships. I advise the Green Party to initiate a debate on that at some future date.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Crawford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" />I am happy to indicate the Labour Party's support for the principles in this Bill and to commend the Green Party on drafting and presenting it. The principles underpinning the Bill are sound. It is true to say that transport policy has been dogged for some years by the twin problems of under-investment and lack of co-ordination. Too often we see decisions taken in respect of transport projects which are politically motivated rather than the outcome of a long-term planning process. It is because there is no such forum to consider a wide range of transport and road needs that the Green Party is proposing such an authority. In the past we have seen, particularly with road building, that while the NRA is charged with performing a certain function, all too often critical decisions are made relating to significant expenditure on roads projects which have little to do with cost-benefit analysis of such projects or long-term, planned regional growth. More often such decisions relate to political exigencies in particular areas during elections.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that while the NRA makes proposals to Government, at the end of the day the Government plucks out those projects it wants to pursue and there is little accountability to the public on the return to the taxpayer from such projects. A National Transport Authority could perform the important roles of assessing proposed projects, looking at the economic, social and environmental benefits and evaluating whether a project fits in with the overall plan for transport. While in theory the NRA may partly fill that role, it is not the body which finally decides which project gets the go-ahead. No similar body looks at the public transport situation, which is scattered among different State agencies, private providers, interest groups and so on. There is no-one to oversee what is happening in public transport.</P>
    <P>This kind of scatter-gun approach to planning and decision making is nowhere more evident than in Dublin. The Government has recognised this for some time but has failed to do anything. It is a long-standing promise of this Administration and its predecessor to set up a greater Dublin land use and public transport authority but we have yet to see any action being taken. It was on the list of promised legislation for 2002 and for 2003 but has now been put back to 2004. Meanwhile things are happening and there is an urgent need to co-ordinate transport services. However, no structural changes are being made and there is no evidence of preparatory work to establish such a body. The Minister can shake his head all he likes but that body is now two years overdue. There is no sign of heads of legislation being approved or any other indication of the Government's thinking on the governance of such an authority.</P>
    <P>The disaster of Dublin traffic gridlock clearly shows the need for greater public transport investment and for planning to relate transport provision to land use. It shows the clear failure of private solutions, particularly the unrestricted use <Col N="1265" /> of the private car and the over-emphasis on road building in Dublin over many years. There has been a sea change in public attitudes on these issues over the last five to ten years. We are attached to our cars, to having the radio on and to controlling our own space. We have privacy and we do not have to wait for a bus or train. However, the public has increasingly come to realise that this is not sustainable in Dublin in the long-term. The solution must be greater investment in public transport and encouraging people to shift to public transport, but we have not been successful in doing so for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>There is a serious difficulty in the political leadership in the Department of Transport, particularly with the Minister's view of public transport. He is a person who tends to take quite a right wing view of most issues and he is carrying that through in the Department of Transport. He has a major ideological hang-up on the competition issue, irrespective of the experience of other European countries or the appropriateness of his market-led thinking to transport. He also has a serious difficulty with accepting the principle that if we are to have effective public transport then it must be heavily subsidised. Throughout Europe, every city with a good public transport system enjoys heavy subvention by national Government for that system. The average subvention is 50% and in some cases it is 70% to 80%. We have discussed this in recent months and the Minister has made it clear that this is not the route he intends to take. He does not propose to follow the European model in spite of the fact that he, the Joint Committee on Transport and others often look to the experiences of other countries for examples to follow. How do they get it right and make their transport systems sustainable? The underlying principle for those systems is a commitment on behalf of the Governments involved to public transport <i>per se.</i>The Minister provides subvention reluctantly and recently said how worrying it was that the subvention rate was creeping up to between 20% and 25%. He was concerned that the rate was worryingly high. This is not the kind of ideology &ndash; where one resents funding &ndash; which will bring about a good public transport system. The Minister does not accept that principle. He says there is a private solution to a public transport problem and that does not add up.</P>

      <P>We would like Ireland and our capital city to operate like any other modern European city. This requires sustainable public transport and Government commitment to make it work, which is clearly not the case here. There is real concern that the Minister is about to embark on a course of action which would hive off more and more parts of the public transport system to the private market. He regards transport as a commodity, rather than a critical element of social infrastructure.</P>
      <P>There are a number of principles to which we should adhere in respect of public transport policy, the first of which is sustainability. It is fair to say that a transport policy based on ever greater use of the private motor car is unsustainable in environmental terms.</P>
      <P>Another principle which must be accepted and adopted in respect of public transport is social inclusion, about which the Taoiseach talks a great deal. Let us have some action in respect of the public transport system. Public transport must be understood as a right. Everyone has a right to move around his or her capital city. Even in boom times large numbers of people do not have access to private cars and even larger numbers do not own a car. Some groups, for example, the young and the old, will always be restricted in their car usage. Nobody should be forced to make an enormous private investment just to move around his or her city.</P>
      <P>The other principle which must be accepted is urban citizenship. It is fair to expect that Dublin, a national capital, should be a city people can identify with and in which they can enjoy living and a city of which they can be proud, none one of which can be said of Dublin. This is due to the daily traffic chaos in the city and the huge difficulty people experience in getting from A to B, whether this entails standing on packed buses, waiting long periods on a bus in the morning, standing on one of the urban trains on which people are packed in like sardines or being refused access to the Dart because it is full and there is insufficient capacity.</P>

      <P>In most people's books, such chaos does not allow for an acceptable lifestyle or for living in a city of which people can be proud. We should be trying to ensure we have a city that works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point to be made in respect of the need for co-ordination in the greater Dublin area is that the failure of the long promised legislation to materialise highlights the hopeless weakness of our local government. Local government that functions properly has responsibility for transport, as is the case in most European cities. We <Col N="1267" /> have a crazy system here where it has virtually no powers or role in transport. Although the local authorities in the Dublin area have responsibility for certain traffic matters, they have very little responsibility in terms of enforcement and none whatsoever in terms of transport services.</P>
    <P>Due to the weakness of local government, the Government is encountering difficulties in proposing the establishment of a greater Dublin transport authority. What role, for example, would public representatives play in such a body? Will the Minister establish another authority operating in parallel to the local authorities in the greater Dublin area or will he try to combine them? The obvious approach would be to establish a greater Dublin local authority with responsibility for transport. It is vital that local government is reformed to ensure local issues are taken care of locally.</P>
    <P>I turn to a number of other areas in which the Minister has been extremely negligent. Last night he stated that the programme for Government already contains plans for a forum similar to the authority proposed by the Green Party. The programme for Government contains a large number of bullet points on transport. At a glance, about half of these have not been implemented or little action has been taken on them. The Minister suggests this is a grand plan. It is not a plan, but a series of issues plucked from the air in the run-up to the election.</P>

      <P>The Minister promised to promote integrated ticketing and smart card technologies. What is the reality now? There will be a pilot programme in 2005. We will not hold our breath on that promise. He also promised to introduce legislation to establish a greater Dublin transport authority in 2002. There is no sign of the Bill in question because it has been postponed for two years. He promised further progress on upgrading the bus fleet and the inter-changeability of commuter tickets on bus and rail. No progress has been made in that regard to date.</P>
      <P>He said new services would be introduced to some new housing developments and poorly served communities. We know what the Minister's game is in respect of bus services. He has adopted a policy of restricting public service bus companies when they attempt to set up new services by putting them off or refusing to approve new routes because he wants to open up the market to allow in certain interests, in which he is interested.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for the opportunity to speak on the Bill and commend the Green Party on introducing it and giving us the opportunity to discuss the vital issue of transport. The issue of changes to bus services brings to mind the changes in County Cavan where the introduction of a private bus service resulted in the removal of the available service and had a very negative impact on bus users. I ask the Minister to address this issue about which many Members have contacted him.</P>
      <P>The debate tonight is about traffic chaos. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, will be aware of the changes in the journey time from Donegal to Dublin using the N2 or N3. Congestion now means one must add an extra few hours rather than minutes to the journey. Anything that would improve these roads would be helpful, as those of us living in counties Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal depend on the road network.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, after ten years, the N2 is starting to move. I will only be satisfied when work begins on all three bypasses. We were given guarantees that the minute the consultants' plans for the bypasses were ready, all three would begin to roll. We were told money would not be a problem, yet suddenly we find it is a major problem. Before the election, the Minister for Finance stated there would be no cutbacks. We now know the reality. However, I accept and appreciate that the decision to give one of the bypasses the go-ahead is progress.</P>
      <P>I heard a spokesman for the National Roads Authority speaking on the Northern Sound radio station the other day. It is very strange that the reporter was able to obtain more information on the current position of the roads programme in counties Cavan and Monaghan than Members can obtain in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one problem with the Bill, it is that it does not make the new authority answerable to the House. I propose that amendments be made on Committee Stage to ensure we can hold the Minister accountable. The Minister is only a short time in office but I presume at this stage he has opened some bypasses and roads. It is strange that a Minister for Transport, or Minister for the Environment, as he would have been called in the past, has no responsibility for the National Roads Authority when we put down questions to him, <Col N="1269" /> yet any time there is an opportunity to be seen&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister examine the possibility of park and ride facilities? It is ludicrous that people like me have to travel on the M2, arrive at the M50 and drive on a single lane from that junction into Dublin city with an empty lane beside us for the bus service. That bus lane could be used properly with the provision of a park and ride facility which would avoid much of the chaos in the city centre. If there were nine or ten park and ride systems around the perimeter of the city, many problems would be avoided. I urge the Minister to give consideration to that suggestion, not just for the sake of the people of Dublin but also for those of us in rural Ireland who have to travel into the centre of Dublin for business reasons.</P>

      <P>I commend the Green Party for using its Private Members' time to bring forward this legislation. As my colleague, Deputy Crowe, stated during this debate, it is not without flaws but it is a progressive attempt to tackle the issue of transport in Ireland or, I should say, in the Twenty-six Counties because missing from this legislation, as from the Government's plans for transport, is any meaningful emphasis on building an all-Ireland transport network. I find it ironic that the Enterprise service from Dublin to Belfast has the most modern and efficient carriages. This is an example of the kind of transportation system we could build if the Northern Assembly focused on the issue. When I see the horror on the faces of those who take the Dublin to Cork train at certain times of the week, where they are placed together like cattle in dangerously unsafe circumstances, I am grateful for the co-operation that makes the Enterprise system possible.</P>
      <P>As I said in this House previously, the Enterprise is not without its faults. At peak times in the morning it too can be grossly overcrowded and I have made the comment that if animals were on board, Compassion in World Farming would probably block the line demanding more humane conditions. Notwithstanding that, I commend the Minister for the 80 rail cars we hope will come on-stream this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" />We look forward to that addition on the line but it can be expanded. There is a clear case to be made for the construction of a rail link, for example, from Dublin to Derry, as Deputy Crawford has suggested. Not only would this have obvious benefits for the Border counties of Cavan and Monaghan, as he and others have said, but it would also have benefits across the Border and in the isolated parts of the north-west. Somebody told me earlier that in terms of the public transport system, and particularly the rail system, the old map used to be a map of partition so there is much to be done in the Assembly on that front.</P>
    <P>For isolated towns and villages along the Border, the provision of an integrated transport service with an integrated ticketing procedure makes much sense. Not only would I encourage the Government to move in that direction, I suggest the Green Party should widen the scope of its thinking on transport to an all-Ireland basis.</P>
    <P>I note that the Greens will soon contest elections to the Assembly. I welcome that and hope that some of the other parties in this House have that ambition some day and, dare I say it, Nationalist parties because sometimes I wonder about them.</P>

      <P>The need for greater cohesion in transport matters was outlined last night. I accept the point the Minister made that the setting up of a Department of Transport is a positive step in that direction but it is not enough. In Dublin, for example, we have the Dublin Transportation Office, the National Roads Authority, Dublin City Council and the Department of Transport all involved at one level or another. Each organisation has its own analysis and interpretation on transport. Each wishes to guard its own patch. There appears to be a profusion of consultancy groups, quangos and three-letter acronyms regarding transport. In regard to the Dublin Port tunnel, Dublin City Council set the standard height for a tunnel at 4.65 metres. The NRA, to whom the tunnel will be handed over on completion, has set the clearance on its motorways at 5.3 metres. It is this type of slip-shod communication between groups that makes the need for a joint authority all the more clear. In the Government's tendency towards the construction of roads, we face a danger that public transport might be about to revert to its status as a poor relation in the public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any move, as proposed in this Bill, to establish an authority that will <Col N="1271" /> properly co-ordinate and develop a transport infrastructure in this State. If I were to pick any aspect of the proposal with which I find fault, it is that it does not take into account the need for an all-Ireland dimension. It is ridiculous that an island such as ours should have two transport agencies operating out of sync and it is vital that this be addressed in future to ensure optimum co-operation and the provision of public transport in rural areas, which are currently badly served by the transport authorities in both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>Another change I would like to see is much greater input from local communities. This could be catered for in section 4(<i>c</i>), which refers to the development of local area framework plans. Without doubt local authorities have a crucial role to play in transport planning but as a local elected representative, I am also aware of the direct input of communities and the valuable contribution they can make. This is particularly important where communities believe they are badly served by existing public transport and where the local population is best placed to inform the relative authorities on how best to implement improvements.</P>
      <P>All of this is dependent on funding available under the national plans, which currently include the national development plan and the national spatial strategy. While both of these were launched with great fanfare, they have already been shown to have serious flaws and this has led to a rowing back of plans to develop, in particular, the road network in different parts of our country.</P>
      <P>While much is being made of the designation of Killarney and Tralee as hubs to assist in the attraction of industry to Kerry and the south-west, in general such plans will be fatally undermined if the road infrastructure is inadequate and if the public transport system cannot cope with the demand. That will remain the case if the Government intends to solve the current financial difficulties by cutting back on the provision of these services. While we must have a coherent transport plan and an integrated authority as proposed in this Bill, we must also ensure that the funding is made available to provide for the necessary infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major flaw in the rail system in Kerry is that it only serves Killarney and Tralee. As in any other area of the country, and indeed to follow the example of the proposed transport plans for the greater Dublin area, a feasibility study should be done on the prospect of expanding the rail-based system in Kerry. The whole of north Kerry from Tralee north is cut off. I am aware that over 30 years ago the line was closed down and abandoned completely only in the past two years. That is a mistake and it is something that is probably contributing greatly towards the lack of economic investment in the north Kerry area. There is a progressive business community in Listowel which built access units out of its own pockets to attract industry to the area. The main reason <Col N="1272" /> industry is not coming into the area is the condition of the M69 on which representatives of all parties in this House have worked to the best of their ability to try to get the National Roads Authority to deal with that problem. There is no railway link to connect it to Tralee, Limerick or anywhere else outside the county.</P>
    <P>I represent a rural constituency and I am aware of the importance of the public transport system to local communities. People who live in isolated areas are highly dependent on it to get to work, to get children to school, to shop and to socialise. I believe in the basic principle that any person living in any part of the State, urban or rural, is entitled to the same level of public service. Everyone pays the same tax and is, therefore, entitled to the same basic services. That should apply to transport as much as to anything else. It must be the fundamental aim of any national transport authority that this should be the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I would like the points I have made to be taken into account later in the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and compliment the Green Party on the Bill. There is an acceptance that the public has a right to public transport, irrespective of where they live, even if it means that it has to be subsidised. People in Dublin, Clonmel and Ballyporeen all have the same right to public transport. Transport systems, be they road or rail, must not be concentrated in large urban areas in the east of the country.</P>
      <P>There should be an integrated authority to deal with public transport. The chief executive and the chairman of Iarnród Éireann recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport to discuss the company's proposals, including the closure of railway lines. Members of the committee asked the executives to explain what would happen to the commercial freight that would have to go on to road as a result. We were told in a glib way that it is nothing to do with Iarnród Éireann, it is a matter for the National Roads Authority. That is not good enough. Closing railway lines and forcing huge numbers of lorries on to a poor road network is unworkable. There was a proposal to close the railway from Limerick Junction to Rosslare, forcing 80 heavy trucks to take the road from south Wexford to Mallow. It would be impossible for 80 trucks a day to travel on that route yet the executives of Iarnród Éireann were able to say it was not their responsibility.</P>
      <P>Transport facilities in rural areas are much poorer than those in urban areas. Many people in small towns or villages do not own cars or have access to them. They are dependent on neighbours and friends to bring them into the local doctor, post office or shops. We need a rural transport system that links these small towns and villages and the outlying areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road tolls are a form of taxation. The Minister for Transport recently approved the building of a <Col N="1273" /> road that will be tolled and tolls will increasingly be a feature of our roads. They are simply a form of general taxation on the motoring public who are already paying more than their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>The state of the county road network must be addressed. Many county roads are in poor condition &ndash; they are covered potholes with heavy growth on either side and they need to be strengthened. In recent years the amount of money going to the reconstruction and the upkeep of county roads has been insufficient. People living in rural areas deserve a reasonable roads system.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Green Party for introducing this Bill and I will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the work the Green Party has put into developing this legislation. There is a consensus in the House that the integration of our transport policy is a high priority. The formation of the Department of Transport at the beginning of the Government was the foremost step in bringing that together.</P>
      <P>The Green Party is suggesting that setting up one new group on top of the 23 existing groups will pull them all together. That is exactly why the Department of Transport was set up &ndash; to pull everything together instead of setting up another national authority. The establishment of a new national transport authority does not, as is suggested by the Bill, represent a step forward in thinking in this matter. The functions allocated to the new authority under this Bill overlap with those of the new Department of Transport. They are mainly policy issues that should be the responsibility of the Minister, the Government of the day and this House rather than being allocated to another appointed board.</P>
      <P>This issue was dealt with comprehensively by Minister for Transport last night. He intends to establish an independent regulator for public transport in the greater Dublin area initially and, in due course, throughout the rest of the State. However, the Government must continue to have overall responsibility for policy matters. The abolition of those agencies could only lead to further unnecessary delay in completion of the respective projects and, no doubt, that would lead to further criticism from the Members opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, time does not permit me to read my prepared speech in full, but copies are being circulated to Deputies. I wish to refer to some points which were raised during the debate. Taking a totally political approach, I would point out to Deputy Shortall that, between 1994 and 1996, the parties opposite did not put one penny of capital investment into CIE. Currently, we are putting &euro;500 million into that company, of which &euro;400 million is in the form of capital investment on an annual basis, amounting to &euro;2.4 billion over the past six years. With reference to the Deputy's comparison between Ireland and Europe, of <Col N="1274" /> course our situation is totally unlike that in Europe, where there is a rail system connecting Stockholm to Rome and Warsaw to Madrid.</P>
    <P>It was argued that the Minister for Transport is pro-privatisation. Deputy Shortall's party adopted the same position in relation to Aer Lingus, arguing that, as a State company, it should not be touched. One cannot ignore what has happened to the entire aviation industry in the meantime. The Deputy's arguments with regard to rail transport simply do not stand up, having regard to past experience with Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the roads network. Anybody who has listened to traffic reports from AA Roadwatch over a period cannot be unaware of the fact that bottlenecks which formerly occurred at places such as Leixlip and Knocklyon, if memory serves me correctly, are no longer featuring in those reports. Granted, they may have been replaced by other bottleneck points such as Sandyford. However, once the legal issue in relation to the motorway at Carrickmines has been resolved, Sandyford and other such locations will also be removed from AA Roadwatch reports. Yesterday, the Minister announced expenditure of &euro;320 million for the Kilcock to Kinnegad by-pass and other projects which will relieve the most notorious set of bottlenecks in the country over a distance of 39 kilometres. All of those improvements will come to pass in due course &ndash; it takes time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford made an excellent point, on which I commend him, that bus lanes should be extended further out from the city. Deputy Morgan and others referred to the Dublin Port tunnel project. Monitoring over a six months period has shown 98% of traffic is within the limits which the tunnel can accommodate. The NITL has now undertaken a further six week monitoring programme, on which a report will be available at the end of this month. When the tunnel is completed, the journey from the M50 to the port will take a maximum of seven minutes.</P>

      <P>I will answer the Deputy at another time. Having regard to developments since 1996, the views of economic and regional development interests, and the importance of high quality. inter-urban road links between the main urban centres in supporting economic and social development and achieving more balanced regional development, the Government decided to provide for the upgrading of five key routes to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard in their entirety. The Minister has also prioritised safety on our roads. In the course of a meeting with the Italian Minister yesterday, I learned that only 11% of road accidents in that country <Col N="1275" /> occur on the motorways. The statistics in other parts of the European Union are consistent with that.</P>

      <P>I have listened with some interest to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid. I found a couple of references in his script quite funny, including his belief that there is not much difference between the thinking behind the Green Party proposals and current Government policy. In my opinion, the difference is about the same as that between George Bush and Gandhi. Before the last election, my colleagues, Deputies Ryan and Cuffe, advocated diverting expenditure from roads to rail. However, as I am not my party's spokesperson on the environment or transport, I will stay with my own remit, tourism. As a former Minister for Tourism, the Minister of State will have noticed that the length of stay in Ireland decreased by 20% in the July to September period last year. That is a very worrying trend, for which there is a number of reasons, including rising prices, the perceived lack of service and access to land issues.</P>
      <P>Another significant factor is the difficulty for tourists to get around this country by public transport, as distinct from hiring a car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>People may take the train from Dublin to Killarney or Galway, but if they wish to travel along the western seaboard from Donegal to Galway to Killarney, it is virtually impossible. While there is a bus service, I would describe it as a skeleton service which is not worthy of a first world country. From that perspective, an overseeing body would change the priorities by taking an integrated view of train and bus services and road traffic issues. If it takes a holistic, strategic, long-term view, it will not put the emphasis on roads, in line with the Government's policy <i>vis-à-vis </i>the NRA. Separate bodies, working in isolation, greatly facilitate a Government with no vision. On the other hand, under the auspices of a body with a long-term strategic view as to the best integrated transport system for this country, I believe rail transport would be recognised as a <Col N="1276" /> much more cost-effective option. As my colleagues have already stated, we support the idea of a western rail link.</P>
      <P>I now turn to matters closer to home. The Minister of State referred to AA Roadwatch reports. My constituency, Dublin Mid-West, features very prominently in those reports. However, there is a wider issue. Leixlip, to which the Minister of State referred, has a rail service. Lucan, one of the fastest growing towns according to the last census, does not have such a service and does not seem likely to have it within the next few years, despite talk of a railway station being provided in Lucan south. Iarnród Éireann has received no guarantees from the Government with regard to the required funding. Developments at Adamstown, in the Lucan area, could involve up to 10,000 additional houses. If that takes place without the necessary infrastructure, major chaos will follow.</P>
      <P>There is a need to fast-track an outer orbital ring route and to build cost-effective by-passes at various locations around the country. That is not in question, but the huge emphasis on road development is in question. That will simply create more congestion in urban areas whereas, on the other hand, it is a total waste of money to build large scale motorway developments which will not reach capacity for 20 years. The answer lies in a combination of rail and bus services. From a tourism perspective and based on my experience of living in a congested constituency, I submit that if one is trying to develop vast areas of land in an integrated fashion, one must ensure that the transport infrastructure is provided. The DTO is taking a piecemeal approach towards local authorities, with a tendency not to cross borders. For example, Kildare County Council does not work well with South Dublin County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to integrate transportation. At present, four fifths of new transportation funding is going into roads. We suggest that 20% for public transport is not good enough and we need to reverse the allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" />First and foremost, we need to reform the institutions. We believe that an umbrella body such as the proposed transportation authority would help unite the plethora of transportation agencies that exist. This is a problem that we discussed ten years ago when the National Roads Authority was introduced under the 1993 roads Act. At that time we said there was a real danger that roads would receive the vast bulk of funding and that public transport would be the poor relation, receiving only the crumbs of the transportation cake. That prophesy has proven to be true and today public transport is lagging dramatically behind roads investment.</P>
    <P>Fifteen years ago when the Government commissioned a study into the Harcourt St. line, people were building extensions and garages on that line. The Government commissioned a study and those people are now receiving millions of euro in compensation for giving up the property they occupied. The Government did not take the initiative then and we are concerned that the Minister is still not taking the initiative with public transportation.</P>
    <P>We believe that the NRA is an outdated body, that its terms of reference are wrong. We believe that its &ldquo;predict and provide&rdquo; approach makes ostriches look well informed by comparison. The legislation is ten years old. It fails to take into account the Kyoto Protocol. It fails to take into account recent thinking on transportation planning. It appears to take its cue from the 1950s interstate highway programme in the USA. We need to look towards modern European planning which integrates public transportation, land use planning and roads provision. We have yet to see evidence of this and we believe a new body is necessary to make this happen.</P>
    <P>We believe a new body is necessary to take into account the national spatial strategy. If we are to give that fine plan some teeth, we must integrate transportation decisions with that, yet the NRA stated objective is simply to build roads. The NRA does not have a mandate in regard to planning. Indeed, the NRA is enthusiastically building roads from one urban area to another while refusing to take responsibility for what happens to the traffic once it arrives at the other end. In other words, it makes it possible for cars to travel from a certain point to the outskirts of Dublin in two and a half hours but it is not responsible for the traffic at the far end. That is not good enough in transportation planning or in roads planning. The institutions need reform.</P>
    <P>We need to shake the NRA from top to tail and make it a modern body responding to environmental and archaeological challenges and the challenges and needs of local communities. We believe that at present transportation planning is being led by roads planning and it certainly needs reform.</P>

      <P>The institution's terms of reference are Neanderthal. We propose that the body should have representatives from urban planning institutions and environmental agencies. That is the case to a certain extent at present but they are very much in the minority. If you ask a roads engineer for the solution, as the Minister will be well aware, the chances are he or she will tell you to build a road.</P>
      <P>The remit of that body should be widened. All transportation issues should be put under an umbrella body, which unites and integrates transportation planning and gives it a strong environmental mandate. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

Bhí an Ríaltas béasach, thaispeáin sé suim ó am go chéile agus b'fhéidir go dtabharfaidh sé tacaíocht ar ball.</P>
      <P>In the debate on our Bill last night, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, questioned the bias we claimed existed in the funding of public transport as against roads projects. To clarify the matter, the public capital programme published by the Department of Finance shows that total capital investment in roads in 2003 will be &euro;1,249 billion as against &euro;261 billion for public transport, not quite the 6:1 ratio quoted by my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, but certainly far nearer to that than the 3:1 ratio claimed by the Minister. This imbalance in capital funding is the key indicator of where the future lies for our country and where Government policy priorities lie.</P>
      <P>The key intent of the Bill is the development of a priority listing for all transport projects. We believe any co-ordinated analysis of the merits of the different transport projects will favour more money going to the public transport projects that are now being stalled because of a lack of funds. The northern suburban line, for example, needs a third rail line, as line capacity for carriages is limited. I support Deputy Crawford on the need for park and ride facilities for which no agency seems prepared to accept responsibility at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why in the Dublin Transport Office's transport plan is the upgrade of the M50 the very last on the list of priorities for investment up to 2016 while at the same time the M50 upgrade is being proceeded with ahead of all the other recommended public transport projects? The Government's obsession with building new roads has turned our cities into places of mobilisation rather than civilisation. By ignoring land use issues in transport plans, the average mileage that people travel each day has increased significantly, at a huge cost to the economy, society and the environment. For instance, in the 1950s a person travelled 25 miles on average per week but now <Col N="1279" /> the distance travelled is a weary 130 miles and rising, yet all we hear from the Government is that it has a problem feeding the demand, which will never be met unless it is reduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to extend the remit of the implementing agencies to take a more strategic approach. A clear example of the lack of such strategic transport planning is the Dublin Port tunnel. Much attention has been given to its height, construction difficulties and its cost, but the real controversy will arise when it opens and we realise that in traffic management terms it will bring very little benefit. It will bring a welcome relief in taking trucks from the city centre quays, but its unplanned upgrade to a dual rather than a single carriageway will encourage traffic down to the central port area where traffic management will be dictated by traffic using the tunnel rather than by local planning or transport requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister criticised the Bill for failing to grant sufficient powers to the new authority. However, we are glad he went on to acknowledge that this was largely due to the prohibition on an Opposition party to propose legislative changes which have significant financial implications. We would be happy to see the Government amend the Bill so that the existing functions of the NRA and the RPA are properly maintained. The intent of the Bill is to provide the integration in trans<Col N="1280" /> port and planning policy which is critically lacking in the current legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked in his presentation about his proposal to introduce a transport regulator, both for Dublin and for the rest of the country. If the Minister does not undertake a review of our transport investment priorities as recommended in the Bill, however, there will be little for the regulator to do as projects such as the western rail line or other new commuter rail or bus services will never get off the drawing board because of lack of funds. There seems no sense of urgency on the part of the Minister to require the NRA to take into account planning or broader transport considerations, let alone make it properly accountable to this House.</P>
    <P>Our Bill would be a first step towards an integrated approach to the development of both road and public transport infrastructure. It would be a vital step to integrate land use planning and transport planning which would give the national spatial strategy some credibility rather than the token support it has from the Government. We ask all sides of the House to support the Bill and we look forward to the positive suggestions and amendments from all parties on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on Tuesday, 25 March 2003:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;noting the outstanding success of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 in achieving greater openness and accountability in the decision making process in Government and ensuring the access of individual citizens to information held about them;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;further noting the comments of the Information Commissioner on October 10, 2002, that he was &lsquo;fully satisfied that the provisions of the FOI Act as they stand are more than sufficient to protect all of the essential interests of Government';</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;conscious of the serious concerns that have been expressed about the implications of the Government's Bill and believing that these proposals represent a complete negation of the principle of openness and the right of the public to know;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;condemning the failure of the Government to consult with the Information Commissioner and FOI user groups;</P>
    <P Just="Center">postpones the Second Reading of the Bill until such time as the Information Commissioner has been asked to:</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>a</i>) initiate and complete a process of consultation with interested parties;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>b</i>) examine all proposals for amendments to the 1997 Act; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>c</i>) report back not later than April 1, 2004, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy Burton).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains committed to the principle of freedom of information. The amendments proposed are based on the need to ensure that the business of Government can be properly and efficiently organised. Freedom of information provided citizens with confidence <Col N="1283" /> and trust in Government and in public administration. The Act has played an important part in public service reform in Ireland over the past five years. The Government has significantly extended the application of the Act, which now covers some 370 bodies compared with only 67 bodies when the Act came into force. The range of bodies now covered includes local authorities, health boards, voluntary hospitals and numerous other State agencies.</P>
      <P>The principal changes now being made are designed to improve the effective discharge of Government. The Government's responsibility is to take collective decisions on behalf of the community as a whole. In this regard the Government should not be discouraged from engaging in the most honest and frank assessment of all options open to it with, where necessary, a full ventilation of all of the issues involved. Ministers should be able to engage in this full, frank and honest assessment of all the issues. For that reason the amendment being proposed gives the Government space within which to deliberate.</P>
      <P>Government decisions are taken on the basis of collective responsibility. The effect of this is that all Ministers take joint responsibility for decisions against which they may have argued. It is merely a distraction when the media is more concerned about the dynamics within the Government than with the decision taken by the Government and the issue to which the decision relates.</P>
      <P>If one believed everything the Opposition has said one would be excused for thinking that the amended Act will, by international comparisons, be the most regressive freedom of information legislation in the world. This is evidently nonsense. The Canadian legislation, for example, applies a blanket restriction of 20 years on a wide range of records under the general heading of Cabinet confidences. Although the Swedish system, often portrayed as a paragon of freedom of information legislation, may be very open, it is worth looking a little more closely at it. Unlike the Irish system of Government, no memoranda of any detailed kind are submitted to Ministers nor are any minutes kept of Cabinet discussions. Records not created cannot be accessed at any subsequent time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These examples serve to scotch the notion that our system is significantly more restrictive than that which applies elsewhere. Contrary to Opposition suggestions, the reality is that Ireland will continue to have a liberal freedom of information regime, by international standards. The measures being proposed are protecting a process which simply does not exist in all of the countries to which our system is so frequently compared. While it seems to have taken some time, I welcome the fact that the merit of extending the restriction on access to Government records from five to ten years now seems to be more widely accepted. This is one of the several recommendations that emerged from the review of the high-<Col N="1284" /> level report and it is worth recalling the commentary in this regard. The report stated:</P>
    <P>It is evident that a five-year moratorium on the release of Cabinet records is too short. It does not give Ministers the assurance that they require to commit views freely to the record if those views are to be divulged in such a relatively short space of time.</P>
    <P>The new time limit strikes the right balance between transparency and the effective functioning of government.</P>
    <P>Freedom of information, like so many other public services, does not come cheaply. The Department of Finance estimates that requests made to it cost an average of &euro;425 to process. One request to that Department a number of years ago, was estimated to cost well over &euro;10,000 while the cost to the requester amounted to around &euro;600. In the first year of the operation of the Act, one individual made 466 requests, of which 101 were subject to internal review and 35 requests were appealed to the Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the fee to be imposed will be prohibitive. In that regard, I welcome the Minister's assurance that the Bill specifically precludes the possibility of a fee being imposed on requests for personal information. I also welcome the Minister's commitment to striking a balance between the burden and cost of administering the legislation and the need to allow people to have access to information in considering the level of a fee to be applied. It is worth making the point that the Act already requires fees to be charged, except for personal information or in exceptional circumstances, in relation to the cost of search and retrieval and for photocopying records. In practice however, such fees are rarely charged. Therefore, it is the case that the original intention of the Oireachtas that fees should be charged has not been given full effect.</P>
    <P>The issue of personal information has generated considerable interest. This is entirely understandable as access to personal information is at the heart of freedom of information. In view of the fears and concerns expressed about the continued access to personal information, I welcome the Minister's statement that the Government has always been, and continues to be, fully committed to access by individual citizens of personal records held by public bodies. I also welcome the Minister's assurance that the position of an individual's right of access to personal information is not being changed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has been tiresome in its criticism that the Bill is being rushed through the Oireachtas. The Bill was given as much time for consideration in the Seanad as was needed; in the Dáil it is being considered on Second Stage over three days and will be given as much time on Committee Stage as is necessary. This Bill, which is relatively short with many technical provisions, is being given all the parliamentary time it <Col N="1285" /> requires. Additional time could have been given last night had the Opposition not engaged in playing games and futile time-wasting tactics in an effort designed more to grab media headlines than to contribute constructively to the debate. The indignation of the Opposition seems to be designed to stir media emotions more than anything else, particularly given that it has failed to generate public interest.</P>
    <P>While there has been much criticism of the Government's alleged failure to engage in widespread consultation, it should be pointed out that the Government is not obliged to do so. This is about determining the best way of running the business of Government. I accept that the Government has the right to make its own decisions in this regard. The Government has taken proper account of the public interest to retain access to information and has balanced that against the need to ensure it operates effectively. In addition, the Government established the high-level group that examined the issue in detail. The central policy unit in the Department of Finance talks to many interested parties and is fully aware of their views. I do not accept that the Government has any apology to make for the way it has gone about its work. It is a sensible and practical measure designed to improve the effective working of the Government. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I especially welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. It is good that he and the Minister for Finance, as sponsors of this Bill, would be in the House while it is being discussed. It was extraordinary that when two Bills were going through the Oireachtas two weeks ago that both Deputy Parlon and the Minister for Finance were dealing with more urgent business at Cheltenham. It is extraordinary that this Bill was rammed through the Seanad, and I presume it will be railroaded through this House, without taking into account what it is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should allow Deputy Crawford to continue without disruption. If Deputy Crawford addressed his <Col N="1286" /> remarks through the Chair he might not invite interruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you remember when the original Act went through this House, a Cheann Comhairle. As Deputy McGrath noted, Fianna Fáil, then in Opposition, said it did not go far enough.</P>
      <P>Why should the period for the retention of papers be increased from five years to ten years? It is clear the Government, which enjoys an overall majority, is trying to bury the issues that have caused dire problems. While the country enjoyed a period known as the Celtic tiger era, the health service is collapsing and agriculture has never had a more difficult time with &euro;318 million removed from it this year. This Bill tries to ensure the reasons for some of the decisions taken are covered up.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not get the coverage it otherwise might have had due to the coverage afforded to the war in Iraq. We must remember the lessons of the beef tribunal. Government Deputies have spoken of the cost of processing freedom of information requests. How much did the beef tribunal cost? It cost £40 million. While we all welcomed the IRA ceasefire, the report of the beef tribunal was buried when it was released on the same weekend. Very few people realised how serious and sinister was that report. A synopsis of the report was not provided and if people wanted to know what was in it they would have had to spend weeks poring over it.</P>
      <P>At this time of international trauma, an effort is being made to bury information that should be freely available to us. The Information Commissioner had a statutory right to see this Bill as it was being drafted. Why was he not given the chance to view it? Why can the legislation not be delayed to give Ms Emily O'Reilly, the Information Commissioner designate, an opportunity to outline her views? When the current Information Commissioner made his views known he was treated with contempt and arrogance by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will roll over something the Minister of State will have to live with and he will not forget that. Without the Freedom of Information Act, we would not have found out the facts of the Bertie bowl issue and we would not have obtained all the information. The Government might have bulldozed the proposal through if the information had not been requested.</P>
      <P>Cross-Border bodies were located in Cork to deal with cross-Border issues even though we were assured that the Good Friday Agreement would deal with the difficulties in the Six Counties and the six Border counties. I would love to obtain the information on how that deal was done. It is absolutely despicable that Ministers should put their own areas first in spite of their public pronouncements to the contrary. What about the ladies in the Gaeltacht who have been brought into the tax net because they keep a few students for six weeks during the summer? They would like to know, without having to wait ten years, how the decision was reached to take from them the few bob they earn to nurture the Irish language, while stud owners and the horsey set have been let off scot-free.</P>
      <P>I refer to the handling of the foot and mouth disease outbreak. The Minister of State was president of the IFA at that time and I was a member. The organisation highlighted the illegal importation of sheep, yet nothing was done. If that issue had been brought into the open, the amount that failure cost the Exchequer would have been made known. A few farmers and dealers were blamed for the entire problem but nothing happened to those responsible, including departmental officials who turned a blind eye to what was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Such information should be made available. An information request that cost &euro;10,000 has been highlighted repeatedly as a disgrace. However, such requests could prove to be a cheap investment if they were used to establish the background to shady deals that have been done. It is the right of the people to know why such deals were done. The beef tribunal cost the country millions but the inquiry should have been dealt with in this House. Such tribunals and inquiries would not be necessary if there was openness and transparency and private deals should not be done to ensure parties are funded so that elections can be bought and paid for with lies, lies and damn lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Freedom of information means freedom of access to decision making and what is happening. The Act has worked extremely well. <Col N="1288" /> The people elect politicians to make decisions and they have a right to know what is going on in the corridors of power. We are made aware of the decisions made but we can only guess why. Freedom of information is a road map for us to discover what arguments were used for and against different decisions. The collective wisdom of the Houses was enunciated by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 19 March when it stated: &ldquo;In the light of the hearings held by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to date and the report of the high-level group of the Government on the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and related matters, the joint committee strongly recommends as a matter of urgency that sufficient time be allowed for further limited hearings to be held as important areas have been identified in the legislation which the joint committee agrees will need further significant amendment.&rdquo;  The collective wisdom of the House is that the Act is being rushed through and insufficient time has been provided to debate the serious issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">

      <P>The Minister of State may have wasted time but I did not and he will not waste my time now. I will tell him how it is regardless of whether he likes it.</P>
      <P>I accept there must be procedures and I have no problem with Government memoranda being exempted under the Act but when decisions have been made it should be open to all of us to examine them. Government decisions should be as transparent and open as they have been heretofore. Under the legislation that will not be the case and the Secretary General of a Department can decide that an FOI request is not to proceed further. Issues that are important in terms of the public good will not see the light of day for ten years under the Government's proposal.</P>

      <P>That is absolutely unacceptable. We will protest because the legislation is being rushed through the House. Members of the Minister of State's party and Fianna Fáil agree that more hearings and debate is needed.</P>
      <P>Following enactment of the legislation, there will be silence on the part of the Government in terms of providing information to the public. More transparency and honesty is needed and the integrity of the Government's decision making must be transparent. The Minister of State should not be afraid because if he makes a decision with total integrity, it should be open to everybody to examine it. Of what is he afraid or ashamed? What is he trying to hide? What does he not want us to know?</P>

      <P>As my colleague, Deputy Crawford, said, it is a case of shame on the Minister of State for introducing the Bill and removing from the public the right to know what is going on at the heart of Government.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled that the Government proposes to change the Freedom of Information Act. It is only being used for two things at the moment &ndash; to find out what Deputies' salaries are and what expenses they are drawing down. A request to the local authorities from the local newspaper in my area, required public representatives to divulge what we did and did not own. These details are published in the local newspaper this week. Next year, when I am asked to provide that information again, I will put down &ldquo;nil&rdquo;, because it is not right that everyone in the public houses of County Mayo knows what I own and where it is. The legislation seems to only exist in this House to reveal information about backbench Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Government afraid of in the Freedom of Information Act? If I was the Minister for <Col N="1290" /> Finance, I would tell the officials to release all the information &ndash; everything that was being requested &ndash; so people would not come back for more. There are two types of Government &ndash; that of the Civil Service and that of this House. Under FOI legislation, we cannot find out what civil servants receive in travel and other expenses from central Government because they protected themselves from that when the Bill was before the Dáil. When it comes to freedom of information on Deputies and Ministers, they are happy to throw it out. This Bill was dictated by un-elected civil servants. The Minister of State is elected and he should make sure that people get the information.</P>
    <P>I recently requested information under the FOI Act and a civil servant had the cheek to say she was going to charge me for it. I said I would not pay but that I would raise on the Order of Business in the Dáil, the fact that she was not going to give me the information. I received the information which was valuable. It related to a school in my area which had no catchment area. The Department of Education and Science had been writing to the VEC for three years looking for the catchment area. I could not get that information in response to a Dáil question, but I got it under the FOI Act. No catchment area was ever advised to the Department of Education and Science and yet it spent £400,000, without laying a brick, because it spent three years looking for the information.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Information Commissioner, Kevin Murphy, on the excellent job he and his office have done over the years. I gave him plenty of work in recent years and he and his team responded well. They represented the weak in society by taking on the cases for which public representatives were not able to get information. I compliment him on his independence and I am sorry to see him go. I wish Emily O'Reilly, the new Information Commissioner, well and I hope she will display the same independence and do as well as Mr. Murphy.</P>
    <P>The Government is wrong to attempt to change the legislation. We have the un-elected Civil Service on the one hand and elected representatives, such as the Minister of State, his Government colleagues and the Opposition. However, the Civil Service is running the country at health board, local authority and Oireachtas level. This House has given away its powers to un-elected officials. The Minister of State should not be afraid if the Civil Service tells him it does not agree with him. He should tell them he is doing it his way and give the reasons. If he is doing something wrong, the public will judge him on it, as they will if he is doing something illegal. We should be given all the information available.</P>
    <P>This amendment Bill is designed to protect the Civil Service and the Government. I know the Government is afraid in relation to the controversial appointments it made &ndash; such as that of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty and others &ndash; and there were other shenanigans during the last <Col N="1291" /> Administration. The Minister of State is a member of the Progressive Democrats Party, which was elected to be a watchdog.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the Bill which is a reasonable response to the report which was prepared on foot of the Government request by the five senior civil servants. Like others in the House, I might have preferred if more politicians had been involved in preparing it. The argument has been made that the Information Commissioner should have been involved. He made his position clear at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week and, as has been pointed out, there are legal constraints on his position. Anybody who read his report would have to conclude that the thrust of what he was saying goes along lines that are, at worst, parallel to what the Government proposes.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in some respects this amendment Bill does not go far enough in addressing some of the shortcomings that have been found in the legislation. It addresses those issues which are required to be addressed in the short-term. There are time constraints. The Government has been accused of rushing the Bill through the House, but it is required to be passed by mid-April and common-sense dictates that it be done within that timescale. It is also important for Members to accept that the need for good and effective Government supersedes many of the other issues and points raised in relation to freedom of information.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the Labour Party, it must be acknowledged that its Bill, which was before the House some weeks ago, adverted to this fact and acknowledged that changes were needed in the short-term and went some way towards addressing the difficulties and shortcomings in the Bill, which are addressed by this amendment Bill. Deputy Howlin made a thoughtful contribution and, while I disagree with some of the detail of what he said, he made the fair point that the Act contributed to creating a more open Government and society. I do not accept that the amendments proposed by the Government damage that in any way. On balance, they are required to ensure orderly and good government into the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Paul McGrath indicated earlier that he was going to quote what I had said in the House in 1997. Almost all Members who have had their contributions from previous years quoted would be in some trepidation in case what they said then was something about which they had, perhaps, changed their minds. They might have had a bee in their bonnet at the time and it might not appear to be balanced five or six years later. The quotations used by the Deputy were selective and were a misrepresentation of what I said in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the criticisms I levelled on that occasion was that there were virtually no Government Deputies to support the Minister of State at the time. I am surprised that some of the Members seem to know so much about what was said then, since they were not there. One of my concerns was that the Act would only apply to 67 bodies. <Col N="1293" /> The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments have in the meantime extended it to 370 bodies, a huge increase. Some of my concerns, as was the case with many Deputies, arose from my experience of trying to represent people and having difficulty getting information from some of the bodies that are now under the remit of the Act, but were not then.</P>
    <P>I salute Deputy Ring for having the honesty to point out that the Freedom of Information Act has been stringently applied to Members of the House with regard to details of their expenses. The problem has not been created by the fact that the details of expenses can be made available but by the method of reporting on them by some media organs. Two weeks ago, during the debate on the Labour Party Bill, I referred to the need for a press council to address these difficulties and, indeed, to change the daft libel laws. That is something we must address. One of the weaknesses of addressing freedom of information in a vacuum is that the wider issues tend not to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of concern that it is occasionally possible to establish under the Freedom of Information Act the representations made to or by Deputies. This is an important point to consider in the context of the action being taken by Deputy Howlin and Senator Higgins in relation to their right to protect their sources. Equally, constituents who make representations to or wish to have matters addressed by their public representatives should have their right to confidentiality established and protected. One of my main concerns about the operation of the Freedom of Information Act is that it allows access to records of representations made by Members of the Oireachtas and other public representatives in a manner which fundamentally undermines the right of the citizen to raise such matters through their public representatives and to be assured of confidentiality. This is something we need to address in the medium term. I am not sure that it can be addressed by amendment to the Bill before the House but if it can be done, it should be done.</P>
      <P>There is also considerable evidence that some officials choose to commit less of their advice to paper in the knowledge that, under the FOI regime, it is likely to be released and made available for public consumption. This does not contribute to providing better Government. On the contrary, it undermines the right of Ministers to have access to the amount and quality of advice which might otherwise be available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made the reasonable point that there is a considerable administrative burden and associated costs arising from requests under the Freedom of Information Act. That is one of the points I made in my speech in 1997, a speech I had long forgotten but which I am indebted to <Col N="1294" /> Deputy McGrath for drawing to my attention. During the debate on the Labour Party Bill, I said it was not appropriate that the Ombudsman should also be the Information Commissioner. I still hold that view. Mr. Murphy is retiring and will be replaced by Ms Emily O'Reilly, whom I wish well. However, it is a fundamental point that deserves consideration.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the person's right to access to their personal records. It was one of our concerns in 1997, when only 67 bodies came under the ambit of the Act. The situation is considerably improved now with the Act applying to 370 bodies. The new legislation ensures that people will continue to have access to these private and personal records, which is extremely important. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the arguments made against this Bill is that the high level group that reported to the Cabinet would have been incapable of making an independent inquiry into the operation of the Act since 1997. Deputy Ring made that argument and criticised the civil servants. The vast majority of people in the public service are dedicated to the service of the public. Much of the criticism of the Bill over the past few days is based on the assumption that people in the public service have no interest in serving the public and an assumption that they will act to protect their own interests.</P>
      <P>People working in the public service do not have a vested interest in the protection of information. A member of the public service comes to work in the morning and leaves in the evening. What gain is there for them in what they do during the course of the day? There is clearly a restriction on their working day and a failure to achieve their goals in the public service if they have to spend all their time on pointless trawling exercises through the documents and records in the Department for the purpose, in many cases, of journalistic titillation. Many of the applications are fishing expeditions for information that may be trawled up during the course of a large-scale application. It is wrong to think that members of the public service have a vested interest in the restriction of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the long debate we have had on this Bill. The legislation has spent days in committee and an extraordinary length of time in the Seanad, including a debate into the small hours. We are in the Dáil for a second day and there will be a third day's debate also. Why are we debating this Bill far more than any other Bill since I have been a Member of the House? Why is it that we are debating this particular legislation at such length? One would wonder whether it is an attack on democracy. Did we not have democracy prior to 1997? Was democracy invented when the Freedom of Information Act was introduced? Is it a drain on the public finances? The contrary is true as regards this Bill, which tries to prevent the whittling away of public finances on <Col N="1295" /> irrelevant and pointless applications for access to information. That is the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>One of the extraordinary things I heard about the Bill came from the National Union of Journalists and we have a few journalists in the House. The NUJ referred to the amendment to section 6(5)(ii) that personal information must contain a reference to the applicant, rather than simply relating to a reference to the applicant. The NUJ has got it wrong. It says this will allow public servants &ndash; again, another attack on public servants who are incapable of independent inquiry &ndash; to create &ldquo;mirrored records&rdquo; on individuals in future. The amendment only applies to documents that were already in existence pre-1998, so it is not possible for them to create &ldquo;mirrored records&rdquo;, as the NUJ calls them. I have never heard of this phrase before but this is the nature of the NUJ's criticism. Quite simply, however, the union has the whole thing wrong. It does not understand what the Bill is about and it has peddled opinion as information and fact. That gives us some idea of the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>The name of the Bill is self-serving in many ways. I feel the Freedom of Information Act 1997 should have been called the access to information Act. As everybody knows, there is no such thing as absolute freedom, either in the Constitution or elsewhere, so it is wrong to describe it as a Freedom of Information Act. It is simply an Act which provides for systems of access to information, subject to some clearly defined limits. The Bill goes towards serving those limits as well as ensuring healthy discussion in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers say we should have access to information that is used in taking major political decisions. We should not have it, however, because that information is a matter of Cabinet confidentiality. The way in which those decisions were arrived at is also a matter of confidentiality for a limited period of time. I have said all along that five years is too short a period. Perhaps those who framed the legislation in 1997 were of the view that no Government would be in office for such a period but we cannot be naive about this. The reality is that Governments will serve for longer periods in future. Everybody knows that the type of debate one will have around the Cabinet table will be influenced by how soon the details are to be made publicly available. If a window is to be opened onto Cabinet discussions within a period as short as five years, it will limit the frankness, openness and honesty of debate and, accordingly, it will also limit the quality of decision making at Cabinet meetings. That is why extending the period of confidentiality from five to ten years is all about good governance. It is not about secrecy or restriction but about good governance, which is the core of the Bill and that is why the high level group reported in the fashion it did.</P>
    <P>Every Government decision has a deliberative process &ndash; some may be very short and others very long. It is already the practice that a decision <Col N="1296" /> which is continuing within its own deliberative process is not available for being trawled through via the Freedom of Information Act. It is not true to say that the deliberative process is a new excuse to prevent information from coming out. All the existing types of information will continue to be available, subject to a refining of the Act which was always going to happen for such new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government's dedication to freedom of, and access to, information is evidenced by the extension of the Act's application to over 300 bodies, along with a commitment to have it extended to all relevant bodies by 2005. The appointment of Emily O'Reilly, a distinguished journalist, as the new Ombudsman and Information Commissioner provides further evidence of the Government's dedication to access to information. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Andrews, I feel rather old and battle weary. I find his description of public servants who are willing to give out information all day, every day, is a bit surreal. My experience of 23 years with a local authority and over ten years in this House is rather different to what he has described. The reality is that legislative change has brought about a cultural change in terms of information. It is a process that certainly has not finished yet and could go forwards or backwards. Unfortunately, in this case, it appears to be going backwards as a result of a Government that is committed to drawing a veil of secrecy down again after a period of great progress and change.</P>
      <P>Through the decades, there have been major legislative reforms that have served to define us as a society since the foundation of the State. The Freedom of Information Act is one such Act. It is a great modernising mechanism which reflects a modern Ireland that has moved out of times of ignorance, corruption and abuse both in the public and private spheres. More than anything, it is a republican measure that recognises the public right to know how and why it is governed by those entrusted with power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We inherited a Civil Service system from the British administration which was renowned for its secrecy and hierarchical structures. Historically, the system was inimical to the principles of accountability and open Government. While changes were introduced over the years, no legislation has been as extraordinarily transforming as the Freedom of Information Act. Now we have the political party that claims to be republican, setting about to dismantle the Act. Fianna Fáil is taking away rights from the Irish people for one reason only &ndash; because it suits Fianna Fáil. There is no demand for these measures from the public. The Act is both popular with and respected by the people, and the 15,000 inquiries initiated under it last year are a testament to that fact. Only a handful of what may be vexatious or trivial requests have occurred. There is no demand for these measures from the retiring Information <Col N="1297" /> Commissioner, Kevin Murphy. I, too, would like to pay tribute to Mr. Murphy's work. I wish his successor, Emily O'Reilly, the very best in her new role.</P>
    <P>When the 1997 legislation was enacted the general members of the Civil Service found it so congenial that in the first year of its operation civil servants themselves constituted the largest group using the Act to access information, seeking personal records in particular. Having listened to some Fianna Fáil speakers, it is important to make clear that in his report the commissioner does not in any way endorse the general thrust of what the Government is doing. If time permits, I will refer to his report in more detail because it is clearly and deeply critical of the approach that has been adopted by the Government. It is wrong and misleading of Government Deputies to try to paint a different picture. This is, pure and simple, a political choice to bring down the shutters. The clear unswerving light that the Act casts on Government is creating discomfort for Ministers and for a party that prefers to keep the electorate ignorant of what it is doing.</P>
    <P>The hallmark of Fianna Fáil is its obsessive efforts to manage and control the media. Freely accessible information has the capability to subvert the flow of Government propaganda and to interfere with its selective leaking. I want to put the record straight because Government speakers have tried to make out that it is senior civil servants, who were asked to give their opinions, who are driving this and are responsible for the changes being proposed, but the changes, as we all know and as has been stated over and over again, go well beyond anything that the top civil servants produced by way of change.</P>
    <P>I will cite an example from my experience. We know the real situation about the management of the health care crisis largely because of the Freedom of Information Act. The official version, as told by the Minister, Deputy Martin, is that there is no feud between him and the Minister for Finance. However, the record shows over and over again that there are deep divisions between the two Ministers, whether on funding, management or manpower issues. This conflict has clearly led to paralysis in the system. Instead of the long overdue reforms and restructuring that our health service so desperately needs, there is a deepening crisis and lengthening queues for public patients across the board. We know the cause of much of the difficulties because of the existence of the Freedom of Information Act. It provides access to knowledge that will soon be denied to us if this Bill is passed. In my experience the Department of Health and Children is one of the most secretive and unco-operative of all Departments. I dread to think how little we will be able to learn about it in the future.</P>
    <P>We certainly cannot depend on parliamentary questions to get the facts we seek and that we are entitled to have. I will give an example of my experience. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and Children in early <Col N="1298" /> February seeking information about the number of reports, committees and expert groups established since the election of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 1997 and their costs. On 11 February the Minister for Health and Children said it was not possible to compile all the information sought within the time available. I waited a suitable length of time but nothing came back to me. I tabled my parliamentary question again and to this day I am still waiting for a reply. I intend to raise the matter in the House to ensure that it is dealt with. This is unacceptable and it is also in direct contravention of the rules of this House that are laid down not to protect us as Deputies but to protect the entire democratic process.</P>
    <P>There is a culture of secrecy that corrodes good government and good opposition. As public representatives, we can choose to acquiesce to it or change it. Fianna Fáil has made its choice and it should not surprise us that it is driven to emasculate the Freedom of Information Act, but it is not doing it on its own. Not for the first time is a respectable cover to a shameful Government project being provided by the Progressive Democrats. When the Government embarked on the constitutional amendment on abortion in 2002 that reactionary, dangerous proposal was dishonestly and staunchly defended by the Progressive Democrats as being progressive and protective of women. The weasel words of Progressive Democrats Ministers then are reflected in their weasel words now on this Bill. Again, they are supporting the emasculation of the rights of citizens instead of using their power within Government to protect the public interest. Many of those people who voted for the Progressive Democrats must now be asking themselves what is the point of voting for a party to prevent one-party government, as the Minister, Deputy McDowell, exhorted them to do before the election, if one ends up with that party being a mirror image of the main party &ndash; Fianna Fáil &ndash; after the election? </P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Fiona O'Malley's contribution. She was not a Member of the House at the time of the abortion amendment campaign. She came out against it and that did not do her any harm at election time. However, now she is a Member of the House, on the one hand she is attacking this Bill while leaving herself plenty of wriggle room to support it, despite the fact, as she said, that it is a flawed Bill prepared in haste and without proper consultation.</P>
    <P>Members should remember that the rainbow Government was responsible for this important Act. As a Labour Party Minister in that Government, Eithne Fitzgerald was the architect of the original Act. To her credit, she worked diligently to construct a complex legal framework whereby doors and windows could be opened for ordinary citizens in a way that for many has been a liberating experience. For the first time knowledge about personal records about themselves but also knowledge about those who govern them was <Col N="1299" /> accessible to the public. Her work has withstood the test of time and the rigours of considerable usage of its provisions.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Act's introduction, the then Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, had to take some flack from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Deputies for not going far enough in her proposals. What an irony that is now. Those same individuals now on the Government benches are unravelling her good work and jettisoning some of the most important elements of the Act, those which relate to the scrutiny of Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party took the lead in delivering this legislation then and we are offering a lead to the Government now. We have published alternative legislation to the Government's hurried, ill-conceived and untested Bill. We have set out a timeframe of one year during which the current Act would be frozen and during which systematic, open and thoughtful consultation can take place. There is no reason the Government could not accept this more reasonable and reflective route, yet its determination to bulldoze through this Bill regardless is unrelenting.</P>
    <P>The final outcome will be a complete negation of the fundamental principle that underpins the existing Act. The definition of Government will be altered in a way which puts it at risk of a constitutional challenge. Documentation of sub-committees with officials, ministerial correspondence and material compiled principally but not solely for Cabinet for the first time will be exempt. Clearly, this will reduce significant access to knowledge that the public enjoy at present and which is necessary in a fully functioning and healthy democracy.</P>
    <P>The Government has never explained satisfactorily why this or other measures are justified. Its failure to do so simply fuels public suspicion and creates a sense of betrayal that this Act was designed to tackle in the first place. The Act was a confidence-building measure. It was designed to give people hope, appreciation and trust in a political process that has been severely damaged by corrupt politicians and people who used the system who were not fully accountable, but now a measures is being drawn up by those who are on the inside, senior political figures in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and top civil servants. In effect, they are designed to keep the public excluded.</P>
    <P>If there were a real and present danger to the public interest that required such changes, we would have read all about it in the report produced by the Office of the Information Commissioner. Instead the dangers outlined in this report arise from changes being proposed by the Government Bill. Section 13 provides that a Minister cannot release a record under the Freedom of Information Act if the Secretary General of another Department issues a certificate in writing stating that the contained matter related to the deliberative process of a Depart<Col N="1300" /> ment. This provision undermines the authority of a Minister as head of his or her Department. It has serious consequences for how Ministers are to be held accountable for their duties and responsibilities. When reasons are given for the proposed changes they are not always true, let alone justifiable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in the House that it was necessary to abandon the five year rule because the release of some documents could undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. He was misleading the House as it is impossible to make that statement stand up. The current Freedom of Information Act contains a clause which specifically excludes this kind of material from being released.</P>
    <P>With such misleading statements from the Government's most senior Minister, is it any wonder the Opposition, the media and the public simply do not believe these changes are either necessary or desirable? We need to remember what those changes are and to look at the assessment carried out by the architect of the Act, former Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>She says the changes denying access to briefing documents for parliamentary questions and accountability to Parliament will revert to putting the right question and we know where that led. The changes would deny access to the costings of party political proposals and she says this would surely restrict true democratic choice. To paraphrase another section of the Act, that is purely factual information such as statistical or econometric information.</P>
    <P>Regarding the charges for information, she says:</P>
    <P>When I drew up the Act I was careful to include a provision that no charge could be levied where the cost of collecting it was not worth it. This was to ensure that no charges would be levied for simple requests where the material could be retrieved easily. If there is a charge for requests then many NGOs and individuals would be unable to afford to exercise their rights to information. Reluctant Departments and bodies would challenge requesters to pay fees rather than issue information outside the Act in accordance with the spirit and indeed the letter of it. If there is a fee for appeals this may encourage bodies to withhold information despite the terms of the Act in the hope that charges may deter an appeal or indeed this may be seen as a way simply to raise money.</P>
    <P>It is clear that by charging unnecessarily for information one is excluding people who under our laws should be treated equally but who cannot exercise their rights due to a lack of funds. We know we live in a deeply unequal society where many people's rights to health care, education or a decent home are restricted or denied because of a lack of income. It is unacceptable that a right to information which was established in the past should now be thwarted and distorted because of the issue of charges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" />It is interesting to look at the Information Commissioner's report. He cites cases appealed to him where a Department refused individual applicants &ndash; Eithne Fitzgerald herself in one case. The commissioner goes carefully through the process by which she requested copies of minutes and a policy paper prepared for the interdepartmental strategy group on employment and unemployment. Access was refused on the grounds that the records contained matters relating to the deliberative processes of the Department. The commissioner went through the matter very carefully and found in favour of Ms Fitzgerald and found that the Department was wrong to deny her the information. I do not recall the sky falling when someone with a distinguished record like hers was able to access information. It is interesting to note the commissioner's comments:</P>
    <P>Had the 1997 Act been framed as now proposed it would have been sufficient for the Department to have shown that the background paper was part of the deliberative processes of a public body, as opposed to having been part of the deliberative process of the public body concerned with the request. While some further clarification would be desirable it seems that this amendment is designed to enable greater co-ordination or perhaps centralisation of decision-making across the public sector.</P>
    <P>Secondly, had the Secretary General of the Department been in a position to certify that the record at issue related to an ongoing deliberative process I would not have been in a position to even review. Finally, rather than having to satisfy me that the release of the records would be contrary to the public interest, the Department would only have been required to satisfy me that public interest would, on balance, be better served by refusing the request.</P>
    <P>That is a total negation of the original spirit and thrust of the Act. It is now simply a matter of the Department arguing that the public interest would be better served by refusing a request rather than an issue of the public interest being better served by access to information. Regrettably, the sample case I cited is only one of a number of cases.</P>
    <P>This is a sorry proposal from a Government which clearly has something to hide. It does not want the light shone by Eithne Fitzgerald to continue to burn in a way that ensures the public is included in the democratic process. The public's rights are not being respected by a party which calls itself a republican party. That party is not ensuring we have a Government and State which operate as a true republic.</P>

      <P>I have an objection in historical terms to the characterisation of the Irish State for a prolonged period as being dominated by ignorance, corruption and abuse. We have all read and heard about the corruption, abuse and ignorance in Irish society over the years but my generation views Ireland in a way that differs from Deputy McManus's worldview. I do not see Irish society, even in the deepest, darkest and most depressing days of the 1950s as one dominated by ignorance, corruption and abuse. Those elements were unfortunate, prevalent and tragically wrong but they do not characterise the time. That language, which is particularly lurid in its characterisation of the Irish State, is characteristic of the old Workers' Party. That party specialised in this kind of characterisation and it is no accident it has ceased to be. The people who protested long and loudly that they would never be part of the Labour Party are now part of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I raise is safety management systems and efforts to ensure the safety of employees in hotels following the death of a worker in a Limerick hotel last year and the subsequent investigation by the Health and Safety Authority. Gráinne Dillon was a young woman <Col N="1303" /> full of life and looking forward to a career in the hotel industry when she was tragically murdered while at work in Limerick in early January last year. Her death shows that life does not always turn out as we would hope or expect. However, there are other lessons that can be learned from these events.</P>
      <P>The individual who took Gráinne Dillon's life has been dealt with by the courts and faces a long time in prison. What I wish to raise is how Gráinne ended up in a position where, as a trainee manager, she had sole responsibility for running one of the biggest hotels in the country. Her employers must account for leaving a young woman with only six months experience in sole charge of more than 300 guests on the night in question. What, for instance, would Gráinne have done if a fire had broken out or in the event of any other emergency? Surely people who stay in these hotels must now sit up and take notice of the risks hoteliers are taking with their safety.</P>
      <P>Gráinne's duties that night took her away from the hotel front desk on many occasions, yet this was the only area where a panic button was located on a night when there was no security or door staff. At 24 years of age Gráinne had huge responsibility in her job which she took very seriously. That night, she took care of room service, answered the phone and tallied the money in the hotel tills. She was doing a diligent, thorough job for her employers. However, Gráinne's employers failed to match the dedication and hard work she displayed by not providing adequate protection for their employee. They left her to fend for herself while she suffered a fatal attack which robbed her of her life and her family of a loving sister and daughter.</P>
      <P>Her employers completely failed to comply with the safety, health and welfare at work regulations which state that it shall be the duty of every employer to ensure that in taking measures necessary for the safety, health and protection of employees, the measures take account of changing circumstances and the general principles specified in the first schedule. In leaving Gráinne Dillon unprotected in her workplace her employees must share some responsibility for the tragedy that occurred. Given that the hotel group in question has recently announced record profits, it is not as if it cannot afford to provide adequate security for all its guests and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their grief the Dillon family turned to the Health and Safety Authority, the agency charged with ensuring employers take all necessary steps to protect their employees. Legislation is in place which clearly puts the responsibility for providing a safe workplace on the employer, yet the Health and Safety Authority has continually said this is not its business and is the sole responsibility of the Garda Síochána. The Garda has done its job and I call on the Minister to demand that the Health and Safety Authority does its job. If not, the question of ultimate responsibility remains <Col N="1304" /> unanswered and many other young people may be placed in the same danger to which Gráinne Dillon was so tragically exposed. In virtually every hotel owned by the group in question young men and women are placed in charge of large areas without experience or support. It is surely the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority to ensure employers do not place their employees in a position in which their lives could be taken, as was Gráinne's.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer my condolences and those of the House to the family who have suffered immeasurably as a result of this tragedy. To see a young, energetic woman with everything going for her taken from her family and friends is harrowing.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 applies to all workplaces, including hotels. Under the Act all employers are required to prepare a safety statement on how the employer will protect the health and safety of his employees. The implementation of this statement in the workplace is essentially the health and safety management system for that workplace. All workers are to be made aware of that part of the safety statement which applies to them and follow the procedures laid down for them. In turn, the employer must regularly monitor compliance with his own safety statement.</P>
      <P>During 2003, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, will introduce a new safety, health and welfare at work Bill to the Oireachtas. This will herald a new era of health and safety in Ireland and will emphasise, in a much stronger manner, the elements of safety management, training and consultation. The Minister of State is keenly aware of the need for increased penalties and the Bill will address this issue. Good safety management, training and consultation are the foundations of good preventative action.</P>
      <P>Health and safety inspectors, when inspecting workplaces, check for the existence of the safety statement and check the extent of its implementation. Enforcement action up to and including prosecution may be taken for non-compliance. Unlike, for example, the construction sector and the mining industry, the authority does not categorise hotels as high risk workplaces and would only inspect hotels on complaint about health and safety conditions. Much as the Minister would like it to be the case, the resources of the HSA are not infinite and inspection of every workplace is not a feasible target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2002 health and safety inspectors carried out 214 inspections of hotels and 221 such inspections in 2001. The HSA continues to work in partnership with employers and unions to reduce the level of fatalities and accidents in all sectors. The authority did not carry out an investigation into the death of the person in question. The matter was the responsibility of the Garda which carried <Col N="1305" /> out an investigation and achieved a successful prosecution with a life sentence.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, preventing workplace violence is a growing concern. Media attention has focused primarily on dramatic cases of violence in the workplace. It is incumbent on managers to respond appropriately to the actual risks of workplace violence faced by their employees. Although we live in an era dominated by technological advances, it is still ultimately human behaviour and human interaction which determines the extent to which we can be genuinely secure and content at work.</P>
    <P>The workplace is a microcosm of life. We are not obliged to like everyone we work with, but we are obliged to treat everyone fairly and with dignity. Bullying and intimidation are insidious and reprehensible forms of behaviour and have no place in a civilised workplace. They are forms of discrimination and harassment derived from a lack of basic respect for the dignity of another person. Bullying, harassment and intimidation are legitimate workplace issues and the introduction of codes of practice under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Industrial Relations Act 1990 have further enhanced the totality of the State response to these issues. These codes are an invaluable source of guidance on putting in place policies and procedures at enterprise level and as a basis and reference point for the Health and Safety Authority, the Equality Authority and the Labour Relations Commission which offer related advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>The responsibility at local level of the employer, manager and employee must also be rightly recognised and emphasised. The commitment of management and workforce to develop and maintain an atmosphere in which the dignity of each individual is respected is central to the concept of an effective workplace. Adherence to and promotion of the dignity at work charter, as recommended by the task force on workplace bullying and the provision of a separate and specific anti-bullying policy are two of the most important preventative measures which every employer can undertake immediately. Anti-bullying measures should be taken, in the first instance, to protect employees.</P>
    <P>An employer who develops an anti-bullying policy is not only protecting his or her employees, but also his or her business, the well-being of employees will eventually reflect itself in the overall well-being of the organisation. In the same context I emphasise that employees have responsibilities and duties towards each other. Bullying, harassment and intimidation must never become the accepted silent work practice.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the central co-ordinating State agency handling bullying at work. Bullying is considered a workplace hazard alongside more traditional hazards and, as such, must be treated within the safety management system. Bullying must be identified as a hazard and a risk assessment carried out to eliminate or <Col N="1306" /> reduce the risk of its consequences should it occur.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am glad that you have allowed me raise this issue. As a frequent user of a car I must declare my interest at the outset. Petrol and diesel stations make up a large part of the economy in my peninsula, particularly as we are so close to the Border. The differential between petrol prices in the North and, more importantly, the exchange rate has yielded a large economic benefit in Border counties of which you, a Cheann Comhairle, will be aware as a Border Deputy. The argument is frequently made that petrol is more expensive in certain areas than in others. I often hear Conor Faughnan on the radio encouraging people to shop around for a better deal. That is something I will allude to later.</P>
      <P>On the question of the differential between petrol prices, the price of petrol has not increased in various budgets over the years. Recent budgets have been good to petrol station owners. In the December budget there was a 3 cent increase in the price of diesel, which came into effect on the night of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" />That leads me to something I have noticed in the past few days. I was astonished to find that where there used to be a differential of around 10 cent between diesel and petrol prices because diesel is much cheaper to produce &ndash; I can only speak for Dublin where I have been for the past number of days &ndash; it is now the case that diesel and petrol prices are converging so they are either very close or exactly the same. In some stations diesel is now more expensive than petrol. That is confusing and I want the matter clarified. Is there a Government reason behind this or is there another reason?</P>
    <P>The usual complaint is that there are large differentials in prices among regions. I made a return journey to the south-east on Tuesday and I noticed that one station was selling petrol at approximately 85 cent per litre while diesel was being sold at approximately 81 cent per litre. Another station in the same town was selling diesel for 94 cent per litre and petrol for 92 cent per litre. One could shop around in that town and decide to go for the cheaper option but as I got closer to Dublin and on to the Naas dual carriageway, I found that four out of the five petrol stations were selling diesel at 93.6 cent per litre and petrol at 93.9 cent per litre. With four out of five stations selling at those prices, it would be more difficult to shop around.</P>
    <P>Having asked some members of the public about this, one reason I was given was that the Government has put some new duty on diesel. Is that fact or fiction? The December budget brought in the 3 cent increase but I do not remember an increase since then. The second reason is that people link the war in Iraq with increases in oil prices yet media reports say the price of oil has reduced in the recent past. Even if war had increased the price of oil, why would the result be a price convergence of a commodity such as diesel, which is cheaper to produce than petrol? Does the Department of Finance have a response in that regard?</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs must examine this issue. Too many people just fill up their cars with petrol or diesel without looking at the price per litre, nor do they compare prices among stations. As consumers we should play our part in supporting those who are engaging in fair play, and I do not relate that to any individual petrol seller.</P>
    <P>On another level, the Director of Consumer Affairs should intervene and ensure consumers are protected when we get to the stage where options of what should constitute fair play begin to disappear. In that regard I refer specifically to the convergence of diesel and petrol prices. I want the Government to indicate whether it is responsible for the recent change and if it is not, who is responsible and what can be done?</P>
    <P>Deregulation can assist the price of any commodity if it generates competition but has the time come to explore the way stations in various parts of the country&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has no responsibility for the retail price of either petrol or diesel which is a private commercial issue. However, the Minister has responsibility for the excise duty levied on these products.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rate of excise duty levied on diesel, the rate was increased in the budget by 3 cent a litre with effect from midnight on 5 December 2002. There are two rates of excise duty for road diesel. The rate is &euro;379.12 per 1,000 litres for diesel with a sulphur content above 50 parts per million, and &euro;326.73 for diesel with a sulphur content below 50 parts per million. Virtually all diesel sold is of a low sulphur content.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rate of excise duty levied on petrol, there was no increase in the recent budget. The rate of excise duty on unleaded petrol is &euro;401.36 per 1,000 litres. The excise rate for auto diesel prior to the budget was well below the EU average. For example, the Irish excise rate was 30 cent per litre compared with the EU average of 35 cent per litre. The German excise rate is 44 cent per litre and the UK excise rate is 74 cent per litre. Even after the budget increase, the Irish excise rate will only rank 7th in the EU, at 33 cent per litre.</P>
      <P>The excise rate for petrol is also well below the EU average. For example, the Irish excise rate is 40 cent per litre compared with the EU average of 51 cent per litre. The German excise rate is at 64 cent per litre, and the UK excise rate is at 69 cent per litre. The Irish rate ranks 12th in the EU. The figures quoted relating to excise rates in the EU are based on the latest available European Commission excise duty tables, dated August 2002.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been political agreement on the proposed EU Directive on Energy Taxation. This directive will mean an increase in the minimum rates of excise duty on mineral oil products. The current EU minimum rate for auto diesel is &euro;245 per 1,000 litres &ndash; this rate will increase to &euro;302 from 1 January 2004 and to &euro;330 from 1 January 2010. The current EU minimum rate for petrol is &euro;287 per 1,000 litres &ndash; this rate will increase to &euro;359 from I January 2004. However, Irish excise rates are already above these levels in respect of both petrol and diesel so the change in the EU minimum rates will not impact on Irish excise rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consulted with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on <Col N="1309" /> this issue. The Minister has no remit regarding the pricing of goods and services. These issues remain a commercial matter. She is not aware of the trend referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>In the absence of State enforced price control, movements in prices are an ongoing aspect of the market economy. When price control was last used as a policy mechanism in the 1980s, maximum prices became the minimum prices, inflation rates were close to 20% and consumers lost out. It has been the Tánaiste's policy to encourage consumers to shop around for the best prices available. The Director of Consumer Affairs also has no role in the pricing structures operated by retailers of these products.</P>
    <P>It has always been the Tánaiste's contention that competition and price transparency are the most effective means of protecting the interests of consumers. To this end the previous Government introduced new legislation to strengthen the powers of the Competition Authority. Consumers concerned about anti-competitive practices are encouraged to take their complaints to the authority. To facilitate price transparency the Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997, S.I. No. 178 of 1997 requires that the retailer display the price per litre of diesel and petrol. This order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs. The Tánaiste has always urged consumers to be assertive in seeking explanations for price increases from retailers that they feel are not justified.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Finance has no responsibility for the retail price of either petrol or diesel, the Revenue Commissioners undertake a cross-Border price survey for information purposes at various times throughout the year. The most recent survey was compiled on 12 February 2003. This survey provides a snapshot of the average retail prices of the main excisable commodities observed in the Dublin and Newry areas. When compared with Northern Ireland, auto diesel is currently 39 cent per litre cheaper here &ndash; the average price of a litre of diesel in the State is 81 cent compared with &euro;1.20 in Northern Ireland. When compared with Northern Ireland, petrol is currently 29 cent per litre cheaper here &ndash; the average price of a litre of petrol is 89 cent compared with &euro;1.18 in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope this information is helpful to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am raising this matter on behalf of constituents who want to adopt a child from abroad. They received information and an application form from the South-Western Area Health Board and were advised that the waiting time for processing the application would be between 16 and 18 months. This is the initial stage of the adoption process. The next stage that leads up to and includes adopting a child will take another 18 months. Like many others, the couple accepted this timetable without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" />There is now a problem, however, with the waiting time for the processing of the initial application form. This is related to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and, in the case of my constituents, specifically to the South-Western Area Health Board.</P>
    <P>I looked at the website of the International Adoption Association of Ireland and was shocked by the information based on the most recent data available to the association. According to Department of Health and Children figures for December 2001, the national waiting list for overseas adoptions stood at 1,070 applications. Of these, 51% live in the ERHA area, while of the 38 full-time and one part-time social worker doing adoption assessments State-wide, fewer than one quarter are in the ERHA area. This discrepancy means that each ERHA social worker deals with 57 applications while social workers in health boards outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority deal with only 18.</P>
    <P>This discrimination against ERHA applicants makes the service terrible in Dublin when compared to other areas. Based on current productivity levels, the ERHA health authority applicants on the waiting list can expect a four year wait before starting assessment and, at best, they will then have to wait a further year before receiving their declaration of suitability.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, social workers seem to do far too few assessments. In 2001, they each carried out 15 complete assessments, considerably below the national target of 18 to 20 and a reduction from the 20 to 24 target set in June 1999 by the Department of Health and Children's standardised framework on inter-country adoption. According to the Department's own figures, between December 1998 and September 2001, the ERHA inter-country assessment service team grew from eight full-time and one part-time social workers to nine full-time and one part-time social workers, an increase of one social worker in the health board area with over 50% of national applications. In the same period, the number of non-ERHA social workers doing inter-country adoption assessments rose from nine full-time to 28 and one part-time, an increase of 19 full-time and one part-time social workers in health board areas with less than half of the applications. Since 2000 the number of ERHA social workers allocated to inter-country adoption assessments has fallen from 12 full-time in June 2000 to nine full-time and one part-time in June 2001 and remains at that level as of December 2001.</P>
    <P>There are also continuing doubts about the accuracy of the ERHA figures. Since September 2001 the ERHA alone of all health boards has refused to provide an official estimate of the waiting times. The South-Western Area Health Board states that it cannot accurately project waiting times due to the constantly varying numbers on the waiting lists and the fluctuations in the number of social workers available for assessments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" />The Minister of State recently addressed a conference on inter-country adoption organised for the International Adoption Association. He said that the issue of changing circumstances in the 21st century and their impact on adoption legislation was being actively considered and that he hoped to be in a position to produce a set of proposals in the near future and consult widely on them. I welcome such proposals but the system must be in place to deal with overseas adoptions, particularly in the largest population area.</P>
    <P>Are the statistics I read out accurate? Has there been any meaningful improvement? Does the Minister of State have statistics to back that up? There is a mismatch between the demand for the service and the allocation of social workers that has led to a massive waiting time problem in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give a commitment, given the discrepancy that penalises people living in Dublin, to redistribute the processing workload of the South-Western Area Health Board to other health boards? I ask for this one small commitment on behalf of the hundreds of families in the Dublin area who want to give nothing but love and a chance of a better life to children from overseas.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gogarty for raising this issue on the Adjournment. He referred to the recent announcement I made about a consultation process on new adoption legislation. That process is taking place in a tight timeframe. The heads of a Bill to implement the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoptions must be submitted for consultation because unless we do that our credibility and sincerity in seeking children for adoption will be open to challenge. Legislation is crucial because it is not just a matter of providing a service to assess prospective adopters in Ireland, it is also essential to ensure that adoptions that take place from other jurisdictions are in the best interests of the child, a controversial subject.</P>
      <P>Our legislation provides for inter-country adoption and for assessment based on a standardised framework that is also an important guarantee of the integrity of our overseas adoption arrangements. We are the only jurisdiction in the world that provides its citizens with the statutory right to an assessment of suitability for adoption. The existence of that assessment is of considerable assistance to our authorities when seeking to conclude adoption arrangements with other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment, I have been acutely aware of the delays being experienced by prospective inter-country adopters for assessment in the eastern region. The delays have occurred because of an increased interest in inter-country adoption and difficulties in recruiting social workers. I have had meetings with my officials and the interests involved to discuss this issue in <Col N="1312" /> detail. Efforts are continuing to deal with the current shortage of social workers by recruiting internationally and by increasing the number of training places nationally.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of &euro;2.1 million has been provided nationally over the past four years to reduce the time spent by couples on waiting lists. Almost &euro;830,000 of the additional funding provided has been provided to the ERHA.</P>
    <P>The standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment procedures is now being used in all health boards. The purpose is to streamline assessment processes so that resources are used effectively. The framework has been welcomed by both health boards and prospective adopters and provides clarity on the training that must be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Major improvements are now being seen in the ERHA service. The waiting time for assessment has decreased to 17 months, a substantial improvement on the previous position. Staffing difficulties are being overcome &ndash; the number of social workers in the ERHA service almost doubled between the end of 2001 and the end of 2002. Staffing difficulties are being overcome. The number of social workers in the ERHA service almost doubled between the end of 2001 and the end of 2002. There are currently about 18 (whole-time equivalent) social workers in the service, including supervisors. The ERHA has advised that the retention rate of social workers has also improved. The number of assessments completed increased from 137 in 2001 to 157 in 2002. The ERHA expects that the output will increase significantly during the first half of 2003 as the social workers recruited during 2002 become more experienced. An appropriate administrative structure is now in place to manage the service, freeing up social workers to concentrate on assessments and to provide a more focused service for those who require it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that progress is being made in the ERHA inter-country adoption service. The waiting time in the eastern region is now similar to the waiting time being experienced in some of the other boards. However, I am continuing to monitor the situation to ensure that prospective adopters do not experience long delays in waiting for assessment. I am not satisfied that the waiting period should even be as long as 17 months. I have been assured by the ERHA that it continues to work in conjunction with the area health boards to continue to improve delivery of this service. I am open to constructive suggestions as to how the service can be improved. As I pointed out to the Deputy, this is one of the few, if any, jurisdictions in the world providing such a service free of charge. However, I do not wish to give the impression that I am proposing to introduce a charge for this service, which must be available free of charge to those who seek it. I am examining other options with a view to improving the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this most sensitive matter of the death, by suicide, of a 21 year old student while a patient of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital on 20 September 2002. First, I wish to sympathise with the father, mother and brother of the suicide victim. The death, as in any suicide, has been deeply traumatic for them. I also recognise the trauma of the staff of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital and recognise that the death has a deep effect on the service providers.</P>
      <P>The family and I are demanding that the Minister for Health and Children should immediately set up an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of this young girl. It is not acceptable that the Mid-Western Health Board is the investigating body of itself. There are serious questions of hospital practices, procedures, safeguards and suicide prevention protocols, including ensuring that the control of suicide opportunity is recognised as a key area of prevention. I disagree fundamentally with any internal review by a health board of the facts surrounding a tragic incident, assessing the adequacy of procedures in place to ensure safe patient care, and making recommendations to itself on necessary changes.</P>
      <P>In this respect, I refer to the report of the independent review panel to the Minister for Health and Children concerning the birth of baby Bronagh Livingstone on 11 December 2002 in the North-Eastern Health Board area. The conclusion of the NEHB report was that the decision to transfer to Cavan General Hospital was the right one, given the condition of the mother and the prevailing conditions on both sites. However, it was the view of the independent review panel that the birth of the baby was imminent shortly after the mother arrived at Monaghan General Hospital and that, consequently, no attempt should have been made to transfer Ms Livingstone to Cavan General Hospital.</P>
      <P>On 20 September, the 21 year old student entered a shower around 1 p.m. and was discovered hanging on a shower rail by a dressing gown cord. She was cut down by nurses and a cardiac team was called. She was pronounced dead at 1.55 p.m. The deceased had been admitted the previous night, having been transferred from St. Patrick's Hospital, Dublin. She was diagnosed as depressed and suicidal and had attempted hanging twice. A senior nurse checked the patient at around 9.45 a.m. and asked a student nurse to observe her. The senior nurse took her break around 9.45 a.m. to 10 a.m. and, on returning to the patient's room, she noticed that the curtain rail had fallen down. The deceased denied interfering with the curtains. The nurse expressed concern to the clinical nurse manager that the curtain of the dormitory had fallen and that this may have been caused by a patient, which might indicate cause for concern. She also spoke to the deceased's psychiatrist and expressed her concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" />When the senior nurse called to observe the patient later, she found her locked into the shower. With difficulty she opened the door and, although the patient said she was all right, she appeared to be anxious, fretful and frightened. The senior nurse again requested two student nurses to stay with the patient. The students finish work each Friday at 12 noon. Was it because of the demand on nursing staff in the unit that there was no one available to give special attention to the deceased? When the senior nurse checked the deceased's room later, she was not there. She may have attended the dining room at lunch time.</P>
    <P>The two nurses who discovered her body had been working since morning and had seen the girl at about 12.30 p.m. to 12.45 p.m. She had been missed from the ward and a search was conducted. It was noticed that the shower room was locked. The two nurses tried to open the door but failed to do so as it was locked from the inside. They had difficulty opening the door and scissors had been used to turn the lock. The girl was hanging from the shower curtain rail by a shower robe cord. She was discovered at about 1.30 p.m. The findings at the autopsy were consistent with cardio-respiratory failure due to asphyxia due to constriction of the neck by a ligature.</P>
    <P>The family demands and, in my opinion, is entitled to an independent review. If this death had the same profile and public disquiet surrounding it as the death of baby Livingstone in Cavan Hospital last December, I have no doubt there would be an independent inquiry to review all aspects of the tragedy. I ask the Minister to ensure that such an inquiry is established. In the Cavan case, an independent inquiry proceeded at the same time as the internal inquiry. In this case also, an internal inquiry should not preclude an independent inquiry. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I have the greatest admiration for the Deputy's continued interest in issues associated with suicide and his thought-provoking approach to the matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the case referred to, I extend my condolences to the family concerned on their tragic loss. Today, I also attended a removal arising from such a tragedy. Every sudden death, from whatever cause, of a patient in psychiatric care is regrettable. Under section 272 of the Mental Treatment Act 1945, all clinical directors of psychiatric facilities are required to report sudden deaths to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, who was informed of the death of the person concerned in September 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board indicated at that time that it was conducting its own investigation into the circumstances of the case. I am informed that the board will finalise its report <Col N="1315" /> into the death in the coming weeks. While I appreciate the case which Deputy Neville has made, my Department does not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation established by the Mid-Western Health Board. When the report is available, I will ask the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to examine the matter in full and to make any recommendations he considers appropriate. I am, therefore, of the view that it would be inappropriate, at this time, to establish an independent investigation without access to the board's final report and conclusions regarding the incident. However, in light of the Deputy's presentation, I may be prepared to review the matter of an independent investigation in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has <Col N="1316" /> requested all services to review, in depth, all sudden deaths of patients in their care with a view to scrutinising existing clinical management and risk assessment of patients for the possibility or likelihood of self-injury. The inspectorate is of the view that formal clinical audit procedures should be carried out in each case of suicide or suspected suicide among in-patients.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I assure Deputy Neville that when the report of the health board's own investigations is received by my Department, the matter will be thoroughly examined by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and appropriate measures taken thereafter, if required. I hope that is helpful.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 March 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>I launched the CLÁR Programme (Ceantair Laga Árd Riachtanais) &ndash; a targeted investment programme in rural areas &ndash; on 5 October 2001.</P>
      <P>The areas selected are those which have suffered the greatest depopulation since 1926 with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula, which was included based on the serious difficulties caused for that area by foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>Arising from the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, on 17 January last I announced the extension of the CLÁR areas to include an additional 189 DEDs, bringing the total to 890 in 18 counties. The total population in the extended CLÁR areas has increased from 283,654 to 361,901.</P>
      <P>CLÁR funds, or co-funds with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These measures support physical community and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversions, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health and sports projects. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on CLÁR in 2002 was &euro;14.14 million. For 2003, the budget is &euro;9.5 million. Never<Col N="1318" /> theless, I expect I will be able to complete a comprehensive work programme in 2003. CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources. The 2003 CLÁR allocation will be sufficient to continue this leverage to sustain an effective programme.</P>
    <P>It is not practical here to provide Deputy Penrose with complete details of activities under the programme. I am arranging to have this information sent directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 116, 126, 137, 139 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that my Department was established against a background of concern at the multiplicity of structures and agencies through which local and community development schemes and programmes are delivered. As I have said before in this House, many local and community programmes were established under different Departments years ago, in some cases almost decades ago. Accordingly, there is an inherent danger of fragmentation of services and diffusion of resources. This can cause problems for communities in understanding and accessing funding and services on the ground.</P>
      <P>I have been working closely with other Ministers, in particular the Ministers for Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and we have agreed to take a number of initial steps aimed at addressing these concerns. The key principles governing our approach are: strengthening the impact of current resources in terms of on the ground services, supports and benefits for local communities; streamlining structures to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheads; bringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local-community development measures; and strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and service providers in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Guided by these principles, we have taken a number of initial steps towards bringing greater cohesion across local and community development programmes. There are three basic elements to this phase of reform. In late February we initiated a comprehensive consultation process with the providers of schemes and programmes and the social partners on improving local delivery structures. All projects and support agencies under the community development support programme and Leader groups have been included in the consultation process, as have Area Development Management Ltd. and the area partnerships, community groups and RAPID area implementation teams. The national drugs task force has been asked to consult the local drugs task forces. The Department of Justice Equality and Law reform has sought the views of county and city child care committees and the Department of Environment and Local Government is consulting county managers and county and city development boards. Basically we are asking the various participants in this area how structures might be improved to secure better coherence within and between programmes <Col N="1322" /> and schemes. I hope to conclude the consultation process with a national seminar next July.</P>
    <P>The second element of our initiative is an independent review of existing arrangements between Area Development Management Limited, Government Departments and other stakeholders. ADM dispenses more than &euro;100 million in public funds. Given the original social partnership context and EU related functions of ADM and the current services provided by the company, I am sure Deputies will agree that such a review is both a timely and essential part of any attempt to review and improve structures for the delivery of these programmes.</P>
    <P>The third element is a requirement that various local agencies and boards submit their business plans to city or county development boards for endorsement, in order to support greater coherence at local level. A local authority area based approach provides a manageable and comprehendible locus for measuring the expenditure and impact of programmes and schemes for communities.</P>
    <P>I and my ministerial colleagues hope to be in a position to bring proposals for change arising from this process to Government in late 2003.</P>
    <P>These initiatives are a sensible and practical approach to this important and complex task. The comprehensive consultation process, which is at the heart of the process, allows us to draw on the commitment and the expertise of those engaged at a community and local level. My overall objective is to secure the most positive impacts for communities from expenditure through programmes in this area. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 131, 160 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>Under the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, ten regional drugs task forces (RDTFs) are being set up in the ten health board regions throughout the country. A list of the regions and their administrative headquarters follows.</P>
      <P>The RDTFs will represent a team-based response to illicit drug use. Each task force will be chaired by an independent chairperson and will be made up of nominees from state agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sector and elected public representatives. The RDTF members will work in partnership, in a manner similar to the local drugs task forces.</P>
      <P>The existing regional drug co-ordinators will act as interim co-ordinators for the RDTFs. Given their knowledge and experience of the local drug problem and their relationship with local agencies and groups, the co-ordinators will greatly facilitate the setting up and initial development of the task forces.</P>
      <P>The national drugs strategy team is overseeing the establishment of the RDTFs and has prepared guidelines for their operation in consultation with the relevant sectors and agencies. The team met the interim co-ordinators in January and again in late February to discuss the guidelines and to exchange information and experience. The aim is to convene the first meeting of each task force shortly after Easter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of an early warning system to track the potential spread of heroin into new areas, my officials have held discussions with a range of Departments and agencies involved in tackling drug misuse. Arising from these discussions, it is planned that the early warning sub-committee of the national advisory committee on drugs, which contains membership from a range of relevant Departments and agencies, including my Department, will fulfil the role outlined in the programme for Government. The sub-committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow and at that meeting it will consider how best to put the system in place.</P>
      <P>While heroin misuse remains predominantly a Dublin problem, I am aware that the problem has begun to emerge in a number of provincial centres. I am also aware that drug misuse &ndash; in many different forms &ndash; is occurring throughout the country. The Deputies should note that the regional drugs task forces will have a key role to play in this area as they will have responsibility for identifying the nature and extent of the drug problem in their regions and for putting strategies in place to combat drug misuse.</P>
      <P>These strategies will, where appropriate, include plans for tackling heroin misuse.</P>

      <P>The grant-in-aid for general expenses for the Western Development Commission for 2003 is &euro;1,385,000 compared to &euro;1,413,000 in 2002. I am satisfied that despite this 2% reduction, the commission will be able to operate effectively this year.</P>

      <P>I consider the development of the rural agri-tourism sector to be a key factor in ensuring the improved well being of rural areas. I established the rural agri-tourism advisory group to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the sector and put forward practical suggestions to enable the sector to develop.</P>
      <P>The inaugural meeting of the rural agri-tourism advisory group was held on 28 February. The functions of the group include: To identify and consider opportunities for the development of the rural agri-tourism sector and related employment activity; to enable coherent guidelines to be brought forward, on the expenditure by Leader groups, on the rural agri-tourism measure; to provide guidance on consistency of practice within Leader groups in relation to rural-agritourism issues.</P>
      <P>A key function of the group is to advise my Department on all issues relating to the operational aspects and funding provided under the national development plan for the promotion of rural agri-tourism of the national rural development programme and to ensure a coherent strategy is in place to ensure its effective delivery.</P>
      <P>The programme is implemented by my Department, via Leader groups, as a measure under the Southern and Eastern Operational Programme and the Border, Midlands and Western Operational Programme. The budget for the measure in the two regional operational programmes is &euro;30 million over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>
      <P>The following organisations nominated members to the group: Irish Farmhouse Holidays; Comhar Leader 2 members; IFA, rural development committee; ICMSA, rural development committee; Western Development Commission, rural tourism steering group; Irish Countrywomen's Association; Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism;Bord Failte; The Irish Sports Council; the regional tourism authorities; Shannon Development; Teagasc;Udarás na Gaeltacht-Gaelsaoire.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 113 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. He agrees with the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals under the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 to extend the range of on-farm rural development measures to promote food quality, meet higher standards and foster animal welfare. However, the Commission is also proposing to introduce a system of modulation, which would reduce direct payments to farmers receiving more than &euro;5,000 a year to provide funds for such rural development. My colleague has made his overall objection to the proposals clear in the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers and his objective in the negotiations is to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food continues to keep me apprised of the progress of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Rural development in the context of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy is farm-related, and not wider rural development as is generally understood here.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rural development programmes for which I have responsibility, principally Leader, the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations will not affect existing financial commitments under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>However, my Department will work closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in the coming period to ensure that coherent rural development policies are pursued, so that the effects of any changes in farm related policies do not impact negatively on rural development generally.</P>
      <P>The mid-term review of the national development plan being carried out currently will also assist in terms of assessing the effectiveness of expenditure in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 118 and 166 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I established an advisory committee in October 2002 to advise me on the actions necessary to give practical implementation, where appropriate, to proposals contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta. On foot of recent discussions by the committee, I have decided to commission a comprehensive linguistic study of Irish usage in the Gaeltacht areas. This study will form the basis for the linguistic development of the Gaeltacht as an <Col N="1329" /> Irish-speaking area and for a review of Gaeltacht boundaries.</P>
    <P>The precise terms of reference for the study are currently being finalised by my Department having regard to the views of the advisory committee and it is proposed to invite tenders for the study from interested parties by way of normal public tendering procedures as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Other issues and initiatives being considered or progressed by the advisory committee include: the linguistic impact of planning policy in the Gaeltacht; proposals for an action plan aimed at emphasising to parents the benefits of choosing Irish as the primary household language in Gaeltacht areas;the preparation of a submission in regard to critical issues affecting the Irish language in primary and post-primary education in the Gaeltacht; proposals for the re-structuring of pre-school education in the Gaeltacht; recommendations in regard to new structures for youth organisations in the Gaeltacht; and the review of schemes which play a significant role in strengthening the use of Irish in Gaeltacht areas, namely Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge and the language assistants' scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has initiated discussions with a number of relevant Departments in relation to specific issues arising out of the ongoing work of the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>It should be recognised that the successful outcome of the recommendations of the advisory committee in general is largely dependent on the co-operation of all who have a stake in the future of Irish as a language in Gaeltacht areas, not least of which are the Gaeltacht communities as well as relevant Departments and State agencies.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there has been a steady decline in the numbers availing of the student summer job scheme in the past five years. Since 1998, the take up has dropped significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This trend reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs in recent years. In this context and in the light of financial pressures on my Department, I have decided to discontinue the student summer job scheme in 2003. I have, however, requested the area based partnerships to consider alternative measures to assist students from disadvantaged areas in finding suitable summer employment.</P>

      <P>The young people's facilities and services fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.</P>
      <P>Since the YPFSF was launched in 1998, &euro;68 million has been allocated under round 1 of the fund to support approximately 350 facility and services projects, mostly in local drugs task force areas. As outlined in my reply to the Deputy's question yesterday, funding for the YPFSF transferred from the vote of the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2003. Some &euro;15.877 million has been provided for the YPFSF to meet both current and capital commitments in 2003. The Deputy will be aware that the fund is focused on areas which have traditionally been marked by a dearth of facilities and services for young people. Accordingly, I am determined to maximise the impact of the funding available for the YPFSF in 2003, so that the valuable work undertaken by the fund up to now can be consolidated and built upon.</P>

      <P>In my reply to Question No. 120 from the Deputy on 12 February, I referred to the creation of a group to advise my Department on rural tourism issues, including the issue of access to walkways. The inaugural meeting of this group was held on 28 February. Membership of the group includes the farming organisations, including the Irish Farmers Association, rural organisations, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Irish Sports Council and tourism promotion groups.</P>
      <P>I addressed the inaugural meeting of the group, and in relation to the issue of access to walkways, I made clear that in my view that a local community based approach was the way forward. Following the inaugural meeting, officials from my Department are to meet interested parties and draw up a discussion document on the issue. I met the Irish Farmers Association on 6 March. The issue of open access to the countryside was mentioned in passing but not discussed at this meeting. I have in the past made clear my position that the concept of open access to the countryside is fundamental, subject to the constitutional provisions on private property. I have also made clear my view that any proposal for Exchequer payment for access would not be acceptable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process of drawing up the first strategy statement for the newly established Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, a review was carried out of the range of departmental schemes and policies, including those in relation to the Irish language. In so far <Col N="1332" /> as Irish language policy is concerned, the process identified a number of critical issues to be addressed over the period 2003-05, including the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Irish Language in the Gaeltacht; language planning, followed by the implementation of a focused action plan; and the provision of Irish-medium education at all levels.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of public services through Irish, the Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2002 has particular policy relevance and key tasks will include implementing its provisions, particularly by working with Departments and other public bodies to put in place agreed new schemes and structures regarding service provision through Irish and establishing an operating structure for the Official Languages Commissioner. Other key tasks will include rolling out, on a broad front, a series of practical, costed measures to strengthen Irish as the principal community language in the Gaeltacht and supporting Foras na Gaeilge in its task of increasing the use of the Irish language in everyday life throughout the island.</P>

      <P>My Department's overall goal with regard to rural, Gaeltacht and islands development is to promote and maintain living and working populations in rural and Gael<Col N="1333" /> tacht areas and on the islands by helping to foster sustainable and culturally vibrant communities in those areas. Among the key strategies underpinning this overall goal are those aimed at promoting traditional cultures, including the strengthening of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>The key outputs that my Department will be pursuing in this context will be the funding of cultural projects supported by the new Leader programme, which I launched in November 2001 while Minister for State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and which now falls within the remit of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; and to continue to fund various projects aimed at supporting and strengthening the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, both through schemes administered by my Department and by Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme includes specific measures that focus on culture and provide funding aimed at promoting traditional cultural activities. In relation to the introduction of initiatives aimed at strengthening the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, the Deputy will be aware that I have established an advisory committee in order to advise me on the measures necessary to implement, where appropriate, recommendations in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta. The advisory committee's recommendations will form the basis of action plans which will have deliverable targets and are aimed at strengthening the language in Gaeltacht communities.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, in so far as is possible and in the context of available resources, to implement these action plans as the work of the committee progresses. I have also decided to commission a comprehensive linguistic study of Irish usage in the Gaeltacht areas as a basis for the linguistic development of the Gaeltacht as an Irish-speaking area and for a review of Gaeltacht boundaries. The Deputy will also be aware that the Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2002 will be of particular relevance in terms of providing a statutory framework for the improved provision to the people of the Gaeltacht of public services through Irish by Departments and other public bodies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Public funding of almost &euro;150 million has been <Col N="1334" /> allocated to the Leader programmes over the period. The national rural development programme was introduced through the BMW and S&amp;E regional operational programmes by the Government as a co-funded measure to complement the EU initiative Leader+, as not all rural areas could benefit from Leader+. Under the previous Leader 2 programme 1994-99 all rural areas were covered by the initiative.</P>
    <P>Following negotiations with the European Commission, Leader+ activity was secured in 22 areas and NRDP funding for the 13 remaining rural areas. Funding for agri-rural tourism is provided from this programme on a nation-wide basis. In addition, collective bodies which are not eligible under Leader+ receive assistance under this programme. The programme was launched and contract agreements were signed with the groups on 6 November 2001. The programme is proceeding and I am satisfied local groups are fully operational and allocating funding in line with their contract commitments and working to meet their targets over the programme period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 133, 144 and 159 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that my Department, supported by Area Development Management Ltd., co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, however, a matter for individual Departments to advance and report on progress on implementing RAPID proposals that fall within the remit of their areas. While the <Col N="1336" /> scale of the proposals in the RAPID plans is large, nevertheless, progress in implementing the plans has been slower than anticipated. While the Government remains fully committed to RAPID, the delivery of the programme may require adjustment. I am currently looking, at options to bring about greater progress under the programme, and I am in discussions with my Cabinet colleagues as to how best this might be achieved.</P>
    <P>As regards my Department, proposals from the RAPID plans fall to be considered under the young people's facilities and services fund, the community development programme and funding for local drugs task forces. In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round 2 and in light of the overall funding position for 2003. A number of proposals in RAPID plans relate to the community development programme. My Department announced allocations of funding to six new community development projects in RAPID areas yesterday. Projects in Bluebell, Dolphin House, Inchicore, Merchants Quay-Ushers Quay, Longford Town and Tipperary each received a renewable one year contract for funding of &euro;60,000.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals from RAPID plans are also being pursued through the local drugs task force plans. In terms of staffing issues, the Deputies will appreciate that the allocation of specific staff to deal with the RAPID programme is a matter for individual Departments. However, following a series of meetings between my Department and other Departments during 2002, I am satisfied that Departments have put in place sufficient staff resources to deal with the RAPID programme.</P>

      <P>My Department is represented on both the Civil Service Users Network and the interdepartmental working group on freedom of information. The views of the membership of these fora, both on the general operation of the Act and on specific issues, were conveyed to the central policy unit of the Department of Finance on an ongoing basis. Doubtless these were considered in the context of the current review. The Deputy will also appreciate that, as a member of the Government, I have participated in Cabinet discussions on the Freedom of Information Bill and, in that context, reflected the experience and views of my Department.</P>

      <P>Tuigtear dom go mbaineann an Cheist seo leis an infrastruchtúr pobail agus sóisialta sa Ghaeltacht. Faoi Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin Gaeltachta mo Roinne-se, cuirtear deontais chaipitil ar fáil chun áiseanna ar nós hallaí pobail, páirceanna imeartha agus áiseanna eile a fhorbairt nó a fheabhsú sa Ghaeltacht agus chun scéimeanna d'athnuachan baile sa Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt. Trí fheabhsú an bhonneagair ar an dóigh sin, tá sé de chuspóir ag mo Roinnse cur le saol sóisialta agus cultúrtha na gceantar Gaeltachta agus, dá réir sin, an Ghaeilge a neartú mar theanga phobail. Tá sé i gceist agam leanúint arís i mbliana leis an gclár oibre seo agus tá &euro;10.294 million curtha ar fáil dom sna Meastacháin lena aghaidh. Chomh maith leis sin, íoctar deontais faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) le hiarratasóirí cáilithe sa Ghaeltacht chun tithe nua a thógáil agus chun feabhas a chur ar thithe atá ann cheana, rud a chuireann go mór leis an infrastruchtúr sóisialta. Tá &euro;4 million curtha ar fáil i mbliana chun na deontais tithíochta sin a íoc.</P>
      <P>Anuas ar na scéimeanna thuasluaite, tá &euro;6.129 million curtha ar fáil i leith oibreacha caipitil ar na hoileáin amach ón gcósta i 2003, na hoileáin Ghaeltachta san áireamh. Caithfear an t-airgead seo ar thograí a chuireann le forbairt na n-oileán idir leas eacnamaíochta agus leas sóisialta. I 2003 tá &euro;2.35 million ar fáil sa chiste reatha do na hoileáin agus caithfear an t-airgead seo ar sheirbhísí farantóireachta agus aeir do na hoileáin go príomha. I measc na n-oileán Ghaeltachta a bheidh ag fáil buntáiste ón gciste reatha i 2003 tá na trí hOileáin Árainn, Oileán Thoraí, Oileán Árainn Mhóir agus Oileán Cléire.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a key aspect of my Department's work is the co-ordination of Government policy on the islands. This is mainly achieved through the work of the interdepartmental committee for the islands and resulting bilateral contacts with other Departments. Among the positive outcomes achieved through this forum, which have had the effect of reducing the cost of living on the islands, are: an extra &euro;12.70 per week for islanders over age 66 who are in receipt of various categories of Department of Social and Family Affairs payments, payment of which was announced in Budget 2000; a special rate of &euro;66 in respect of road tax for island cars which was introduced with effect from 1 April 2001; the introduction by the Department of Education and Science since September 2001 of a significant increase, from &euro;2,539 to &euro;3,809, in the level of remote area boarding grant payable in respect of island children attending secondary school on the mainland; and an extra &euro;12.70 per week for islanders under age 66 who are in receipt of various categories of Department of Social and Family Affairs payment which was announced in Budget 2002.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the extra construction costs incurred by islanders, in 1999 my Department's new house grant available to eligible Gaeltacht island applicants was increased from &euro;7,618 to &euro;15,300, while in 2000 the house improvement grant on such islands was increased from &euro;4,380 to &euro;15,300. As the Deputy will appreciate, these increases have helped considerably in offsetting the additional costs involved in constructing or improving houses on the Gaeltacht islands.</P>
      <P>On transport costs incurred by islanders, my Department, in 2002, paid a total of &euro;2.1million in subsidies towards the provision of ferry and air services to the islands. The benefit of these subsidies is in providing guaranteed scheduled services throughout the year and in helping to ensure that the services are available at a reasonable cost to islanders. While considerable progress has been made to date in reducing the cost of living on the islands, it is my intention to continue to examine ways of making further progress in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>the measures which have been introduced to encourage and facilitate communities with a special focus on areas of disadvantage to pursue social and economic progress in their areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is responsible for a wide range of schemes designed to support the social and economic development of communities both urban and rural, across the country. Following is a brief summary of these schemes:</P>
      <P>The local development and social inclusion programme is delivered across three sub-measures &ndash; services to the unemployed; community development; and community based youth initiatives. The programme is delivered on the ground by 38 partnerships and 33 community groups. There is a provision of &euro;44 million approximately in my Department's vote for this programme in 2003.</P>
      <P>The RAPID programme is a focused initiative designed to prioritise and target Government expenditure, over a number of Departments, on the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. There are two strands to the programme. Strand 1 targets 25 urban areas while strand 2 targets 20 provincial towns around the country.</P>
      <P>The local drugs task forces operate in areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. The role of the LDTFs is to prepare local action plans which include a range of measures to tackle drug misuse in the areas of treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply. In total, the Government has allocated more than &euro;51 million to implement the projects in the plans of the task forces since 1997 and a further &euro;11.5 million has been allocated to community based drugs projects, most of which are based in the LDTF areas, under the premises initiative. The total 2003 allocation for drugs related projects is &euro;16.159 million, the bulk of which is for LDTF projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. An amount of approximately &euro;68 million has been allocated to date under the first round of funding. Some &euro;15.877 million has been allocated to the fund for 2003. More than &euro;21 million has been provided for 2003 under the <Col N="1340" /> community development support programme and programme of core funding for community and family support groups, administered as part of the social inclusion measure of the National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>
    <P>The community development programme is designed to develop a network of community development projects in communities experiencing high unemployment, poverty and disadvantage. The programme provides funding towards staff overhead and administration costs associated with running a resource centre. There are currently 153 projects receiving funding or approved in principle for inclusion in the programme. The programme of core funding for community and family support groups provides support for smaller scale self-help work in specific target groups that experience disadvantage. At present, there are some 50 groups participating in the programme or in the process of being set up. Funding under these programmes assists in relation to the needs of women and children, those with disabilities, the homeless, lone parent families, the elderly, the unemployed, young people at risk, Traveller and other disadvantaged groups. A further &euro;2.4 million has been provided for grant schemes which concentrate on a wide range of supports for local self help groups and community development and on the provision of seed money to enable groups to pilot initiatives to meet new and emerging community needs.</P>
    <P>My Department also has a significant role in the implementation of the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation established in 1995 to promote cross-Border peace and reconciliation through the economic development of the communities most affected by the conflict and geographical isolation. The programme is targeted at the six southern Border counties and Northern Ireland. An amount of &euro;12.49 million has been allocated for PEACE in the Department's vote in 2003. Of this allocation some &euro;11 million has been provided for the support of those aspects of the programme administered on behalf of the Department by ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency. The remaining &euro;1.44 million is allocated for the rural development aspects of the joint cross-Border programmes.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;1.309 million has been allocated in 2003 to the various INTERREG measures under the remit of my Department. The strategic focus of the rural initiative measure in the joint INTERREG Ireland-Northern Ireland programme is on the development of integrated area based strategies to address rural disadvantage. The measure is aimed at area-based cross-border regeneration groups which can be developed, managed, administered and delivered jointly in four to five small geographically defined areas of rural disadvantage. A sum of &euro;0.627 million has been allocated to this measure in 2003.</P>
    <P>My Department also has a specific role in the development of cross-Border community infrastructure measure, which aims to give people in border regions the opportunity to take part in the <Col N="1341" /> development of their communities. Responsibility for this aspect of the INTERREG programme is shared with the Department of Social Development in Northern Ireland. A sum of &euro;0.133 million has been allocated to this measure in 2003. Under the joint INTERREG Ireland-Wales programme, support is being provided, in the eligible area, for joint projects promoting rural business skills, rural tourism, rural health and on and off farm diversification to compliment agricultural activities. An amount of &euro;0.549 million has been allocated for this measure in 2003.</P>
    <P>The EU Leader programmes administered by my Department provides funding to local groups to develop their own areas. In line with the bottom-up philosophy of Leader, the local group is the decision-making authority on funding for projects in their own locality, subject to compliance with EU rules and regulations. There is a strong community focus in the programmes and substantial funding is directed towards community type projects. While the programmes do not have a special focus on areas of disadvantage the activities of Leader groups in implementing projects have a positive effect on areas of disadvantage. An amount of &euro;11.806 million has been allocated for this programme in 2003, while a further of &euro;9.457 million has been allocated to the area-based rural development initiative which focuses on the development of integrated area based strategies to address rural disadvantage.</P>
    <P>CLÁR funds and provides co-funding to Departments, State agencies and local authorities in accelerating investment in selected priority developments. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure across a variety of measures electricity, roads, water and sewerage, enhancement, community initiatives and islands. The provision for this programme in 2003 is &euro;9.517 million. My Department is also responsible for the administration of a range of measures designed to facilitate and support the development of Gaeltacht and island communities.  In 2003 &euro;6.129 million is available in the Department's vote for capital grants in respect of economic and social development on the offshore islands and &euro;2.35 million is available in respect of subsidies for operation of ferry-air services between certain islands and the mainland.</P>
    <P>In addition to current funding of &euro;8.72 million, capital funding of &euro;24 million has been made available to Údarás na Gaeltachta in 2003 to achieve its objectives of developing the economy of the Gaeltacht and encouraging the preservation and the extension of the Irish language as the principal language of the Gaeltacht community. Údarás also promotes and supports community development and pursues a range of language and cultural activities involving individuals, community groups and industries throughout the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Under the Gaeltacht improvement schemes capital grants are available for the development of maritime works in the Gaeltacht, the improvement of Gaeltacht roads, the provision and <Col N="1342" /> improvement of amenities, such as community halls, sports fields and other facilities. By improving the infrastructure, these grants are aimed at adding to the social, cultural and economic life of the Gaeltacht areas, as well as strengthening the Irish language as the community language within such areas. A provision of &euro;10.294 million has been made for these schemes in 2003.</P>
    <P>Grants are also made available from my Department to qualified applicants in Gaeltacht areas to build new homes for themselves and to improve their existing homes. A provision of &euro;4 million has been made for this purpose in 2003. Gaeltacht households which accommodate Irish students while they are attending Irish summer colleges in their locality are paid a grant by my Department for this purpose. The Irish summer colleges play a vital role in the local economy in the Gaeltacht &ndash; particularly in the more disadvantaged areas. An annual grant is also paid to households in Gaeltacht areas who use the Irish language as their normal everyday language and this grant helps foster the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas. An allocation of &euro;6.88 million has been made for these schemes in 2003. My Department also has a &euro;8.479 million funding in 2003 for islands to ensure the development of infrastructure and services on offshore islands. A key objective for my Department is the achievement of the optimal level of co-ordination and synergy across these many schemes.</P>

I established the rural/agri-tourism advisory group to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the sector and put forward practical suggestions to enable the sector to develop. The inaugural meeting of the advisory group was held on 28 February. I addressed the inaugural meeting of the group and made clear my desire for a community-based solution in relation to access to walkways.

      <P>Cé nach bhfuil measúnú foirmeálta déanta maidir leis an gcostas a bhainfidh le feidhmiú iomlán an Bhille, is léir go mbeidh costais bhreise i gceist, go háirithe ag an tús. Is cinnte go mbeidh éagsúlacht i gcúinsí Roinn amháin seachas Roinn eile maidir le seirbhísí a chur ar fail i nGaeilge agus, go deimhin, go mbeidh buntáiste ag Ranna éagsúla thar Ranna eile maidir leis na hacmhainní a bheidh acu leis an éileamh ar sheirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a shásamh. Tá Ranna Stáit/comhlachtaí poiblí áirithe ag feidhmiú polasaí dátheangach ar leibhéal éagsúla cheana féin .i. eagráin dhátheangacha do thuarascálacha bliantúla, ráitis straitéise, foirmeacha iarratais, bileoga eolais srl. á fhoilsiú. Tógann na comhlachtaí seo na costais ar bhord gan maoiniú faoi leith a lorg.</P>
      <P>Go ginearálta, meastar nach mbeidh costas breise substaintiúil ag titim ar aon Roinn/comhlacht poiblí mar thoradh ar fheidhmiú an Bhille, os cionn na costais a thiteann orthu de bharr a ndualgas i ndáil le cinneadh an Rialtais i mí Iúil 2000 glacadh le &ldquo;Comhionannas Teangacha Oifigiúla&rdquo; mar cheann de trí phrionsabal nua maidir le seirbhís ardchaighdeáin do chustaiméirí. Sonraítear faoin bprionsabal seo go ndéanfaidh an Státchoras seirbhísí d'ardchaigheáin a shólathar i nGaeilge agus/nó go dátheangach agus go gcuirfear in iúl do chustaiméirí go bhfuil an ceart acu a roghnú go ndéileáilfear leo i gceann amháin de na teangacha oifigiúla. Sin ráite, is léir go mbeidh costais bhreise i gceist do na réimsí seo a leanas: Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a bhunú, costas traenála, seirbhísí dhátheangacha agus seirbhísí aistriúcháin. Ní féidir, áfach, an costas a bheadh i gceist d'aon Roinn nó d'aon chomhlacht stáit a mheas, go dtí go mbíonn an scéim a bhaineann leo aontaithe.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 222, 223, 225 and 226 together.</P>
      <P>My views on the dispersed rural populations are well known to members of the House. I have spoken many times on the need for a settlement pattern that would allow for the regeneration of rural areas, particularly those which have suffered continuous decline. Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in August 1999. As a result the Government is committed to ensuring the economic and social well being of rural communities and providing the conditions for a meaningful fulfilling life for all people living in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The aim is to have vibrant and sustainable communities able to enjoy a standard of living and quality of life which will make them attractive communities in which to live and work and where individuals and families will have a real choice as to whether to stay in, leave or move to rural Ireland, whether in farming or otherwise. Rural communities should also be able to enjoy access to education, training and lifelong learning and an adequate level of social and other services and infrastructures. Their cultural identities, in particular the language, traditions, heritage and sense of community must be valued and retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my statement welcoming the publication of the national spatial strategy in November 2002, I said the strategy sets down clear markers for the way ahead in rural development. The strategy addresses many of my concerns about such issues as rural housing, services and cultural identity. As further evidence of the Government's commitment, I launched the CLÁR programme for dis<Col N="1345" /> advantaged rural areas in October 2001, during my time as Minister of State with responsibility for rural development. In January 2003, I announced the extension of CLÁR areas arising from the review based on the 2002 population census, as promised in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>An Taisce participated in a discussion on rural planning which I arranged at the meeting of the National Rural Development Forum, held by me in Maam Cross in November 2001. I have not had any discussions with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and An Taisce on the lines referred to by the Deputy. My Department has, however, at my request been in touch with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's Department in the context of follow up to the national spatial strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the local development social inclusion programme is delivered on the ground by 38 area partnerships and 33 community groups. The programme is delivered across three sub-measures &ndash; services to the unemployed, community development and community based youth initiatives. The needs of the unemployed on the live register and, indeed, the under-employed &ndash; in terms of training, education and up-skilling &ndash; are taken into account under the LDSIP which aims to counter disadvantage and promote social and economic inclusion by specifically targeting those individuals and communities most in need. Throughout all of the actions and across the three sub-measures there is a commitment to developing linkages and networks with other agencies and organisations to ensure that the work of the programme continues to be dynamic and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my Department's primary objectives is to maximise the impact, coherence and effectiveness of the local and community development programmes for which it is responsible. As a first step towards achieving this objective, I am undertaking a review of the structures that fall within the remit of my Department, with a view to <Col N="1346" /> achieving greater coherence across the various initiatives. Particular proposals narrowly focusing on the future of partnerships are not under consideration. The views of the relevant parties, including area partnerships will, be sought and considered in the context of this review.</P>

      <P>In recent years, this Government and its predecessors have been committed to revitalising the islands by improving the quality of life of island dwellers. This is being done through investment in island infrastructure and services such as ferry and air transport, electricity supply, health and education. Much progress has been made in the period since mid-1997 and the level of funding available to my Department for island development has risen from under &euro;2.5 million in 1997 to almost &euro;8.5 million this year. In 2003 alone, &euro;6.129 million has been provided for essential physical infrastructure such as piers, roads and water supply schemes on the islands, with a further &euro;2.35 million being provided for subsidised transport services thereto.</P>
      <P>It is my considered view that proper access infrastructure and safe regular transport are prerequisites for the economic development of the islands. With this in mind, transport services to all the main islands have been significantly improved since 1997, together with the pier infrastructure serving the islands of Counties Donegal and Cork. In addition, my Department is about to embark on a major programme of investment in pier infrastructure serving the islands of Counties Mayo and Galway over the coming years. In tandem with this work, the next major challenge for my Department is to provide sustainable employment through the economic development of the islands. Údarás na Gaeltachta will have a vital role to play in this regard in encouraging sustainable economic development on the Gaeltacht islands, particularly in the context of the Irish language being a major resource for creating high-quality employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" />In addition to this, both myself and the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Harney, are actively considering the introduction of an enterprise fund for the non-Gaeltacht Islands as a joint initiative between our two Departments. It is envisaged that this fund will help to assist entrepreneurs who wish to create valuable jobs in island settings where traditionally communities have had to depend on tourism and small scale farming and fishing to make a living for themselves. I am confident that this proposed initiative will be met with a positive reaction and, more importantly, will see a large uptake amongst island communities, thus strengthening their future economic viability.</P>

      <P>Irish language schemes in the Gaeltacht are continually kept under review with a view to making them more effective and suitable for today's needs. Among the schemes in regard to which reviews have been completed or commenced since 2000 are: the Irish summer colleges scheme; Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge; Gaeltacht summer camps; and the Gaeltacht Irish language assistants scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, a new Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act relevant to Gaeltacht housing grants was enacted in 2001. Furthermore, the Gaeltacht roads scheme was extended in 2000 to include strategic roads in the Gaeltacht and a new strategic plan for Gaeltacht piers is also being implemented.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162, 165, 218 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the RAPID programme is a focused initiative by Government to target the 45 most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the country. Strand 1 targets 25 urban areas and strand 2 targets 20 provincial towns around the country. My Department, supported by Area Development Management, ADM, Limited oversees the implementation of the programme.</P>
      <P>My Department is working closely with Departments to oversee and, where necessary, identify ways of improving implementation of the programme. In addition, a national monitoring committee, with an independent chairperson, was established to oversee implementation of the programme at national level and to report to Government on its implementation. This committee comprises representatives from all relevant Departments, State agencies, the community and voluntary sectors and other groups as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" />As the Deputies will be aware, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established against a background of concern at the multiplicity of structures through which schemes and programmes relating to community and local development are delivered. One of my Department's primary objectives is to maximise the impact, coherence and effectiveness of the programmes for which it is responsible. I am working closely with my ministerial colleagues, particularly the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, so as to deliver the most effective support possible.</P>
    <P>As a first step, I am undertaking a review of the structures that fall within the remit of my Department, with a view to maximising optimal coherence across the carious schemes. I am consulting with all the relevant parties, ADM area partnerships, ADM funded community groups, community development projects, core funded groups, Leader groups, local drugs task forces and the area implementation teams and all views will be considered in the context of this review. I want to ensure that expenditure on such programmes has a positive impact on the communities involved, particularly in communities in designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In regard to CLÁR, the measures introduced under the programme were decided after consultation with the communities in the areas concerned. Furthermore, they are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments or agencies, as appropriate, thus ensuring efficiency and effectiveness as well as meeting the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas. I intend to continue this practice in relation to any new measures I may introduce under this programme. Equally, I will keep under review the operation of existing measures.</P>
    <P>As regards RAPID in County Kerry, Tralee is one of the towns that was selected under strand 2. An area implementation team was established in Tralee to prepare a plan for the area. This plan was approved at county development board level before being sent to ADM. Proposals from the plan were then forwarded to relevant Departments for consideration. Departments have begun to carry out specific actions to progress the area action plans.</P>
    <P>The expenditure in County Kerry to date under the CLÁR programme is &euro;1,484,133 out of total expenditure of &euro;14,485,000. An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to annual funding for the CLÁR programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in the light of the 2002 population census results.</P>
    <P>The Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these on 17 January last. In the case of Kerry, seven DEDs have been added, bringing to 71 the number of DEDs in the county now included in the programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that my Department has responsibility for community and local development, including delivery of the Leader and CLÁR programmes.</P>
      <P>The Bantry Bay coastal zone charter contacted my Department in February 2003 regarding the funding of this project and was advised that it might pursue the possibility of funding the project through the Leader programmes and might make a formal proposal to the local Leader group, West Cork Leader Co-operative Limited. Leader is the EU community initiative for rural development that provides approved local action groups with public funding &ndash; EU and national &ndash; to implement multi-sectoral business plans for the development of their own areas.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme is operated in accordance with the bottom-up philosophy of rural development, which means that the local Leader group is the decision-making authority in relation to approving actions falling within its business plan.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the funding of projects directly by my Department under the Leader programme is prohibited by the EU regulations. I understand that my colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and his Department are currently developing a national strategy that will deliver a more strategic approach to coastal areas generally and their resources. Legislative proposals to support the development and effective operation of integrated coastal zone management will be formulated in co-operation with other public bodies. I understand that the intention is to publish legislative proposals in 2004.</P>

      <P>From 17 April 2003 the seating order at meetings of the Council will be adjusted to include the ten acceding states. The seats of the member states will continue to be arranged in the current order of Presidency rotation which reflects a number of factors including alphabetical order and which has been agreed until 2006. The seats of the acceding states will be included in alphabetical order and alternating with those of the existing member states as described.</P>
      <P>The location of the acceding states in the seating order will begin after the member state assuming the next Presidency of the European Union. The practical effect of this will be that the Czech Republic will be seated immediately to the right of Ireland which assumes the Presidency on 1 January 2004. The Council has agreed to decide on the question of the order of the presidencies for 2007 and onwards as soon as possible and at the latest one year after accession of the new member states.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the European convention is currently discussing how an enlarging Union should organise itself to ensure continuing effectiveness. One of the most important issues to which the convention is giving consideration is the future of the Presidency function. Ireland continues to believe that the key advantages of the rotating Presidency should be preserved. We are open to discussion as to the means of achieving this objective. We have been particularly interested in detailed further work on the team Presidency concept.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports of difficulties encountered by the Greek Catholic Church in Romania, particularly in relation to the question of the restitution of property following the end of the communist era. Following the establishment of a communist government in Romania after the Second World War, the Romanian authorities effected a union between the Greek Catholic Church, which recognises the authority of the Holy See, and the Romanian Orthodox Church. Places of worship and other properties belonging to the Greek Catholic Church, and also those belonging to the Reformed Church, were nationalised and then transferred to the Orthodox Church in 1948. After the fall of communism in Romania, the question of restitution arose when the Orthodox Church did not restore places of worship to the <Col N="1356" /> Greek Catholic Church. For its part, the then Romanian Government took the view that this was a private dispute and refrained from seeking any legal solution or ordering restitution of any property.</P>

The timing of when this project can progress to tender and construction is dependent on the funding allocation in 2004 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated resource teaching support to 127 primary schools in County Kerry. Some 114 of these schools have sanction for at least one resource teacher on a full-time or shared basis. The remaining 13 schools have resource teacher provision in the form of part-time hours. Some 17 primary schools in the county do not have resource teacher support. This support is allocated to assist schools in providing an education which meets the needs of children assessed as having disabilities. My Department is continuing to allocate additional resource teacher support on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, the learning support-remedial teacher service was extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios were advised that they could seek a learning support service where they could demonstrate a need for such a service. There are currently 50 learning support posts in primary schools in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated additional teaching resources to cater for students with special needs to 26 of the 27 post primary schools in County Kerry. Of these, 14 schools have one or more full resource teaching posts and 12 schools have part-time provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the remedial education, all second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education since the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year. The general position is that schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post. Schools with enrolments below 600, which were specifically <Col N="1358" /> allocated a full post in respect of remedial education by my Department prior to the 1999-2000 school year, retain their entitlement to an allocation of a full post.</P>

The following schools in County Kerry have an allocation of one full post or more in respect of guidance: Mercy Secondary School, Mounthawk, Tralee; Coláiste Bhreannain, Killarney; the Intermediate School, Kilorglin; Presentation Secondary School, Listowel; CBS Secondary School, Tralee; Presentation Secondary School, Tralee; Coláiste na Sceilge, Cahirciveen; Causeway Comprehensive School, Tralee; and Tarbert Comprehensive School, Listowel.</P>
      <P>The following schools in County Kerry have an allocation ranging from 0.36 to 0.90 of a post in respect of guidance: St. Joseph's Secondary School, Ballybunion; Meán Scoil na mBraithre Críostaí, Daingean Uí Chuís; Meánscoil na Toirbhirte, Daingean Uí Chuís; St. Brigid's Secondary School, Killarney; Presentation Secondary School, Milltown, Killarney; Tralee Community College; Castleisland Community College; Killarney Community College; Scoil Phobail Sliabh Luachra, Rathmore; Pobal Scoil Inbhear Sceine; Meanscoil Naomh Ioseph, Castleisland; St. Michael's College, Listowel; Kilorglin Community College; Meánscoil Phádraig Naofa, Castleisland; Meanscoil An Leith Triuigh, Breanann, Trá Lí; Coláiste Íde, Baile an Ghoilín, Daingean Uí Chuís; Gaelcholoaiste Chiarraí, Tobar Mhaigh Dor, Trá Lí; and Listowel Community College.</P>
      <P>My Department makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance to all second level schools. The allocation ranges from 0.36 of a post &ndash; eight hours per week &ndash; in schools in the free education scheme with an enrolment of less than 200 pupils to two posts in the case of schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. In the case of certain fee paying schools, which are not in the free education scheme, 0.5 of a post is allocated in respect of these schools in the 350-499 enrolment category and a full post is allocated in the case of schools with 500 or more pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, certain schools have been allocated additional posts for guidance and counselling <Col N="1359" /> under the guidance enhancement initiative in order to enhance the provision of guidance to young people at risk, to improve links between schools and the world of work and to improve the take-up of science subjects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, a board of management of a school, with the agreement of the patron, shall publish and provide the policy of the school concerning expulsion of students, subject to the proviso that this decision may be appealed to the Secretary General of my Department under section 29(1)(<i>a</i>) of the aforementioned Act.</P>
      <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student, suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than 20 days in an academic year or expels a student from the school. An independent appeals mechanism is in place to deal with section 29 appeals. Under the Act, an appeal must be dealt with within 30 days with a provision for a 14-day extension to this period if required. As a matter of course, home tuition hours are sanctioned as an interim education provision while a section 29 appeal is proceeding. Where an appeal is upheld, the Secretary General may give such directions to the board of management of a school as appear expedient for the purpose of remedying the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department gives assistance in <Col N="1360" /> securing placement in individual cases where, for whatever reason including expulsion, a pupil is without a mainstream school place. This can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with schools and through the inspectorate to assist his or her placement in another school. In more difficult situations the National Educational Psychological Service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which came into effect on 5 July 2002, provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body, the National Educational Welfare Board. An educational welfare officer will be assigned to every school for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires schools considering the expulsion of a student to notify the educational welfare officer 20 school days prior to the expulsion. The automatic involvement of the educational welfare officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school. Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, the Education Welfare Board may itself invoke section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal a decision to expel a student.</P>

      <P>Children in infant classes attend school for a reduced daily period and the level of special needs assistant support they require is correspondingly reduced and is met through the allocation of part-time hours support. The duration of the service provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual children involved.</P>
      <P>Part-time special needs assistants are contracted to deliver a specified number of hours service per week in the schools in which they are employed and are paid at an hourly rate. Under current legislation, 8% of total earnings is paid to each part-time special needs assistant in respect of holiday pay.</P>
      <P>Overtime is not paid to special needs assistants who work more than the allocated hours. It is a matter for the schools management to determine the hours of work based on the number of hours allocated.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of employment for all special needs assistants is currently under review within my Department and when the issues have been finalised my Department will ensure that all relevant people are issued with guidelines on the matter.</P>

      <P>A copy of the guidelines for consulting children and young people was received by my Department earlier this month and are currently under consideration by my officials. I welcome the central tenet of these guidelines, which is to ensure that the voices of children and young people are heard in matters that affect them.</P>
      <P>Under section 27 of the Education Act 1998, students in a post-primary school may establish a student council, whose role is to promote the involvement of students in the affairs of the school in co-operation with the board of management, parents and teachers. This development originated in my Department's recognition that students have a voice and a contribution to make to their school and these councils can play an integral and important role in the school community by providing a representative structure through which students can debate issues of concern and undertake initiatives of benefit to the school and the wider community. Guidelines designed to aid schools and students in the establishment of student councils have been circulated by my Department to every second level school.</P>
      <P>A quality framework initiative for the Youthreach programme is currently being developed, the aim of which is to develop an appropriate quality assurance process for Youthreach, including the development of quality standard, good practice guidelines as well as internal and external evaluation mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Widespread consultation with all stakeholder groups was a fundamental component of this process. Consultation with trainees, aged 15 years and over, in Youthreach and senior Traveller training centres was accompanied by nine regional consultation seminars and the feedback collated from trainees will play an important part in the development of the quality framework initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Student participation has also been incorporated into the home school community liaison scheme which has been extended to all designated disadvantaged schools. The central focus of the scheme is the development of parents as the primary educators of their children, and it promotes active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies. Primary and post-primary students have been included in a number of the local committees established as <Col N="1363" /> part of the HSCL scheme. These committees, which also include representatives from voluntary and statutory agencies in the area, the principals of the local primary and post-primary schools, the local home school liaison co-ordinator, and marginalised parents, consider issues in the community that affect learning such as bullying, substance abuse, school attendance, homework clubs, and then identify the priority issues for their area.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, is the prescribed national representative voluntary youth work organisation in accordance with the provisions of section 24 of the Youth Work Act 2001. As such, it represents the views of approximately 35 major national and regional youth work organisations such as Foróige, National Youth Federation, scouts and guides. The NYCI is also represented on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, NYWAC, established under sections 17 and 18 of the Youth Work Act 2001. This committee has a role to advise and consult the Minister in relation to youth work. These provisions enable the NYCI to represent the views of young people in the area of non-formal education to the Minister.</P>
    <P>My Department contributed towards a research project undertaken as part of the National Forum on Primary Education: Ending Educational Disadvantage, which was convened by the Centre for Educational Disadvantage in St Patrick's College of Education in July 2002. The findings of this project have been published and involved 203 children in 16 sites across the country. This project was designed to elicit, in a creative and participatory way, the children's opinions and understandings about achieving equality in children's education.</P>

      <P>Secondary schools are privately owned and managed institutions and are the responsibility of the managerial authorities of the individual schools. Complaints should be addressed, in the first instance, to the secretary of the board of management of the school in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where issues remain unresolved and all local avenues of appeal have been exhausted, my Department may, on receipt of written authorisation of a pupil's parents, refer a complaint received, to the schools management authority concerned, for its observations. Following consideration of the school's response, the case may be referred to my Department inspec<Col N="1364" /> torate for the purpose of making local inquiries. The outcome of my Department's investigations, when complete, is communicated to the parents.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has moved to tackle the issue on a number of fronts. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum.</P>
    <P>The social, personal and health education programme is part of the curriculum in every primary school at present and by September 2003 will be a mandatory component of the junior cycle in all second level schools. The content of the programme reflects current best practice in the area of educating children in relation to bullying.</P>
    <P>As part of school development planning schools are advised to have stated policies and to develop plans on discipline, health and safety and countering bullying behaviour. Parental involvement in the planning process is encouraged. Through their representation on the board of management and through parents' associations parents can readily be consulted in the clarification and development of these policies and plans.</P>
    <P>Guidelines were put in place in 1994 as an aid to schools in devising their individual anti-bullying strategies. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. The national educational psychological service is also available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fully recognised to teach at primary level in this country and, therefore, be entitled to take up permanent posts, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification is usually achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised primary teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the post-graduate conversion courses. It is open to degree holders wishing to pursue a career in primary teaching to opt for the post-graduate diploma in primary teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognised secondary qualifications are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach <Col N="1365" /> in a permanent capacity in primary schools. At primary level teachers are class teachers, rather than subject specialists, and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. In order to obtain recognition to teach in mainstream primary schools second level teachers must undergo a post-graduate primary conversion course.</P>
    <P>However, under a temporary scheme operated by my Department to address the shortage of qualified teachers at primary level, secondary qualified teachers are remunerated at the trained rate of pay when they take up substitute or temporary positions in primary schools. Secondary teachers may also hold posts as resource teachers for pupils with special needs at primary level under this scheme. I emphasise however, that this is only a temporary scheme and secondary teachers could only hold such posts for the duration of the scheme. It should also be noted that under this scheme secondary teachers would not be eligible to hold posts as learning support teachers, as such teachers must be fully probated primary teachers.</P>
    <P>Recognised secondary teachers may also teach in special primary schools where a proportion of the pupils attending the special school are of post primary age, that is, 12 years or older, and where second level programmes are being provided by the school &ndash; for example, junior certificate elementary programme and leaving certificate applied programme.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream teaching posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of St. Ciaran's national school on 30 September 2001 was 71 pupils, which warranted a staffing of principal and two mainstream class teachers for the current school year. The enrolment on 30 September 2002 was 74 pupils, which warrants a staffing of principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2003-04 school year. As the agreed appointment figure for a third mainstream class teacher is 82 pupils, there is no basis on which my Department may sanction an additional teaching post in St. Ciaran's national school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 2002, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, announced the provision of 175 additional therapy training places to tackle the shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists as identified by the report, Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, which was undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in 2001. The announcement followed on the work of an inter-agency working group comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority, which was established to ensure the provision of these extra places and which considered proposals received from a number of third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the additional places is as follows: University College Cork, National University of Ireland, 25 places &ndash; bachelor of science in speech and language therapy, and 25 places &ndash; bachelor of science in occupational therapy; National University of Ireland, Galway, 25 places &ndash; bachelor of science in speech and language therapy, and 25 places &ndash; bachelor of science in occupational therapy; University of Limerick, 25 places &ndash; master of science in speech and language therapy, 25 places &ndash; master of science in occupational therapy, and 25 places &ndash; bachelor of science in physiotherapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an intake to the new physiotherapy course at the University of Limerick in 2002. Preparatory arrangements, including the recruitment of necessary staff, are being made by the institutions concerned to enable first intakes to the other additional courses to commence in 2003. These increases are in addition to previous increases in the number of places provided by institutions with existing courses in the 2000-01 and 2001-02 academic years, in response to a <Col N="1367" /> request by the Higher Education Authority to expand provision in light of perceived shortages.</P>
    <P>The provision of these extra places takes account of the full analysis set out in the Bacon report and is fully in line with the recommendations made. In this context, although the report acknowledges that even with these increases, the shortage of therapists will not be completely resolved for 15 to 20 years, it also emphasises that an attempt to provide a more immediate solution would risk moving the constraint to the clinical training point and lead to a considerable over-supply of training places in the long-term. The report also stresses the importance of ensuring that the number of places in the adjustment period does not depart greatly from the number which will be needed on an ongoing basis to maintain supply at its new higher level and suggests that one way to move towards this is to make the determination of the number of places as flexible as possible. Such flexibility has been delivered in the manner of the response to the Bacon recommendations through increasing the range of institutions contributing to future supply and widening the nature and type of courses which will be available. For example, the master of science courses in occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, which are due to come on line in the coming academic year, will allow for the release of graduates after two years, as opposed to the four years' duration of the bachelor of science course in these areas.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring the provision of the extra places agreed for the therapy areas in line with the expert recommendations of the Bacon report as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>The 2003 capital programme has been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. The project referred to by the Deputy is included in section 7 of the programme among the large scale post primary projects at an early stage of architectural planning &ndash; pre-planning permission. Having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, my Department does not envisage that it will be in a position during this year to allow architectural planning for further large scale projects to progress beyond their current stage. The project will, however, be <Col N="1368" /> considered in the context of the capital programme for 2004.</P>

      <P>The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003, which was signed by me on 13 March 2003, designates a range of sporting events as events of major importance to society which should, in the public interest, continue to be made available on Irish free television services. A copy of the order is available in the Oireachtas Library. In accordance with Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, the designation order will only have legal force after the European Commission has published a notice of the measures which Ireland has taken in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The Commission has indicated that a notice will appear in the journal shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition to the designation order, I have recently published a Bill designed to strengthen the 1999 Act to ensure that the events included in the designation order will continue to be made available to qualifying Irish broadcasters. The Bill passed all Stages in Seanad Éireann on 11 March 2003. It is expected that Second Stage of the Bill will be taken in Dáil Éireann next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000, with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group of 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 140,000 women and represents about 50% of the national target population. By the end of December 2002, 110,636 women had been called for screening and 83,000 women had been screened. This represents an uptake of 75%. The non-capital funding of BreastCheck is &euro;8.7 million.</P>
      <P>I have publicly expressed my commitment to the nationwide extension of BreastCheck. As evidence of my commitment, I recently announced the extension of the programme to a further three counties. Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50 to 64 age bracket in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening.</P>
      <P>The board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme, requiring a further investment of &euro;27 million, including &euro;13 million in capital costs. The cost of extension to the west and south is &euro;11.043 million and &euro;11.933 million, respectively. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway, at which breast surgery would be performed on women in the south, west, mid-west and north-west. I met representatives of BreastCheck on 12 March to discuss their proposals, including the links with the symptomatic services, which have received considerable funding in recent years. It was agreed that officials of my Department and BreastCheck would commence discussions with representatives of the static units concerning the details of a national roll-out.</P>
      <P>Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

    <P>My Department is compiling more detailed information on waiting periods which will enable an overall average waiting time for smear test results from all laboratories to be calculated. This will forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the boards that there is a concerted effort to reduce the turnaround times. Phase one of the national cervical screening programme has contracted Belfast City Link Laboratory and Antrim Hospital United Hospital Trust to process up to 250 smears per week on behalf of the Southern Health Board. This initiative is funded by phase one of the national cervical screening programme and it is hoped it will substantially clear the backlog over the coming months. The North-Western Health Board is recruiting additional staff and is in the process of finalising details with a laboratories in Scotland and Antrim to outsource cervical smears to reduce waiting times. In respect of the ERHA, I am advised that overtime has been commissioned in St. Luke's laboratory to reduce waiting times there.</P>
    <P>I am committed to supporting boards in their efforts to reduce the waiting times for cervical smear test results. In this regard, my Department has in recent years allocated additional funding to provide for the establishment of new posts, the purchase of new equipment and the introduction of new technology in the cervical cytology laboratories. In 2003, an extra &euro;1.4 million has been provided to assist ongoing developments in the cervical cytology and colposcopy services.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board has informed my Department that it takes approximately three weeks from receipt of completed applications for the board to complete a financial review, arrange a medical dependency report by the public health nurse and communicate the amount of subvention payable to the applicant. In the event of insufficient information <Col N="1373" /> being received, it may be necessary for the board to further communicate with an applicant.</P>
      <P>A person applying for an enhanced subvention from the board will be in receipt of basic subvention. The average waiting time for applicants on basic subvention to be approved for enhanced nursing home subvention is approximately 11 months. I am concerned at the length of the processing period. The provision of enhanced nursing home subvention is a discretionary matter for the board. Any enhancements granted are dealt with in the context of the funding available for the nursing home subvention scheme and the requirement for the board to remain within its budgetary allocation under the 1996 Health Amendment Act.</P>
      <P>The board will continue to review the existing arrangements, which apply to applications for enhanced subvention, to ensure that the maximum number of applicants benefit from the available funding. The Southern Health Board will also continue to work closely with individuals on the waiting list and their families to assess those cases where an additional contribution can be made to resolve their current difficulties. In this way, it is envisaged that the board will be able to provide an increased contribution to a greater number of individuals on the waiting list for enhanced subvention.</P>

      <P>Since 2000, funding of &euro;2.99 million has been allocated to University College Hospital, Galway, UCHG, under the cardiovascular health strategy. A number of additional posts have been funded and services have been developed as follows: the <Col N="1374" /> appointment of two additional consultant cardiologists by the end of 2003 in line with the interim recommendations of the joint working group on consultant cardiology requirements as well as the necessary infrastructure-facilities required to support these appointments. These two appointments will double the consultant cardiology manpower in UCHG and will benefit the region's cardiology service. Eight beds are now open in the coronary care unit, additional staff have been employed and equipment upgraded enabling enhanced quality of care to patients.</P>
      <P>Services have also been developed by the appointment of two cardiac technicians which has increased access to cardiac diagnostic services; a chest pain clinic and the appointment of supporting staff to provide a structured link between the primary care and hospital settings and the rapid diagnosis of angina, enabling further diagnostic tests and treatment as appropriate; phases one, two and three of cardiac rehabilitation services and the employment of a multidisciplinary team to support these services, including a health promotion officer and a smoking cessation officer.</P>
      <P>In respect of cardiac surgery, I understand from the Western Health Board that the newly built theatre and critical care complex will be completed in July 2003. The question of providing resources for staff recruitment will be considered in the context of further discussions between officials of the Western Health Board and the Department of Health and Children.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1376" />I am responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the national children's strategy. The first goal of the strategy is that children will have a voice in matters which affect them and their views will be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity. It is recognised in the strategy that support and guidance must be provided to agencies involved in consulting with children to fully implement the first goal. My officials in the National Children's Office have been working in co-operation with statutory and non-statutory organisations in providing this support and guidance.</P>
    <P>Following a request for funding from the End Child Poverty Coalition to print additional copies of the guidelines, officials in the National Children's Office have examined the Hearing Young Voices guidelines. They met representatives of the End Child Poverty Coalition to discuss the possibility of developing these guidelines into a set of national guidelines for consulting children and young people. The development and reprint of the guidelines would be done in co-operation with the End Child Poverty Coalition and would be fully funded by the National Children's Office. The office is awaiting a formal response from the End Child Poverty Coalition to this proposal. I hope these guidelines can be adapted to a set of national guidelines on consulting children and young people and that they will be published this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in May 2002 I announced, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, an additional 175 therapy training places in physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy to achieve the recommended increase in the number of therapists recommended in the Bacon report. The first intake into the occupational therapy and speech and language therapy courses in the Uni<Col N="1377" /> versity of Limerick, University College Cork and National University of Ireland, Galway, is planned to take place later this year, while 28 students commenced the new physiotherapy course in the University of Limerick in the 2002-03 academic year. There has been a significant increase in recent years in the number of therapy training places in those third level institutions already offering degree courses in these areas to address the human resource requirements of the health services.</P>

    <P>Given the 426 (30%) increase in the number of therapy professionals employed in the health services over the two year period to the end of 2001, it is clear that good progress has been made in responding to the vacancy level identified in the Bacon report. Information in respect of employment levels at the end of 2002 is being compiled by my Department and will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>Significant investment in new services since 2000 has given rise to additional staffing requirements. As a result, intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels at local and national level as recommended in the Bacon report. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has made an important contribution to meeting the employment needs of the health services in areas experiencing shortages of fully trained and qualified therapy staff. Undertaking a concerted overseas recruitment drive by the Northern Area Health Board on behalf of all health boards in 2002 resulted in the employment of 95 additional therapy professionals, consisting of 44 occupational therapists, 14 speech and language therapists and 37 physiotherapists.</P>
    <P>Increased attractiveness of employment in the health services as a professional therapist has been achieved through such measures as pay enhancements, developments in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional development as a result of the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert group on various health professionals. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body will make a further contribution to the <Col N="1378" /> recruitment and retention of therapy professionals.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a fast-track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications are other initiatives that have been taken to help meet the human resource requirements of the health services in these areas. A total of 74 speech and language therapists and 198 occupational therapists were validated in 2002 by the national validation unit based in the Northern Area Health Board and 21 speech and language therapists and 44 occupational therapists have been validated to date in 2003.</P>
    <P>Having recruited and developed such a large number of staff in recent years, it is a priority to retain them by offering a challenging and rewarding career path. In a human capital and skills intensive health sector, retention has been identified as a key issue in better people management. The implementation of the action plan for people management, which I launched in November 2002, also has a crucial role to play in boosting the capacity of the health services to retain scarce skilled health and social care professionals.</P>
    <P>The proposed introduction of a grade of therapy assistant into the health services was among a number of recommendations contained in the report of the expert group on various health professions. This new grade is intended to complement the roles of the major therapy professions, and its development and introduction will be progressed by my Department as part of the continuing implementation of the expert group report.</P>
    <P>This initiative will form part of the overall move towards building on skill mix as set out in the modernisation process for the health service under Sustaining Progress, the new social partnership agreement for 2002 to 2005. As outlined in Sustaining Progress, skill mix is at the core of the requirement for the re-design of jobs, development of new ways of working and the determination of the quality and cost of health care. Enhanced skill mix will benefit patients, empower health personnel to reach their full potential, maintain skill levels and also help to secure a more rational utilisation of available health care personnel through a close matching of skills to functions and service needs.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a long-term workforce planning exercise to 2015, the Bacon report estimates that recommended increases in therapy training places, which are being put in place, will meet long-term demand arising at that time, including that arising from demographic developments and gains in living standards over the next decade. The increase in graduate output under way together with the other developments and initiatives I have outlined will make an important contribution to meeting existing demand on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>Section 23 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, which was commenced on 31 October 2002, provides for major increases in certain financial penalties for road traffic offences, including an increase in the general penalty that applies to the majority of offences under the Road Traffic Acts, including the offence of illegally parking in a disabled person's parking bay.</P>
      <P>Where a person is convicted of this offence, he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;800 for a first offence, increased from &euro;190 and a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 for a second or subsequent offence, and if a third or subsequent such offence is committed within 12 months, the person is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both. The determination of the fine to be imposed in each case is a matter for the courts.</P>
      <P>The offence of parking illegally in a disabled person's parking bay comes within the scope of the on-the-spot fines system. The amount of the on-the-spot fine applicable to this offence is &euro;19, which is the level that applies to the majority of parking offences. Where an on-the-spot fine notice is issued, it is open to the person to whom the notice is addressed to pay the relevant amount to prevent the matter proceeding to court.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the current on-the-spot fines system by a fixed charge system. Introduction of the new fixed charge system is being progressed in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities. The new system will bring greater certainty to the application of administrative charges for the majority of traffic and parking offences. It will feature, in particular, a provision through which the original amount of the fixed charge will automatically increase by 50% where payment is not made within 28 days of the date of the original notice. In the context of the introduction of the fixed charge process system, I envisage that consideration will be given to updating the charges associated with parking offences, including this offence.</P>

      <P>The station is in the Garda building programme and it is the intention to build a new station there that will provide the gardaí with the facilities they require to provide an effective and efficient policing service to the local area.

      <P>I understand that the Dublin Corporation by-laws prohibiting the consumption of intoxicating liquor in public places, including parks, came into operation on 6 October 2000. On 1 July 2002, the Dublin City Council parks and open spaces by-laws 2002 came into operation and created offences in public parks, including acts of anti-social behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that members of the Garda Síochána who detect breaches of these by-laws forward the details of the offender to Dublin City <Col N="1383" /> Council by means of a notification form. Dublin City Council then issues the fine to the offender and, if required, institutes a prosecution for non-payment. Where necessary, members of the Garda Síochána attend the court as prosecution witnesses to give evidence in such detections.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider that the by-laws have proven useful in addressing unwelcome activity in public parks, but, in certain circumstances, the Garda Síochána opts to use the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the by-laws are enforced by both the Garda Síochána and Dublin City Council and that the Garda authorities are committed to tackling public order problems, irrespective of where they occur.</P>

Upon receipt of the committee's views, I expect to be in a position to decide on this matter.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Office of Public Works is finalising structural works required at Finglas Garda station to facilitate the installation of the CCTV monitoring room and associated equipment.

      <P>My Department funds a wide range of grant schemes across the range of its remit. Many of these are administered on behalf of the Department by subsidiary agencies such as ADM and local Leader groups. My Department is not in a position to provide the Deputy with the information requested in respect of applications received by such bodies.</P>
      <P>In the case of many of the schemes for which application is made directly to the Department, especially those relating to Gaeltacht areas, applications are not generally classified on a county by county basis and the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. Given the wide range of such schemes and the large volumes of applications received thereunder on an ongoing basis, I am satisfied that the work involved in compiling and collating a county by county breakdown of applications received would exceed the information value of such statistics.</P>
      <P>However, I have directed that the Deputy be supplied with the requested information in respect of all schemes administered directly by my Department for which such information can be readily compiled. If the Deputy wishes to contact me with a specific query in respect of any scheme under the remit of my Department, I would be happy to assist him.</P>

      <P>The young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug <Col N="1387" /> misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
      <P>The national assessment committee, NAC, of the YPFSF, which is chaired by my Department, is examining the services projects funded under round one of the fund. The intention would be that, where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed by enabling their ongoing provision by statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>Qualification for continued funding will be dependent on the successful evaluation of each project by the services steering group, which has been set up to examine the projects, and sufficient funding being in place. The work of the steering group should be completed over the coming weeks with a view to the NAC making recommendations to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion shortly thereafter.</P>

      <Quest>if a person who is a proprietary director of a company but is paid under the PAYE/PRSI system on a weekly basis as a wage earner can qualify for family income sup plement; if this person and their partner have four children, the maximum amount they can be eligible for; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Proprietary directors employed in an executive role in a company under a contract of service and paying PRSI class A may have entitlement to FIS depending on their salary. However, directors employed in an executive role under a contract for service and paying PRSI class S are not covered for FIS as they are not regarded as employees. Directors who receive fees in respect of their office pay PRSI class S on the fees and would not have entitlement to FIS. Where clarification is required with regard to a person's employment status, this is obtained by the deciding officer prior to reaching a decision on the FIS application.</P>
      <P>The maximum weekly amount of FIS payable to a person in low-paid employment with a dependent spouse or partner and four children is &euro;109.</P>
