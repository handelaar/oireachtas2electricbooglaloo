      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the urgent need for the Minister for Health and Children to take immediate steps to avert the strike of public health doctors which is due to go ahead on Monday next, having regard to the vital role played by these doctors in combating infectious diseases and in view of the potential threat of the spread of the SARS condition; and to outline what procedures have been put in place to provide emergency cover should the strike proceed.</P>

      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate a matter of major national and local importance, namely, the decision by An Post to relocate the Lahardane postman's job, after 150 years of service to the people of Lahardane, County Mayo, from Lahardane Post Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to highlight the failure of the Government to tackle the terrible record of this country in overrunning limits on CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, which is now made worse by the ESB decision not to convert Moneypoint generating station from coal to gas and so to continue emitting over five million tons of CO2 from Moneypoint alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 13, motion re appointment of Ombudsman; No. 14, motion re appointment of Information Commissioner; No. 19, Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; and No. 2, Immigration Bill 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken not later than 1.30 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 13 and 14 shall be debated together and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion consecutively after 40 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the speech of the Minister for Finance, the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) Members may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste confirm that the House will get an opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland next week, preferably on Tuesday? I express the hope of everyone when I wish the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister well with their work and with the announcement to be made today. I give credit to every pro-Agreement leader in the past few years as they have all played a part in bringing us to this point. I express the sincere hope that the republican movement and other paramilitary groups will end all paramilitary activities after today so that the people of this island can go on to a new future and a new Ireland. We need only look at our televisions to see the devastation wrought by war in Iraq. We know there is no going back. We should take statements on Northern Ireland next week to enable us to express those sentiments. We on this side of the House support the efforts of the Government to bring a successful and peaceful conclusion to this 30-year saga. It has brought trauma and tragedy to thousands of people and wrecked local and national economies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Kenny in asking the Tánaiste for an assurance that we will have the debate he seeks. I also extend my good wishes and those of the Labour Party to the Taoiseach in his endeavours in the hope that we are embarking on the last few weeks of what will be a momentous phase in our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is to be a debate on Northern Ireland next Tuesday. We <Col N="295" /> look forward to it. I will be in Northern Ireland between now and then and hope to find the same sense of positive expectation as there is here. The Taoiseach has stated he feels this is the most important time since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope this turns out to be the case. Members of the Green Party, both south and north of the Border, hope he and all the other Government and party leaders involved will be able to fulfil and implement the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. We hope the current vacuum will now end. It cannot be allowed to continue as it is a recipe for violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government appreciates the comments and ongoing support of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party as well as other parties in the House. On the issue of Northern Ireland there has been in recent years widespread support from all sides of the House for the efforts of successive Governments and a genuine bipartisan approach.</P>
      <P>We hope this will be a momentous and historic weekend. That clearly depends on the response to the proposals of the two Governments. The hopes, good wishes and expectations of all Members and the general public, north and south, are with the talks which will take place today and over the weekend. Expectations are high, I hope they will not be disappointed. It is the intention of the Government to have a debate on Northern Ireland in the House next week. The Whip will, I am sure, be in touch with the Opposition parties on the matter over the weekend.</P>

      <P>I call the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to move the motion for the appointment of the Ombudsman. The motion for appointment of the Information Commissioner is being discussed together with this motion, but only the first motion should be moved at this point.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann recommends Ms Emily O'Reilly for appointment by the President to be the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to move the resolutions recommending Ms Emily O'Reilly for appointment by the President as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. The need for these appointments arises following the decision of the present incumbent, Mr. Kevin Murphy, to resign from both offices from 1 June 2003. Mr. Murphy has served as Ombudsman since November 1994 and as Information Commissioner since April 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House had a sizeable influx of new <Col N="306" /> Deputies at the last election. No one seriously making his or her way in local or national politics can avoid the basic on-the-job training of getting acquainted with the functions of the Ombudsman and the freedom of information commissioner. For this reason, I do not believe that even our newer Members need a whistle-stop tour of the main points of the Acts which set up the two offices and I do not intend to give one. What Deputies need to know is that the separate legislation which governs each of these offices specifies that the appointment is made by the President, but only after this House and the Seanad have passed resolutions recommending that a particular person be appointed. The appointments are for six years. They can be renewed, but only by going through the same resolution and appointment procedure. Retirement is compulsory when the person appointed reaches the age of 67.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, when Kevin Murphy mentioned that he would like to leave these two offices, I had to think about the qualities essential to doing the jobs well. It was quite easy to make out a list of those requirements: a familiarity with public administration and a knowledge of how it works; an ability to listen, sometimes with sympathy; the ability to sense when the plausible just is not true or is deliberately incomplete; and that unexpected scarce property, basic common sense and skill in handling the media without being ruled by headlines. However, the fundamental quality has to be independence. This word is much bandied about and, in this context, usually taken to be freedom from interference or influence by the Government of the day. That independence has to be expected from an ombudsman or commissioner, but independence has to mean more than that. It has to comprehend the ability to shake off the shackles of one's own strong feelings, to ignore the assumptions of the crowd one comes from &ndash; be it club, party or professional group &ndash; and, should righting wrongs in either job require it, a willingness to upset those people.</P>
    <P>When Kevin Murphy was appointed Ombudsman, there was a feeling in some quarters that it was asking too much of a top civil servant to go out and do strenuous battle with those who worked in the same corridors he had inhabited for most of a lifetime. Those who were in Government with me when he was appointed did not share those views, for we knew him as a man who called things as he saw them. We knew he had that vital streak of real independence which is without fear, favour or embarrassment. That quality was to be called upon in his dealing as Ombudsman and freedom of information commissioner with former colleagues whenever the interests of those he was chosen to serve required it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Kevin Murphy has nearly two months to serve in both positions. He may think it slightly premature on my part to pay tribute to him when he is still very much in harness. Never<Col N="307" /> theless, I know that Members of this House will join me in putting on record our deep appreciation of the immense contribution he has made to the development of the Ombudsman, for embedding into our system a desirable freedom of information culture and making both institutions user friendly.</P>
    <P>One characteristic of his time as Ombudsman was that he saw his work on behalf of individuals as a tool which could be used to root out bad practices and so protect the health and well-being of public administration. Having probed individual complaints, he distilled the lessons they presented into prescriptions for what I might be forgiven for calling &ldquo;the body administrative&rdquo;. In one of his reports, he spelled out, very clearly, principles of good administration, warned that this was what he expected public servants to measure up to and provided them and the public with a checklist of best practice. Settling Complaints &ndash; the guide to internal complaints systems, which he published, set out, in succinct form, the benefits of such systems and their essential features. Providing annual reports in Irish and on disk were, likewise, simple but helpful innovations.</P>
    <P>For most public positions, specific statutory requirements narrow the field from which candidates can be picked. That is not the case in this instance and I am sure each of us knows somebody with the characteristics I listed. Years ago, some civil servant identified a practical restriction on the choice for this position. It was to the effect that if, when one mentions the Ombudsman's name, the automatic response is &ldquo;who&rdquo;, one has got it very wrong. We will not have that problem with Emily O'Reilly, who is well known to all of us. She has been one of the most widely read journalists of her generation in this country and readers have followed her when she moved from one newspaper to another. She has been a hard-hitting journalist, but those of us who have sometimes taken those painful hits will admit that she has been generally fair, if trenchant. She has never made her columns cheerleaders for the conventional or unthinking partners in fashionable denunciation of the unpopular. One thread that has run through Emily O'Reilly's writings, whether in newspaper columns or the books she has written, is a willingness to say what she sees, even when it involves annoying politicians, colleagues and the power structures of the world of journalism. I do not always like what she writes and I often disagree with what she says but that may be a good sign for the appointment for which she is being proposed.</P>
    <P>The Government is not proposing Ms O'Reilly for these posts on the basis that it expects her to give it an easy run. These are two relatively young institutions of the State where the personal credibility of whoever is appointed is vital to the regard in which these offices are held and to their utility. Both are, in their own way, the safety valves of our administrative system and nobody, <Col N="308" /> least of all a Government, a Minister or the head of a public office, wants an ineffective safety valve &ndash; an Ombudsman or Information Commissioner who will not make a racket when something seems to be going wrong. We and the leaders of the Opposition, whom I consulted, are confident that Ms O'Reilly will not be silent and will not make noise when none is needed.</P>
    <P>That being said, there will be moments in any such office holder's term when sparks will fly between them and public servants and, indeed, between them and Ministers of the Government, for, between an Ombudsman and Ministers or public servants there will always be a degree of tension. There has to be. They have different jobs and different outlooks. What is important is that an Ombudsman or an Information Commissioner forces the decision maker to look with fresh eyes at what her or his organisation has done or left undone. Often, they agree but, when they do not, the interaction between them ensures that all factors are considered, even if, in all honesty, each attaches different weight to those factors.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in commending the resolutions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister's contention that these positions are a safety valve in the administrative system. This seriously understates their importance and misses the central point of the relationship between citizens and the public service. The public service is there to serve citizens, which is different from citizens' relationships with commercial organisations, and the public service must learn that the relationship is not about finding a safety valve to let off steam or eke out a bit of information where it has to be given. Rather, the relationship between the public service and the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner should increasingly be one of pursuing the same agenda, which is that agreeing to the demands of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner is central to delivering good public service.</P>
      <P>It is crucial that citizens have confidence that their public administration is honest, fair, responsive and inclusive. We increasingly see shortcomings in our systems of accountability, most notably in this House, where the capacity of the House to hold the Executive accountable has been diminished over the years and is not seen as effective. There is growing public cynicism about that and it is important that we underline the independence of this office which we are appointing today. The person who holds the position of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner is an appointee of the President rather than the Government, is only appointed on the resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas and cannot be removed without such a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that people who hold such high office should come before the House or a committee of the House in public hearing before they are appointed so Members have an opportunity to question those who seek to take up <Col N="309" /> important offices of the State. That policy is in Fine Gael's Democratic Revolution document and we believe it is important, especially for an office such as this which is a gift of the citizens, as represented in the Oireachtas, rather than one of the Government. We have not had that approach to appointments generally or to this office specifically, even though we should have if we are to learn from past lessons. We need to have more accountable systems in the House.</P>
    <P>I praise Kevin Murphy's work in what were at times difficult circumstances. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did himself no credit when he recently slurred the independence of his office. It is important that we are mindful that Senator Maurice Hayes, the former Northern Ireland Ombudsman, said we must &ldquo;protect the Ombudsman against the Executive's power to muzzle the watchdog or induce torpor through malnutrition&rdquo; because it is essential we reinforce the independence of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. The difficulties that have characterised the relationship between the Executive and that office in recent months must lead us to draw the lesson that there must be greater respect for the Ombudsman as we go forward.</P>
    <P>The importance of the job of Ombudsman is obvious when one looks at the work that Kevin Murphy, in particular, has done. It is clear that at times the public service overlooks weaker voices and, as the Ombudsman rightly pointed out, there is little correlation between the suffering people may endure at the hands of the public service and the frequency with which they complain. The Ombudsman and Information Commissioner must hold that brief for people who do not have the same opportunities to complain as those who are more articulate or better resourced. That is a solemn duty which the incoming Ombudsman must keep to the fore as she sets about her task.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Ombudsman successfully drew our attention to anomalies which continue to prevail, such as his successful prosecution of the case involving nursing homes in which the State went beyond its legal authority to force families to contribute where no contribution was justly payable. He also drew our attention to the fact that, under the Health Acts, there is an obligation on the State to provide for the tens of thousands of people who need nursing home care, but the State has stepped back from that obligation and is not willing to honour it. There is much incomplete business.</P>
    <P>The concession proposed in the Ombudsman's report on redress for taxpayers, which came to a successful conclusion in the House with the amendments to the Finance Bill, was made only after an extraordinary struggle between him, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance. We have much more to learn and the Ombudsman's job is far from finished. He recently pointed out in a speech that too often, the reaction of the public service is influenced by a concept that comes from the adversarial tra<Col N="310" /> dition of legal advisers &ndash; defences go up and minimum information is offered. There is a tendency not to see the issue of redress as a central obligation of the public service where injustice has occurred. There is still a tendency to see this as defending and perhaps, as the Minister says, having a safety valve in extreme cases, rather than the obligation on the public service to ensure there is appropriate redress when things go wrong.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman rightly pointed out that there is a vast difference between providing redress where the Department thinks it appropriate and appropriate redress &ndash; these are different concepts. He pointed out that much of the public service is still steeped in the old view of the nature of redress. He also drew to our attention to the fact that, in the revision of the customer service guidelines in 2000, there was a change when the notion of redress was replaced by the notion of appeals. The Ombudsman pointed out that this undermined the notion of quality customer service because central to that notion is the provision of information to people so they understand how the system works, providing the opportunity to appeal and complain and, the third and most essential pillar, ensuring that appropriate redress is available when things go wrong. We must ensure that as these offices develop, they are seen first and foremost to fearlessly defend those qualities in delivering a service to the people.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Kevin Murphy on the tremendous work he has done. I agree with the Minister that he has been fearless in his pursuit of cases, has paid enormous attention to detail and exhibited a willingness to be tenacious and hang on to issues which he believed were right even in the face of much criticism and opposition from time to time. That is the sign and quality of someone who takes his task and responsibilities seriously. I also agree with the Minister that Emily O'Reilly has those qualities in abundance &ndash; she has the tenacity, determination and ability to pursue matters relentlessly. I have no doubt that she will fulfil the role of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner to the highest standards. I look forward to her continued pursuance of the issues raised by Mr. Kevin Murphy about the development of our public service as a body which sees its role as serving the citizen first rather than trying to defend the structure of which it is a part. That will be a slow process.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me not to recognise the progress made in the public service since the creation of this office in 1984. There have been revolutionary changes in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, once an extremely difficult Department with which to deal. It is now the most customer oriented Department of all. Other Departments have lessons to learn and a good deal of road to travel.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael supports these appointments and wishes Mr. Kevin Murphy success in his retirement &ndash; I am sure it will be an extremely active <Col N="311" /> retirement. I know his skills will be brought to bear for many worthwhile causes. I wish Emily O'Reilly great success in taking on the solemn duties being conferred upon her. Those duties are recognised in an exceptional way in the Act under which she is appointed. This is an appointment made by the President on the recommendation from both Houses of the Oireachtas. We will see her as the defender of the rights of Members of the Oireachtas and the wider citizens of this country in pursuance of her duties.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what has been said by Deputy Bruton and I join with him in welcoming Emily O'Reilly's appointment. She has the qualities and character necessary to do this important job with distinction. She has, in the past, demonstrated an independence of mind and a tenacity appropriate to this job. She has shown a commitment to public service and has demonstrated a sense of fairness. She has shown a single-minded determination to do whatever job she is doing well.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Ombudsman is a unique office nominated by the Oireachtas, appointed by the President and cherished by the people. Those of us who have to deal with constituency work, particularly Members on this side of the House &ndash; five or six faithful servants of the State serve each Minister, but the help the Minister promised those of us on this side of the House has not yet materialised &ndash; know at first hand the kind of constituent who relies on the Ombudsman for relief when other routes are beyond their reach. It is an important office and Emily O'Reilly has the capacity to discharge the functions of that office with the same distinction as her imminent predecessors.</P>
      <P>I agree with everything Deputy Bruton said about Mr. Kevin Murphy's performance in office. I take this opportunity to again record the appreciation of Irish citizens of his predecessor, Mr. Michael Mills. Mr. Mills appeared to do the job with such impartiality and fairness that the Taoiseach of the day did his best to contrive a situation where we would forget his re-appointment. Fortunately, we remembered at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the nursing homes and taxpayers cases during Mr. Murphy's tenure in office. I was greatly influenced by his most recent report on the performance of the Freedom of Information Act. It demonstrates in every paragraph how diligently and seriously and with independence of mind he took the task of invigilating the Act and discharging the functions of his office. If I have one regret it is that the new Ombudsman, specifically in her role as Information Commissioner, is now being handed legislation that has effectively been emasculated in so <Col N="312" /> far as it relates to Government decision-making. It is a great pity and will make a qualitative difference in terms of the job she can do that the Government, particularly the Minister responsible, decided to make a substantive change for the worse in that area of the Act without facilitating the taking of public evidence from those who had experience of it.</P>
    <P>Whereas on this occasion I am happy to support with enthusiasm the nomination of Emily O'Reilly, it is not desirable that this appointment, made by the President and nominated by this House, is made on the basis of a half hour's notice by the Minister for Finance. I thank him for consulting me, but a half hour's notice after the appointment has been made by Cabinet is not the ideal way to deal with this matter given the importance of the office. There ought to be some process in place where we could hear the merits of prospective candidates or a candidate because that is important. We have all had experience of Ms O'Reilly's ability to write or occasionally to use her stiletto, but she has always done so with impartial precision against and for all parties. While I have no objection to the appointment on this occasion, I think we should look in the future at a more suitable process for the ultimate appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the words of congratulations to Ireland's first ombudswoman. At the risk of sounding politically correct, that is how Emily O'Reilly has chosen to style herself. I welcome that. I have raised with the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions the dearth of appointments by the Government and its predecessors of women to State boards and public positions. There has been a fall-back and roll-back in this area. It is to be welcomed that the third appointee to this office will be an ombudswoman.</P>
      <P>Emily O'Reilly brings to the office her skills and reputation as a hard hitting journalist. In her earlier career in journalism, she not only had an established reputation for getting the best stories but had a high calibre of investigative journalism. Her capacity to carry out investigations impartially and with will and serious intent, the hallmark of good journalism and reporting, is desirable in the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by what the current holder of that office had to say when he came before the Committee on Finance and the Public Service on two occasions recently. On the first occasion, he told us of widows who had not been given redress in relation to interest on arrears of tax that had been incorrectly deducted from them. I was struck by the precision and quality of Mr. Murphy's presentation to the committee, a man in full and absolute command of the facts and of the administrative remedies available in relation to the wrong he was seeking to redress. He was part of and in command of a loyal, efficient and co-operative team. That is something on which I wish the incoming Ombudsman good fortune because thousands of representations are made to the <Col N="313" /> Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I noticed in recent weeks that the secretary general of the Association of Higher Civil Servants was at pains to point out, in the context of that association rejecting the Government's proposals to change and effectively destroy the Freedom of Information Act, that despite the thousands of inquiries which had been received under the FOI Act, a good deal of which were appealed to the Information Commissioner's office, it had been possible for the Civil Service to deal with those inquiries.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the complaints made to the Ombudsman's office give rise to a significant amount of Civil Service work and it is necessary to have a good team in place. I am sure the same calibre of team will be made available to Ms O'Reilly, although she may wish that some extra people might be made available.</P>
    <P>Kevin Murphy has done the State some honourable service. I hope he enjoys many fruitful years in his retirement.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Sinn Féin I support the motions recommending Emily O'Reilly for appointment by the President to the position of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. It is ironic that these motions are before us the day after the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government abused its majority in this House and forced through the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, which should have been called the restriction of information Bill. These motions recommending the appointment of Emily O'Reilly will probably arrive on the President's desk for signature along with that disgraceful Bill.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman, the Information Commissioner and the 1997 Freedom of Information Act are key components of the architecture of democracy in this State. There are many faults in that architecture, some of them fundamental, but the Government has done enormous damage by gutting the 1997 Freedom of Information Act. That was done against the advice of the outgoing Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, who deserves praise for his role. Along with other Deputies, I wish him well in his retirement. The system of openness and accountability and of protection for citizens has been undermined. The new Bill will certainly make the Government less accountable. It will take away rights from ordinary citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two reservations about the motions. First, it is being taken for granted that one person should hold two posts. Why should this be the case? The posts are interrelated. It is desirable that someone such as the Ombudsman, who has an advocacy role for the citizen dealing with the <Col N="314" /> State, should also be a citizen's advocate in terms of freedom of information but I accept there are arguments on the other side also. These are important positions and while the restriction of information Bill has reduced the Information Commissioner's role, it is arguable that it should be a full-time post for one person.</P>
    <P>Second, Sinn Féin has repeatedly challenged the system of Government appointments to key posts. In this case, Dáil and presidential approval is required but it is still a Government appointment. A whole range of appointments are purely in the hands of Ministers. We believe there should be a system of advertisement of positions, publication of criteria of qualification and interview of candidates.</P>
    <P>I wish Emily O'Reilly well in her new posts, both of which are important elements of democracy and safeguards for our citizens. I have every confidence she will prove to be an effective and efficient office holder and I join with other Deputies in wishing her well in the dual challenges she now undertakes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the appointment of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. At the outset I want to thank Mr. Kevin Murphy for his great work, dedication and commitment over the past few years. Mr. Murphy was appointed Ombudsman in 1994 and he became Information Commissioner in 1998. His was another classic example of top quality public service and we thank him for his efforts.</P>
      <P>Today we are discussing the appointment of the new Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly. I strongly welcome and support this appointment. In examining this position, we have to ask ourselves a number of questions. Does the person have ability, integrity, compassion and understanding? Does the person have a vision for society, warts and all? Does the person have the capability and strength to be a thorn in the side of official Ireland? Having asked myself all these questions and studied Ms O'Reilly's <i>curriculum vitae,</i> I have no doubt she is the person for the job. She has the ability and integrity to do the job and, more importantly, she will have the respect of all citizens. Trust, respect and independence are essential aspects of this office.</P>
      <P>On a personal level, I wish Ms O'Reilly and her family well. It is a great honour and privilege for her family as she is selected by this 29th Dáil. To be asked to take up such a high position in the country of her birth is a great honour for her and her family. It will not be easy and difficult decisions will have to be made, but always in the interests of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not brought up to believe that one has to respect this or that just because somebody comes from a wealthy family or a high profile political family. One has to earn respect in this life and Emily O'Reilly has earned the respect of the people over the past 20 years. That is the reason I support her nomination today on behalf of the <Col N="315" /> Independent group of Deputies. I agree with the Minister for Finance that Ms O'Reilly is hard-hitting and has been a thorn in the side of politicians, media and official Ireland. That is the type of person we need, and I strongly support this resolution. We wish Ms O'Reilly and her family well. We wish her every success in her new position. She will need great courage and honesty but I believe she has these skills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears I have the last word on this appointment and I promise the House I will not sound a discordant note. The Green Party is pleased to accept the Government's recommendation of Ms Emily O'Reilly for the position of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. The role of Ombudsman in particular is to act as a bulwark against maladministration and a reminder to those in political and administrative systems that they are there to serve the people rather than think of themselves as self-perpetrating entities. Ms O'Reilly has shown in the practice of her journalistic integrity, to be capable of both positions.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Ombudsman in particular has been a success since its inception. The Government has promised further legislation which I hope will assist the strengthening of the office. I include that note of caution because in relation to the other role Ms O'Reilly is being asked to take on, Information Commissioner, it is clear that the Government has already tied her hands behind her back before she takes up office. I believe that is a temporary little arrangement because this six-year term will coincide with the next general election and a promise from all Opposition parties, should they have any part in the next Government, that the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill will be rescinded and the principal Act brought back into being.</P>
      <P>The difficulties regarding the Information Commissioner's office cannot be understated. The changes the Government introduced as of yesterday's Dáil vote mean there will be more appeals made to her office and the Information Commissioner will have reduced power to rule on those appeals in favour of the appellants. I hope the Information Commissioner's role can be strengthened in the future.</P>
      <P>All Members of the House have sounded a note of confidence in respect of Ms O'Reilly's appointment and expect of her the ability to not accept on face value all that is presented to her from various Departments and State agencies. The citizens expect the best possible services from all agencies of State and they need a strong office which will protect their interests to ensure that happens.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the names of Deputies McManus and Ó Caoláin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 42 to 47 and in page 7, to delete lines 1 to 5.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment due to a change that is being proposed by the Minister in this Bill. The original proposal, when setting up the Health Insurance Authority, was that the costs of establishing the authority would be recouped over time by way of levies on the insurers. The running costs of the authority are to be met by levies and it would seem logical that any establishment costs would also be paid for in the same way. When this was being proposed, in the 2001 Act, there appeared to be a limitless supply of money. Now we are living in much more straitened times and yet the Minister is seeking to introduce a change whereby the public, rather than the insurers, will cover the costs of the authority.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Finance has left the Chamber because he would have been interested in what I had to say. We are talking about approximately &euro;500,000. When I raised this on Committee Stage, I was astonished, and would still argue vehemently against a decision made then by the Bills Office, to learn that my amendment would incur a cost on the people. I was trying to ensure the insurers carried the cost rather than the people of Ireland who the Minister appears set to ensure will bear the cost.</P>
      <P>I have tabled a more simple amendment on Report Stage, as I indicated I would, which does not create any difficulties in terms of a charge on the people. It is simply to delete an amendment which is being put forward by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister argued on Committee Stage that this change is only an option for him, that he can choose to levy the insurers to repay the costs or simply pay the costs from Exchequer funds. According to the terminology used in section 7, the money for the establishment costs of approxi<Col N="317" /> mately &euro;500,000 &ldquo;shall not require to be repaid&rdquo; by the insurers by way of levy. In legislation, we know that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means shall. I have been a Member of this House for over ten years and I have some experience of what &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; mean. It is clear to me, from reading this Bill, that in this instance &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means that the money put in by the Department does not have to be repaid by the insurers.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Minister has succumbed to lobbying from the authority. Be that as it may, the original intent at a time when money was less scarce was that the authority would be established and the money would be recouped from the insurers. In this instance, we are talking about a small amount of money, although to many people &euro;500,000 would not be a small sum. At a time when disabled children are unable to get hot meals; when A&amp;E departments such as that in Tralee General Hospital are closing down due to cutbacks; when cancer patients are unable to access necessary care; when children must wait an inordinate length of time to access psychological and speech therapy services; and when there is suffering as a result of cutbacks which have come about as a result of a Government policy to win the last election no matter what and then institute severe cutbacks where people are most vulnerable, whether in education, health, social welfare or elsewhere, it is inconceivable that when legislation has already been passed setting up a system of repayment, the Minister is now withdrawing from that arrangement and simply saying that the people, rather than the insurers, should carry the cost. I would ask the Minister at this late stage to accept this amendment to delete this change which he has introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage. I again point out that we are talking about approximately &euro;508,000 which was advanced by the Department to the Health Insurance Authority for its establishment. Of course the authority is now funded in respect of its operational costs by a levy on the premium income of those registered health insurers. In passing, I would say that any costs which are passed on to the insurers are ultimately passed on to the consumers of health insurance and those who are insured. The measure is an enabling provision. It allows the Minister to have the option of seeking the repayment of all or part of the advance originally given to the authority.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the White Paper on Private Health Insurance provided that the authority's establishment costs would be funded by the Exchequer. The rationale behind that at the time was that this was an important public service which needed to be carried out arising from a Government regulation in the common good regarding voluntary health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, the authority feels strongly about it. I take on board what the Deputy has said and the concerns she articulated. Our advice <Col N="318" /> is strongly of the view that this is only an enabling provision and that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; appears towards the end of the section, and that that subsection is wholly dependent on a determination in the first instance by the Minister for Health and Children, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, of an amount to be waived, if any. The option to claw back the &euro;500,000, or part of it, over the coming years still remains.</P>
    <P>It is a matter which we will keep under review and which the legislation allows us to keep under review. If the authority builds up sufficient reserves into the future, then this may not be as big an issue for the authority or, indeed, for anyone. I would bear in mind the comments that have been made by Deputies on the overall issue of whether we should claw back some of the money that was advanced for the establishment costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deputising for Deputy Ó Caoláin, who is my party's health spokesperson. His absence is not meant as an insult. He is on other important business at Hillsborough this morning.</P>
      <P>This amendment has been put forward by my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, because Sinn Féin does not believe that the cost of establishing the Health Insurance Authority should be borne by the State. Although the authority is a public body, it is regulating a profitable private sector which should be required, as originally envisaged, to pay for the cost of establishing this authority. As the ongoing operational costs of the authority are funded by proceeds from a levy on the premium income of registered insurers, there is no justification for the State having to bear the establishment costs, particularly at a time of widespread cutbacks and the under-funding of the health service. In that regard, I support the Minister in his alleged disagreement with the Minister for Finance. I know that support would have considerably more value if I was on the other side of the House, but the Minister should know that we do not disagree on everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sinn Féin does not support the private health insurance model as a means of financing the health service and cannot support any measures that subsidise private health care companies. We are strongly opposed to the Government's pursuit of policies that will lead to the privatisation of the health service. We are opposed to the range of State incentives and supports that have made private health insurance an attractive option for those who can afford it. Private health insurance is not a solution and should not be seen as a solution to the crisis in the health service, nor should the Government seek to abdicate its responsibilities in the provision of health care for its citizens by encouraging more people to take up private health insurance. I refer to the NESF report on equality of access to hospital care, which states: &ldquo;A critically important role for the State is to act as guarantor in the availability of a satisfactory <Col N="319" /> level of health care to all its citizens, irrespective of means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Health care must not become a mere market commodity. A vigorous and competitive private health care market does not mean that all citizens will be able to avail of health insurance. For example, in the USA there is a high level of competition, yet many people are still without cover. Those who are either low income or high risk cannot afford private insurance. As a result, access to health care in the USA is highly inequitable. Market forces in health care work only for those who are wealthy enough to pay for it. The British NHS, once one of the most comprehensive health care systems in the world, has never recovered from the attempts by the Conservative Government under Margaret Thatcher to impose market forces on its delivery. I urge this Government not to follow the flawed health care policies pursued by successive right-wing Governments in the USA and the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being disingenuous. He knows that this money will not be recouped from the insurers if his amendment takes effect. At the moment, the <i>status quo</i> is that it does have to be recouped. The Minister's amendment changes this so that, in effect, it does not have to be.</P>
      <P>The health service is in crisis. The Minister is lambasting hospitals for withdrawing services to their patients because they have financial difficulties, yet he is withdrawing from his budget &euro;0.5 million which could deliver to front-line services &ndash; in a small way, but one that would make a difference to somebody who is disabled, has cancer or is waiting to obtain treatment. He is making a choice now to ensure that legally, the strength of the current Act is diminished so much that insurers will not have to pay the money back. If they were to be obliged to pay it back, it is hard to see why he would put forward this amendment.</P>
      <P>This is a way of ensuring that the people are paying for start-up costs of more than &euro;0.5 million. The law says at the moment that this money should be recouped from the insurance companies, which are hardly on the breadline &ndash; they have a tremendous and growing market and could easily carry this cost. The Minister, however, has decided that rather than their carrying the cost, the people will have to do so, at a time when our health service is in deep trouble. There should be a recognition that services at the front line need to be preserved and that anything which interferes with that should be dealt with by the Minister. He may be under pressure from the Minister for Finance, but at the end of the day it is a question of who will win this battle. If the Minister for Health and Children is so ineffective that he cannot stand up to the Health Insurance Authority, it does not augur well for other, bigger battles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill before us contains a number of important developments of Ireland's immigration law and the law regarding asylum seekers. Its provisions build on the solid achievements of the previous Government in the areas of immigration and asylum policy. The Government is committed to the ongoing development of immigration policy within the balanced and realistic co-ordinates set down in our programme for Government in the interests of Irish society in all its diversity and with fairness to all who seek to come to Ireland to share in and contribute to that society.</P>
      <P>That migration issues are now to the forefront of public policy-making, something unheard of little more than a decade ago, is in many ways a welcome and necessary consequence of the economic and social successes of the State in the last decade. We have turned around from being a country traditionally of outward migration to one to which people are keen to come to share in and contribute to our prosperity.</P>
      <P>Central Statistics Office figures indicate an estimated average net inward migration of more than 20,000 people a year, mainly returning Irish migrants and people from within the European Economic Area, who are coming to Ireland to make their living. However, Ireland's attractions as a place for people's futures are recognised further afield as well. Employment permits issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the four years from 1999 to this year indicate something of the order of 100,000 non-EEA nationals migrating to Ireland for economic reasons, observing our normal immigration requirements and being made welcome in their places of employment and their new communities. In 2002, some 93,000 non-EEA nationals either registered or renewed their registration with the Garda national immigration bureau. These figures are clear evidence of a thriving and effective immigration system in Ireland, capable of facilitating non-nationals who wish to come to work and live in the State in compliance with our laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No claim is made that our immigration systems represent the pinnacle of perfection. The programme for Government acknowledges as much. We are committed to bringing forward a comprehensive code of immigration and residence legislation, which will undoubtedly provide a better framework for the development and implementation of <Col N="321" /> evolving immigration policies. Considerable groundwork has been laid for this major project, including a public consultation process and the excellent report commissioned by the Minister's predecessor from the International Organisation for Migration, which sets out how the challenges facing Ireland in the area of migration policy and practice are dealt with in other countries around the world.</P>
    <P>While that legislation is under consideration, the Government continues to evolve the immigration policies designed to facilitate economic migration into the State so as to keep them in tune with the changing economic climate and other influencing factors. The growing number of exotic accents that we hear in the streets and encounter in our daily lives are for the most part the voices of non-nationals who have properly and honestly availed themselves of those immigration policies to migrate to Ireland. These are people who are wanted and are welcome here.</P>
    <P>With the increase in regular migration, we have experienced what many other developed countries of the western world had already undergone in the previous decade or so: a growth in illegal migration and in the international business of facilitating those who for one reason or other feel that they cannot, or are otherwise disinclined to, avail of the regular means provided by law for entering and settling in their chosen countries of destination. These people-smugglers, who are in business for the profits they can garner and whose interest in the lives of their clients goes no further than the extent to which they can pay, run operations that can often be highly sophisticated, with advanced document-forging skills and the ability to switch from one method or route to another as immigration authorities succeed in blocking off loopholes. One feature common to illegal people-smuggling throughout the world is the universal abuse of asylum processes as a means of securing a toehold in the country of destination. Ireland is no exception when it comes to this abuse.</P>
    <P>I should restate at this point the well-established Government policy in the matter of asylum &ndash; a policy to which the Government is unshakeably committed. The aim of this policy is to ensure that people arriving in the State who are genuinely in need of the protection of the State are identified as such as soon as possible after they arrive so that they can immediately start the process of integration into Irish society and take up the rights to which they are entitled under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its amending protocol of 1967.</P>
    <P>A person who seeks asylum in the State makes the very serious claim to be here in our country seeking the protection of our State and cannot return to his or her country of origin for fear of being persecuted. Any reasonable person will accept that for a person who claims to be persecuted nothing in his or her life at that time can be more important than obtaining a decision on that claim at the earliest possible moment. In return all that is asked of the applicant is his or <Col N="322" /> her full co-operation in a process whereby the investigator and the applicant work together to determine whether the person is a refugee. An asylum applicant in Ireland can be assured of a system that is fair, transparent and independent and that provides him or her with the opportunity to avail of legal representation and interpretation at every step of the way. This is a system fully in line with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the 1967 amending protocol.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of this commitment, we have a legal framework for honouring our international commitments to those who are oppressed and persecuted, and who are in need of the protection of this State. That framework is the Refugee Act 1996, under which the claims of people who seek protection here are investigated independently by the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and negative recommendations emerging from that independent process can be appealed to another independent body, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Legal assistance is made available, at the expense of the State through the Refugee Legal Service of the Legal Aid Board, at each stage of this process, and each step is liable to court scrutiny by means of judicial review.</P>
    <P>Interpreter facilities are available as necessary at every stage. Overseen by the Reception and Integration Agency established for the purpose, the State feeds, houses and clothes those awaiting decisions on their claims, and ensures that their medical needs are catered for. By way of illustration, a sum in the region of &euro;340 million was spent in 2002 on State services for asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>It is an undeniably fair and generous system. It is not without room for improvement. Those who are operating this independent system acknowledge that, notwithstanding the great improvements that have taken place in the Irish asylum process in recent years, there are some in-built inefficiencies which require statutory amendment. The Minister is striving for a system, which continues to provide the requisite high standard of fairness, but achieves that standard with more efficient use of time and resources.</P>
    <P>The demands of the public for efficient use of the resources being expended on services for asylum-seekers is not exclusively a question of the cost of investigating asylum applications, which is a matter within the Minister's area of responsibility. By achieving greater efficiencies through a reduction in the large-scale abuse of the asylum process, we can inevitably bring about substantial savings right across the Exchequer, in the budgets of all the other Departments involved in providing services for asylum-seekers. What is more, we can achieve this without any compromise in the fairness of our asylum process.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned at the extraordinarily low proportion of those who, after having their claims examined by this independent process and, as appropriate, exercising their right of appeal, are actually found to be refugees. Most <Col N="323" /> people who claim to be fleeing from persecution are not fleeing persecution at all. Even allowing some margin for those who, while not strictly within the criteria of the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, are otherwise in need of the protection of the State, the fact, independently arrived at by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, is that close to nine out of every ten asylum applicants in Ireland have no basis for their claim to be refugees. That bespeaks unsustainably high levels of abuse of a system designed to help the weak and unprotected.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to the vulnerable individuals who have genuine claims, and whose recognition is delayed by unfounded asylum claims. It is not fair to those who pay Irish taxes to maintain that 90% while their claims are being examined. The Minister has no intention to do anything that would undermine the sound principles on which that system is built. However, it is not a corollary of a fair system that it should be supine in the face of obvious abuse as if such abuse were of no real consequence for those who genuinely seek the protection of the State. Nor is it an essential element of a fair system that it involves unnecessarily elaborate processes or protracted timescales.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the Refugee Act in November 2000, the present Refugee Applications Commissioner and her staff, and the chairperson and other members of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, have between them achieved the significant objective of dealing fairly and efficiently with the backlog of cases with which they were faced and bringing their workload more and more up to date. A measure of the improvements in turnaround time which have been achieved is that applicants who applied this February are already being scheduled for interview. The Minister is greatly appreciative of the work that Bernice O'Neill and PJ Farrell have done and continue to do in the refugee determination process.</P>
    <P>As with any new system experience in the first few years of operation has brought to light ways to improve even further the efficiency of the current asylum process while in no manner compromising our obligations to those in need of protection. This Bill is an opportunity to bring forward those improvements by way of amendment to the Refugee Act. Some of these were in the Bill as published, more were included by way of amendments in the Seanad and a further set of amendments is being developed which I expect will be the subject of amendments on Committee Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>I will go into a little more detail as to the content of those amendments when dealing with the provisions of the Bill in a few moments, but the purpose of these amendments is to defend the integrity of the refugee process as the means for giving the protection of the State to those who are actually in need of it, to discourage the abuse of the process by those who are not refugees and <Col N="324" /> to get people who turn out to have no right to be here out of the State as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>These aims are consistent with the approach of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which continues to emphasise, most recently in its Agenda for Protection programme, the need not only to strengthen the implementation of the convention for genuine refugees and deal with the root causes of refugee movements, but also to safeguard asylum systems from abuse by returning those not entitled to or in need of international protection to their countries of origin.</P>
    <P>Briefly, this Bill provides for the following four main areas. It provides a scheme of carrier liability designed to ensure to the greatest extent possible that when people arrive in the State, from places other than the common travel area with the United Kingdom, they have proper travel documentation. That matter is dealt with in sections 1 to 3. There is provision for some other amendments to current immigration law, in particular, the provision at section 7, which is largely technical in nature. As I have indicated already, section 6 of the Bill amends the Refugee Act 1996 in a number of significant respects.</P>
    <P>Section 4 creates offences relating to employment of non-nationals without employment permits. As that provision has now been incorporated in a recently enacted Bill promoted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister will be proposing the deletion of this section from the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Turning to the carrier liability provisions of the Bill, I should like to give Deputies a general view of what is proposed in section 2 of the Bill and its purpose. The principal aim of the section is to put in place legislative provisions which will have the effect that carriers, in other words those responsible for aircraft, sea-going vessels or road vehicles coming into Ireland, will check before embarking on the journey that everyone coming on board for the journey has the proper travel documentation that is required for passing through Irish immigration controls. Of course this system could not apply to flights, sea-trips or road journeys coming from the United Kingdom into Ireland &ndash; the common travel area arrangements mean that Irish and UK citizens can travel between the jurisdictions without any requirement to carry a passport; so the Bill is designed to apply only to journeys into the State from places other than the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>Section 2, which contains the core of these provisions, sets out the obligations being placed on a carrier whose vehicle arrives in the State. Section 2(1) spells out what those obligations are. The first two paragraphs give statutory weight to the normal co-operation with the immigration authorities that most carriers at present offer as a matter of routine business practice in disembarking their passengers. The last element, at paragraph (<i>c</i>), states that the carrier must ensure that the disembarking non-national passengers must have <Col N="325" /> the right documentation. For carriers to ensure that these things are in order at the end of the journey, they will have to do in respect of journeys into Ireland what they already have to do with regard to journeys in the other direction, that is, to have in place systems at the start of the journey to check their passengers' documents.</P>
    <P>What are the right documents? First, a passenger must have a valid passport. For EU nationals, the identity card issued by many member states to their own citizens meets that requirement. Nationals of certain non-EU countries also require a visa of one of two types, depending on their nationality and whether they want to visit the country or merely to transit a seaport or, more usually, an airport. The categories of non-nationals who do not require a visa to enter Ireland are currently set out in the Aliens (Visas) (No. 2) Order 2001; anyone not in those categories needs a visa. That order also lists the small number of countries whose nationals must be in possession of a transit visa if they wish to make a journey which involves transiting through an Irish port, as distinct from actually entering Ireland. Details are published on the website of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and are kept up to date as new orders are made from time to time.</P>
    <P>This provision, as in most other jurisdictions, is designed to enlist the help of carriers, within the scope of their competence, in cutting down the opportunity for abuse or circumvention of legitimate immigration controls. The Bill takes a &ldquo;carrot and stick&rdquo; approach to this. The &ldquo;stick&rdquo; element is that failure to observe the obligations is to be an offence, punishable by a flat &euro;3,000 fine. That is set out at section 2(4) and (7).</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides a means, similar to the system at present in relation to parking offences, where the carrier can avoid court proceedings by payment of a fixed penalty, in this case &euro;1,500, within 28 days of receiving the notice of intention to prosecute.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; element has a number of constituents. Of prime importance is the co-operation that, in advance of this Bill's enactment, already exists in large measure between the Garda national immigration bureau and various groups of carriers both centrally and at local level to help reduce immigration abuses. While constructive consultations on the development of this proposal have taken place with the representatives of all sectors operating commercially into Ireland from the Continent and from further afield, it is not invidious to single out for special mention the Irish Road Haulage Association, representing the owners and operators of road freight vehicles.</P>
    <P>As part of these consultations, that association, together with officials at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the then Department of Public Enterprise and representatives of the Garda national immigration bureau developed a set of guidelines which provide a checklist for long distance lorry operators so that <Col N="326" /> they can minimise the scope for their vehicles being used for the clandestine carriage of people. Section 2(8) will give a statutory basis for guidelines of this type, another aspect of the &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; element of this proposal.</P>
    <P>Observance by hauliers of these guidelines will have two effects. In practical terms it will help to protect them and their cargo from the activities of smugglers of human beings and, as far as this new law is concerned, it will go towards assisting them in dealing with any prosecution that might arise, in the event that covert passengers succeed in boarding their vehicles unknown to them, on the basis of the &ldquo;all reasonable steps&rdquo; defence at subsection (5). The defences provided at subsections (5) and (6) are further parts of the &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; incentive. Thus, a carrier who has sensible procedures in place at the point of embarkation to check documents and can show that those procedures were operated properly in the instant case, would be able to invoke the subsection (5) defence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) underlines the position that carriers are not expected to engage in minute examination of all documents for potential forgery. From our own experience and the experiences of other member states, we know the reality of document fraud ranges from basic and crude attempts at forgery and falsification to high quality forgeries and falsification methods, including photo substitutions, which might only be detected by an expert after recourse to sophisticated equipment. Carriers are not being expected to spot any other than the more obvious and well known forgery techniques.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the first constituent, which is co-operation between carrier staff and the immigration authorities. We are not concerned to clock up high numbers of convictions under this legislation. It is quite the opposite, since each conviction would represent another instance of an illegal entry into the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no sanction against the illegal entrants themselves; that is a matter dealt with separately in other legislation. It is properly dealt with separately because we recognise that some of those who make their way irregularly into Ireland do so because they wish to claim asylum and we have an international obligation to consider each such claim. The Refugee Act 1996 gives full statutory effect to that obligation and the carrier liability provisions of this Bill do not compromise the fulfilment of that obligation in any respect. In order to address in statutory form the unfounded assertion by some commentators that it would compromise those obligations, subsection (9) has been inserted into the Bill by the Seanad to put the matter beyond doubt. The Attorney General has advised that this provision is unnecessary from a strictly legal point of view, a view with which the Minister strongly agrees. However, he believes the law in this instance should explicitly reflect his policy commitment and that of the Government and the State to our responsibilities to those in fear of persecution and <Col N="327" /> in need of Ireland's protection. This provision represents incontrovertible statutory evidence of the State's continuing commitment to honour and fulfil its convention obligations.</P>
    <P>Why put these arrangements in place? The carrier liability provisions in the Bill will provide an important additional instrument in the existing immigration tool-kit to address what is a significant element in the illegal immigration trail, that of persons boarding transport to the State and arriving here without any documentation required for entry, such as a passport or visa. Its effect will be that carriers will carry out the most rudimentary of checks to ensure that a passport is valid and that it relates to the person presenting it and that, where necessary, there is a current valid visa in the passport. Nothing more is required. Carrier staff will be helped, as some are at present, by training and advice given by immigration officers to be able to spot the more obvious forgeries and falsifications.</P>
    <P>It is basically a mechanical task. It is a task that carriers out of Ireland and throughout Europe and other western states have been undertaking for many years now. It is the work of a few moments for the most part &ndash; the passport is subject to a quick scrutiny at the check-in desk and handed back to the traveller. Ireland is the only member state of the European Union which does not have legislation providing for a scheme of carrier liability. That is why Deputies are familiar with these checks when they seek to visit other jurisdictions. Our participation in certain aspects of the Schengen <i>Acquis</i> with our EU partners means that we are subject to binding legal instruments in the area of carrier sanctions. These requirements inform the development of the Bill before us. However, apart from our EU requirements, the Minister is satisfied that there is a well established need for this form of immigration control to supplement the existing immigration controls at our borders and under the visa system to combat the growth in illegal immigration to the State.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a standard provision regarding the responsibility of officers of a body corporate for offences committed by the body. This is relevant to the provisions on carrier liability at section 2. Before coming to the Refugee Act amendments at section 6, I will briefly refer to section 7. This is a largely technical amendment. Its purpose is to restore to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a power to prescribe the ports and airports at which non-nationals coming from a place outside the State may land. Currently, the Minister would have to introduce primary legislation if he wished to designate any port in the State as one where non-nationals may land in the State. Clearly this is not an efficient way to do business. Without the flexibility to make suitable provisions by secondary legislation, which is always subject to review in any event by the Oireachtas, the potential delays involved in securing the passage of a Bill could create difficulties <Col N="328" /> for port or airport authorities who must await the passage of such legislation before they could act legally to allow non-nationals to land at their ports.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for amendments to the Refugee Act 1996. These fall into a number of broad categories as follows: technical amendments to do with the Refugee Advisory Board; the privacy of applicants; housekeeping matters regarding the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal; clarification of the Minister's power to agree arrangements with UNHCR for bringing in refugees in Ireland for resettlement and streamlining the process for dealing with asylum applicants who withdraw or abandon their applications.</P>
    <P>The first of these, paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the section, was designed to rectify a problem regarding the dates on which, under section 7A of the Refugee Act, the Refugee Advisory Board is to provide reports on the operation of the Refugee Act and other matters to do with the asylum process, which arose because of the unavoidable time delay between the passing in 1999 of the amendments which inserted that section into the Refugee Act and the commencement of that Act in November 2000. Due to the passage of time in this Bill's progress through the Oireachtas, the proposals for change in the Bill have been superseded and the Minister will bring forward on Committee Stage an amendment to replace the present paragraph (<i>a</i>)(i) with a more flexible provision which will cater for the establishment of the Refugee Advisory Board and its regular reports on asylum matters.</P>
    <P>The revised proposal will not affect the measure at subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) to give the chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal an <i>ex officio</i> place on the Refugee Advisory Board. The Refugee Applications Commissioner's role in relation to the board is already specified in the legislation. Her function as an <i>ex officio</i> member is to act as secretary to the board. It makes sense also to have the chairperson of the other key independent body involved in the asylum process as an <i>ex officio</i> member.</P>
    <P>Section 6(<i>g</i>) addresses the question of the privacy of applicants. It amends section 19 of the Refugee Act to remove the requirement of the Minister's consent where an asylum seeker himself or herself consents to be identified as such in the media. This change has been pressed for by many media interests, including some who have represented the current situation as being an absolute ministerial veto on any coverage of asylum matters. It is nothing of the sort. It is vital that asylum applicants, whose families may still be under threat in the home territory, should have a legal basis for protection of their privacy and the Minister is satisfied that the protection of the privacy of individual asylum seekers is sufficiently achieved without the additional requirement of ministerial consent.</P>
    <P>Section 6(<i>h</i>) inserts an important provision into the Refugee Act which provides for arrange<Col N="329" /> ments involving the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the acceptance into the State, by agreement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, of persons from around the globe who have already been identified by the UNHCR as persons fleeing persecution and in need of protection. This reinforces the solid commitment of the Government to assist the UNHCR in its resettling of displaced persons and, thus, to play our full part in the protection of those who really need protection.</P>
    <P>The next group of amendments to the Refugee Act, which I will describe, is at paragraphs (<i>i</i>) and (<i>j</i>) of section 6. These amendments address issues identified largely through the practical experiences of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal over the two and a half years or so of their operation. They deal with two aspects of the offices of the commissioner and the chairperson of the tribunal respectively. The first aspect is provision for an emergency appointment of a person to fill an unexpected vacancy in either office, or a temporary inability of the office-holder to perform his or her functions. The Minister is of the view that it is prudent to take this opportunity to fill that lacuna in the present Act. The second aspect dealt with in these amendments is the setting out of the powers of the office-holder to manage the business of the office in each case. In this regard, the provision in relation to the chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is set out in considerably more detail than that in relation to the commissioner. That is because, while the commissioner, as head of her office, can instruct or issue guidelines to her staff, the powers given to the tribunal chairperson must respect the independence of each individual member in the exercise of his or her functions and, in particular, in deciding individual appeals.</P>
    <P>Two further matters are provided at paragraph (<i>j</i>) in relation to the tribunal. One of these, at paragraph (<i>j</i>)(i), changes matters so that in the event of a casual vacancy in the membership of the tribunal the new appointee is appointed for a full three-year term, rather than the present arrangement whereby such an appointment is only to serve out the remainder of the term of the member being replaced. There is no particular benefit to be achieved by that arrangement and no good reason why there should not be overlaps of membership. The other additional matter is a provision for the preparation by the tribunal chairperson of annual reports and of reports on a one-off basis for submission to the Minister. These provisions at present exist for the commissioner.</P>
    <P>I now come to the most technically detailed of the Refugee Act amendments; that is the package of amendments at paragraphs (<i>b</i>) to (<i>f</i>) of section 6 which, taken together, provide a revised system for dealing with withdrawn and abandoned cases under the Refugee Act. In particular, it tackles the issue of applications where it is clear that an <Col N="330" /> applicant is no longer demonstrating any interest in pursuing an asylum claim and, indeed, may no longer be in the State. These changes are designed to address actual problems that have been experienced on a significant scale in dealing with asylum applications under the Refugee Act's provisions, which have been in operation since November 2000.</P>
    <P>The first phenomenon tackled is that of persons who apply for asylum &ndash; usually at a port of entry, which means that they must be allowed to enter the State &ndash; and then simply disappear. They never supply a contact address, either then or subsequently and, as a result, are untraceable. There are approximately 1,000 such cases on hand which cannot be processed or finalised in any way and the number is rising daily. In order to address this position, paragraph (<i>b</i>) amends section 9 of the Refugee Act to provide that where an applicant fails to inform the commissioner of his or her address within five working days of the making of the asylum application, the application shall be deemed withdrawn. The Minister is satisfied that five working days &ndash; in effect, a full week &ndash; is ample time in which the applicant can get his or her bearings in the State, almost invariably with the help of the reception and integration agency, and fulfil the very simple task of letting the commissioner know his or her address. To underline the seriousness with which we view failure to provide an address in order that the application can be dealt with, (<i>b</i>)(iii) makes it an offence, punishable by a fine of up to &euro;635, to fail to supply an address or change of address.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Irish asylum process is the high proportion of cases where the Refugee Applications Commissioner is unable to complete her investigation of the asylum claim because the applicant does not turn up for interview &ndash; an essential part of the investigation. Of the 12,677 interviews scheduled in 2002, it was possible to proceed with only 47%, or just under 6,000. In each of those cases, the Refugee Act at present requires that the applicant be asked again to attend for interview. Of those who did not show for interview when first asked, a total of 1,380 failed again to attend the second time, which is the equivalent of one in eight of all asylum applications lodged in 2002.</P>
    <P>The waste of time and resources on each no-show represents time and money that could be far better spent investigating the applications of people who are genuinely interested in being protected by this State from persecution. In order to address this in a more efficient way, but a way that still is fair to those who are forced through illness or some other pressing emergency to look for a rearranged interview, the Bill provides for a number of amendments to section 11 of the Refugee Act.</P>
    <P>The key amendments are at section 6(<i>c</i>)(iii) as follows &ndash; the new subsection (9) to section 11 of the 1996 Act provides a statutory basis for an applicant to withdraw the asylum claim volun<Col N="331" /> tarily and the new subsection (10) deals with the situation where the applicant fails to show for interview. Unless the applicant has a reasonable explanation for not turning up and gives it either before the date fixed for the interview or within three working days after the no-show, the application will be deemed withdrawn. The new subsection (11) deals with less direct forms of non-co-operation. The form of non-co-operation of the kind referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the new subsection (11) usually, but not always, manifests itself first when a letter to the applicant about some aspect of the claim for asylum is returned by An Post marked &ldquo;not known&rdquo; or &ldquo;gone away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of new subsection (11) covers a situation where the Minister becomes aware that the applicant is missing. This may come about because the Garda Síochána may indicate that an applicant has consistently been failing to observe a requirement to report once a week to a Garda under section 9(5); the reception and integration agency notes an absence from the assigned accommodation that it has provided for the applicant; or information comes to hand in some other way that an applicant is no longer at the address supplied. In any case like this, where the strong indications are that the applicant is not going to be around to assist in the investigation of his or her asylum application, once the Minister passes this information to the commissioner, the commissioner will write asking the applicant whether he or she is still pursuing the application. If there is no reply to this &ldquo;one last chance&rdquo; letter, the application is deemed withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 6(<i>d</i>) amends section 13 of the Act of 1996 and provides that on the withdrawal of an application the investigation of the claim is brought to an end; the report of the commissioner, which is prepared in all cases, will include a recommendation that the applicant not be declared a refugee and no appeal lies from that recommendation; and, as a consequence, the negative recommendation is sent directly to the Minister who will proceed to make the decision in each case that the applicant is not a refugee.</P>
    <P>It is not just during the first-instance investigation that asylum claims are withdrawn or simply abandoned. While most abandoned cases arise during the first stage of the process, a surprising 11% of appeals made to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal &ndash; one out of every nine appeals made &ndash; are also abandoned. In order to discourage abandonment of appeals at the appeal stage, it is necessary to put in place provisions, analogous to those I have just described for the first-instance investigation, to deal with &ldquo;no-shows&rdquo; at appeal hearings and other indications that the applicant is not available to pursue the appeal.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses this at paragraph 6(<i>e</i>), which amends section 16 of the Refugee Act &ndash; the appeals section. Other amendments being made to that section arise out of the fact that a with<Col N="332" /> drawal, whether actual or deemed, will be un-appealable and restates the existing statutory provision governing the withdrawal of appeals.</P>
    <P>The last amendment in the series dealing with withdrawn and abandoned cases, at section 6(<i>f</i>) of the Bill, deals with the final outcome of an application that is withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn. The outcome is, as I have already indicated, that the Minister will refuse to grant a declaration in every case where the negative recommendation arises out of a withdrawal or a deemed withdrawal. Of course, under present law, any applicant whose application has been rejected may seek the Minister's permission under section 17(7) of the Act to make a fresh application, and this Bill does not interfere with that.</P>
    <P>These are the amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 that already appear in the Bill before the House. I will now outline the further amendments, which are in preparation and which the Minister intends to put to Government for bringing forward on Committee Stage. His proposals include provisions for a speedy &ndash; in some instances, very rapid &ndash; process for dealing with applications that are either what one might call manifestly well-founded or which have characteristics indicating that undue time and resources should not be wasted upon them. A particular example of a class of cases of the latter type concerns persons coming from candidate countries of the European Union, which are widely recognised as safe and generally do not give rise to well-founded claims of fear of persecution. The Minister is aiming for a position where applications selected on a basis such as this, can be investigated, decided upon, and any appeal dealt with within a matter of days after the person arrives in the State. The purpose will be twofold: first, to avoid the unnecessary expenditure of taxpayers' money on supporting applicants whose claims are likely to be without merit; and to send a strong signal to potential abusers of Ireland's asylum system, and to those who expect to profit from them, that there is no point in making an unfounded claim for protection in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also developing amendments to deal more effectively with those who come to Ireland to claim asylum even though they have had ample opportunity to avail themselves of protection in safe countries through which they have travelled. It cannot be right that people who are genuinely fleeing persecution should studiously avoid seeking the protection available in any one of several countries of transit, which are safe havens and willing to offer refuge to them, simply to suit themselves or, more usually, to suit the people-smugglers to whom they have paid their life savings or may still owe money. The Minister's aim is to improve the turnaround time for such applicants, who can expect to be sent promptly back to whatever safe country they have come through to have their asylum claims dealt with there.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also examining the possibility <Col N="333" /> of amendments to spell out in statute where the burden of proof lies in asylum cases and what factors are to be taken into account when assessing the credibility of an applicant, in particular, the extent to which an applicant who gives an obviously untrue or incomplete story about such readily verifiable matters as how he or she arrived in the State, is to be believed in the details which he or she gives regarding the asylum application itself.</P>
    <P>Among the other areas which the Minister expects will be dealt with in the package of amendments which he will table on Committee Stage are: revised provisions for fingerprinting to improve the system's effectiveness in reducing the scope for multiple asylum applications or other abuses; powers for the Minister to set from time to time the priorities with which the two independent bodies, the commissioner and the tribunal, are to deal with different elements of their workload, though not interfering with the independence of their decision-making functions; other technical amendments on the sharing of information between the various agencies involved in the wider asylum process; and the publication of selected decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which will greatly benefit practitioners, applicants and the staff of the commissioner.</P>
    <P>The Bill will put in place a range of measures regarding immigration and its related issue, asylum, which will reduce the scope for abuse, reduce the incentive for abuse and deal justly and promptly with abuse where it does occur. I reiterate that the Bill does not interfere with the State's obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention and the related 1967 protocol to provide refugee protection to those who require that protection. The Bill, along with the Committee Stage amendments in development, will provide a more solid foundation to ensure that these obligations are better complied with and that genuine refugees obtain protection more speedily.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the Dáil and look forward to engaging in a constructive debate with Deputies on the important provisions contained in it. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister of State on the speed at which he read his script. It is impressive that he got through it all, but he might need to work on emotion and feeling in regard to it. It is becoming typical in the House that a script is prepared for a Minister and he or she has to get through it. In fairness to the Minister of State, this practice is not his area, but it is dreadfully boring.</P>

      <P>This legislation will make it an offence for carriers to transport migrants, regardless of their asylum status, without valid documentation. Unfortunately it does not draw a distinction between political refugees and economic refugees, a distinction the United Nations High Commission for Refugees has identified. That is something we will have to thrash out on Committee Stage. The legislation also requires carriers to take responsibility for detention costs and they will also be liable for the costs of the removal of third country nationals who are refused entry into Ireland.</P>
      <P>I listened to and read the comments made during the Seanad debate on the Bill, with some of which I disagree in the sense that one cannot have it both ways. It was not so long ago that 58 people were suffocated in the back of a container lorry. We need to impose severe penalties on those people who are prepared to bring illegals into this country. I agree with some of the Minister of State's comments, that there is an element of organised crime involved. The EU needs to harmonise its laws and we need to have strict laws when it comes to carriers who are prepared to take the risk of bringing illegals into the country. That is dangerous and there needs to be a deterrent in place, on that I agree.</P>
      <P>The legislation also makes it an offence for an employer to take on a non-national without an employment permit. The Equality Authority has warned for some time of the exploitation of illegals, of the denial of their basic human rights and of the incredibly bad working conditions in which many of them find themselves. The Bill addresses that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 80% to 90% of immigrants are economic as opposed to political refugees. We need proper restrictions on access to this country. My party and I will support sensible measures in this regard. Across the immigration area in general there is an almost fanatical zeal by the Government to be perceived as being the hard man on immigration. There is a growing mob element fuelled by racism. There is an ugliness creeping into our society. It has got to the point where someone with dark skin is perceived immediately to be an asylum seeker and, therefore, a sponger. We saw during the last election how politically fashionable it had become to almost attack asylum seekers. That must be guarded against. I do not see the Government taking steps to guard against that kind of growing racism. We have an obligation to guard our immigration laws, to make sure that they are not taken advantage of, but we also have an obligation to integrate and to allow for diversity. The policy of the Government for the past few years seems to be one of lock them up and kick them out. That goes down well in some sectors of society, but it is not a balanced policy. I detect a strain of intolerance with the legislation and the measures that have been taken by the Government in recent years. There seems to be a reluctance to co-ordinate and implement a policy of integration. Some steps <Col N="335" /> have been taken on the anti-racism side, but not enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; I am disappointed he is not present &ndash; once wrote that it is time for coolness and kindness as qualities in the debate on immigration. He said that humanity has now a chance to prevail. He said that what is of concern is not the issue, but the values which we bring to bear on it. That has not happened.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I believe we would do non-nationals a favour by heightening the restrictions on their access into this country because they get murdered when they come here. One in every seven of the unlawful killings that occurred last year was of a non-national. That is an extraordinary statistic. It is also clear that the Garda does not have the contacts and sources within our non-national communities and have not had them for some time. A unit has been set up, but it is clear and has been identified that the Garda does not have those necessary contacts.</P>
    <P>In October 2001, the Garda Commissioner, Pat Byrne, initially came up with the suggestion that we need to distinguish between crimes committed against nationals and non-nationals. We need to have the numbers readily available to determine racist violence. As of now, there is no way of distinguishing between crime committed against nationals and non-nationals in some circumstances. The expert review group on crime statistics needs to take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>Two years ago a survey was carried out among members of the Garda Síochána and the majority of those surveyed said they were uncomfortable with changing the regulations to allow a member of the Garda Síochána to wear a head-dress and to lower the height requirement to allow members of non-national communities to enter the force. Only half of those surveyed said they were comfortable with encouraging applications from racial and ethnic minorities. We have to be mindful of the fact that many members of our non-national communities come from oppressive regimes and have an inherent distrust of the police. Gardaí in Templemore and outside it need more intercultural training, communications training and a basic training in human rights law. That is not occurring across the ranks.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> recently reported that there is no requirement to secure the services of a competent interpreter before a non-national suspect is questioned by gardaí, that recordings of interviews with non-nationals are frequently not made and that the rights of non-national suspects in some cases are not fully explained to them. That is an area that needs to be identified and dealt with.</P>
    <P>The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism has reported that there has been a massive upsurge in racist e-mails and letters. They have advocated a complete review of the Incitement to Hatred Act, and we need that at the very least. Any such review needs <Col N="336" /> to establish whether Irish legislation is adequate to protect against new forms of racism such as racism on the Internet. There has not been enough research on that, as they are finding a huge increase in the percentage of racist comments made through text messaging and e-mails.</P>
    <P>The Government's famous response to this growing racism was Operation Hyphen, which was described by the Government's consulting body as inefficient and counterproductive. It went on to say that future operations could seriously alienate the trust of ethnic communities. The operation cost was &euro;100,000 and 140 people were detained, but only 15 were deported. It was defended by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who once wrote that he was sickened by the appalling spectacle of a Dublin-Belfast bus being escorted by squad cars because there was a black man on the bus who turned out to be a long-term Belfast resident. As a result of Operation Hyphen a lot of innocent black men ended up in squad cars but of the 74 people charged with immigration offences, 50 were released because they were legally resident in the State. That is a careless policy which fuels fear.</P>
    <P>The Minister once complained about the indignity and contempt with which the State treated its immigrant families. My party and I have no quarrel with the State's right to police its immigration laws firmly and its right to deport people. However, I have problems with a Government which advocates a reign of terror against sections of the immigrant population, many of whom are here legally. That must stop.</P>
    <P>My party will support tighter controls on economic refugees and the general view that there is no alternative to access controls. One must have those access controls, although they have been lax in the past, and we welcome new immigration and residence legislation. We also support the concept of a single European asylum and migration policy based on the provisions of the Amsterdam treaty. However, I have some misgivings about a proposal recently announced in the media which would result in asylum seekers forfeiting their rights to State benefits if they did not apply for same at their port of arrival when they came to the country. I agree with the Irish Refugee Council that in some cases these refugees are terrified out of their minds and the last thing they want to do is talk about where they came from and what they are at. It is crazy to seriously consider taking away their benefits because they do not make an application in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In England the High Court prevented the Government introducing such a measure. We would have to think long and hard about introducing such a provision as we would end up with thousands of immigrants working illegally at a time when we are dealing with legislation which purportedly combats exploitation. The measure would drive immigrants into illegal working situations and sweatshops would develop.</P>
    <P>Some asylum seekers continue to be sidelined in society. The vast majority are excluded from <Col N="337" /> the workforce and they are perceived as spongers as a result. That fuels racism. The Minister has repeatedly ruled out allowing asylum seekers to take up paid employment because he claims it would lead to a huge increase in the numbers applying. Our party policy has always been that after a certain amount of time asylum seekers should be allowed to work and this area should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>People become marginalised when they are not integrated and not working. The danger is that we will make asylum seekers welfare dependent and when one generation is welfare dependent and unemployed, the risks for the next generation are very high. The Government has referred to its migrant policy as being one of the most open in Europe but based on what some representatives of industry said recently, they would disagree strongly, particularly because the Government has cut back on work permits. That is a serious mistake. The Small Firms Association has made it clear that immigrant labour is not responsible for higher unemployment and that an endemic skills shortage remains in certain sectors. Those views are shared by ISME, which says that to clamp down on allowing non-EEA nationals to take up opportunities could conceivably lead to company closures and further job losses. The experts are saying we need more migrant workers next year in some sectors, despite the modest forecasts for economic growth, and they stress that for the most part immigrants are taking the jobs we are not doing ourselves.</P>
    <P>Rather than support Irish industry, the Government is more worried about maintaining a hard line on Irish immigration whatever the effect that has on the economy. That is regressive, small-minded and short-sighted. We need controls on access and to a certain extent the Supreme Court has done the Legislature's job for it. We need a proper system of integration because we are creating the conditions for marginalised communities and the risk is that we will perpetuate a new cycle of discrimination and long-term exclusion in those communities. At least 6% of the population are non-nationals, people who had no previous contact with Ireland, and 130 different countries are represented in our secondary schools. The challenge for us is to develop support systems and training for proper integration. Some schools have ongoing plans for multiculturalism and inclusion but many do not have the funding from the Department of Education and Science &ndash; it may not be the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which deals with this. Many schools are crying out for funding to conduct multicultural training.</P>
    <P>Attention must be paid to a policy which embraces diversity and that policy must be balanced, which is not the case at present. Since the Government took office race crime has increased dramatically while the Administration's desire to be seen as tough on illegal immigration has been the dominant factor in immigration law. The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="338" /> Reform said once that this State has a tradition of hard-nosed, red-necked discrimination, and that has not changed greatly. It is time to confront the red-neck element but that takes political courage. We have a legacy of intolerance on this island &ndash; for 30 years Catholics and Protestants were intolerant of each other and there is a danger that if we do not learn lessons from the past we will be doomed to repeat it. The legislative measures we have introduced in the past three to four years which affect non-national communities have a distinct strain of intolerance.</P>
    <P>This is another Bill which effectively cracks down on illegal immigration. Our immigration legislation needs to be balanced and must take account of our multi-ethnic society and the treatment of non-nationals in Ireland. We need to encourage tolerance and awareness of cultural diversity and to facilitate integration. We could start by improving the working rights and conditions of immigrants.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Garda Síochána and the minority community must improve. We must adhere to the requirements in law when dealing with non-nationals in custody, review the incitement to hatred legislation and increase the number of work permits for non-nationals in certain industrial sectors. The crime statistics must reflect the number of offences committed against nationals and non-nationals. We must finance the support systems and training for proper integration in schools.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party is a pro-immigration party. While we believe in strict access controls, we are also in favour of diversity and multi-culturalism. The wealth created in Ireland in the past ten or 15 years was brought about, in large part, by foreigners. These factors make our society more complex, but also much more interesting.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. While I accept that he has responsibility for taking the legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas and did a good job in this respect in the other House, I deplore the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is not dealing with the legislation. The Bill bears all the Minister's hallmarks and reflects his statements and views. As its tenor is that of the Minister, he should be here to defend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Deasy stated, this is not balanced legislation. We need a balanced and sympathetic approach to non-nationals who come here, which recognises we are not an insular society but a global one and that we are part of both the European Union and the world body of nations. Major questions of racism, inter-culturalism and multi-culturalism need to be addressed, in addition to obvious issues such as the manner in which we deal with asylum seekers and non-nationals who come here in search of work. The programmes, laws and regulations in place for this purpose <Col N="339" /> must be reviewed if we are to create a balanced approach to this issue.</P>

      <P>The issue of my mobile telephone is work for another day. All the human rights organisations disagree with the approach outlined by the Minister of State. Amnesty International, Comhlámh, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Refugee Council and the Refugee Protection Policy Group have combined in universal opposition to the Bill. None of them believes it is justified. The only people who believe the Bill has merit and value are the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>The objections of the human rights organisations focus specifically on a dangerous measure which provides for liability of carriers. The argument that similar measures are being introduced in other European Union member states does not make it right, either in terms of domestic or international law. The Bill places the onus on carriers of persons and goods to check that the travel documents of all persons arriving here in the carriers' vehicles are authentic. Failure to do so will become an offence subject to a fine and prosecution in the courts. The State is gratuitously and shamefully transferring its responsibilities regarding the processing of non-nationals under international law to unqualified third parties.</P>
      <P>The Bill even provides for the mandatory vetting of all Irish citizens returning from abroad by a new immigration police force which will patrol all access points. Undoubtedly, traffickers and smugglers of people will have a field day and make windfall profits on human misery as asylum seekers and refugees who have been subjected to persecution are forced to pursue clandestine means and routes because all other avenues to safety have been closed off. Such mandatory vetting of citizens by immigration police may well be unconstitutional. I believe the provisions of the Bill are in breach of international law, particularly Article 31 of the United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951, as they would have the direct effect of inhibiting and obstructing those fleeing persecution from seeking a safe haven and asylum here.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the Bill constitutes the Government's response to the Nice treaty and our acceptance of European Union enlargement. It is the Government's new version of céad míle fáilte. The Minister is pulling down the shutters, battening down the hatches and letting loose the immigration police. The great Irish diaspora of the past two centuries and the generosity of other nations has been forgotten in the narrow, xenophobic policy of the current Government. This Bill marks the beginning of efforts by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties to build a fortress Ireland in a fortress Europe and is not a pretty sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" />It has taken approximately 15 months to bring the legislation to this point during which time it has undergone a sea change. It is clear from the Minister of State's introductory remarks that the original thrust of the Bill was to address the question of employment permits and non-nationals working here without such permits, yet the relevant section, which imposes savage sanctions of up to &euro;250,000 in fines and ten years' imprisonment, has been excised from the Bill and inserted in the Employment Permits Bill.</P>
    <P>Much of the Minister of State's contribution dwelt on the section which has been removed, rather than the new focus of the Bill, which is the measure placing responsibility for checking the content, validity and authenticity of passengers' documentation on carriers of people, namely, companies operating ferries, aeroplanes and other vehicles at ports and airports, and delivering such passengers to the immigration officers present at such locations. The measure is specifically directed at asylum seekers and aims to keep them out of this country.</P>
    <P>The removal of the section dealing with employment permits has gutted the Bill and changed its thrust. I fail to understand the reason we introduce legislation which is then left for 15, 18 or 24 months. A considerable number of Bills fall into this category. By the time they come before the House, they have become somewhat irrelevant having been overtaken by events or the competent Minister has changed his or her mind and decided to amend them or insert new elements. The legislation before us has suffered in all these respects. Having passed the Seanad in its original form, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment removed one of the Bill's most important sections and incorporated it into other legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill still includes section 4 on the employment of non-nationals. Why are we discussing this matter when the Minister of State informed the House the section would be removed? He also informed us he planned to introduce substantial new amendments, but refuses to tell us what they are. We are discussing a Bill that is only a shadow of its final draft given the amendments to be made on Committee Stage and so on. The substance of a Bill should be in front of us on Second Stage and, generally, it should only require minor amendment if a Minister knows what he or she is doing. The Minister of State should not chop and change and transform a Bill in mid-stream. We still do not know what are we debating because we do not know what new amendments will be tabled. There is no sign of them.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago I asked the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment during the debate on the Employment Permits Bill 2003 what amendments would be introduced to this Bill. She informed and assured me that she would circulate the amendments before Second Stage of the Bill was taken. I asked the Taoiseach about this yesterday but the poor old Taoiseach did not <Col N="341" /> know what was going on, although, eventually, having gone on about it for a while, he said the Minister would deal with the issue on Second Stage. However, a commitment had been made that the spokespersons would be given an opportunity to peruse the substantial amendments that would be introduced. It is not good enough that the Minister of State is hiding them, given that the Bill has passed through the Seanad and we must deal with it now without knowing what it will contain. Second Stage provides an opportunity to examine the general thrust of the legislation to see where we are going. If substantial amendments are being introduced, then the general thrust of the legislation is being withheld from us. I am far from happy with the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>I should restate at this point the well-established Government policy in the matter of asylum &ndash; a policy to which the Government is unshakeably committed. The aim of this policy is to ensure that people arriving in the State who are genuinely in need of the protection of the State are identified as such as soon as possible after they arrive, so that they can immediately start the process of integration into Irish society and take up the rights to which they are entitled under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its amending protocol of 1967.</P>
    <P>A person who seeks asylum in the State makes the very serious claim to be here in our country seeking the protection of our State and cannot return to his or her country of origin for fear of being persecuted.</P>
    <P>How can an asylum seeker come to Ireland once the legislation has been passed? The hatches have been battened down and a mechanism is being put in place so that nobody can come to Ireland unless his or her documentation has been checked before he or she embarks. There must be prior vetting of the documentation to ensure it is in order, otherwise the carrier will be severely sanctioned. How many asylum seekers have documentation that is in order? If they are fleeing a regime, such documentation will not be provided for them. While being persecuted, they can hardly say they are seeking asylum in Ireland and ask for proper documentation because Ireland has introduced carrier liability legislation and if they do not have proper documentation entering Ireland, they will not be allowed into the country. Asylum seekers cannot reach Irish shores if this legislation is passed and, if the Minister of State was honest, he would admit the thrust of the legislation is to prevent asylum seekers from ever entering Ireland.</P>

      <P>Ireland is an island that has become part of the mainstream of the continent through the European Union and we have done <Col N="342" /> well over the past three decades as a result. The people are proud to be Europeans. However, we do not want an insular policy of this nature that leads to the introduction of tight regulations under which there must be prior checking of all documentation and the carrier must ensure it is in order before asylum seekers are transported. It will be impossible for asylum seekers to reach Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is no good for the Minister of State to refer to the Labour Party amendment he accepted in the Seanad. It is irrelevant in terms of dealing with the problem if he has put forward an inhibitory and obstructionist approach, which means nobody can reach our shores. One can only apply for asylum when one arrives in Ireland. If people are barred from entering the State, how can they apply for asylum?</P>
      <P>Section 2(9) states: &ldquo;This section without prejudice to the provisions of sections 8, 9 and 24 and the discretion of the Minster to admit to the State a person whom the Minister considers to be in need of the protection of State. . . &rdquo;  This legislation is about nothing other than keeping these people out. There is no good in saying we have nice procedures under the fine Refugee Act 1996 for dealing with applications and everybody is entitled to apply. Sections 8 and 9 relate to the provisions for making applications when one has arrived in the State.</P>
      <P>The legislation should be withdrawn because it is a scandal and an insult. It is in breach of international law. Many organisations, including Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and others dealing with human rights issues hold the view the legislation is in breach of the Geneva Convention while the Government is the only body that does not think so. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, carriers should not be penalised for transporting people who are seeking international protection from persecution. God knows it took us long enough to establish a structure for the UNHCR to operate in Ireland. The Minister of State will recall the days at Shannon Airport when people fleeing from Cuba and the former Soviet Union were put back on their airplanes immediately by the Garda without having the benefit of a hearing. It was due to complaints about the manner in which they were dealt with that, eventually, the UNHCR office was established at the beginning of the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation we will return to those days and it will be worse because asylum seekers will not be allowed on airplanes or boats before they embark and they will not have the opportunity to reach their destination and make an application. We are a long way from the Ireland of the diaspora. It was St. Patrick's Day a few weeks ago. I do not know where the Minister of State was but every Minister&mdash;</P>

      <P>How many Irish people who went to the four corners of the globe over the past two centuries were equipped with proper documentation, with everything in order? If they were checked by carriers on arrival in the United States, South America and various other countries, how many Irish Ministers would now have the opportunity to go abroad on St. Patrick's Day to celebrate that great Irish diaspora resulting from the flight of Irish people from persecution and famine? Many of them were economic refugees. It is not very long since we were fighting for special concessions for our economic refugees in the United States, as Deputy O'Flynn may recall. Just a decade ago, successive Taoisigh and Ministers were trying to influence people at the highest level in the USA. It was a specific aspect of St. Patrick's Day visits by Irish Taoisigh to US Presidents to secure visas for Irish &ldquo;non nationals&rdquo; so that they could remain in the United States.</P>
      <P>Memories are very short. Following half a dozen boom years in this country, we now wish to batten down the hatches. We do not want anybody else to come here to enjoy the benefits. That is a very heavy-handed approach. All of the legislation is negative, in terms of sanctions, penalties, preventative measures, inhibition and obstruction. Even in the section of the Bill which amends the Refugee Act, the aim is to make it difficult for people to pursue their applications for refugee status if there is delay, or what the Minister sees as time wasting, or if things are not done within a specified time, regardless of how long it has taken the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to process the current volume of applications. Asylum seekers in this country have had to wait years to have their applications processed. Yet, in this Bill, the Minister provides that if there is any delay by an asylum seeker in submitting an application, attending for interview or whatever, the application will be immediately struck down and deemed invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent Supreme Court decision determined that residency would not be a requisite for the parents of any child born in this country to non nationals. Many of those people have withdrawn their applications for refugee status on the understanding that they would be automatically entitled to residency. We are not sure what their status is. The Minister has stated that he has a certain sympathy for the approximately 10,000 to 12,000 people who are affected in this way. However, he has not done anything about this situation and there is no way of knowing what will happen. Technically, one cannot re-apply once <Col N="344" /> one has withdrawn an application. People withdrew their applications for particular reasons. The time limit which the Minister is now introducing would appear to militate against them.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister introduce an immigration Bill which is entirely concerned with controls? The term &ldquo;control&rdquo; is central to the very title of the Bill: &ldquo;An Act to make provision in relation to the control of entry into the State of non nationals and to amend the Refugee Act&rdquo;. The emphasis is on absolute control and inhibition in relation to anybody arriving on these shores. I wonder where the Minister is really coming from in this regard, considering the manner in which he has already dealt with the provision of holding centres throughout the country while, at the same time, he was part and parcel of the bodies that objected to the use of Broc House as a centre for refugees. After the State had spent millions on updating it, the whole community in that area of Dublin 4 objected to the location of any centre for refugees in their midst. That is one side of the coin.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, the Minister is trying to effect deportations in a very ham-fisted fashion. He introduced Operation Hyphen to round up people, irrespective of whether the Garda have any evidence as to whether the people they are chasing are bona fide or bogus asylum seekers. In reality, the information available to the Garda was so pathetically inadequate that virtually nobody came within the terms on which arrests were being sought. Five or six hundred people were searched. How did all of those search warrants originate? What was the process involved? How did any court issue search warrants to the Garda on the basis of minimalist information to indicate that the people concerned were validly within the relevant remit of such warrants? Such questions must be answered. Should Garda resources be used in that fashion? Does the Garda know what is going on in this area? Does the Minister know what is going on, or is he just acting, in a fit of bravado, to show how tough he is in terms of action on the streets? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appears to be more concerned with media projection than anything else.</P>

      <P>Yes, he is very good at that. However, in terms of his real responsibilities, he is certainly very lax in ensuring that they are properly undertaken and implemented. I wish to raise a few other questions in the short time remaining. How is a carrier to determine whether an asylum seeker's documentation is valid? What is a carrier to do if told that a person is an asylum seeker? Is the carrier to allow that person to board the vehicle or to refuse on the basis that Irish law requires documentation to be in order? Will carriers be given any directions to enable them to allow asylum seekers to go on board? How will that be done? This legislation seems to <Col N="345" /> say the opposite. Is there an appeal mechanism if the carrier declines to recognise a person as an asylum seeker? Why should a carrier have any authority in that regard in any case? </P>

      <P>They are in another jurisdiction, but that is not our jurisdiction. We are talking about Ireland's obligations, under international law, to deal with asylum seekers. Irrespective of the jurisdiction in which they are, we have obligations under international law. Just because one may quote the Dublin convention, that does not diminish our obligations under international law in relation to any person who is an asylum seeker in search of a safe haven from persecution. One cannot simply claim that we have rules and regulations. International law demands that we listen to such a person and give him or her a fair hearing. There is nothing in this Bill to cover that situation. We must have regard to the existence of traffickers, smugglers and clandestine routes. The cowboys and criminals involved will be in a position to operate with impunity in a situation where, on the one hand, everything is above the law in terms of the Minister's strict implementation and, on the other hand, there are situations which are outside the law. The pursuit of extreme measures has never proved very credible. The Minister of State will be glad to hear that I welcome the immediate establishment of the refugee advisory board and the appointment of 15 members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. I am worried about the thrust of the legislation and its implications as well as the fact that it has been chopped and changed and is not the Bill that was first drafted. I am also worried that the Minister is to table amendments but is not prepared to put them before the House at this stage. The legislation is a bad day's work and should be rejected.</P>

      <P>Sinn Féin has called for a positive, compassionate and anti-racist immigration and asylum policy. A raft of reforms is needed in these policy areas which are not addressed in this Bill as present provisions are not only woefully inadequate, but are negative, backward and xenophobic. Immigration and asylum policy in this State needs a massive overhaul to reflect a genuine commitment to equality and human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House is in no way positive, compassionate or anti-racist, nor does it comply <Col N="346" /> with Ireland's human rights obligations. It is also of questionable legality, being introduced under an EU imperative to comply with the 1990 Schengen Agreement. It not only acquiesces in, but seeks to enforce, the fortress Europe agenda &ndash; something we should actively oppose as unjust and hypocritical. For these reasons, this Bill before the House today is totally unacceptable to Sinn Féin and we strongly oppose it.</P>
    <P>If the Bill must progress to Committee Stage, and I support Deputy Costello's calls for it to be withdrawn and redrafted, Sinn Féin insists that prior to the Bill being taken on Committee Stage, it must be the subject of joint committee hearings, so that the implications of the legislation can be fully investigated, and the members of the committee can consider all the relevant evidence available from the human rights NGOs and other agencies which are so concerned that this Bill will violate human rights and Ireland's human rights obligations.</P>
    <P>I oppose carrier liability legislation in principle because it will force untrained airline and ferry staff into the role of immigration officials and the protection of human rights will be devolved to commercial entities, thereby risking the indiscriminate prevention of individuals from entering Irish territory to claim asylum. Measures which directly or indirectly obstruct the entry of asylum seekers into their territory are incompatible with international law and, in particular, with Article 31(1) of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. A state's right to control its borders is not absolute &ndash; it must be proportionate and humane. Denial of entry into the State on the basis of lack of proper documentation will remove access to the whole asylum apparatus established under the Refugee Act 1996, without any mechanism for transparency or accountability, or means of appeal. Sinn Féin is therefore in agreement with the position taken by the UNHCR, Amnesty International and the Irish Refugee Council &ndash; all of whom are opposed to this Bill in its present form.</P>
    <P>It is well known that people fleeing persecution are forced to travel with incorrect or incomplete documentation. Denied regular means of transport as a consequence of this legislation, refugees will be driven to resort to dangerous means of travel. This Bill will force many asylum seekers into the hands of smugglers and human traffickers and into the back of freight containers, with the deadly and tragic consequences such as those we saw in Wexford. Other European countries have introduced carrier liability legislation and the results have been horrific. Many refugees forced into irregular transport have drowned, frozen, or suffocated en route. As of 20 November 2002, nearly 3,500 asylum seekers have died trying to access fortress Europe &ndash; and these are only the documented deaths. Shame on the Government for introducing a Bill that will increase the potential for such gruesome and unnecessary episodes to continue.</P>
    <P>Our main concerns with this Bill are sections 2 <Col N="347" /> and 6 which, as they stand, do not conform with international standards. Section 2 proposes to penalise transporters bringing in non-nationals without proper travel documentation and-or entry permits but the Bill does not allow for any asylum-related defences to liability. The UNHCR has stated that such measures interfere with the ability of persons at risk of persecution to gain access to safety. This is incompatible with international human rights and refugee protection principles, notably Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights according to which each person has the right to seek asylum, and Articles 31 and 33 of the 1951 Convention. The UNHCR strongly argues that carriers liability should not apply to refugees and asylum seekers with which I agree.</P>
    <P>At minimum, section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) must be removed from this Bill. What is now section 6 introduces several measures regarding refugee applications and appeals that are withdrawn or &ldquo;deemed to be withdrawn&rdquo;. It prioritises administrative efficiency over due process requirements by mandating that such applications automatically receive a negative decision without the right of appeal. It states that &ldquo;an applicant shall be declared not to be a refugee&rdquo; in addition to &ldquo;having their application withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn&rdquo; if they have failed to comply with time limit provisions. This is neither right nor proportionate. As Amnesty International has pointed out, an individual does not cease to be a refugee merely by failing to comply with arbitrary administrative time limits.</P>
    <P>In international law, a person claiming convention refugee status cannot be found not to be a refugee without a substantive interview and consideration in light of the convention refugee definition. This measure, as proposed, could exclude those in need of protection on the basis of expedience. It is mean-spirited, illegal, and should be rejected. The UNHCR advocates that the proper procedure is for those who are deemed to have abandoned their claims to have their files closed and retain, in the interests of due process, the right to apply to re-enter the asylum procedure.</P>
    <P>Ireland must defy the European directive and refuse to introduce such legislation as it violates international law. If we are then taken to the European Court of Justice, this would allow us to take the lead in challenging it at European level, as we should have done at an earlier stage. I urge the Government to reconsider this Bill, withdraw it and, in its place, introduce positive immigration reforms, such as those advocated by Sinn Féin and many other groups in Ireland and internationally.</P>

      <P>There has been a slight change in the balance of power in the Chamber since I was here last. It is good to have you in the Chair, Deputy McCormack.</P>
      <P>There is a sound in the distance and it is the sound of the drawbridge being raised, of the people in the tower quietly cooing with satisfaction as the gates are closed against people coming into Ireland. We have heard of fortress Europe. That is clearly being replaced by fortress Ireland. The Green Party opposes the Government's shift of responsibility of decision making onto people not trained in immigration procedures. Such decisions directly affect the lives of the people involved.</P>
      <P>How dare the Minister of State suggest that those coming into Ireland will be required to have their passports in order. How dare he suggest they will be able to access information on immigration procedures on the world-wide web. Does he not realise that people fleeing atrocities, be it in central Africa or Africa or persecution in eastern Europe, may well not have access to the web and may not have access to the kind of documents to which he refers? How dare he suggest that an asylum seeker must have his or her passport in order when fleeing from atrocities in his or her former country. I do not think that is an appropriate view; the Minister of State's view from the ivory tower is clouded.</P>
      <P>I am worried that this Bill will close the door on many. I worry that Operation Hyphen, introduced last year, will be replaced by operation full stop when this Bill comes into effect. This Bill will discriminate against those who have a right to remain in Ireland. It will make it more difficult for people to come into this country and will drive others underground into more dangerous situations. Any restrictions on entering Ireland by those fleeing human rights persecutions or violations is contrary to Article 31 of the Geneva Convention 1951. Not all those fleeing persecution will have on their personal documentation issued by the country from which they are fleeing. It is vital we recognise this. A consequence of this will be more incidents like the one in Wexford where eight people died last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a real danger that people will be forced into seeking refugee status in countries other than Ireland. The Minister of State is well aware that in France the circumstances in which one can claim refugee status are much narrower. In France, for instance, one cannot claim persecution from non-State actors. That means somebody fleeing from Iraq, fleeing persecution <Col N="349" /> from non-Government forces such as local representatives of the Ba'ath Party cannot claim refugee status in France. Such people can claim refugee status in Ireland where the circumstances are much wider. The process of <i>refoulement</i> is a dangerous one which will result in individuals applying for refugee status in other European Union countries where definitions are narrower. I am concerned about that because of the toll on human lives. The Minister of State well knows that more than 3,500 people died in recent times while trying to gain access to Europe due to border militarisation, carrier sanctions and detention policies. This inevitably forces people to take more dangerous routes. A great deal of information in that regard is contained on various websites such as unitedagainstracism.org that provides numbers in relation to those falling into difficult situations as a result of the implementation of carrier sanctions in other countries. Such sanctions were implemented in a manner which is inconsistent with human rights under Articles 31 and 33 of the Geneva Convention 1951.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is calling for exemptions to these sanctions for those found to be carrying asylum seekers as exist in other countries such as Spain, Norway and France. It is not acceptable that the carrier of an asylum seeker is penalised even if that person is found to be a legitimate seeker of asylum. Neither I nor the Green Party think that is fair.</P>
    <P>The United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Irish representative on that body have voiced serious and significant concerns about this Bill. In particular, they are concerned about the determination of withdrawal which will unduly discriminate against people coming into the country. The system of deeming an application to be withdrawn is a real and significant problem. It may well precipitate action at European level. I am concerned it may lead to a court case that could go against Ireland. If that is the case, it is good that matters will come to a head but it is not so good that the Minister of State is presiding over the introduction of such legislation.</P>
    <P>My great fear in regard to this legislation is that it primarily promotes an admission policy surrounding migration. We must move away from that area and look at the broader human rights issues. Let us look at the social and economic issues. Within the last few days the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland said it was having difficulty finding people to fill vacancies and would like to see a broader based admissions policy into Ireland. It would like to see more people coming into Ireland to fill the jobs we cannot fill. The Minister of State will say the introduction of this legislation will clarify who is coming in, who has a right to be here and who does not. I suspect it will lead to a tightening of the screws on our immigration policy and will lead to fewer people wishing to live and work in Ireland. I am concerned about that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" />The Minister is going for the watch tower approach rather than a more broadly-based human rights one. I am worried in that regard as funding from the European Union dries up. I am also worried about the perception of Ireland from abroad. We will be seen as having pulled up the drawbridge as we became wealthier. That sends out to the wider world all the wrong kinds of images of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State give an indication of when the refugee advisory board will be set up? Will he name those who will make up the board? It is crucial we have a wide spectrum of individuals represented on that board. When will it be set up and what kind of people are being considered for appointment to it? I suggest that when it is set up, the board be required to produce an annual report, given our volatile situation, rather than a biannual one. It would give us a clearer snapshot of emerging issues on an annual basis. I intend to table an amendment to the Bill in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is coming at this issue from an admissions policy. What happened to integration, human rights, equal access and participation? I am worried at the slant from which the Minister of State is coming at this issue. I hope this Bill will be discussed by the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights so NGOs and other groups will have a chance to make an input before it goes any further. I am concerned that the UNHCR has expressed concerns about this Bill. I would listen carefully to what it is says in that regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to Government policy, my colleague, Deputy Finian McGrath, discovered that Operation Hyphen involved the spending of over &euro;100,000 on Garda overtime. I would prefer if that money was spent on putting in place good policies on asylum seekers, immigration and migration.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the message this Bill sends out to the wider world. We intend to table substantial amendments to it. We wish to see the carriers' liability dropped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's presentation of the Bill to the House. I cannot welcome the Bill, largely because of the grave reservations expressed about its provisions by Amnesty International. Its human rights concerns relate specifically to section 2(1)(<i>c</i>), which requires carriers to ensure that non-nationals seeking to land in the State or pass through a port in the State en route to another state are in possession of valid passports or equivalent identity documents establishing their nationality and, if required by law, valid Irish transit visas or valid Irish visas. Penalties of &euro;3,000 per inadequately documented passenger will be imposed on the carrier for any contraventions of this requirement or if the papers turn out to be fraudulent. Similar to the penalty points provision, hauliers are being given the possibility of avoiding prosecution by the payment of a fine on the spot. This is a serious <Col N="351" /> imposition on the hauliers if they arrive in this country totally unaware that they may be carrying such passengers on their trucks.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International has stated that to penalise carriers in this way evades our duty to provide asylum from persecution, contrary to international human rights law. Amnesty further states that untrained airline and ferry staff will be forced into the role of immigration officials deciding which passengers' documents to scrutinise and who may or may not travel to safety in Ireland. Some of those turned away may face torture or worse.</P>
      <P>The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has expressed deep reservations about the &euro;3,000 fine for carriers and has expressed the view that this type of fine will drive refugees into the hands of human traffickers. Organised crime in Europe is raking in approximately &euro;7.8 billion from human trafficking, which is said to involve over four million unfortunate people who are duped into making a journey from eastern Europe with the promise of a job or a better tomorrow.</P>
      <P>As part of their exorbitant fees, smugglers who transport clients often supply false identity papers. That reprehensible practice deserves to be met with the full rigour of the law. Carriers who knowingly engage in this trade, which promotes economic slavery and which is indulged in by some unscrupulous people in Ireland are worthy of the fines specified in the Bill. However, Irish truck drivers who are themselves duped by these smugglers and whose ingenuity knows no bounds deserve to be treated somewhat more leniently as the imposition of heavy fines threatens to drive them out of business.</P>
      <P>It is virtually impossible for many genuine refugees to secure the documentation required by the Bill's provision. How are they supposed to enter this country legally in line with the Bill's requirements? These genuine asylum seekers will never reach this country to have their applications for asylum considered by our authorities. Instead, they may have their applications &ndash; in many cases life or death decisions &ndash; determined by some airline or ferry company clerk at the port of Le Havre or Charles de Gaulle Airport.</P>
      <P>It is the opinion of the UNHCR and the Irish Refugee Council that such restrictions and sanctions on carriers are in breach of the 1951 UN refugee convention under which the refugee status of anyone applying for asylum on the territory of Ireland would be determined. We are colluding in the &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; mentality which followed the war in the former Yugoslavia and resulted in the displacement of more than 2.5 million people from their homes. The collapse of communism in the past 15 years has also caused a major shift of peoples from the newly emerging nations which has flown from that. Since we pride ourselves on being loyal members of the European Union, we will be required to accept free movement from many of these nations shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" />Over the past century, Ireland has sent hundreds of thousands of economic migrants &ndash; in effect, refugees &ndash; to countries like the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In our annual national income statements a small item is faithfully recorded every year as a major contributory factor, namely, emigrants' remittances or money sent back to their own country by what is now fashionably referred to as our diaspora.</P>
    <P>This legislation is both heavy-handed and small-minded and amounts to a cynical attempt to minimise immigration into Ireland by the application of the law of láidir. The aim is to terrorise genuine asylum seekers and to simultaneously coerce staff of airlines and ferry companies into doing their work for them. This Bill must be opposed with all the energy we can muster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of addressing the debate on the Immigration Bill. Before I go into the details of the legislation I express our total support and sympathy to the two Indian nationals who were brutally assaulted outside McDonald's on O'Connell Street recently. That racist attack was horrific and the people responsible disgraced the vast majority of Irish people. Racism, like sectarianism, has no place in our society. It must be nipped in the bud and rooted out of society. It is a major cancer and everyone, particularly politicians, has a major role to play in this serious issue. We have had too many assaults and deaths. It is important to raise that issue in this debate and all Deputies and Ministers should unequivocally state where they stand on it.</P>
      <P>I have major concerns about section 2 of the Bill, which creates an obligation on a carrier whose vehicle brings persons to the State to pay a fine of &euro;3,000. Amnesty International and other organisations, including the UNHCR, are opposed in principle to the introduction of carrier sanctions in any form, a primary reason being that such restrictions drive asylum seekers into the hands of traffickers and smugglers and hence into increasingly dangerous modes of transport, such as containers, where lives are put at grave risk. We only have to remember the recent horrific events when people suffocated in containers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of carrier sanctions ignores the specific protection needs of refugees and asylum seekers but may also constitute a breach of international law in certain circumstances and prevent states fulfilling their obligations in terms of refugee protection. I understand the Government's desire to amend the Refugee Act with a view to improving case processing. The Bill contains several positive features such as the possibility of providing protection to refugees through resettlement and the concept of prioritisation of caseloads. I welcome these sections. However, the UNHCR considers that some aspects of the Bill need to be revised to ensure full conformity with international protec<Col N="353" /> tion principles as well as the realisation of the legitimate aims of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is in the spirit of its ongoing close co-operation with the Irish Government that the UNHCR, Dublin, stated that it trusts its observations and suggestions will be taken into consideration and appropriately reflected in the final text of the Bill. I urge the Minister to listen to the views of such credible organisations and groups, which are experienced in these issues.</P>
    <P>We should never forget the positive side of immigration, the growth of inter-cultural activities, the new dimension to our country and the massive boost to our economy. Those issues are often forgotten in the debate on this Bill. We seem to be obsessed with the &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; type approach which is creating misunderstanding and fear. We only have to look at Britain and the way its policies are helping far right groups in local government. They are now getting elected to councils, something we must guard against.</P>
    <P>We need honesty, openness, sensitivity and clarity in this debate. In the recent past some of our politicians have not shown leadership on this issue and they should be challenged at all levels. Racism has to be dealt with head-on. There is no room for beating around the bush.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome the great efforts of Amnesty International, Comhlámh, the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Refugee Council and the Refugee Protection Policy Group. These groups have shown leadership and vision. I will strongly support them, both inside the Dáil and in the wider community, and I urge all Members of the Oireachtas to do likewise.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to recognise the many concerns people have about this Bill and accept the reality that there are sections which are neither progressive nor democratic. It is essential that the Minister listens to these views. Good and sound legislation should always be based on listening and examining different views in an open and democratic manner. We must listen to our experts, and learn from experiences in other countries. We also must get consensus. This Bill lacks these ingredients and I have no alternative but to vote against this flawed legislation.</P>
    <P>Regarding some of the points raised earlier, we must remind ourselves of our own history, particularly the problems encountered by Irish emigrants going to England, America and across the world. We must acknowledge that there are many economic migrants from Ireland in other parts of the world who are not receiving their civil rights, and also the recent terrible situation of children born in this State not having proper and adequate rights. Then there is the terrible impact of Operation Hyphen, when Garda resources were used in raiding homes.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill is timely and necessary. The Bill amends the Refugee Act 1996. I commend Deputy McDowell, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for introducing this measure and thank Deputy O'Donoghue, who as Minister did valuable work in the area of immigration.</P>
      <P>It is the stated intention of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, that he will continue to maintain the high standards that already exist in this field. However, he has at the same time made it clear that there are changes that must be made. He intends to reduce the asylum seeker costs to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>We can make substantial savings by using the available funds with greater efficiency without diminishing the high levels of care available for genuine asylum seekers. We have always shown our full commitment to honouring our obligations to them. We have been both just and generous in our response to the needs of people fleeing from oppression and persecution in their native lands. We have given them the protection and the refuge they sought. It is important that this be stated.</P>
      <P>Ireland has honoured its commitments to those forced from their homes by oppression. It has faced this issue honestly. Some would say Ireland is at fault in its handling of immigration issues. It was said by people who should know better that &ldquo;our record on asylum policy is appalling; it is a litany of backward and oppressive measures.&rdquo;  These outrageous statements are unfair and unfounded and I would ask those who criticise to talk positively and with regard to the facts. Credit must be given to people who are tackling a difficult situation aggravated by a mass influx of immigrants, the vast majority of whom are economic migrants. The record is one of which those who deal with asylum matters can be proud.</P>
      <P>Major economies can be attained by ensuring that illegal immigrants are dealt with speedily. Ideally, this must be done at the point of entry. They must be deported with the minimum of delay to the country from which they last travelled to this State. To underline the urgent need for this course of action, we must bear in mind that senior gardaí and Government officials are reported as believing that the vast majority of claims for asylum are bogus. These are not my words. These are the words of the officials and senior gardaí, but it is also my viewpoint and I know that it is broadly shared in my constituency and across this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures released in the 2001 annual report of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, Ms Bernice O'Neill, bear out the accuracy of the public perception that there is a vast multitude of bogus applicants among the many who seek asylum here. The statistics make for alarming reading. A local newspaper has had a headline proclaiming &ldquo;Rejection of 6,631 Asylum <Col N="355" /> Cases Urged&rdquo;. In the body of its report, it revealed that only 467 applications were &ldquo;given the green light&rdquo; by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I examined figures in that body's report for the period in question &ndash; November 2000 to December 2001. I found that there were 12,577 applications. The Commissioner recommended rejection of 6,631 claims. More than 5,500 more were not passed for other reasons such as: claims were manifestly unfounded, failure by the applicant to attend a second scheduled meeting, the claim should be rightly determined in another Dublin Convention country, the claim was withdrawn from the asylum process by the applicant, and the commission decided that the claim was incapable of being processed.</P>
    <P>The figures speak for themselves. These are official statistics, they are not my statistics. That means that less than 500 applications, out of a full total of more than 12,000 submitted, were valid. Less than 4% of the claims were approved.</P>
    <P>The detection of illegal immigrants who have entered this country involves a costly and long drawn-out process. The Immigration Bill 2002 makes provision for the tightening-up of controls to prevent the illegal entry of non-nationals. The Minister clearly states that the system of carrier's liability is a legitimate form of immigration control. He sees it as a critical factor in the machinery to ensure the detection of illegal entry. It will put the onus on the carriers &ndash; airlines and shipping companies &ndash; to ensure that travellers brought here from other places are in possession of valid travel documents. The exercise of this responsibility by the carrier, combined with the vigilance of immigration officers, can stem the mass entry of illegal immigrants. This will help this State to cut drastically the massive and unsustainable costs involved in this area.</P>
    <P>A code of practice has been agreed with the Irish Road Hauliers' Association. This should ensure that the incidence of clandestine entry into this State by stowaways can be eliminated. The co-operation of carriers with immigration authorities is of paramount importance. This should help in the identification of potential illegal immigrants.</P>
    <P>Passengers must carry documentation required by Irish law. There are fines in place for carriers who fail to fulfil their obligations. A fine of &euro;3,000 will be imposed on each case of non-compliance. The payment of an on-the-spot fine of &euro;1,500 will mean that the carrier will avoid prosecution.</P>
    <P>This Irish legislation brings us into line with the normal procedures observed by our EU partners and with world-wide practice. It is important that ongoing dialogue is continued with all carrier bodies. The measures proposed in this Bill must be rigorously enforced.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the cost of dealing with immigration six years ago was &euro;30 million. This rose to &euro;255 million in 2001 and to more than &euro;300 <Col N="356" /> million in 2002. There is every prospect of increased costs in 2003, as tough new UK immigration laws are now in place.</P>
    <P>The fast-tracking of the claims of asylum seekers from countries with good human rights records must be made a priority. This will be a very positive step in the right direction. The listing of safe countries is a major step in the move to cut bogus applications. Safe countries should include all nations with long-established human rights records. It should include all member countries of the EU and countries such as the USA, Australia, New Zealand. Those states that are applying to join the EU also must be perceived to be among the safe countries of origin. The EU candidate states among the listed countries are: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary. Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.</P>
    <P>Denying asylum to people from these areas and other areas where they do not face persecution is not a contravention of human rights. There are those who come here as refugees from areas with a good humanitarian record. They are allegedly fleeing from persecution. We must eliminate all such bogus applications at an early stage. They are an abuse of our hospitality and our legal system. We must ensure that this system, involving both appeals and judicial reviews, must not be used to enable the many bogus applicants to spend months, sometimes years, receiving benefits at the expense of the taxpayer. There is still in place the existing machinery for a written appeal. This can still be used by immigrants even when their claims have been deemed to be clearly unfounded.</P>

      <P>Under new legislation, published as part of the Social Welfare Bill 2003, control of welfare payments to asylum seekers will pass to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Much of this significant bill, including the cost of accommodation, is paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Heavy costs are also incurred by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This Department has had to provide extensive new office accommodation to deal with immigrants and it has a staff in the region of 500 dealing exclusively with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda national immigration bureau incurs major expense when repatriating illegal immigrants. We, as a State, cannot continue to meet this huge and expanding bill. Our citizens are alarmed at the escalation of costs related to this problem. I know they will welcome this positive step. It is time the administration of asylum affairs was dealt with by one Department. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have overall control of all matters relevant to this area. This is important for the admin<Col N="357" /> istration of legislation regarding the entry of asylum seekers. It is logical that it should also have ongoing and total responsibility for asylum seekers while their claims for asylum in this country are being determined. Dual responsibility in any area leads to duplication of effort and waste of valuable resources. It also leads to major administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Irish Refugee Council has expressed reservations regarding the intended changes. It is on record as stating that the changes are alarming and unnecessary. It interprets the legislation as a step that will waste existing resources. I cannot see the logic in this line of thought. The council further states that the Government is playing with the welfare needs of asylum seekers to deter further asylum applications. I do not agree with this interpretation of the purpose and intent of the new legislation. We should have a single mechanism in place to monitor the entry of asylum seekers. It is a logical step that ensures that relevant matters will be dealt with in a more speedy and cost-effective manner.</P>
    <P>This move to centralise responsibility poses no hazard to the genuine asylum seeker. Those who seek to abuse the system, however, will find it much more difficult to evade detection, as their claims will be processed by the same Department from time of entry to departure. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will continue to be solely responsible for immigrants up to the point where they are granted or refused asylum. I welcome the introduction of the new measure. There is a pressing need for this more effective form of administration of asylum seeker affairs.</P>
    <P>There has been a drastic tightening up of British asylum requirements over the past 12 months. It is inevitable that the many illegal immigrants who are now being refused entry to the United Kingdom following the introduction of much stricter asylum procedures will be looking for an alternative venue near to hand. This State is their nearest port of call.</P>
    <P>On 29 January 2002, I wrote to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, making several proposals to him on the issue of immigration. This was the subject of much media speculation. Everyone was trying to figure out what I wrote to him &ndash; if they had put in an FAI request, they would have found out.</P>

      <P>I requested first that the Dublin Convention be enforced. We cannot continue to have other EU countries address their immigration problems by landing them on our doorstep. I am advised that only 1% of immigrants <Col N="358" /> come here directly from their own countries. Second, that the application process be speeded up with a view to early detection of illegal immigrants and that the deportation process be enforced without delay. Third, that a special High Court judge be designated to deal with legal aspects of deportation. Fourth, that there be compulsory health checks for all immigrants at points of arrival. Much disquiet has been expressed in relation to the serious health hazards endemic in the countries of origin of some refugees. We must protect the health of our own people. There is no point in having disease eradication programmes if vast numbers of people are not subjected to health checks when they seek asylum on our shores.</P>
      <P>I requested further that the law be amended to allow the immediate deportation of anyone carrying false documentation and that the law relating to the automatic rights of citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants be revised in line with EU practice. At this stage, the latter point has been ruled on by the Supreme Court. Last year I tried to make this point in the Chamber, but I was shouted down by people from the Opposition. I notice that those people were not elected to the House this time. These points were relevant then and they are even more relevant now.</P>

      <P>I addressed this matter at a time at which the immigration issue had developed into a major problem that appeared to be spiralling out of control. A small minority of the many who sought asylum in this State were genuine cases. I support genuine applicants &ndash; refugees and asylum seekers who are fleeing tyranny, oppression and religious persecution. I have made that point several times, but it is a pity some sections of the Dublin print media could not understand that. The vast majority of applicants, however, were economic immigrants who were attempting to seek asylum illegally. The position has not changed. It is necessary that we tackle this matter now.</P>
      <P>Ireland is the obvious destination for those who will not be allowed entry to the UK without the visa that is now required. Up to now, entry to that country had been granted to those carrying refugee documents. This was in line with a 1959 Council of Europe agreement that allowed visa-free access to such people. The tough new line has been introduced because many thousands of those seeking to enter were travelling from safe states. The attraction for those travelling on from safe havens to Britain was that benefits in that country were perceived to be more generous than those prevailing in the states to which they had first moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Home Secretary, Mr. David Blunkett, stated that the measures had to be introduced. The introduction of the new tighter regulations was prompted by the ever-increasing <Col N="359" /> and in many cases unjustified applications for asylum. Vast numbers who had been accepted as refugees elsewhere were moving on to the UK. This prompted the Home Secretary to re-appraise the existing entry regulations. He concluded that many of the applicants were abusing the asylum system &ndash; his words, not mine. He felt that they were in pursuit of better benefits and making use of the relatively lax criteria for the entry of immigrants, not trying to escape oppression. The fact that many were coming from safe countries verified this. Mr. Blunkett has stated that this practice is damaging to the overall integrity of the asylum system. I agree with him. He further states that it is placing an intolerable financial burden on the UK. I agree. He said that many valuable resources were being diverted from genuine applicants as a result of the massive numbers of applications from bogus asylum seekers. I agree with him.</P>
    <P>He further stated that the Home Office would crack down on the many asylum seekers who appeared to have no difficulty in returning to holiday in their native countries. When they first arrived they said they were seeking asylum after fleeing from tyranny and oppression in their native countries. Their statements were accepted as being truthful. Their initial allegations were that they had left their homes because they were suffering persecution from oppressive regimes in their native lands. The fact that they can now freely travel to their native lands, stay there and return to the UK without hindrance is proof that they were not genuine asylum seekers at the time they were granted permission to stay in Britain. Their actions at this point in time contradict their claims for refugee status at their time of entry.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, friend of the Irish people, the Government and the Taoiseach, wants the number of asylum seekers allowed entry to the UK to be drastically reduced. It topped 100,000 last year. He wants a further substantial decrease of up to 50% in the year ahead and he wants the numbers to be halved by September 2003. These measures are being introduced in the UK because of the significant financial implications of unchecked and mainly illegal immigration under the old system. It had developed into a major political problem that has had to be addressed. There has been a massive public reaction to the detection of terrorists who entered Britain via its hitherto liberal asylum system and there is widespread demand for the new, tighter laws.</P>
    <P>The Home Secretary wants to ensure the strict observation of the Dublin Convention. This was signed in 1990 during the Irish Presidency of the EU. This convention came into being so that the EU could put in place a mechanism to tackle the problems faced by those who were then titled &ldquo;refugees in orbit&rdquo;. These were the unfortunate refugees who were being shunted around Europe with no particular state willing to accept their asylum applications. The convention states that the <Col N="360" /> asylum applicants should be the responsibility of the first EU state they enter.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government is following in the footsteps of the British Government in taking action against bogus asylum-seekers. When I used the term con men in the House last year, I was berated by everybody. When I looked up the dictionary I found very little difference &ndash; if any &ndash; between con man and &ldquo;bogus&rdquo;. When others in senior public office use the word &ldquo;bogus&rdquo;, some sectors of the Dublin print media are full of praise for the initiatives to tackle bogus asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record again the fact that I do not object to genuine asylum seekers coming to this country and being treated properly by the State. I was called all sorts of names last year. That wonderful organisation, Amnesty International, took out a full-page advertisement in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>stating that Cork was racist. The same organisation wrote to the Garda Commissioner saying that I had uttered racist remarks. Never in my life have I done so, nor do I intend to. I was delighted that the Garda Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions could find no case for me to answer earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I ask the Opposition to support it to ensure that we treat properly those who are genuine and ensure those who are economic migrants are repatriated to their own countries or to the country they first entered the EU. This may well release money we need to fund other services in this country&mdash;</P>

I hope that when the Minister replies at the end of the debate, he will take the time to <Col N="361" /> distance himself from many of the sentiments contained therein.</P>
      <P>Many of Deputy O'Flynn's utterances seem to revolve around the economics of dealing with these refugees. When I hear that and some of the figures he quotes, it sounds very familiar. Recently the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights discussed the status of refugees with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who used very similar figures. The Minister was so concerned about the economics of this that he stated our overseas aid was not at the level it should be because when deciding on the level of overseas aid we give, we have to bear in mind what we spend on immigrants in this country. That is outrageous.</P>
      <P>It is terrible to think that any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would think in such a way. This underlines the problems Deputy O'Donnell had when she was the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid and her budget was cut. I am beginning to see what was happening. Perhaps Deputy O'Flynn should be in the Progressive Democrats because he seems to be on very much the same track as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is also a member of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Flynn dwelt at length on economic refugees. He appears to have a dread of them and feels we must process them and get rid of them. Has the Deputy lived in Ireland in recent times? He is probably around my own age in his mid 50s. As a youngster in the 1950s I saw the emigration parties that took place in rural villages. These were mainly for people going to America, probably never to return. I recall the 1960s and the 1970s when things began to turn around. However in the 1980s, we again had huge emigration. In 1987, a net 43,000 people left this country. Most of those, a great proportion of whom went to America, were economic migrants. Tens of thousands of others went to America and how were they treated? The record of this House from the 1980s and early 1990s will show we wanted deputations to meet senior Administration officials in the US. We wanted the then Minister for Foreign Affairs to negotiate additional green cards and we wanted amnesties for the people already there.</P>
      <P>Our country is now doing well and we have economic growth and a decent standard of living for many people. We need workers and people are coming from other countries, but what does Deputy O'Flynn want to do? He wants to pull down the shutters and turn them away. If he had his way we would ring fence our ports and airports with members of the Defence Forces so that those who arrive can be processed quickly and turned around. Is that the way to do business? If that happens, it certainly will not be done in my name. These people must be treated in a humane manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State has a trail of such refugees and asylum seekers coming to his <Col N="362" /> constituency clinics, as I do. In my time as a Deputy, no refugee or asylum seeker coming to my office has ever been discourteous, aggressive or over-demanding in any way. Maybe other Deputies have other experiences, but I have always found them to be polite people prepared to put their case and wishing to be dealt with in a humane manner, which is how they should be treated.</P>
    <P>There are many misconceptions. On Tuesday night I attended a meeting where someone asked what was the spending limit for refugees to buy a car, given that they get cheques from the health boards to buy cars. I was told they went to car auctions every week with health board cheques. When replying to this debate the Minister should declare clearly that such cheques are not provided. I know they are not available. I put down a parliamentary question on the matter and received that response. However, there are many misconceptions. There are misconceptions about the income they get for their children. They do not get anything different from Irish people. If they are lone parents, they get the long parent's allowance.</P>
    <P>I encountered a strange case in my office last Friday. The lady concerned has three small children and is seeking refugee status. She was separated from her husband in troubled times in her native country. She had to flee. She does not know where her husband is or whether he is alive or dead. She sought lone parent's allowance. She met the deciding officer who asked her if she was married. She replied that she was and that she had three children. &ldquo;Where is your husband?&rdquo;, he asked. &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;, she replied, &ldquo;I think he is in Nigeria&rdquo;. She went on to tell her story. The officer asked if her husband was coming to Ireland, to which she replied that she did not know. &ldquo;If your husband came to Ireland, would he live with you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I would hope so&rdquo;, she replied, &ldquo;I hope he would help to look after his children&rdquo;. She was told she could not receive lone parent's allowance because she was not separated from her husband.</P>

      <P>Would we want that to happen to Irish people in similar circumstances? Look at what we tried to do for our people when they emigrated and were in difficulty. Irish people emigrated to some of the major cities of the world. In London, for example, if one checks the nationality of the drop-outs and winos who hang around in certain areas, one will find that a high proportion of them are Irish. One will find the same thing in New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" />Like most Members of the House I contribute each year to welfare organisations which help those people. Often one will hear Irish people say: &ldquo;Yes, we sent lots of people abroad but they all went to work&rdquo;. That is not the case. Many of them went into the welfare system. Look at the people who return from Britain and call to our clinics. The Minister, too, will have seen this in his clinics. People who have returned from Britain might come seeking a house. They will say they were given a house straight away by the local authority in London and that they are not prepared to go on the waiting lists here. They prefer to squat in the council area.</P>
    <P>I have a sour taste in my mouth after listening to Deputy O'Flynn. I do not know where he is coming from or where he hopes to go. It is disappointing that a Member of the House would make such statements. He made similar statements before the last election. We should be leaders of society. We should set standards and be prepared to lead. One area where we must lead is in securing justice and equality for everybody. In the context of equality, we must examine how we treat our immigrants. It is not simply an economic matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDowell, made great play of the fact that it costs &euro;300 million to look after immigrants here. I asked him where he got this figure. He told me it arose across all the Departments. He had gone to the trouble of finding out what the cost was to the Garda, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for processing applications, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children. He must have little to do when he can produce this figure. He is the Deputy who talks about the need to trim our economic considerations yet he spent the money on that.</P>
    <P>Various Members referred to enforcing our immigration laws. I am in favour of that. The Dublin Convention has also been mentioned. What does the Dublin Convention mean? The Dublin Convention was an agreement reached within the EU under which people coming to the EU seeking asylum had to be dealt with in the first country at which they arrived. If one wishes to fly to Nairobi or any of the countries of origin of our immigrants, one would have to fly through another country in the EU to get there. How did all those immigrants arrive here without having landed first in other countries? Are the laws not being enforced? Are they being ignored? Why is that happening? Why are countries not adhering to the Dublin Convention?</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister not working with his EU colleagues to ensure adherence to the convention? If he is not doing that, he is failing in his job as Minister. It is his responsibility to ensure that the laws in this area are enforced and to ensure that asylum applications are processed in an efficient manner. Why is he not doing that? Is it that he does not have the resources? Does he <Col N="364" /> not have sufficient clout at Cabinet to get the resources? Let him look at his own house first and see where he is going.</P>
    <P>In that context, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a reply I received to a parliamentary question. Last year, Ireland repatriated 521 asylum seekers when their applications for asylum failed. We incurred great expense, &euro;1.8 million, repatriating these people. That is a cost of approximately &euro;3,500 to fly each person home. They must have been going a long way. In fact, they were not going far. They were going to places such as Albania, Algeria, America, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, the Congo.</P>
    <P>However, it was necessary to send escorts with them. This is where the major intrigue arises. I asked how many escorts are sent with somebody who is being repatriated. I was told it is a matter for the Garda and that I would get that information in due course. However, I have a few snippets of information. Ireland was repatriating some people to Algeria and, because they would not be taken on normal flights, a plane was chartered. Two deportees were returned to Algeria but they had five escorts. That cost &euro;23,495. Six people were being returned to Lagos in March last year. A plane was chartered and with those six people there were 20 escorts. That cost &euro;190,000. In November last year we chartered another plane to send some people to Lagos. This time 12 people were being repatriated and we sent 35 escorts with them, at a cost of &euro;151,000.</P>
    <P>It was striking to discover that so many escorts were required. Who were the escorts? They are serving gardaí and the costs I mentioned do not involve the overtime, additional expenses and so forth of the gardaí involved. Is it the best use of Garda time to send gardaí on escort duties to bring such people home? Surely that work could be done at much less cost by others, such as a security firm, for example. In that way, the Garda escorts would be on duty at home instead. I am sure the trip to Lagos, involving 35 Garda escorts, probably took three days. Because the gardaí were on duty for so long it meant that 35 of them were taken off the streets here for over a week. That is an awful lot of time and manpower to use when we see that crime increased by 22% last year.</P>
    <P>In some areas crime increased more dramatically, including in my own area of Longford-Westmeath where the increase last year was of the order of 39%. If one takes the 2001-02 period, the figure rises to 59%. Yet, we have the luxury of being able to send gardaí on escort duty around the world to repatriate asylum seekers. Does this make sense? The costs involved are huge, so surely there is a better way of doing it. I look forward to returning to that issue when I obtain the full information concerning all the other such trips that were made and how many escorts were involved. It is ridiculous to use taxpayers' money in this way.</P>
    <P>We must provide resources in schools so that <Col N="365" /> teachers can cope with the children of immigrants. We need to ensure that everybody gets a fair chance of education, be they Irish or immigrant children. Recently, I heard of a school in Dublin where the teacher had children of six nationalities in the classroom. The language difficulties alone that arose in that class were awful. Resources must be made available to provide education services to those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who told Deputy Paul McGrath that I was good at maths but, funnily enough, it was a subject that always pleased me at school. I was interested in what he said towards the end of his address. Like many others, when I left school I worked in London for a few years. I now live in Tallaght where recently a survey showed that 50 different nationalities are living in the parish of St. Mark's, which includes Belgard and Springfield. Consequently, I am able to bring to the House the experience of my community, which provides a certain perspective. I acknowledge the presence in the Chamber of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who knows my constituency well.</P>
      <P>In deciding to speak on the Bill, I was mindful of the sensitivity that surrounds the issue of immigrants, including asylum seekers, and my comments will take account of that. Recently, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, stated, &ldquo;It is a fact that, in recent years, Ireland has had probably the most open immigration system in Europe.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the area of labour migration the work permit system, as well as the working visa and work authorisation schemes, have allowed employers to employ nationals from outside the European Economic Area to fill a large number of vacancies. In fact, Ireland has attracted people from over 120 different countries to fill vacancies at a wide range of skill levels and in many areas of employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the need for Government to uphold principles. I support him fully when he states that principles, such as the rights of a sovereign State to control access to its to territory and to determine who can cross its borders, are still of vital importance.</P>
      <P>Immigration policy must reflect the needs of the country and the wishes of its people. On a recent television programme I noted the UK Minister with responsibility for immigration issues said that many of these changes would have to be agreed at European level, and that it was essential for immigration policy to reflect the needs of all EU member states. This is not as it should be. The European Union is not a nation state and it remains a matter for member states to determine for themselves the numbers of immigrants they are willing and able to invite in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As elected Members of this House, we cannot condone or accept any form of illegal immigration, including where it is done in the guise of asylum seeking. While recognising that our system must meet the needs of those genuinely in <Col N="366" /> need of international protection, it must not be subject to abuse by those simply wishing to evade immigration controls &ndash; or worse, those wishing to subvert our systems. In ensuring acceptance of immigration in society, it is essential that members of society do not see it as a threat to them or as something which the State cannot control.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which seeks to develop a more structured system of immigration and I support the Government's commitment to introduce this new legal framework, suited to the needs of today's realities. This legislation goes some way towards providing a system that will give greater clarity and certainty to immigrants, while at the same time safeguarding the needs of Irish society and ensuring that our system is not open to abuse.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provision on the liability of carriers will allow a more effective policing of our borders and will assist in combating illegal immigration and trafficking. The amendments to the Refugee Act will assist in the administration of the asylum process and will help the entire immigration system. I am also pleased that all developments in this sensitive area are based on best international practice, while taking account of the views of our constituents at large.</P>
    <P>I support the initiatives the Government has introduced in this area, including the system of direct provision and dispersal for asylum seekers. This, in effect, means that full social welfare allowances are no longer paid to asylum seekers who will have to remain in allocated accommodation while their claims are being processed. I agree that because of the considerable State investment which the system of direct provision necessitates, asylum seekers should not be permitted to leave the area of their allocated accommodation, unless the circumstances are exceptional.</P>
    <P>The Government has also introduced streamlined and faster processing arrangements for asylum applications, with particular focus on those which are manifestly unfounded. In addition, the Garda national immigration bureau has been established, the functions of which will include monitoring and tracking non-nationals who are the subject of deportation orders. Better co-ordination of activities is aimed at a more effective execution of deportation orders and combating trafficking in illegal immigrants generally. The Government has strengthened its powers for the purpose of more effectively executing deportation orders, while re-admission agreements have been concluded with many countries.</P>
    <P>As regards the details of the Bill, the provisions on the liability of carriers are adequate, with perhaps a few exceptions. The relevant section states: &ldquo;It shall be a defence for a person charged to show that they took all such steps as were reasonably open to them to ensure compliance with the Act.&rdquo;  This is very ambiguous and is, I believe, a let-out clause. In addition, the on-the-spot fine of &euro;1,500 to avoid court is too low, given <Col N="367" /> that a person could be seen to be avoiding the courts.</P>
    <P>Provision for the employment of non-nationals should be considered in a broader sense. Legislation should be considered to provide that employers could only take on an employee when he or she has provided the employee with his or her PPS number and that effective controls operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs which provides this number will assist in verifying false identity issues and related problems. I accept there are great difficulties in the area of immigration and there is great unease in the country regarding it. However, the Government is getting there in terms of addressing those difficulties and I support the Bill on that basis.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said earlier about my constituency. Those Members who were present for the debate on the Private Members' motion on education heard me get into a little controversy with my Labour Party colleagues. Deputy Rabbitte and I raised the issue of a school in Ballycragh. That issue is relevant to this debate in the sense that the Holy Rosary School in Ballycragh is making a great effort in regard to integration.</P>

      <P>On a serious note, and I hope the Deputy will join me in doing this, it is important to support those schools and institutions not only in Ballycragh in Tallaght but throughout the State which are making an effort in this regard. I visited that school and other schools in my constituency on a number of occasions recently and it is good, positive and even amazing to see young people from different nationalities with different backgrounds and perspectives on life playing and working together in that sense of being educated together. I take the Deputy's point about school accommodation and that is why I am speaking about it. It is important that we are supportive of such practice and we should be seen to be so. We should lead by example.</P>
      <P>I was in London for a little while which gave me a perspective on this area. I also had an opportunity some years ago to visit a project run by Ireland Aid in Mazabuka in Zambia. I did so of my own volition and at my own expense. Even though I was there only three weeks I came home with a strong perception of issues, which are now important to us as public representatives.</P>
      <P>I speak in this House about what I see happening in my own constituency. I reflect on and convey the attitudes of people in my own constituency. It is important that Members do that. I am happy to have had this opportunity to speak on this Bill, which I support and commend to the House.</P>

As a young Deputy recently elected to this House, I cannot get over those comments made by Deputy O'Flynn. I hope that the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will share with us their views on the Deputy's comments.</P>
      <P>I cannot believe it has taken 15 months for this Bill to come before this House. It was introduced in the Seanad by the then Minister for zero tolerance, Deputy O'Donoghue, on 27 March 2002.</P>
      <P>I come from Wexford where recently eight out of 12 people died from suffocation in the back of a container at Rosslare ferry port. We must seriously examine such movement of migrants because if the present position is allowed to continue we will face a similar incident in the future. We must clamp down on such movement of migrants. The road hauliers might not be happy with what I am saying, but they must be held responsible for the cargo they carry from one country to another. Hauliers from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the UK and elsewhere enter this country at Rosslare. They must be obliged to know what cargo they carry from place to place to ensure that an incident similar to that which occurred in Wexford last year does not occur in the future.</P>
      <P>The family and friends of those who died in that container attended a ceremony a year after that incident. One could see the sadness in their faces and the trauma they suffered in losing sons, daughters, mothers and fathers. One could sense the trauma children who survived that ordeal went through. People spoke of their trauma in the business park in Wexford that day. One person, whose name I forget, spoke of the trauma he went through from the time he went into the container. Those people were trying to escape the country from which they came. Road hauliers must know what cargo they are carrying and there must be a clamp down in this area, whether by way of a fine or some other penalty, to ensure such an incident does not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are not enough gardaí on duty at Rosslare ferry port. From now until the end of September a great number of cars, vans and lorries will travel through that port. There is not a <Col N="369" /> sufficient number of gardaí or security personnel to check the cargo being carried in container vehicles travelling through the port. On leaving the terminal a driver of a lorry may be stopped and two or three gardaí may check it, but meanwhile 50 to 60 lorries can go through and nobody knows what cargo they carry. Something must be done in this area. The migration of non-nationals to this country, especially through Rosslare port, is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The road hauliers will not be pleased about any legislation which imposes restrictions because they want to collect their cargo in its country of origin, bring it back here and make their money. A mechanism to put in place strict control on access to this country by non-nationals must be seriously examined. Proper documentation by non-nationals must be shown at the place of entry to this country and non-nationals, if they are illegal immigrants, will not have the proper documentation.</P>
    <P>I come from Enniscorthy where I have a constituency office. A great number of non-nationals call to my office seeking proper documentation, be it work permits or other documentation. I make representations on their behalf to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but the issuing of such permits is delayed for months, during which time the public gives out because these people are perceived as sponging off the State. That is the fault of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment because of the delay in issuing such permits. The process involved in issuing them must be speeded up. These non-nationals are being discriminated against. When they are not allowed to work, people say they are sponging off the State and can go to a health clinic and receive social welfare benefit. We heard what Deputy O'Flynn said in this regard.</P>
    <P>The non-nationals who call to my office tell me they do not want to claim social welfare benefit, rather they want to earn an honest wage working in a factory or some other business. As Deputy Deasy said, we would not have the prosperity we have were it not for the foreigners who came here in the past. They left money here as holidaymakers and so on. Those are the people who made the country what it is today thanks to tourism and I criticise the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism because that is not being pushed enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor referred to racism in schools, which worries me. Many of our schools now have pupils of different nationalities and Deputy Deasy referred to racism coming into schools through the Internet and text messages. Schools will have to be properly funded to stop racism. Deputy Deasy referred to Catholics and Protestants earlier and the same situation will develop between coloured people and us white people &ndash; some people say black and some white but the Minister of State will understand what I am saying. If there is not proper coaching in our schools we will have a very serious problem, because diversity of nationalities is going to rise <Col N="370" /> in our schools rather than fall. I welcome those people to our schools. We are there to help them. We mentioned racism and criminals and the Garda will have to have the communication skills to deal with these people. If those skills are not in place we will have serious problems.</P>
    <P>Some important sections of the Bill are welcome and others must be examined. The most important provisions relate to checking people coming in through our ports and airports. Lorries, cars and vans will have to be checked and people will have to have the proper permits and so on. We cannot have another situation like that in Wexford last year, when eight asylum seekers died in the back of a truck.</P>

      <P>How popular would it be now? Our society is changing radically, particularly since the advent of the Celtic tiger. We are changing quickly from a monocultural, all-white country to becoming multicultural and having every different human colour in our society. Like all other speakers today, I welcome that positive and constructive change in society. We welcome people who come here to work, though there is a legal distinction between those who have work permits and refugees and asylum seekers. I understand approximately 42,000 legal permits were issued last year to non-European nationals to work in Ireland and they have made a significant contribution, as previous speakers said. Deputy Kehoe meets many of them in Wexford.</P>
      <P>There is still a shortage of workers in many areas of the economy as there are jobs that Irish people will not do. If one goes into many hotels and restaurants or if one wants a haircut or a newspaper, one is often served by a non-national. A hotelier was quoted in a newspaper this week as saying that if the situation changes his business will be finished as he cannot get Irish people to work in the hotel and catering industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one hand the economy's demands are being met by people who were not born in the country and on the other we have a Bill which is to regulate this issue. I accept that asylum seekers have caused a significant economic problem for the country but that is because we do not let them work. Members of the Minister of State's party first proposed that asylum seekers should be allowed to work and I support that view. That is no longer the situation and the proposal is unnecessary because asylum applications are pro<Col N="371" /> cessed within three months, so that issue should not arise. There are thousands of asylum seekers living in the country and if the law takes its course most will probably not get asylum; they will have to leave either voluntarily or on foot of a deportation order. However, those not officially recognised as refugees while living in the country may have job skills we could use in the economy. We should be able to do a better job of matching the skills of someone about to be deported after living here while their application is processed with the needs of our community. We should then be able to provide those people with jobs and enable them to remain in the country.</P>
    <P>Two of my immediate family members went to work in America and made careers there having been made welcome. Many Irish families in the last 30 years had members who found homes in America, England and elsewhere. We need to look out as a society rather than look in and we need to recognise that Irish people were economic migrants for many centuries and were accepted. They worked and became part of their communities abroad. If economic migrants from other jurisdictions who are already here are allowed to work and contribute to society I see no reason why we should not work to keep them in the country. That would be a constructive move by the State. We may draw a line with the legislation &ndash; if it is the Government view it will prevail &ndash; but we ought to be more sensitive and caring about people who have chosen to come to Ireland for economic reasons and who have lived here due to our inability to process their applications for so long.</P>
    <P>I was involved in the case of one family which was very popular in their Irish community and got involved in the social and community life of the town. One of them had been a professional musician with a State orchestra in the Russian territories but he was deported because he did not meet the criteria. That family was the life and soul of the local musical society and of many musical evenings when they entertained us with their skills. Many such people have been deported when they should have been kept here. I know of another case involving a young man from the former Yugoslavia who learned Gaelic football so well he became captain of the local team. Again, he had to face exile.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kehoe said, there are many students in our schools who are making a great contribution to our multicultural society and we will be at a loss if we drive them from our shores now. I am concerned that we should do a better job in integrating our economic refugees before this Bill changes things forever.</P>
    <P>Our approach should be one of constructive, positive dialogue. I recommend that the State invests more money and time in eliminating prejudice against refugees, particularly those who are coloured, which is significant in our society. We should invest much greater effort in campaigning in fav<Col N="372" /> our of constructive acceptance of multi-culturalism and other religions. We would be a much prouder and greater nation if were big enough to do this.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Crawford. I am glad to speak on the Bill. I agree with earlier comments that we are a nation of emigrants, which has been sending its people abroad for years. We have now become an immigrant population. This country has always been known as Ireland of the welcomes and its people always had a céad míle fáilte for everyone who came to our shores. In recent years, we have benefited greatly from all those who came here from other European Union member states, the aspirant member states and elsewhere. We needed them and they helped us become the Celtic tiger by contributing to the significant regeneration of that period.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in the House before, I fully welcome the countries which will join the European Union. While no one is in favour of illegal immigration, we must also be careful not to throw out the baby &ndash; the milk of human kindness &ndash; with the bath water, which we are in danger of doing. We must try to strike a balance between ensuring we help those genuinely in need of our help and stopping the terrible trafficking of human beings.</P>
      <P>It has already been pointed out that asylum seekers who come here face considerable delays in having their applications processed. Every effort and resource should be put into ensuring these applications are processed as quickly as possible. There is no reason asylum applicants should have to wait for years for a decision on their case. The most demoralising aspect of this wait is that they are not allowed to work.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was quoted as saying eight of ten foreigners on our streets are here legally either to work or study. The scale of the number of incoming migrants is staggering. In the period 1995-2000, about 250,000 persons migrated to Ireland, of whom about half were returning Irish people. The aggregate figure for immigrants, including Irish returnees, in this five year period amounts to an amazing 7% of the 1996 population of 3.6 million. This is an astonishing figure which will force us to consider immigration in new ways.</P>
      <P>We have been told current immigration trends will continue. It is interesting that the great majority of immigrants are returning Irish emigrants or citizens of other European Union member states and the USA. The CSO population and migration estimates for the five years up to April 2000, published in September 2000, indicate that only 12% of immigrants, or 29,400 persons, came from outside the European Union and USA during the period. Returning Irish emigrants and immigrants from other European Union and European Economic Area countries have an absolute legal right to live and work here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" />Asylum seekers apply to stay here under the terms of the United Nations convention on refugees of 1951. Until they are informed of a decision on their cases, they do not have the right to work. This policy has been questioned, including by the previous speaker who referred to the significant economic and personal benefits to the people in question of being allowed to work. There is already a precedent for doing so. On 26 July 1999 a once off decision was taken to allow asylum seekers who could prove they had been living here for more than a year to work. This decision was not repeated, nor will it be, which is regrettable as asylum seekers have many skills. It is very bad economics to accommodate asylum seekers at the expense of the State when they are willing to contribute. We can ill afford to take this approach if other alternatives, particularly humane ones, are available.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of asylum applications are rejected, which means the applicants have to be deported at considerable expense to the taxpayer. The current approach does not make sense. I urge the Government to allow asylum seekers to contribute in some way for their own benefit and that of the State. Such an approach would make sense as many asylum seekers are, in reality, economic migrants.</P>
    <P>This observation reminds us of our past and the many who left in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s to build America and the United Kingdom. There is something inherently wrong with us if we choose to build a fortress to keep people in need from our shores. While I do not advocate a free for all, we should at least ensure that those in need of our help receive it. How will we be able to help people if they are stopped before they get here? Although I accept the measure to make carriers liable for keeping people out would work and is in force elsewhere, is it a positive development?</P>
    <P>What are we doing for economic migrants? Let us suppose the people who left our shores, the people who created the original Celtic tiger and kept communities across the west and elsewhere alive, had not been allowed to leave. We would not have the Irish diaspora or its support which sustained entire communities when we had no friends. They contributed even more in equivalent terms than we now receive from European Union Structural Funds. Where would we be now if they had not left? We would not have been able to support them because we could not support ourselves at the time.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a quota system, our entry policy should be as liberal as possible. Many asylum seekers are economic migrants who work illegally. It does not make sense for the State to accommodate and pay for them if they are going to work in the black economy. It would make much more sense to allow them to work. Asylum seekers who fail in their applications should be allowed to remain and their cases considered sympathetically.</P>
    <P>In the past, we were welcomed into the United Kingdom because we were needed. So many Brit<Col N="374" /> ish men were killed in the Second World War that immigrants were needed to drive the economy. Their economic migrants, the Irish, were a wonderful group of people who not only supported the United Kingdom economy, but sustained ours as well. Similarly, Irish people were accepted and integrated in the United States.</P>
    <P>The House has heard a great deal about the dramatic increase in the number of work permits being issued to people from countries outside the European Economic Area and the boon this has provided to the catering and service industry. Last week Members argued that giving work permits to particular employers would lead to exploitation by employers.</P>
    <P>It is time we examined the integration of immigrants into society and developed coherent, human policies with which we can live. Up to now the market has dictated our policies but, given the influx of so many people from abroad, we need to think more about the implications that has for integration into schools and the workplace. These matters are of considerable importance because our society is changing. That should be looked on as a challenge and treated positively. Putting the onus on the carrier under the legislation permits the Government to act like Pontius Pilate and wash its hands of the problem. Carriers are profit driven and are hardly the people best qualified on a people-orientated basis to act as immigration officers. The stick approach should be adopted to deal severely with those who exploit immigrants and engage in human trafficking but we should try to exclude economic migrants in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said the policy is to ensure anyone arriving in the State who is genuinely in need of the protection of the State is identified as such as soon as possible after they arrive so that they can immediately begin the process of integration into society and take up the rights to which they are entitled under the 1951 convention on the status of refugees. That is a laudable aspiration but how good are all such aspirations if individuals cannot get to Ireland in the first place?</P>
    <P>Our history teaches us that we should treat people as we were treated ourselves in other countries. We should not lose our humanity. Many people emigrated and through the safe home project many old people have returned. There has been considerable support for that project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Minister of State said people are wanted and welcome and that should be the case. Many of our emigrants have returned and thank God for that because they had to leave Ireland prior to our accession to the European Community. Many of them live in my parish of Aghabog. They worked in the UK, the US and elsewhere and learned to live with people of other races.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU workers have been able to enter Ireland freely since we took up membership. They have <Col N="375" /> contributed to the build-up of expertise in the State and, in more recent years, people from applicant countries have been allowed to work here under permit. Hopefully, in the next few years they will be able to move freely similar to EU workers. However, unfortunately, people who have entered the country legally are sometimes perceived to be illegal immigrants in certain quarters and are also perceived to be taking the jobs of local people. I represent a food producing and furniture making area that has many low paid jobs but if it had not been for these workers, it would have been difficult for companies to operate at full capacity.</P>
    <P>The legislation addresses issues relating to illegal immigrants and asylum seekers, which are difficult. We must give them support, legal rights and a helping hand while making sure they are treated humanely. I am worried about the issue of whether they should be permitted to work. My neighbours, particularly those in Monagahan town where there are many Romanian and other immigrants, point out that Irish people had no problem working in the countries to which they emigrated. It is hard to explain to immigrants that under our laws unless they have a work permit they cannot work, irrespective of whether they are willing to do so. I implore the Minister of State to examine this issue. Immigrants must wait a long time to discover whether they will be permitted to stay in the State and they should be granted short-term work permits so that they are not seen to be living off the State unnecessarily by Irish people.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people, for whatever reason, are under the impression that asylum seekers are in receipt of better services. For example, I am working on a case involving a young girl from a town in my constituency who must obtain transport to physiotherapy sessions. She takes the same taxi as an immigrant worker who has a serious illness. The immigrant worker does not have to pay for the taxi but she does. Such anomalies are being created by us. They cause rancour and lead people to see the immigrant issue in the wrong light. These issues should be examined because, in the main, the Irish were treated well when they emigrated to the US, Australia and elsewhere. These people, like our own, are entitled to be treated well on an even and balanced basis.</P>
    <P>Housing is also a major issue. The Department has got around the issue to some extent by taking over institutions such as the Mosney centre and St. Patrick's College, Monaghan, but I worry about putting large numbers of people in one place. I am aggrieved that the college was not retained in the education system as it was more than capable of providing a service. Local industries have had recruitment problems and they could have benefited if the college had remained open. However, it is being used to house asylum seekers but I warn against putting too many of them there. There are approximately 100 asylum <Col N="376" /> seekers staying in the college currently and I heard mention of a proposal to house 400 there. However, a town the size of Monaghan could not cope with such numbers and that must not be permitted.</P>
    <P>The number of people seeking asylum in Ireland would not be as much of a problem if it was not for the carriers. I am glad that those responsible for the deaths of the illegal immigrants who were locked into a container while being transported to Ireland were brought to court and sentenced recently. It was a criminal act to take money from people, give them an assurance that they would be brought somewhere and then bring them to somewhere totally different. Many of the families died in transit.</P>
    <P>That is completely unacceptable. The people involved in that illegal trade must be caught and dealt with in the strongest possible way. I encourage the Government to take whatever steps are necessary to have the best possible structures in place, both at the potential ports of embarkation and the Irish ports, to ensure that a very clear message is delivered and that illegal trafficking is stamped out. With modern methods of communication, including e-mail and text messaging, any experience of easy entry to this country can be promptly reported back to their home base by the people concerned, thus encouraging others to follow.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of countries where people are under serious threat, those affected should have access to this country and should be properly and humanely treated. The Minister of State said that nine out of ten asylum seekers are not in a position to prove their entitlement to remain in this country. I find it difficult to accept that figure but I take the Minister of State's word on the matter. Those who have to leave another country due to severe hardship or a severe threat to their lives must be given an opportunity in this country to start a new life. I have met some of those people and they deserve our assistance.</P>

      <P>There is a rich irony in the fact that we are discussing this Bill on a day when our country is being visited by a very prominent Austrian politician to whom I wish an enjoyable stay in Ireland. He is a very skilled politician who is prominent in his own country. However, in the course of his politics, he has used the issue of immigration in a skilful, though very frightening manner. He is capable of using language and situations to maximise political support in a manner not unlike what happens in other countries nor, indeed, unlike comments I have heard from people within our own political system. I was somewhat shocked by the bombastic contribution of my Cork colleague earlier in this debate, though, perhaps, not entirely surprised.</P>

      <P>It is an issue on which he has made political capital in the past and derived some benefit from it. It represents a use of political debate which, in my estimation, debases all of us in the political system and should not go unchallenged. I intend to challenge it because I live in the same area, though I do not represent the same constituency. Cork is my city as much as his but my experiences are totally opposed to his. The asylum seekers who are currently guests in our city are contributing to the social and cultural life of the city. I am not saying that with a blinkered approach. I fully realise that some of those people are capable of committing criminal acts, just as is the case in society at large.</P>
      <P>The problem with the debate we have had, both at social and political levels, is that the wrong impression has gone out. We have allowed the creation of a number of urban myths and the Government must take the blame for failing to explode those myths. Even in this House, there have been questions to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, not only in terms of the usual shibboleths with regard to cars being provided for asylum seekers but also, on one occasion, as to whether dogs were being bought. When urban myths develop to that extent, I believe the quality of debate has reached a worrying level.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is a very curious measure. It addresses certain aspects which need to be tackled. The tragedy at Rosslare Harbour appalled all of us. However, an interesting aspect of the situation was that while the people concealed in containers were Turkish nationals, they were of Kurdish ethnic background. They had come from a conflict situation of cultural, if not actually military dimensions, in which their ethnic grouping was not recognised within a recognised political state. That is one of the causes of large-scale emigration and I believe it is not adequately recognised as such by the Government. Turkey is just one example. There are similar situations in many African states. The conventional rule of thumb as to whether people qualify for residency and, ultimately, citizenship if they choose to pursue that road is very often affected by a prejudice or bias as to whether people are actually coming from relevant military, political or cultural conflict situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency office in Cork is located in the inner city area in which many asylum seekers are living in apartment accommodation. They are people of innate charm and ability, with a capacity to contribute to our society to an extent that has not yet been recognised or legally permitted. I wish to put in context the current position of foreign nationals in this country. In my estimation, the number of asylum seekers currently seeking residency in this country is no greater than the population of Ennis. It is approximately one third of the total number of foreign nationals who are in this country legally, on the basis of work permits. The combined total number of foreign nationals, including asylum seekers and those on work permits, is roughly <Col N="378" /> equivalent to the population of Limerick. Looking at the situation in that geographical context, one gets a better impression in terms of whether there is actually a problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to some small changes to the Refugee Board and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. I am not unduly concerned about the first of those changes, which is mainly a technical matter. The other provision, in relation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, requires some consideration in terms of the quality of information provided to legislators and the general public as to how the tribunal is operating. We know the number of members on the tribunal, the number of cases being heard and the number rejected. The vast majority are rejected. However, we are not informed as to the particular record of each member of the tribunal in terms of any biases or prejudices which may inform their work. Those involved in the legal aspect of representing people who are seeking residency have expressed their concern to me that particular members of the unfortunately acronymed RAT have given no favourable decisions whatsoever on any of the cases which have come before them. I believe we have to question a system in which the issue of whether a person gets a fair hearing depends on which member of the tribunal deals with the case, having regard to the type of prejudice which may inform that member. I use the term &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; in its widest sense. The value of such a tribunal is certainly open to question.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the immigration issue particularly exercises me is that I happen to be the child of Irish emigrants to the United States. It is an interesting feature of the composition of the 29th Dáil that only two Members out of 166 were born outside this island. I was born in the United States and Deputy McManus was born in Canada, the circumstances of which I am not aware. In this Dáil of 166 Members, that is far from reflecting the Irish experience of emigration. I wonder if it also helps to misinform us as to the type of biases we should have. My school-going experience was with African-Americans, Hispanics and people of east European background, and it was very enjoyable. However, another aspect of Irish emigration was that while there may have been integration in terms of education, Irish communities kept very much to themselves. In a sense, one lived in an Irish ghetto.</P>

      <P>My Department pays annual grants to primary schools including capitation grants, minor works grants, grants under various schemes to tackle educational disadvantage, ancillary services grants, grants for special needs purposes, support teachers grant, school development planning grant, ICT grant, supervision grant, and non-English speaking grant. In addition, my Department has paid once-off curriculum materials grants to primary schools.</P>
      <P>The Department is conscious of the need for funding to be provided to primary schools in an orderly manner and as early as possible in the school year concerned. Where possible, payment is made electronically direct to the individual school's bank account. However, where the amount of grant payable is dependent upon returns being submitted to and verified by my Department, payment can be delayed due to the non-return of the required data to my Department. I am not aware of any general delay in the payment of grants to primary schools. My Department is also working on a new financial management system which is expected to be up and running for the next school year. The new system will speed up the processing of payments which are not made directly to school bank accounts. The Department is also examining ways of reducing the number of separate payments to primary schools.</P>

      <P>The minor works grant is usually paid to schools on the basis of a &euro;3,800 grant plus a <i>per capita</i> payment. This year, only the <i>per capita</i> part of this has been paid to date, with the &euro;3,800 being withheld. Will the Minister explain why this is the case? I know a review was to be carried out in the early part of the year but, given that today is 10 April and the school year ends in two months, it is not early in the school year from a primary school's point of view. Does the Minister think this is an opportune time to carry out the review? In light of the serious conditions in many primary schools, which we discussed in the House this week, will the Minister ensure payment of the grant now and perhaps carry out the review, that might affect next year's budget rather than this year's, in the summer months?</P>
      <P>A leaflet on the ICT grant was sent to primary schools, outlining the grants for 2001 and 2002, and confirming that grants for 2003 would be at a similar level. Will the Minister confirm that the ICT grant for this year will be paid, because the only response my queries to the Department have elicited are &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;? The PE grant was paid on 17 April last year. Will the Minister confirm whether that grant will be paid this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in say<Col N="380" /> ing that the grant scheme for minor works is paid in two instalments of a lump sum of &euro;3,809 and a capitation amount, the total of which amounts to &euro;12.5 million. The first part has been paid and the second part is affected by the ongoing assessment. It depends what side of any assessment a school is on but, generally speaking, there is no such thing as an opportune time to review expenditure. The fact that the calendar year and the school year do not coincide always makes things difficult from a financial point of view. The review is continuing and when it is complete, which we hope will be in the early part of this school year, we will be in a position to pay the remainder of the grant to the schools.</P>
      <P>The total ICT grants provided to primary schools in 2001 and 2002 amounted to approximately &euro;32.3 million &ndash;&euro;17.7 million in 2001 and &euro;14.6 million in 2002. The capital allocation for this year is &euro;6.2 million. There is a review of the current status of ICT within schools which needs to be completed before we embark on further expenditure in that area. All of these amounts and the review in relation to the minor works scheme were announced at the time of the Estimates. At that point, it was made clear to everyone that grants would be paid during the course of the school year.</P>

      <P>I disagree that the position is clear because many schools are still unclear. The Minister is not leaving schools much room for planning. Is he aware that many schools are operating in the red and that some have borrowed against the minor works and ICT grants in the expectation that, as was written in black and white, the grants in 2003 would be at a similar level and that they are at a far lower level than previous years?</P>

      <P>The issue of equitable access to higher education is foremost among my policy priorities. The Agreed Programme for Government, in addition to setting out this Government's commitment to improve the level and quality of participation and achievement at every level of <Col N="381" /> education, contains a clear commitment to expand significantly the number of mature students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds participating in higher education. We must broaden participation in higher education if we are to successfully tackle and break the cycle of disadvantage, open up opportunity and optimise our broader economic and social potential.</P>
      <P>The under representation of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds in the higher education system is, regrettably, particularly evident in Ireland and remains unacceptable even though the overall rate of admission to higher education recorded by Clancy was 44% in 1998 as against 25% in 1986. Nowhere is the disparity in participation rates more graphically captured than by the 2001 fourth national survey of access to higher education, which confirmed that in 1998 almost all children from the higher professional group entered higher education whereas only 21%, or one in five, from an unskilled manual worker background entered.</P>
      <P>It was against this background that, last autumn, I requested my Department to undertake a review of student support provisions with the objective of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made in this area by the taxpayer are maximised. While the review is essentially being conducted by officials of my Department, some issues have required the engagement of external expertise. In this connection, the Department commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to undertake work to enable it to estimate the cost of the various options which I expect will be identified in accordance with the terms of reference of the review.</P>
      <P>In conducting the review, my Department officials are also having regard to international experience, relevant reports and policy documents including the report of the action group on access to third-level education, which was published in July 2001. The action group members, who were representative of a large number of interest groups and the key stakeholders, sought and considered a large number of submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>I expect that the outcome of the review by my Department officials will provide me with a range of possible options which will seek to ensure that the finite available resources are targeted in a manner which achieves maximum impact from the point of view of equity of access to higher education. In this context, I expect that the review will take account of the fact that, while the broad social and economic benefits of wide participation in higher education underpin the rationale for ongoing public investment in this system, there are also clear economic returns to the individual which raise questions on equity grounds as to how the burden of funding should be shared by those who benefit. I anticipate that the review outcomes will be submitted to me in the very near future and when I have had an <Col N="382" /> opportunity to consider its contents, I will bring the matter to the Cabinet. Following consideration by the Government, I will make a determination in relation to publication and appropriate arrangements for consultation. As I have indicated to the House previously, I am very mindful of the need to avoid, as far as possible, uncertainty for students and their parents. In any event, it is my intention to decide within the coming weeks as to the arrangements and support provisions which will be in place for students for the 2003-04 academic year.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the Minister is still not giving us an answer as to when this report will be published and what he intends to do within the timescale. In a reply to a question on 27 February, the Minister said that he hoped to receive the report by the end of January, but that had not happened by the end of February. He said then that, if the situation continued much longer and the report was not published and decisions not made, it would be unfair to students. Will the Minister tell the House categorically that as the report has not yet been published, he will not take any action that will affect students in the coming year?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concerns of students and their families that this burden of fees might be imposed on them in September and may be deterring them from making decisions which affect their future? If the Minister is consulting with the Departments of Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment with regard to the wider implications for the economy, the provision of workers in our economy and what the effect of introducing fees might be, the scope appears to be too narrow. It does not go into primary level, where the real roots of inequality lie. Will the Minister outline the extent of the examination he will undertake in this regard?</P>

      <P>Without wishing to delay the House, I dealt with that matter in the first half of my reply. If Deputy O'Sullivan reads the remainder of the quotation of 27 February in a reply to a question from Deputy Gogarty she will see I indicated that I would make an announcement one way or the other by Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no fall-off in the number of applications to the CAO. I do not accept that parents or students are being deterred from making such applications. I accept that people in receipt of free fees and who may be able to afford to pay them are concerned about this matter. I expect the Deputy, who is a member of a socialist party, would be equally concerned about those who cannot afford to pay and are not gaining access to third level education. I am equally concerned about how we might rebalance the amounts paid in student support to cater for those who do not have the capacity to access third level education or who may never see the inside of a university. My concern for such people is greater than for <Col N="383" /> those who would be well able to afford the fees if re-introduced.</P>
    <P>As soon as the review has been completed and I am in receipt of the report I will bring it to the House. If the review process takes longer than expected, during the course of this month I will make an announcement as to what will happen in September for students.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy. We have tried to ensure that our focus on the disadvantaged is reflected in this year's Estimates. The Deputy will be aware one cannot tackle disadvantage overnight. One must start at primary or even pre-school level and work up through the system. Unfortunately, we did not start on time and people currently in second level education face the reality that they may never see the inside of a university unless we can provide them with assistance. My focus is not just on third level education but throughout the education system. I have to take cognisance of the fact that we have problems which must be faced up to.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if there are plans to set up an independent tribunal of inquiry into abuse in residential institutions and day care centres, as well as the role played by church and State institutions in dealing, or not dealing, with same, in view of the lack of focus and narrow parameters of the Laffoy Commission.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10598/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Laffoy Commission was established on foot of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 to investigate child abuse in institutions in the State, to enable persons who have suffered abuse to give evidence to committees of the commission, to provide for the preparation and publication of a report by the commission containing the results of its investigation and to make recommendations it considers appropriate for the prevention of child abuse. The term &ldquo;institution&rdquo; in the Act is defined as a &ldquo;school, an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a hospital, a children's home and any other place where children are cared for other than as members of their family.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" />The commission was initially set up on an administrative basis and given a broad term of reference under which it was requested to consider and recommend any changes and powers it considered it needed to carry out its function. The commission produced two reports outlining the terms of reference and powers it felt it would require to carry out its inquiries in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>Arising from these reports a broad definition of abuse, which covers sexual and physical abuse, neglect and emotional abuse, was written into section 1 of the Act. The report also pointed out the range of powers that the commission would require and, under the legislation enacted, the commission has the power to compel witnesses to attend hearings, order the production of documents, take evidence on oath or affirmation, appoint inquiry officers to carry out preliminary investigations and conduct and commission research. The commission operates by means of committees, of which there are two, currently operating to facilitate the differing needs of victims. First, there is the confidential committee, which hears in total confidence the testimony of witnesses who do not wish to have their allegations investigated. The purpose of this is to afford victims an opportunity to give an account of their abuse in an atmosphere of compassion and understanding.</P>
    <P>The second committee is an investigative one which hears evidence from victims and investigates their case. The committee can follow up on allegations made and can summon witnesses to hear further evidence as well as compelling the production of documentation and data.</P>
    <P>In light of the above I do not share the Deputy's view that the parameters of the commission are narrow and I do not have plans to set up a further tribunal of inquiry to deal with matters of abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his reply in light of today's newspaper article that the Ferns diocese has finally admitted negligence in its failure to recognise and act on the threat posed by Fr. Fortune and that Colm O'Gorman has settled for &euro;300,000? Will the State come clean about the instances of abuse and its complicity in that regard over many years? Many of the victims of abuse whom I met are of the view that the Laffoy Commission is a sop. The Minister will be aware the commission is running into difficulties in terms of access to records from his Department. Is the Minister aware the Laffoy Commission faces further legal wrangles with the Christian Brothers &ndash; a court case is due on 13 May? Is he aware that it is the view of victims that the Government has so far admitted nothing beyond broad guilt and wit to end their pain? The Government has not recognised that this was a crime in which the State was complicit for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to investigate the State's role and that of the Department of Education and Sci<Col N="385" /> ence and other Departments in this regard. How can the Minister justify the agreement originally made by his predecessor and CORI on 5 June 2002, which includes the indemnity agreement, when evidence came to light from a question I raised on the Adjournment that discussions were held with CORI before the Taoiseach's apology in 1999 and that possibly some deal was made which suited the State and the church institutions? </P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy shows a complete lack of understanding of what the Laffoy Commission is about. He is reading too many articles in newspapers. The Laffoy Commission and its inquiry deals with institutional abuse. The article referred to by the Deputy relates to abuse by a clergyman and not somebody in an institution. It is a totally separate case. Under no circumstances will the State accept responsibility for actions by the clergy outside institutions. We are involved in the commission to inquire into child abuse because the State has accepted that, with those who ran such institutions for the State, it has a responsibility in this area. It was for that reason the Laffoy Commission was set up. We should not mix these two separate matters.</P>
      <P>On the negotiations, the Taoiseach made a clear and unequivocal apology to those involved. I personally went to the UK and repeated that apology directly to the victims of the institutions. Those people, understandably, left this country following their abuse in the institutions. The Government and my Department are not making a half hearted effort in accepting our responsibilities. We set up the redress board which allows victims of institutional abuse in this country to obtain compensation based on their evidence and without recourse to legal action. I do not accept the Deputy's contentions in that regard.</P>
      <P>We are not denying access to records held by the commission. The commission has 500,000 records so far made available by the Department. A discovery motion has been filed against the Department which has to be fulfilled by the end of June. We will do that. There is no truth in any allegation the Deputy might make that the Department wants to conceal anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>All children with special educational needs within the primary school system, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, ASDs, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs of children with ASD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. Many children at primary school level with disorders on the autistic spectrum are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of resource teacher and-or special needs assistant services. Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and special needs assistant support is provided where required.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates additional resources to individual second level schools to cater for special needs pupils enrolled in those schools. Applications for resources are referred to the national educational psychological service and each case is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>There are seven facilities in the State operating on a pilot project basis that use alternative educational methods for teaching children on the autistic spectrum; three are CABAS facilities. The CABAS teaching method employs a comprehensive application of behaviour analysis to schooling approach. A decision on the approval of other such establishments will be made in light of evaluations of provision for children with ASD currently being carried out by my Department's inspectorate. The evaluation process will also include educational services for children with autism in other settings such as special schools, special classes and children integrated in mainstream schools. It is envisaged that a report on the outcome of the evaluation will be available this year.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, receive education appropriate to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive answer. The Minister mentioned integration into mainstream schools. Has he solved the problem of dual enrolment, an issue of which the Minister is aware, where children attend a CABAS school but also a mainstream school one or two days per week? Has the Minister visited any of the CABAS schools? If not, will he try to find time in his busy schedule to do that and inform himself of the excellent work being done <Col N="387" /> in those schools? Can the Minister give me an assurance that he will look favourably on those schools, many of which operate under a cloud of uncertainty? They are doing excellent work but they need his personal support to plan ahead and retain staff. Finally, can the Minister tell us anything about the Middletown project in County Armagh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the question. I have not yet visited a CABAS school. I have visited one or two autism units attached to mainstream schools but in deference to what the Deputy said I will try to ensure that I visit a CABAS school.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to impute motives to the Deputy but there may be a suspicion on the part of some people that there is an anti-ABA view in the Department of Education and Science. That case has been put to me by a number of people but I assure the Deputy that as far as I am concerned that is not the case. The study done on autism stated that ABA has a place, as have other methods. I am sure the Deputy will agree that we must ensure we get the most appropriate system for each individual child.</P>
      <P>On the question of uncertainty and so on, it is inevitable that once the end of a pilot project approaches people get anxious. We are evaluating the different approaches and until that evaluation is completed, I cannot offer any long-term hope. When the evaluation is completed we will then be in a position to let people know the outcome.</P>
      <P>The problem of dual enrolment has been raised with me. I am aware that some schools operate their own systems. That should be done on the basis of the needs of the child, rather than being prescriptive about it. I am aware that in some cases units have been set up close to schools whose method of teaching is Montessori and in other cases they have been set up beside mainstream schools. We should be flexible in trying to facilitate as many approaches as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which is now fully commenced, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national agency with responsibility for school attendance. The board appointed an interim chief executive officer in August 2002 and directors of corporate services and educational <Col N="388" /> services have recently taken up their posts. The board is currently recruiting eight further head office staff.</P>
      <P>Thirty seven former school attendance officers who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation were transferred to the board on 5 July 2002 in accordance with section 40 of the Act. These 37 staff are currently providing a service in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford. Twenty five of them have recently accepted the terms and conditions of employment of educational welfare officer, EWO, and will henceforth be carrying out the full range of EWO duties and providing a year-round service rather than the school term based service they were providing as former school attendance officers.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the recruitment of an additional cohort of educational welfare officers have been received from the board and officials of my Department had discussions with the executive of the board last week in relation to these proposals. Arising from these discussions, the executive wrote to my Department on 4 April clarifying certain costs associated with their proposals. It is not possible to specify the number of new education welfare officers who will be put in place this year until my Department has had an opportunity to consider these proposals and costs in a multi-annual framework.</P>
      <P>I have allocated a budget of &euro;5.4 million to the board for the current year and it is my intention that the board's proposals will be taken forward in the context of these resources and the budgetary allocations in future years.</P>
      <P>The board's proposals provide for the assignment of staff on a regional basis, with regional managers being put in place to ensure smooth implementation of the Act nationally. I should point out to the Deputy that decisions relating to the assignment of education welfare officers to specific areas are a matter for the board, which is an independent statutory body.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I welcome the progress that has been made, particularly the appointment of the educational welfare officers. As the Minister is aware, this is the first issue I prioritised when I became spokesperson because I feel strongly in particular about the scandal of children as young as 11 or 12 roaming the streets of our cities.</P>
      <P>With regard to the funding of &euro;5.4 million, which I understand is only half the amount the board identified as its need for expanding the service this year, what can areas like my own city of Limerick do, which has no service because it did not have the original officers? There is a vacuum now because the gardaí, who used to have the power to do this work, no longer have that power under the new legislation. Will the Minister prioritise funding for this area and give the board enough money to appoint educational welfare officers throughout the country?</P>

      <P>The &euro;5.4 million in funding I provided is what we estimate will be sufficient to roll the service out during the course of the year. The board has decided that wherever cases arise nationally it will provide that service. A local pro-active service will also be provided to the schools and parents in areas where educational welfare officers are appointed. Where that local service is not available, the board will provide a reactive service which will cater for urgent cases brought to its attention.</P>
      <P>Apart from anything else, the board must employ extra staff. We estimate that the &euro;5.4 million will allow the board to employ approximately 30 to 40 extra educational welfare officers in addition to administrative staff and it will meet the needs of the board for this year.</P>

There are RAPID areas in my city, which has many problems, but yet we do not envisage having educational welfare officers, certainly in the current year. Will there be funding allocated in RAPID areas in places like Limerick and other areas around the country to address this issue in the near future?</P>

      <P>Like all statutory boards, the board is obliged to take Government policy into account. It is the Government's policy to give priority to areas of disadvantage, particularly RAPID areas. I am sure the board will take that policy into account, but again I am not in a position to direct the board to do so. I accept the point the Deputy is making about her own city and other areas. I would imagine that the board would give priority to those areas of greatest need initially and I will convey the views of the Deputy to the board in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The action group's report was published in July 2001. Responsibility for implementation of many of these recommendations lies with my Department. Some recommendations require action on the part of other Departments. On a wider level, the recommendations call for action on the part of third level institutions, schools and community and voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>To date a number of measures have been taken by my Department in response to the main recommendations in the report. The most significant spending recommendation of the group concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>Following a review early in 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and to &euro;1,600 for students residing within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a top-up of &euro;1,490 and &euro;596 respectively, for eligible students on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 students.</P>
      <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, administered the fund for the 2001-02 academic year.</P>
      <P>The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. I increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million this year. ADM Limited, which is continuing to administer the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report. I have given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education and my Department is engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority with a view to bringing the national office into operation this year. I anticipate that the <Col N="391" /> national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The action group recommended that the various interventions at early childhood, primary and second level to address disadvantage be reviewed by the Educational Disadvantage Committee. To date the work of the committee has addressed many issues related to the integration and cohesion of service provision to students in greatest need. In addition, the outcomes from the Educational Disadvantage Forum have clearly signalled the need for an integrated and comprehensive policy framework for educational inclusion and for more coherent structures to be established at both policy and operational levels. A report on the deliberations and discussions of the forum has recently been presented to me.</P>
    <P>Some of the action group's recommendations relate to the achieving of targets for access to third level education, over the period of the national development plan, in relation to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability.</P>
    <P>I am committed to progressing these and other recommendations in the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure of office as Minister for Education and Science. In this context, the Deputy will wish to be aware that when the Government first came into office in 1997, spending on third level access measures totalled &euro;508,000. In 2002, this had risen to &euro;23.98 million which represents, by any standards, a quantum leap in committed resources. The 2003 provision is &euro;26 million.</P>
    <P>My Department is also conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. Some of the issues being examined, such as the reform of student supports, are issues in relation to which the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education made a number of recommendations.</P>

      <P>When will the national office for equity of access to higher education be open? Will it be open for students who will be considering going to third level in the autumn?</P>
      <P>Some of the third level institutions have identified programmes or expansions of programmes which they feel would benefit their communities in reaching out to second level and primary level, but do not have the funding to implement them. Is the Minister sympathetic to those proposals which would, to return to his earlier answer, address the real problem of access which, as we all have agreed, starts at a much earlier stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that <Col N="392" /> I am sympathetic to any proposals which might increase access. However, this report to which we refer contains recommendations, not only about the obligations of the Department to fund access to third level and to encourage, through top-up grants, access offices and a fairly substantial commitment, from &euro;500,000 to &euro;26 million, to facilitate access, but also for the colleges themselves. I am a little worried about something that has arisen over the past number of months, where universities and third level institutions set out to attract and to facilitate access by people from disadvantaged areas, particularly in their own localities. Some of them put in place foundation courses and now they are expecting the Department to pay for them. I regard those foundation courses as their contribution to improving access to education. They should fund these courses and the students on them, and I make no apologies for saying so. Setting up such courses and putting a hand out for the taxpayer to fund them is not the way to go about it. Foundation courses should be funded by the colleges.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the office will be operation by 1 July 2003.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister had any discussions with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the administration of the millennium partnership fund in the light of his review of the partnership and community group structure?</P>
      <P>I assume the next part of the Minister's answer had to do with the action group's recommendations for specific targets for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability. In light of the fact that we are almost half-way through the life of the national development plan, is the Minister happy with the progress made to date following implementation of the recommendations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department maintains records on the former residents of 59 industrial <Col N="393" /> and reformatory schools who were placed there by way of a court hearing. Many children were placed in the schools by alternative means, for example health authority referral or voluntary placement, and in such instances my Department generally does not hold information. The primary reason for the absence of information in the case of health authority and voluntary placements is that my Department paid a <i>per capita</i> grant to the schools in respect of all residents who were placed there by the courts. When school authorities were communicating with my Department, they only did so in respect of those residents for whom capitation grant was received.</P>
      <P>In a limited number of cases, the name of a resident who was placed voluntarily in the school may appear on an archive list of residents provided by the school. In most cases the name appears with no other identifying information so it is impossible to verify with any degree of certainty that the name refers to an individual resident. My Department has consulted the redress board in relation to providing evidence of residency to former residents. To assist applicants who have made a claim to the board and to avoid creating delays for the board, officials in my Department are currently issuing a customised report to more than 2,000 residents who have applied to my Department under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act for access to their personal records. The redress board has confirmed that this document should normally suffice as evidence of residency.</P>
      <P>My Department receives a large number of requests under the Freedom of Information Act from former residents who were placed in the schools other than through the courts. In all such cases, the former resident is provided with available information to allow him to pursue his request with other authorities, such as religious orders and health boards. The Residential Institutions Redress Board is an entirely independent statutory body. It is a matter for the board to determine its requirements as to what is acceptable as evidence of residency in an institution. Notwithstanding this, my Department will provide any assistance possible to the redress board and former residents in this matter.</P>

      <P>I know that this matter has been brought to the Minister's personal attention. It was an issue for a number of people who were told only that their name was on a list, which was not enough for the Residential Institutions Redress Board. I was trying to figure out exactly what the Minister was saying, but I gather that his Department has tried to give as much information as possible. Has this information satisfied the redress board?</P>

      <P>As I understand it, we have undertaken to give to the board a list of people who have made inquiries about residency in these institutions and the board has agreed to accept this as a basis for a claim. What happens after <Col N="394" /> that is a matter for the board. I met people a few weeks ago in London who had been looking for records, and the only records they could find were their names on a roll. Some of these people could not get passports because there was no record of their births, others did not know where they came from or why they had been placed in institutions. Anything we can do to facilitate the people that have gone through this kind of pain and suffering will be done and we will try to make it as easy as possible for them.</P>

      <P>A number of people who did not attend the institutions listed in the Schedule to the Act have been in contact with the Department. I raised this on the Order of Business of 25 March and the Taoiseach informed me in writing afterwards that the Minister's Department was giving consideration to the insertion of additional institutions under the terms of the Act. Is this the case and when does the Minister expect this to happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge the need for the Department to be proactive, given the lack of satisfaction expressed by people who have resorted to the redress board in other areas? I mentioned earlier the news that the diocese of Ferns had admitted negligence. Irrespective of its being unrelated to residential abuse, the church has admitted negligence, but the State has not so far admitted negligence even though there has been a heartfelt apology from the Taoiseach. Will the Minister admit that the attempt to search for certain records of people who were incarcerated in State institutions has been compromised by changes under the Freedom of Information Act? I do not know whether the Minister had a personal role in this.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge the absurdity and deviousness of members of the Government telling victims of abuse in London that it would cost the State less to go through the courts process? The church will defend itself by trying to lay some of the blame on the State, as will the victims. If the matter went through the courts rather than being dealt with by a cosy &euro;128 million deal, the State would be liable for far more. The State should come clean and admit that crimes were committed and that the church and the State itself were involved so that the victims can have some closure.</P>

      <P>I will not accept the Deputy's calling me devious. The only person who made statements on this matter in London was me, and I was not in any way devious. I was asked a direct question and I gave a direct answer. If the victims going through the redress board were obliged to go through the courts, many of them would not succeed in their claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">

      <P>It would cost it considerably less as most of these cases would be dismissed because of insufficient evidence. That is what I said in London and I do not accept that I was being devious. I have tried to be as honest and straightforward with people as possible. As to whether I had a role in the change to the Freedom of Information Act, I am a member of Government and I accept full responsibility with the rest of the Cabinet for that. The change does not affect access to personal information, nor does it affect our response to queries about personal records. We will respond as we have up to now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright asked whether other institutions would be included in the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act. We are compiling a list at the moment. I do not know when it will be completed, but we intend to add other institutions to the list. The priority at the moment is to ensure that the redress board can deal with its current cases as efficiently and effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputy Gogarty to read the apology to which he referred, which contains everything he and the victims require. I have received a number of responses to the meeting in London. People said that while it did not take away their pain, they accepted the sincerity of the apology that was made on behalf of the State and the people.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the indemnity agreement between the State and the religious congregations, &euro;12.7 million has been identified to be used for educational programmes for former residents of institutions and their families. It is my intention that a grant scheme for former residents, which will be administered through the National Office for Victims of Abuse, NOVA, will be in operation for the next academic year in September 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that the scheme addresses a broad range of educational programmes from basic adult literacy up to masters degree level. An <i>ad hoc</i> committee was set up in January 2003 to develop a Framework Document and an application process. The committee is comprised of representatives from the vocational education sector, the further education section of my Department, NOVA and representatives of the survivors' groups. The deliberations of the committee should ensure that the application process will take full account of the educational requirements of survivors and that any scheme that is put in place will avail of the educational structures already in place in the country. There will be a provision in the scheme for a review of its <Col N="396" /> operation after one year so that it can be tailored to ensure it is adequately addressing the education needs of survivors.</P>
    <P>The committee has met on four occasions since January and the draft documents are at an advanced stage. When the draft documents are completed, they will be circulated to the broader interest groups for their observations before publication.</P>

      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment recently published the paper Developing Senior Cycle Education: Consultative Paper on Issues and Options. It presents ideas about the future of the senior cycle of post-primary education. The paper is part of a process of consultation through which the NCCA is seeking the views of students, parents, teachers, and other interested individuals and groups, as to how the senior cycle should develop and be shaped into the future.</P>
      <P>The senior cycle has been a focus of considerable change and development in the past ten years resulting in the emergence of transition year, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied, in addition to the established leaving certificate. The consultative paper, which has been widely distributed, now provides an opportunity to take stock of these and other developments in education as well as in the area of assessment and to engage in an exercise of foresight regarding future developments in senior cycle education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the consultation period the NCCA will host a forum entitled &ldquo;National Forum on Developing Senior Cycle Education: Issues and Options&rdquo; in the autumn. The forum will report on the findings of the consultation process and signal the directions that the emerging <Col N="397" /> policy paper on senior cycle education is taking.

The current system whereby how they perform in the June of one year in their lives can make such a difference. What support will the Minister provide to this review? How widely will it be debated? Changing any system can be difficult. Does the Minister agree with me that the kinds of skills and abilities that are measured in the leaving certificate at the moment are not necessarily the most important ones in terms of being a useful member of society? It does not assess the ability to work in co-operation with other people, or being flexible or quick-witted. With what urgency will he address this issue when the full report is received?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis that change takes so long in education, I regard this as extremely urgent. The NCCA is the body that will make the final recommendations to me. The launch took place in December or January. Between February and April we will see the publication of the final report on the international thematic seminar on international developments and the preparation and issue of specific papers on basic and key skills to which the Deputy referred &ndash; the life skills approach; modularisation in curriculum; and curriculum structures and programme which is currently ongoing.</P>
      <P>In May and June there will be a series of meetings between the NCCA and representatives of the partners in education and others outside the partners in education. It will try to finalise the report of the consultations on the senior cycle education with the main findings and recommendations in June or July. In September or October the national forum will take place reporting on the findings of the consultation process. Following that, presumably in November or December, an NCCA policy paper will be issued advising me on future developments in senior cycle education.</P>

Having almost put four children through the leaving certificate, I know that a bit <Col N="398" /> of pressure is no harm. However, there are many things we can do that can reduce the pressure to allow the students to show exactly the skills they have. I would like to see the kind of things the Deputy mentioned measured in some way and an assessment carried out of the whole person rather than just what they can give back at an exam. I would appreciate the support of all sides of the House when we go down that route because it will have its difficulties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 272, 273 and 276 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully conscious of the issues raised by the Deputy in this case. The background to the matter is that Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school opened in September 2002 with provisional recognition from my Department. The school is currently housed in rented accommodation in the scout den in Lucan village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period of provisional recognition, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building. Interim accommodation <Col N="399" /> must comply at all times with planning, fire and health and safety and building regulations.</P>
    <P>In view of the restricted capacity of the scout den, the promoters were advised to develop and implement an enrolment policy in line with the capacity of the available accommodation. This approach was essential to ensure that there was no overcrowding that might create a health and safety problem for pupils and school staff.</P>
    <P>In response to its impending accommodation difficulties, the board of management of the school has made a proposal to my Department to lease the site which has been reserved in the Griffeen Valley area for primary education purposes from the owners and to house the school in temporary accommodation on the site. This proposal is currently under consideration in my Department and as part of the process, the property management section of the Office of Public Works was asked to carry out a rental valuation on the site. The Office of Public Works has supplied an initial report outlining the terms the vendor would require in order to grant access to the site. These terms require further consultation and negotiation between the vendor and the Office of Public Works. A decision will be conveyed to the school management authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister is aware Lucan is the fastest growing town in Ireland with a huge need for school accommodation. My information from the Office of Public Works is that it would cost &euro;200,000 over two years and a further &euro;300,000 to prepare the site. Castlethorn has indicated it needs a three-year commitment on the site. Does the Minister agree that Griffeen Valley Educate Together and other such organisations are caught in a catch-22 position in that not having a traditional church, it needs to find temporary accommodation first and that this land on Griffeen Avenue is the only viable temporary accommodation the school can find? When will a final decision be made?</P>
      <P>The school has given a provisional indication of 40 pupils, which although modest, will require more than one classroom. It needs to give a commitment and in many cases parents have nowhere else to send their children and would be facing major hardship unless clarity is given. Can the Minister acknowledge that the long-term demographics of the Lucan area mean that such a school will be operational at some stage and any jump-start it can get using any thinking outside the box would be warmly welcomed?</P>

I assure the Deputy that we will clarify some of the issues that have arisen with the offer as soon as we possibly can. We will try to facilitate the school as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 18, 21, 26, 50 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of student support provisions is being undertaken within my Department with the aim of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. Officials of my Department are conducting the review. However, some issues require the engagement of external expertise. In this regard, the Economic and Social Research Institute has undertaken <Col N="401" /> work to enable my Department to estimate the cost of various options.</P>
    <P>In conducting the review my Department officials are having regard to international experience and relevant reports and policy documents, including the report of the action group on access to third level education which was launched in July 2001. I expect that the outcome of the review by my officials will provide me with a range of possible options which will seek to ensure that the available funding is targeted in a manner which achieves maximum impact from the point of view of equity of access to third level education.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the review will be submitted for my attention in the near future. As I indicated to the House previously, I recognise the need to avoid, as far as possible, uncertainty for students and their parents. It is my intention to decide within the coming weeks the arrangements and support provisions which will be in place for students for the 2003-04 academic year. When I have had an opportunity to consider the contents of the review I will bring the matter to Cabinet. Following its consideration by Government, I will make a determination as regards publication and consultation arrangements, as appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG" hpid="Ms Enright Ms Enright">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>My first question relates to the loan system. I am aware that the report has not been published and that the Minister is not aware of its content. However, has the Minister given thought to how a loan system would be administered? I am not talking about any particular models. Has he considered whether it would be more beneficial to assess it on the basis of the parents' income at the time the student starts to attend college, the income earning potential of the student depending on the course he or she chooses or the actual earnings of the student after he or she completes college? Obviously, one can start a course which offers the prospect of a good income but the opposite can occur.</P>
      <P>What groups does the Minister intend to consult following publication of the report? He has mentioned who was involved in preparing the report but will he have widespread consultations? I am inquiring particularly about USI but also about Macra na Feirme, which has serious concerns about comments that were made not by the Minister but by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of consultation will depend on how much of a change will be recommended in the report. I have looked at various loan systems and the newspapers have given coverage to a number of different models. In general, there is no means test for a loans system. Anybody who is going to college can apply for the loan. They do not have to but they can apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are common methods of payment in most of the schemes of which I am aware. A certain income level is decided on, which is usually around the average industrial wage. When the student has graduated and earns above that limit, <Col N="402" /> he or she starts repaying. In the Australian system, for example, repayments are 1%, 2% or 3% of income, depending on how much above the limit the income is. In some cases the loan scheme is administered by a separate loan agency and in some others it is administered on the basis of a PPP, where banks tender for the opportunity to provide loans. The interest rates charged in most cases are usually set at the rate of inflation. It is not more than that or the normal bank rate of interest repayment. That is a broad outline of how most of the loan systems I know of operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention or plan to have either a loan or a fees system in place for the coming academic year? Has he reviewed the Australian system? That system has failed where equity is concerned. Is it not true that it has failed to have an impact? It has had the opposite effect in that people are afraid of getting into debt and have decided not to attend third level as a result of that fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to opt for the loan system, it would take longer than next September to introduce it. The UK is changing its system to something akin to a loan system and has provided for a lead in time up to 2006 before it does so. The Australian system has not failed. The figures show that the level of participation across all socio-economic groups increased substantially. The other myth that is perpetuated is that there is huge non-repayment of loans. The figure is actually 12.5%. That is made up of people who do not reach the income level that triggers repayment, people who die and people who emigrate. The fourth category generally comprises women in the home who, with the intention of self-improvement, do a degree but have no intention of working outside the home. There has been an increase in participation across the board in higher education in Australia since the scheme was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be concerned that a system similar to the Australian one would lead to the emigration of people with skills that are needed in this country? Many young people go abroad for a year or two after they qualify but they usually return. Will the Minister research the possibility that a system modelled on the Australian one would encourage young people to leave this country with their skills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a factor in considering whether to introduce the scheme. Obviously, the Department of Finance would not be happy if loans were given out and 30% or 40% of the students decided to emigrate and not repay them. That would have to be taken into account and I am sure the review group will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People emigrating to avoid repayment has not been a huge factor in other countries so far. There are ways and means of avoiding it too. Somebody might guarantee the loan and many of <Col N="403" /> the people who emigrate tend to return. One of the benefits of a fees system is that it would be possible, in cases where particular skills are needed, to skew the system to ensure that students who went into those courses did not have to pay fees. There are pros and cons with all methods. I am sure the matter raised by the Deputy will be taken into account in the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there will not be a loan system in the forthcoming academic year. Does that also mean no fees will be introduced in the forthcoming academic year? Perhaps he will clarify that there will be no fees and no loan system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13, 15, 20 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Physical education and sport, although closely linked, are not synonymous. Sport begins in play and develops through games, competition and challenges, with an emphasis on winning. The focus in the physical education curriculum is on the child's holistic development, stressing personal and social development, physical growth and motor development. Goal-setting, within the curriculum, focuses on individual improvement and not on winning or being the best.</P>
      <P>Competition in sport is not incompatible with the holistic development of the child, however, particularly if the opportunities presented are such that the child is progressing towards the achievement of his or her potential. It is Government policy to encourage and promote sport for all in schools. The policy of my Department is to facilitate this by means of a broad and balanced physical education curriculum for schools at primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>The primary school curriculum was revised in 1999. Physical education was included in this process of revision and forms part of the prescribed curriculum for primary schools. At primary level, the curriculum in physical education encompasses elements of sport in the games strand of the curriculum. Sport is, therefore, presented and promoted as part of the prescribed physical education curriculum for primary schools. In addition to implementing the prescribed curriculum, many schools avail of the services of coaching personnel offered to schools by sporting organisations such as Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union. Schools are also encouraged to devote one day every year to &ldquo;Sport for All&rdquo; where the entire day is given over to sporting activities that emphasise participation, rather than winning or losing.</P>
      <P>In addition to the formal curriculum, many schools provide further opportunities in extra-curricular programmes for sport, including organising and preparing inter-school competitions. Teachers and parents make an extremely valuable contribution to children's social and physical development through their contribution of time and expertise to these extracurricular sporting activities.</P>
      <P>Schools at second level must offer a physical education programme. Revised syllabuses for physical education for junior cycle, senior cycle and leaving certificate have been completed and these are to be introduced into schools on a phased basis. Initially, the junior cycle, non-examination, syllabus will be introduced in 200 schools from September 2003 and the remaining schools will participate on a phased basis over the following two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is planned to introduce the senior cycle, non-examination, programme into schools from Sep<Col N="405" /> tember 2004, while the syllabus for leaving certificate, for examination, is expected to be introduced on a pilot basis from September 2005.</P>
    <P>To support the successful implementation of the syllabuses in all schools, a comprehensive in-service support programme is planned. A support team is to be set up shortly and this will be responsible for delivering the necessary in-service to physical education teachers nationally.</P>
    <P>As sports are an integral part of physical education they are dealt with comprehensively in these syllabuses. In implementing these programmes, students will participate in a wide range of sports and in so doing will gain an understanding of, and will develop technical skills in, these sports. The majority of schools have strong extra-curricular programmes for sport. The skills, understandings and attitudes developed within the formal programmes in physical education provide a foundation for these sports and include the development of positive attitudes regarding health and fitness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Would he agree that participation in sport encourages team work and fitness, thus improving health and fighting the problem of obesity about which many people are concerned? Would he also agree that the practice is very different to the theory he has just outlined? Many schools do not have the facilities or trained staff to encourage all their students to become involved in sport. In many schools only the elite have an opportunity to take part in competitive sporting activities.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister have any plans to ensure that all students will gain exposure to as many sports as possible while attending school? Would he agree that is just about the only time when students can learn sports, such as tennis, basketball and volleyball? If they learn those sports, they might pursue them for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that sport can have a hugely beneficial effect on pupils that goes beyond the fact of their participating. He mentioned some of the benefits himself but apart from the health and fitness ones, sport can teach life skills in which I am a great believer. Unfortunately, the Deputy is correct in saying that in many second level schools, in particular, the practice is different from the theory I outlined. However, I do not think that is true of primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Education and Science is in the House to deal with this matter. It is a month since I raised this issue by way of a parliamentary question, but it seems that there is some confusion between the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Education and Science should tell us exactly where the matter stands; the people of Cork city and county deserve no less. They need to know if this project has any chance of getting off the ground in the short-term. The Minister knows the matter is urgent because Cork has been selected as the European City of Culture in 2005. Everything is ready to proceed with the construction of the new school of music, but the Minister has not given the go ahead for it. I hope he will be able to do so this evening.</P>
      <P>The new school of music was going to be the jewel in the crown of Cork, with all of Europe focusing on its role as the City of Culture in 2005. The Minister understands the importance of music in cultural terms. If the school of music is not allowed to proceed, it will be a terrible embarrassment for the city, the county and the country in general. Damage is being done to Cork's fantastic musical tradition. The Minister is aware that for many decades the school of music in Cork has been at the forefront of musical innovation in the city and many thousands of students have passed through it.</P>
      <P>However, a major problem appears to have arisen. Eurostat and the Central Statistics Office have both been quoted and there have been difficulties concerning a public private partnership. The Minister's colleagues in Cork, like Opposition Members, have been working hard on this matter. At this stage, however, we desperately need urgent clarification of the position.</P>
      <P>Music students and staff are currently operating all over Cork in temporary accommodation, including hotels. It is difficult to learn music in such conditions, which cannot continue for much longer. A Government decision is required, but if that cannot be taken we should be told why it cannot be done at this time. What is the difficulty? I am pleading with the Minister to provide some clarity by telling us what is happening. What are his plans and can he see the new music school project proceeding within the coming months or at all? Will he have to commence the entire procedure from scratch?</P>
      <P>I understand that the developer has already spent up to &euro;12 million in bringing the project to this stage. As the Minister told me when I raised this matter a month ago, that money may be lost to the State which will have nothing to show for it. I wish to support the Minister if he can allow the project to go ahead. He should work with his Government colleagues and move heaven and earth to get it going. It is really urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this <Col N="408" /> matter on the Adjournment. I acknowledge the fact that he and his colleagues, including all Government and Opposition Deputies in Cork &ndash; in addition to a number of organisations &ndash; have raised this matter consistently. I understand their concerns.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the new Cork school of music is a constituent part of the Cork Institute of Technology and was to be procured under a public private partnership model. The Cork school of music provides training in a wide range of musical instruments, musical theory, speech and drama. It caters for first, second, third and fourth level students, whether they are amateur musicians, music teachers or performers. As the Deputy said, it has a central place not only in the educational but in the cultural life of Cork.</P>
      <P>With regard to the history of the project, it was advertised for tender on a European wide basis in June 2000. Following the project launch in July 2000, 12 consortia expressed interest in bidding for it. Following the presentation of outline proposals the number of bidders was eventually reduced to three. These bidders were invited to negotiate in November 2000. The consortia bids were submitted in February 2001, all of which were subject to detailed evaluation under design and construction, services, financial and legal headings by officials of my Department together with specialist advisers. Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder for the project. There then followed a long period of intense negotiations with Jarvis with a view to reaching a financial close to the project. During that period Jarvis, under the terms of the project, sought and received planning permission for the project from the city council. All would have been well and we would have been well on the way to the building of this project had An Taisce not submitted a planning appeal to An Bord Pleanála against the grant of permission. During the period of the appeal, work on the project had to be suspended and was only resumed after An Bord Pleanála rejected the appeal and granted planning permission for the development on 24 December 2001. However, other difficulties arose.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to clarify the current position. Under EU rules, as they stand, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance, GGB, over the construction phase. That is the rule the EU and EUROSTAT have applied in relation to the five second level schools that we built. They have been taken into account in the GGB. We have no reason to believe and we have had no indication to the contrary but that the EU will deal with this project in the same way. As the Deputy is aware, the GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue as will a standing committee established recently by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to advise on the GGB implications of private sector financed projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the rules as they stand or as <Col N="409" /> they are being interpreted, but it is not up to me to say that. If this project was given the go ahead, I would have to find &euro;60 million within my capital budget, but I do not have that kind of money at the moment. I can assure the Deputy that I, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers concerned directly in PPPs are trying, through our own committee and the EUROSTAT group, to have the consideration of PPPs dealt with differently because we believe they should be. Until that is completed the project will have to wait. It will have to be considered in light of the outcome of the deliberations of that committee and in the context of the competing demands on capital funding envelopes going forward.</P>

      <P>Next Monday 270 public health doctors will go on strike. These doctors provide an important service which is often undervalued but is crucial in protecting the public good. Unless the Minister for Health and Children takes action to resolve this dispute we are facing the prospect of a withdrawal of key medical personnel including those at the Disease Surveillance Centre, an end to safeguards currently in place to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and a block to the development of a strategy to protect this country from the spread of diseases from abroad. The need for such a strategy is now pressing in the context of the holding of the Special Olympics, a major international event involving over 35,000 people travelling to Ireland from many parts of the world.</P>
      <P>The current threat of the SARS virus as well as other infectious diseases is greatly increased by travel yet we have no indication from the Government as to its intentions in protecting public safety. What steps is the Minister for Health and Children taking to resolve this dispute? His bland statement that this matter be referred to the Labour Court has been shown to be grossly inadequate. Is he aware of the complexity of the issues involved? Is he aware, for example, that public health doctors receive no payment for their out-of-hours work?</P>
      <P>In view of the call by the EU Commissioner, David Byrne, today for an effective early warning system to be developed on an EU wide basis to deal with the threat of infectious diseases what is he doing to develop a good public health infrastructure in Ireland in line with other EU countries? What preparations are in place to carry out risk assessment in relation to the travel associated with the Special Olympics and what briefing is being done to inform the international delegations of the true nature of our public health infrastructure? Does the Minister for Health and Children agree that we cannot afford to wait for a crisis to occur before this issue is addressed and that the best approach to fears being expressed by members of the public is to implement a clearly understood and resourced strategy of public health measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister also accept that his tardiness on this issue compares badly with the effective and well funded strategy which was successful in <Col N="410" /> combating the threat of foot and mouth disease in animals and that it is hard to fathom why measures are still in place in our airports to counteract this disease among animals while there appears to be no measures in place to prevent the spread of infectious disease among humans?</P>
    <P>Currently there are no special arrangements in place to prevent the spread of SARS in Ireland. Internationally the rate of spread has lessened but this should not be a cause of complacency. Countries like Canada, China and others in Asia are experiencing serious problems in terms of the containment and prevention of the spread of this disease. Already the World Health Organisation has criticised the failure of the Chinese authorities to provide full information on SARS. Is the Government satisfied that guidance given by the World Health Organisation is based on complete information? Will the Minister for Health and Children outline how he will ensure that public health doctors will be in place from Monday onwards and that there will be a mechanism in place to resolve the ongoing and long-standing difficulties in relation to their complaints to ensure they can be resolved? Will he ensure we have a clear and good public health infrastructure to protect the population here in terms of infectious diseases like meningitis or measles but also to deal with these new diseases like SARS, which has only recently become evident but clearly has attached risks that can lead to deaths in our population as it has led to deaths in other populations if it is not properly addressed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on today's Adjournment. In 2002, the public service benchmarking body recommended increases for public health doctors ranging from 2.5%, in the case of specialists in public health medicine, to 14.2%, in the case of the directors of public health medicine. In making these recommendations, the benchmarking body was determining the rate of pay which should apply to the various public health posts based on their duties and responsibilities as of 30 June 2002. However, the benchmarking body did acknowledge that it was not in a position to take account of the issues raised by the Public Health Review Group, the Brennan group, in relation to the restructuring of public health service provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medical Organisation, the representative organisation for public heath doctors, has lodged a claim for a 30% pay increase, in advance of any discussion or agreement on future changes in work practices arising from the negotiations on the Brennan report or that will be required under the health and primary care strategies or the Prospectus report on structures in the health system. This claim is in addition to increases of up to 1% which have been approved by the public service benchmarking body and the 7% increase which will be paid under the terms of the new national pay agreement Sustaining Progress. As mentioned, the benchmarking body has determined the rate of pay to apply to the current <Col N="411" /> duties of public health doctors and negotiations on any further increase could take place only in the context of changes arising from the recommendations of the strategies I mentioned. However, I wish to advise the Deputy that the Health Services Employers Agency has confirmed to the IMO that it is willing to make good any pay increases public health doctors may have lost out on because of the delay in completing the Brennan review, in addition to the pay increases recommended for public health doctors by the public service benchmarking body. These cumulative increases will amount to approximately 27% in the case of directors of public health, with the new national pay agreement providing a further 7%.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the management position must reflect the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body and must comply with other elements of Government pay policy. Within these requirements, management has made a substantial offer of a cumulative 10.8% in recognition of outstanding pay elements. This offer has been rejected by the IMO.</P>
    <P>Both the Health Service Employers Agency and the Department of Health and Children have written to the Irish Medical Organisation indicating their opposition to the current action and requesting the reconvening of talks, including the intervention of the Labour Court. The IMO decision to issue notice of strike action is unwarranted and especially inappropriate in view of the potential risk associated with SARS and the range of current health issues which require the involvement and co-operation of public health doctors. A management team, comprising officials from my Department, the Health Services Employers Agency and the health boards, held negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation in the Labour Relations Commission on a number of occasions in recent months. I understand that the HSEA has accepted an invitation from the Labour Relations Commission to resume discussions and has urged the IMO to participate in this process. I have already requested the Irish Medical Organisation to return to these negotiations or to accept my invitation to attend the Labour Court. Both of these offers have been refused and I now again request the IMO to re-consider its position in this matter in an attempt to resolve the current impasse.</P>
    <P>In the event of this strike going ahead on Monday next, the Health Service Employers Agency has sought confirmation from the IMO as to the level of emergency cover that will be provided by public health doctors across their range of responsibilities, including the SARS outbreak. At a meeting yesterday, the IMO indicated that the strike action will involve all public health doctors and that requests for emergency cover should be channelled to the IMO national strike committee, who will ensure that emergency cover will be provided in circumstances where that committee is satisfied that there is a real and immediate risk to human life. I understand that the Health Service Employers Agency is trying to arrange a further <Col N="412" /> meeting with the IMO tomorrow in order to seek further clarification and assurances in relation to the provision of appropriate levels of emergency cover.</P>
    <P>I again request the Irish Medical Organisation and public health doctors to withdraw from their proposed strike action, to resume normal working activities and to participate in the processes which are available to resolve this dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek an explanation of the dramatic reduction in hospital services across the board in the Dublin metropolitan area, particularly in the Mater hospital in the Taoiseach's constituency. All we seem to get from the Government is the suggestion that the Minister for Finance is imposing the hatchet, which bewilders the Minister for Health and Children, who is critical of the Minister for Finance. They have had a public spat in the media which the Taoiseach denied. The Taoiseach himself seems helpless when it comes to a hospital in his area, though that is the hospital which employed him when he was a civilian, so to speak.</P>
      <P>If there are 120 bed closures, which is over 20% of the Mater's total capacity, one cannot but have a massive reduction in services and staff as well as the ability to bring in patients, from long-term patients on waiting lists to accident and emergency patients. All those services have been affected in the Mater and in other Dublin hospitals. That will lead to demoralisation in the services; such a traumatic effect on a hospital's ability to provide the service it is used to providing means it is hard to get back to a situation where there is proper trust and credibility, not to mention morale. That is the danger of the present situation. A month ago an accident and emergency case was treated in the car park of the Mater; we cannot go on with that situation.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with the case of a double amputee at present who has been in the Mater for nine months and has nowhere to go. The local authority has no interest in providing any essential repairs and the Mater, in the best interests of the hospital, can see the patient has no future if released. That is the kind of hard choices the hospital is finding very difficult, as are hospitals all over the country. There are no proper community services nor is there proper integration of health and accommodation services, particularly when specific adjustments must be made to homes and the local authority cannot act due to the cutbacks.</P>
      <P>The Government took office on a promise of eliminating the hospital waiting lists within two years. That now sounds like a sick joke, as the waiting lists will probably double in size within two years. Why has there been such a dramatic reduction in services? Why has the situation become so drastic in the Mater, the oldest hospital on Dublin's northside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address the matter raised by the Deputy, but regarding waiting lists, the operations of the national treatment purchase <Col N="413" /> fund have resulted in reductions on some waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Dublin hospitals, as the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment. The approved level of spending nationally for health services in 2003 is in excess of &euro;9 billion. Of this, over &euro;500 million relates to capital spending, with the remaining &euro;8.5 billion available for revenue spending.</P>
      <P>While this level of funding is very significant, it is recognised that the authority and the health boards have had to take some difficult decisions in the current year on their service provision and priorities. Nevertheless, it must also be recognised that even in the prevailing economic climate, the health services have once again received the highest increase in funding across all Departments, a clear indication of this Government's commitment to maintaining the quantum and quality of services in difficult economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has a total of &euro;1.154 billion available to purchase acute hospital services in 2003. This figure includes additional funding of &euro;9.450 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services agreed and funded in recent years. This is the basis upon which the authority developed and agreed its own 2003 service plan with the Department. Additional funding has also been provided to meet the costs associated with the recruitment of additional consultants in emergency medicine and consultant anaesthetists, and for cancer, cardiology and renal dialysis services.</P>
      <P>The authority accepts that 2003 will be a difficult year for the acute hospitals sector, as increases in funding over last year will be limited. There is a clear need for tight management of cost and activity in 2003 in the context of working within available resources.</P>
      <P>Discussions between the authority and the major Dublin hospitals to agree service provision plans for this year are well advanced. There are, however, some issues that still need to be addressed to ensure that the hospitals operate within budget. The chief concern of all parties has been to minimise the impact of financial issues on patient service provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority has emphasised that, at a minimum, the same total level of services which the ERHA approved for the Dublin academic teaching hospitals last year will be provided by the hospitals this year. However, because acute hospital activity in 2002 was significantly above the approved level, there will be a percentage reduction in some services this year to enable the hospitals to live within their 2003 funding levels. The hospitals are also planning to implement a number of cost-saving measures that will not impact on activity levels. The authority is confident that the planned level of activity is deliverable within a reconfiguration of bed capacity. All opportunities to maintain activity levels will continue to be explored by the hospitals and the <Col N="414" /> ERHA, including substituting less expensive day-case work for in-patient activity and funding elective procedures from waiting list funding. The overall mix will reflect a more efficient and cost-effective throughput of activity.</P>
    <P>I point out that additional funding was made available to the Eastern Regional Health Authority this year for cancer, cardiology and renal services. The authority has indicated that these essential services will be protected at the 2002 approved levels. The authority and each of the major Dublin hospitals will continue to work together to ensure that in delivering services, the availability and standard of patient care is accorded the highest priority.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowance) (Amendment) (No. 1) Regulations 2002 set out the maximum amount of rent in respect of which a supplement is payable for the period commencing 22 November 2002 and ending 31 December 2003. This amount is determined by the local health board. The rent allowance currently offered by the North-Western Health Board, the lowest in the country, is totally unrealistic. The maximum allowance in the North-Western Health Board area for a single person is &euro;77 per week. The equivalent figure in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area is &euro;107 and just across the border in County Mayo, in the western region, the figure is &euro;115 per week.</P>
      <P>The maximum allowance in the North-Western Health Board area for a couple with one child or a one parent family is &euro;115 per week. In the Midland Health Board area, which covers County Roscommon, again just across the border, the figure is &euro;140 per week. In the Western Health Board area, the maximum allowance is &euro;175 per week, while the figure in the Eastern Region Health Authority area is &euro;225 per week. As the Minister of State will have gathered, the rates allowable in the North-Western Health Board Area are ridiculously low and are causing serious and even insurmountable problems for those who find themselves caught in this position.</P>
      <P>A recent survey of landlords and auctioneers in Sligo indicates that a one bedroom apartment costs approximately &euro;127 per week in the town, but a single person or a couple with one child has available to them just &euro;77 and &euro;115 per week respectively. This means that they simply cannot access accommodation in Sligo town. The average cost of a two bedroom apartment in the town is &euro;170 per week, but the maximum amount available to a couple with three children is &euro;153. Again, this is totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in my possession a letter from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, dated 25 March 2003, which was sent to Sligo Social Services Council and states: &ldquo;The Department is not aware of any case where the introduction of the new Regulations has resulted in individuals being made homeless.&rdquo;  I can state categorically that two cases today presented to Sligo social services as homeless because they could not access <Col N="415" /> adequate accommodation at the rent supplement levels provided. They will spend tonight in temporary hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is probably aware, Sligo social services acts on an agency basis for Sligo Corporation in responding to cases of homelessness. It has confirmed to me today that a significant number of people &ndash; its phrase, not mine &ndash; have presented to Sligo social services as homeless because they are unable to find accommodation in Sligo town at the levels provided for by the health board.</P>
    <P>The letter from the Department also states that data from the CSO indicates that rent levels in the private sector have continued to fall. This data means nothing to the two people who presented as homeless to Sligo social services today &ndash; who will be accommodated tonight in temporary hostel accommodation &ndash; nor will it mean anything to the couple who came to my clinic some three or four weeks ago. They are renting a house in Sligo which is to be sold and this means that they will have to move at the end of June when their son completes his leaving certificate. They will be allowed to spend &euro;115 on accommodation and will simply not be able to find any reasonable accommodation in Sligo for a figure even close to that.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Minister review the rates used by the North-Western Health Board or requests that the health board does so. If he waits until the end of December, it will cause untold hardship and real anxiety for many people who need to rent accommodation. As he and I are both aware, those who find themselves in this position are often very vulnerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reply to the matter raised by Deputy Harkin on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement scheme is payable to people receiving social welfare payments and aims to ensure that applicants pay reasonable rents for their accommodation. The rent supplement scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by the health boards and provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</P>
      <P>As individual health boards are in touch with local market forces, they set the limits on the amount of rent per week or month. Payment is subject to certain conditions, one of which relates to the amount of rent an applicant may incur. Each health board is required to set maximum rent levels for different categories of person, for example, single persons, one parent families and couples with children. The limits are set by reference to local property considerations within the board's functional area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement for individuals to find accommodation appropriate to their circumstances, within the rent limits set by the health board, is a <Col N="416" /> standard requirement of the scheme which has not been changed. The level of rent a person may incur and the amount of supplement payable towards that rent has always been subject to limits. The provision whereby rent supplement is not payable in cases where rent exceeds the appropriate maximum level is not new, although it is now set out in regulations for the first time.</P>
    <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of social welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The reason rent supplement is not normally payable where the amount of rent being sought exceeds the health board's appropriate limit is that to do so would leave a person, after payment of rent, with an inadequate income to meet his or her basic needs.</P>
    <P>The new regulations do not rescind the discretion allowed to health boards to deal with exceptional cases. The legislation governing the payment of rent supplement allows health boards to exceed their limits in cases where, in the opinion of the board, there are exceptional circumstances. The primary purpose of the new regulations introduced in November 2002 was to maintain the maximum rent levels, as set by the health boards at their current rates until the end of December 2003.</P>
    <P>The data provided by the Central Statistics Office, to which the Deputy referred, showed that rent levels in the private rented sector had been stable for some time and had actually fallen. I accept the Deputy's point that the circumstances in particular regions can vary. The purpose of health boards is to reflect and respond to such circumstances. More recent data from the CSO indicates that this trend is continuing. Accordingly, there is no need for health boards to set higher levels of maximum rents for the purpose of the rent supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>The new regulations have not curtailed access to rent supplement. In this regard, on the day the regulations were introduced, namely, 22 November 2002, there were 52,855 rent supplements in payment. This figure has risen to the extent that, as of 4 April this year, there were 57,113 rent supplements in payment.</P>
    <P>The effects of the regulations are being monitored on an ongoing basis by the Department. Health boards are required to notify the Department of instances where supplements are put in payment in cases where exceptional circumstances are involved. Since the new regulations were introduced, 46 such cases have been notified to the Department and in each case the health board in question decided to pay a supplement above the maximum level as an exceptional measure. All aspects of the current system of rent supplement are being reviewed in the context of a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme currently under way in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 April 2003.</P>

      <P>A range of measures to improve teacher supply have been introduced in recent years. The intake to the B.Ed. programme in the Colleges of Education has been increased dramatically. Since 1999 more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the undergraduate B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1996, post graduate diploma courses have been run by the colleges of education to increase further the number of B.Ed graduates. In February 2002, 461 students commenced the post graduate course and these students will graduate <Col N="418" /> in June 2003. A total of 1,633 students completed the post graduate course between 1996 and 2002.</P>
    <P>The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the Colleges of Education.</P>
    <P>Between 2002 and 2003, it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>A further post graduate course commenced in February 2003 with a maximum of 460 places available on the course which will conclude in May-June 2004.</P>
    <P>My Department is examining the feasibility of providing a modular type course for second-level trained teachers currently teaching in primary schools, who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and the necessary academic requirement in Irish. This proposal will be discussed with the colleges of education in the near future and, if implemented, would enable these teachers to become fully qualified primary teachers.</P>

      <P>The manner in which voluntary contributions are sought from local communities for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme is a matter for school principals and management. Voluntary contributions by parents and others are allowed under the free education scheme. The extent of such fund raising, by and on behalf of schools, is determined by a range of socio-economic factors, including the level of local initiative and the need for additional facilities and curriculum provision as perceived by parents and the wider community. In all circumstances the contributions must be voluntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits of obtaining returns from the schools, as suggested by the Deputy, are not clear. Local contributions towards education provision have long been a feature of the Irish education system and any move to quantify the amount of such contributions would require the purpose and parameters of the inquiry to be clarified. Distinguishing between essential and <Col N="419" /> optional spending on the schools would be extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements in the levels of other direct funding to schools have been made in recent years. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;111.58 per pupil in 2003. This represents an increase of 95% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level over the period.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level, schools have benefited from significant increases in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased from &euro;224.74 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;256.49 in September 2001, and was further increased by &euro;10 from September 2002 to &euro;266.49. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra &euro;20,875 per annum, and a total capitation grant of &euro;133,245 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to &euro;152,290. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in the year 2000 to &euro;99 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2003.</P>
    <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of a recent equalisation measure, the support services grant was increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002, bringing the overall support services grant in the case of secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school &ndash;&euro;44.44 per pupil &ndash; per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001.</P>
    <P>For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of &euro;236,761 &ndash;&euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools &ndash; towards general expenses and support services.</P>

      <P>In order to ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. This project has the potential to be a key tool in how we establish any spare capacity in the system. The information <Col N="421" /> gained in the survey has been placed on a geographic information system, GIS, database. My Department is at present undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of the nationwide survey, having regard to available resources. The information gathered from the pilot project, and the completed project, when available, will enable the Department to identify schools with a surplus or deficit of accommodation and thus assist in the long-term planning for educational provision in any particular location.</P>
      <P>As a matter of course, the issue of unutilised school places is also considered when applications for additional accommodation are being assessed. Determining the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration by my Department of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. Where feasible, the utilisation of any excess capacity at existing schools in an area is considered as a possible solution. However, given the growing demand for diversity and plurality within the education system, it is rarely the case that available places match that growing demand for diversity of school ethos. Often, it is our response to the demand for diversity of provision that actually creates the spare capacity in a school of a different management type and ethos. There is clearly a tension here between facilitating parents choice while at the same time creating some spare capacity in other schools. Another factor to be considered is that the areas where the greatest spare capacity is identified tend to be those with an ageing population and not in the areas where additional need is emerging as a result of population increase.</P>
      <P>The utilisation of school places has also been specifically considered by the Commission on School Accommodation in its area studies and this information has been used subsequently by my Department when considering individual cases in the relevant areas.</P>

      <P>In October 2000, my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid for primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials <Col N="422" /> associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally still be available to them for the current year.</P>
      <P>In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged received a grant of &euro;1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of &euro;635.

      <P>The implementation of science subjects in post-primary schools is strongly supported by my Department through the provision of capital funding towards the cost of providing high quality science laboratories and equipment.</P>
      <P>It is the case that when providing an entire new school, provision is made for science laboratories at the rate of one laboratory per 200 pupils. Likewise, with an extension project, the condition of existing laboratory provision is assessed as part of the preliminary analysis of need. Where existing provision is deemed to be inappropriate or otherwise inadequate, either a complete refurbishment is undertaken or alternatively, brand new facilities are provided. In the 2003 school building programme alone, the science needs of a significant number of schools are being addressed. The Deputy can be further assured that all science laboratories being provided in post-primary schools are equipped to a high standard.</P>
      <P>Recently, grants in excess of &euro;13,000 per school were made available to schools in the free education system that offer one or more of the physical science subjects at senior cycle level towards the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment.

      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act was signed into law by the President on 10 April 2002. The Act provided for the setting up of the Residential Institutions Redress Board. This board was formally established on 16 December 2002, and application forms have been made available from the board's offices to applicants <Col N="423" /> and their legal representatives. The Residential Institutions Redress Board is entirely independent and my Department has no input or influence on its work.</P>
      <P>Justice Seán O'Leary, a sitting Circuit Court judge, is the chairperson of the board. Other board members appointed include Professor Desmond Greer, Dr. Helen Commiskey, Dr. Ruth Pilkington and Mr. Richard O'Connell.</P>
      <P>The Act provides that where a person makes an application for an award to the board, she or he is required to establish: (a) proof of identity; (b) that he or she was resident in an institution during his or her childhood; and (c) that he or she was injured while so resident and that injury is consistent with any abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident.</P>
      <P>An independent compensation advisory committee, chaired by a senior counsel, was established in 2001 to advise on the appropriate levels of compensation for injuries related to childhood abuse. The group, which included psychologists and a psychiatrist, reported to the Minister in January 2002 and its report, entitled, Towards Redress and Recovery, has been published and is available on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>The board has confirmed to my officials that the number of applications received to date by it is 773. It is now a matter for the board to engage in the processes laid down in the Act, including the time allowed for all parties to respond, in order to process those applications. It is understood that the board anticipates that the process will be completed in respect of some applications during the month of April and that hearings and settlement discussions will then commence. There is provision under the legislation for the board to make interim payments in certain cases and, to date, I understand from my officials that ten interim awards have been made.</P>

      <P>On 5 June 2002 an indemnity agreement between the State and CORI was signed which provided for 18 religious congregations making a contribution of &euro;128 million to the Residential Institutions Redress Fund. In return for this contribution the previous Government agreed to grant an indemnity to the religious congregations that were parties to the agreement. This indemnity applies only to cases which are eligible to be dealt with under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, but which are not resolved within this scheme, and in respect of which litigation is commenced within six years of the date of the agreement, 5 June 2002. In the event of a religious congregation deciding to run a case itself then the indemnity will not apply.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that all, or certainly the vast majority of cases will be dealt with by the Residential Institutions Redress Board rather than through the courts. Therefore, it is expected that the indemnity will apply to relatively few cases. However, as there is no way to predict at this time how many claimants will opt to go through the courts rather than the redress board I am not in a position to estimate the likely cost of the indemnity to the State. To date, the indemnity has not been applied to in any case.</P>

      <P>The Government remains fully committed to supporting schools in promoting access to and use of information and communications technologies, ICT, in teaching and learning. To this end, substantial funding has been made avail<Col N="427" /> able to schools in recent years for the acquisition of computer hardware and software. Funding has been provided in the form of capital grants, which schools may utilise in a way that best meets their specific ICT needs and priorities.</P>
      <P>The planning, organisation and management of computer facilities within the school, including the location of computers in classrooms or in a computer room, is a matter for the school authorities. To assist them in this process, the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, provides, on behalf of my Department, a nationwide ICT advisory and support service for schools with a full-time ICT adviser based in each of the 21 education centres around the country.</P>
      <P>In addition, the NCTE has provided ICT planning and management seminars for all primary and post-primary principals as well as a range of ICT training and support courses for teachers. The seminars for principals have provided advice on a range of issues, including the development of computer facilities within the school and the relative merits of providing a dedicated computer room or locating computers within classrooms. Research to date does not provide any definitive view on this issue and at the end of the day it is about ensuring that students have the opportunity to develop their computer skills and that ICT is used effectively to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in school.</P>
      <P>In larger schools and many post-primary schools, a designated computer room may be the most efficient way of providing all students with access to computers for a definite time period. This model provides individual students or groups of students with access to relevant software and the Internet. New post-primary schools funded under my Department's building programme are provided with a multi-media language laboratory equipped with 31 personal computers and a computer room also equipped with 31 personal computers. For most primary schools, the practice has generally been to provide computer facilities within the classroom as this is considered to be more conducive to integrating ICT into everyday classroom teaching and learning at primary level.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to comments <Col N="428" /> made in the course of a recent procedural hearing held by the investigation committee of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. I understand that during the hearing both the chairperson of the committee and counsel to the committee were critical of the Department's performance in relation to the discovery of documentation to the investigation committee. I also understand that counsel for the Department rebutted these criticisms and put the Department's contribution to the work of the committee in context.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will probably be aware, the great majority of the complaints made to the investigation committee have emanated from former residents of the industrial and reformatory schools system. In this regard, my Department has provided over 500,000 documents records relating to the old industrial and reformatory schools system to the investigation committee on a voluntary basis. This documentation was provided in e-format for the committee on a phased basis between 2000 and 2002. The assistance provided by my Department in this regard has previously been acknowledged on several occasions by the committee, as was the assistance provided by my officials in relation to the operation of the computer system storing the documentation.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, the investigation committee issued a direction for discovery to the Department which required to be complied with by the end of April 2003. My Department sought a variation on the date for compliance with this direction due principally to the large volume of documents that the Department would have to search through in order to meet the terms of the direction. An extension of the deadline to the end of June 2003 was granted to the Department at the recent procedural hearing referred to earlier. My Department is now working towards ensuring full compliance with the terms of the direction within the revised deadline.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department is fully committed to assisting the investigation committee in carrying out its functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 38, 56, 67, 69 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>Sport can play a major part in personal development and in character formation. Engagement in physical activity involving competition or challenges against oneself, others or the environment can contribute to the development of many positive attributes in young people, particularly when the emphasis on winning is not over-emphasised. Physical education is part of the prescribed curriculum for primary schools, and schools at second level must offer a physical education programme. Physical education and sport, although closely linked, are not synonymous. Sport begins in play and develops through games, competition and challenges. The focus in the physical education curriculum is on the child's holistic development, stressing personal and social development, physical growth, and motor development. Goal-setting, within the curriculum, focuses on individual improvement and not on winning or being the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, competition in sport is not incompatible with the holistic development of the child if the opportunities presented are such that the child is progressing towards the achievement of his or her potential. Engagement in planned, competitive and challenging physical activities and games can contribute to the development of concentration, persistence, motivation to succeed, teamwork and leadership, all elements in character development, as well as physical fitness, and all of which can impact on academic achievement and results. Involvement in sport activities gives rise to a healthy lifestyle and healthy interests and <Col N="430" /> pastimes, diverting students away from drug abuse and alcohol.</P>
    <P>Sport is already presented and promoted as part of the physical education curriculum for schools. At primary level a revised curriculum in physical education was published as part of the primary school curriculum in 1999. A revised syllabus for physical education for junior cycle, as a non-examination subject, is being introduced to second level schools on a phased basis from September of this year. Initially 200 schools will participate in this project with the remaining schools becoming involved over the following years. It is planned that the revised physical education syllabus for senior cycle, as a non-examination subject, will be introduced to schools on a phased basis from September 2004 and while the syllabus for leaving certificate, for examination, is expected to be introduced from September 2005.</P>
    <P>Sport is an integral part of these syllabi and, through participation in the physical education programme, students will experience and learn about a wide range of sports. A variety of skills such as carrying, striking, handling, kicking and controlling a ball is taught in schools and these skills are applied both in the popular sports and in minority sports. Rounders, hockey, pair tennis, Gaelic football, hurling, soccer, volley ball and basket ball are among the wide range of games promoted. However, the choice of the games available in any particular school is a matter for the board of management of each school.</P>

      <Quest>when he expects to publish the promised regulations under the Education Act 1998 to govern admission to primary schools, especially in view of claims made in the report of the National Forum on Primary Education that a number of primary schools were discriminating against poorer and weaker pupils in their enrolment and admission policies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pupils and parents enjoy a number of legal rights regarding their choice of school for primary education. These derive from the Constitution, legislation and my Department's rules.</P>
      <P>Statutory rights to choice of school derives from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting &ldquo;the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, section 15 (2)(<i>d</i>) of the 1998 Act provides that a board of management of a primary school shall &ldquo;publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning <Col N="431" /> admission to and participation in the school . . .  and ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At present, officials in my Department are in consultation with officials in the office of the parliamentary counsel to the Government with a view to drawing up regulations under the Act governing the preparation of admissions policies. This work is ongoing and will be concluded as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these proposed regulations is to promote greater consistency, transparency and accountability in decision-making at school level and to further the objective, under the Education Act, of equality and participation in education.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters, including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</P>
    <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
    <P>In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of the inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the procedures whereby eligibility for additional resources is established by means of psychological, or other professional, assessment. My Department's circular letters 7/02 and 8/02 define stringent criteria for identifying each category of disability and quantify the level of resources to be allocated in respect of each.</P>
      <P>When a school principal receives a professional report that indicates that a child may be eligible for additional resources, she or he makes application to the special education section, using forms SER 1 and SER 2. The school principal also signs a declaration stating, among other things, that the application is based on relevant assessment reports that are available for inspection by the Department. Before Christmas, a survey conducted by the Department's inspectorate indicated a significant number of anomalies in the applications for extra resources. My Department therefore decided to review the two most recent rounds of applications. In view of the confidential nature of professional reports on individual children, NEPS psychologists have been asked to conduct this review.</P>
      <P>NEPS psychologists have checked the data supplied in all the available professional reports to see if they complied with the criteria in the circular letters. In a significant number of cases, they found that the data did not so comply and accordingly informed special education section of this. The reports supplied by psychologists in private practice have not been rejected by my Department. They are generally extremely helpful in providing guidelines for those who are working with the children assessed. The assessment findings are not in dispute but it has been found in a significant number of cases that recommendations had been made for the allocation of extra resources, although the assessment data did not conform to the specific criteria outlined in circular letters 7/02 and 8/02.</P>
      <P>There has been no change to the operation of the NEPS scheme for commissioning psychological assessments nor to the criteria for eligibility outlined in circulars 7/02 and 8/02. It is the responsibility of psychologists in private practice to clarify in their reports to schools the eligibility for additional resources of the children assessed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I indicated my intention to widen the consultation process when the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill was restored to the legislative process and I encouraged all interested parties to participate in the ensuing consultative process.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that as a result of this consultation process 39 groups and individuals responded to the invitation for submissions on the Bill and 25 groups met with officials of my Department for detailed discussions on their submissions. The new Bill will take into account the views which emerged from consultations with the various interest groups. This phase of consultation is now complete and I intend to bring the revised legislation to Government shortly with a view to publishing by May 2003. My objective is to bring forward legislation which will provide for the identification of the special educational needs of children with disabilities and the provision for them of an education appropriate to their needs as early as possible in their lives; which will provide for structural arrangements within which adults with special educational needs can have access to the education and related services and supports they require; which will ensure that parents have a central role in their child's education; and which will ensure that the various agencies involved in providing for special education and related support services are required to act within specified time limits.</P>
      <P>I also propose that the legislation will build on and strengthen the structures set out in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, especially the National Council for Special Education and the Special Education Appeals Board. It will also be an objective for revised legislation that it will closely dovetail where necessary with legislation being prepared by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform relating to the broader issue of services for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>Legislation regarding the fitting and use of seat belts in public vehicles is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Under existing regulations seat belts are not compulsory on school buses. In operating the school transport scheme, Bus <Col N="434" /> Éireann is fully compliant with all relevant regulations as laid down by that Department. Contractors' large vehicles, when tested by the Garda authorities to obtain the licence to operate school bus and other public services, are not required to have seat belts installed to get the PSV licence.</P>
      <P>I understand that agreement has been reached on a proposal to amend the directive on the provision of seat-belts on motor vehicles. This will include a regulation to have seat-belts fitted to certain school buses from a future date. This decision will be considered in consultation with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government and having regard to the commitment in The Road to Safety &ndash; The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002. A consultation paper that set out a wide range of options for enhancing school bus safety was published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 248 and 249 together.</P>
      <P>In framing the education spending Estimates for 2003 I decided that priority would be afforded to specific targeted programmes for tackling educational disadvantage and for primary and post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of An Agreed Programme for Government and the Government's national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS. The NAPS approach for education is based on a continuum of provision, from early childhood through adulthood, with the focus on preventive strategies, targeting and integrated community responses. The strategies and programmes which <Col N="435" /> we are implementing to achieve the NAPS targets, build on the very comprehensive range of measures that have already been put in place to counter educational disadvantage. At school level these include the following:</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;The Early Start Pre-school Pilot Project</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Home/School/Community Liaison Scheme</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;The Support Teacher Project</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;The School Completion Programme</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Youthreach</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Reading Recovery Programme</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;The Needy Books Grant</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;The Book Rental/Loan Schemes</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Library Grants</P>
    <P>The projected current pupil-teacher ratio for primary schools generally is 18.4. The new disadvantage programme in primary schools, Giving Children An Even Break, subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of disadvantage and the Breaking the Cycle pilot project. Over 200 schools, categorised as urban in Giving Children an Even Break, with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement reduced pupil/teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 27:1 in senior classes (third through sixth class). In addition, 32 urban and 121 rural primary schools involved in Breaking the Cycle are being supported through staff allocations to implement a reduced PTR of 15:1.</P>
    <P>The projected current pupil-teacher ratio for second level schools generally is 13.6:1. The criteria, which regulate the allocation of teaching posts to second level schools, provide for an additional allocation of a post to approximately 200 schools which are designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>My Department's strategies have also included widening the educational experience available to students, which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision and meet the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools, by expanding funding for programmes such as:</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Junior Certificate Schools Program (JCSP)</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP)</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Vocational Preparation Training (LPT)</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA).</P>
    <P>The strategies and programmes outlined should make the experience of school more positive and worthwhile for pupils in areas of social or economic deprivation and so help alleviate the problem of educational disadvantage. The issue as to how education may be further enhanced in such areas is being considered in the context of a broad review of our existing initiatives and experience in other jurisdictions will be considered as part of this process.</P>

      <P>All children with special educational needs within the primary school system, including children with ADHD, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs of children with ADHD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>Many children with the condition in question are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and/or special needs assistant services. Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and special needs assistant support is provided where required.</P>

      <P>Section 22 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 allows that any award paid to a survivor of institutional abuse living in Ireland will not be taken into account for the purpose of means tested benefits. This section can only apply to Irish law and can have no bearing on the laws of any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" />As the legislation was proceeding through the Houses of the Oireachtas my predecessor made representations to the Minister for Works and Pensions in Britain seeking assistance in relation to means tested benefits system for claimants to the redress scheme who are resident in Britain. The Minister for Works and Pensions considered that they were not in a position to make any amendment to their legislation to take account of this difficulty.</P>
    <P>I would advise that, with the situation as it stands, people who are making an application to the Residential Institutions Redress Board should seek advice regarding the establishment of trusts which may be of assistance to them in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the reality that some schools have substandard and inadequate accommodation. It is not possible, however, to wipe out in the short-term the cumulative deficit of generations. This Government has acknowledged the historical deficit in educational infrastructure and has set about redressing the situation by allocating substantial funding over recent years. Redressing the situation will take time but the Government is determined to ensure that the needs of schools right across the country are met.</P>
      <P>My Department cannot accept the argument being advanced by the INTO that schools which do not adhere to my Department's planning guidelines are necessarily substandard. These guidelines were drawn up in January, 2000 for the use of architectural design teams where new schools or extensions to existing schools are being planned for the future. The vast majority of the schools listed by the INTO are relatively small buildings and therefore, amenable to considerable improvement with the funds made available to them. Many of the schools listed by the INTO are already in architectural planning.</P>
      <P>My Department must also fund the building of new schools in developing areas where none exist and deal with the provision of new special education facilities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the 2003 capital programme has been published and it includes a new pilot initiative aimed at devolving responsibility to school authorities for the planning and construction phases of improvement works at their schools. Twenty small schools were invited to participate this year. This initiative will be reviewed at the end of 2003 with a view to its expansion, subject to the availability of funding, to other small primary schools in 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" />In order to further aid the long-term planning of capital provision in schools, my Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. A detailed assessment is being undertaken of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature of the proposed nationwide survey, having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a speech made by Mr. Sean Dorgan, Chief Executive of IDA Ireland, at a meeting in Dublin of education chief executive officers from OECD countries. Mr. Dorgan's theme was the challenges ahead for education systems and education chief executive officers. A central element of his presentation was that in the context of globalisation, competition and changing skills needs, education systems must reach out and connect with the national and international social and economic environments in which they operate. Education must respond to the needs of society and the economy if it is to serve the needs of people. I agree with Mr. Dorgan on this approach. It is, and has been for some time, central to the Government's policy on education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to the Irish experience, Mr. Dorgan noted that our education system has worked very well for us as a society and economy to date and <Col N="439" /> that it was a very substantial contributor to our economic progress in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing policy makers now is to ensure that our education system can continue to make that substantial contribution to our development. It is a challenge which I and my Department are happy to take up.</P>

      <P>The review to which the Deputy refers was carried out by the national educational psychological service, NEPS, and covered a total of 788 applications from schools for resource teacher and-or special needs assistant support. The applications in question involved a total of 1,590 individual pupils in respect of whom support was sought.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,590 pupils involved, the review concluded that the applications in respect of 948, 60%, of these pupils conformed with Departmental circulars and the resources sought in these cases have been sanctioned. Deficiencies were identified in the remaining 642 cases. Where possible in such cases, NEPS made a recommendation as to the nature and level of the resources which should be provided and such resources have been sanctioned. However, in some cases, for example, where the school was unable to produce the relevant assessment report, no recommendation for resources could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures which schools are required to follow in applying for the supports in question involve the completion of a standard application form in respect of each individual child and a summary application form covering all the children included in the school's application. The individual pupil form requires particulars of the child's name, address, age, category of disability under circular 8/2002 and the nature and level of the supports being sought in respect of the child. The summary application form requires particulars of the overall number of pupils in respect of whom support is sought, the total supports being sought in respect of those pupils and the total resources already sanctioned at the school to address special needs. Where an application seeks the allocation of resources on a shared basis with other schools, particulars of those schools is sought. The summary application form contains a declaration by the school principal confirming: that the application has been discussed with the parents-guardians of the children and that their consent has been obtained to apply for the support being sought; that the application is sup<Col N="440" /> ported by the chairperson of the school's board of management; that in making the application, full regard has been had to any support services already allocated to the school; that the application is based on relevant assessment reports presented in respect of the pupils in question and available for inspection by the Department; that where a shared post arrangement is proposed, the authorities of the other participating schools are in agreement with the proposal.</P>
    <P>The main deficiencies identified in the NEPS review related to: situations where the level of support sought in respect of individual pupils in a particular disability category did not conform to the support levels identified in the circulars as applicable to the disability category in question; and situations where the relevant assessment reports required to support the application were not available at the school for inspection by NEPS.</P>

      <P>On 27 March 2003 I addressed the annual congress of the Union of Students in Ireland. Among the issues highlighted during my address were: the overwhelming case for attracting more adult learners into higher education and for further strengthening the links between work and education; the policy priority attaching to equitable access to higher education. In particular, I outlined that if we want to break cycles of disadvantage, open up opportunity and optimise our broader economic and social potential, we have to broaden participation in our third level institutions &ndash; support has to be targeted at those most in need and it has to be at a level that really supports those students in third level; in <Col N="441" /> this context, I outlined recent investment in third level access programmes, which had risen to a level of approximately &euro;24 million in 2002 from a base of &euro;508,000 when this Government took Office in 1997. This has enabled the implementation of many of the key recommendations of the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education to be set in train, including the establishment of the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education this year; I raised the issue of how overall funding for student supports, including free fees, can best be used in the context of addressing access issues. In 2002 free fees cost &euro;240 million while total spending on all types of student supports was &euro;382 million &ndash; this funding has to be targeted in a manner that achieves maximum impact from the point of view of value for money and equity of access to third level education; I referred to some of the broader issues that need to be addressed in the strategic development of higher education to ensure that it can meet the broad social and economic challenges that we face &ndash; in particular, I referred to the need for continuing support for investment in our research infrastructure in the context of the development of the knowledge economy; the need to promote excellence in teaching in the third level sector and the need for ongoing dialogue, debate and interaction at all levels to ensure the continuing responsiveness of the higher education sector to the broader needs of our dynamic economy and society.</P>

      <P>The funding arrangements for the recruitment and payment of supervisors were part of the interim arrangements that were prepared and agreed between my Department and the managerial authorities for second level schools to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March 2002.</P>
      <P>The interim arrangements by their nature were flexible and did not specify a pupil-supervisor ratio. It was recognised that the number of supervisors required would vary from school to school depending on local circumstances, including layout, both internal and external. In the circumstances, it was agreed with the managerial authorities that individual school management authorities were best placed to assess the level of cover and the number of persons required on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, responsibility for the making of appointments was a matter for school authorities. As the extent to which supervisors were employed by schools was a matter to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities, schools were not required to return such information to my Department.</P>
      <P>For purposes of the interim arrangements, payments have been made to schools by my Department, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,369 per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum. In addition, funding has also been provided to cover employers' PRSI and holiday pay. Under the contingency arrangements a payment amounting to 5% of supervision costs are being provided to schools to pay for additional support, including secretarial assistance. In aggregate, the sum disbursed to schools to date amounts to some &euro;39 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim arrangements acknowledged that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, schools are currently being asked to forward a statement detailing the moneys received and the moneys paid for both substitution and supervision and a statement certifying that the moneys have been spent for the purposes concerned. Upon receipt of such statements the final cost of the temporary-interim arrangements will <Col N="443" /> be available. The ASTI has recently accepted the offer made on supervision and substitution and schools are currently making arrangements for the implementation of the scheme. It is expected that the scheme will be operational in all schools with effect from 14 April 2003.</P>

Ina theannta sin, tairgítear 20 scoláireachtaí eile ar bhunús iomaíoch do mhic léinn a raibh ag freastal ar scoileanna lán-Gaelacha agus a bhfuil fonn orthu cursa tríú leibhéil a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is léir chomh maith go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh fáil ar chúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge ag daoine ón nGaeltacht, ag daoine eile a chuaigh chuig scoileanna lán-Gaelacha agus daoine ar mian leo cúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge a dhéanamh. Mar sin tá roinnt cúrsaí trí Ghaeilge ar fáil sna hollscoileanna agus sna hinstitiúidí teicneolaíochta faoi láthair. Ina theannta le cursaí sa Ghaeilge féin agus sa Léann Ceilteach faightear cursaí trí Ghaeilge in ábhair eile.</P>

      <P>The 2003 schools building programme was published on 22 January, 2003 and amounted to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition approximately 430 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and of course all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
      <P>An innovative feature of this year's programme is the introduction of a devolved building initiative for small rural primary schools. A total of 20 school communities will benefit from this pilot initiative. The cost of the 2003 building programme published on my Department's web site provides details of the level of commitments to be met in 2003 and the estimated amount available for new projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government <Col N="446" /> will be continued as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government. To meet our objectives I will be looking closely at the potential for using PPP mechanisms and the concept advanced in An Agreed Programme for Government of a multi-annual programme schools' modernisation fund to be financed through the National Development Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey will be placed on a geographic information system, GIS, database. My Department is at present undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of the nationwide survey.</P>
    <P>The proposed standards will be largely based on the planning guidelines for primary and post-primary schools currently used by my Department.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the grant scheme for minor works is set out in the 2003 school building programme which was published in January. The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the <i>per capita</i> element at &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the health, fitness and well-being of children lies in the first instance with their parents or guardians. As their primary carers, it falls to them to ensure that children participate in physical activities as part of their recreation. As Minister for Education and Science, it is my responsibility to ensure that suitable programmes in physical education are provided and implemented in the school curricula at primary and second level.</P>
      <P>A research study published in 1997, which was supported by my Department, showed that almost 85% of 11 to 12 year old children participate in physical activity four or more times a week. The same study found that the child's physical education experience was positively associated with her or his physical self-perception. These figures in relation to activity levels of children are encouraging.</P>
      <P>In primary schools, it is recommended that a minimum of one hour per week should be allocated to physical education. It is further envisaged that an appropriate proportion of the discretionary curriculum time of one hour per week for infant classes and two hours per week for first to sixth classes would be devoted to the teaching of physical education, as circumstances may warrant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant improvements in the levels of direct funding to schools have been made in recent years. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil in 1997 to &euro;105.00 per pupil in 2001-02 and to &euro;111.58 in respect of the 2002-03 school year.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have also been made in the level of funding to secondary schools. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant from &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;256.49 in September 2001, and was further increased to &euro;266.49 in September 2002. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the school services support initiative, secondary schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in 2000 to &euro;88.88 from September 2002 and to &euro;99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.</P>
      <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support services grant was increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brings the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001.</P>
      <P>For a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of up to &euro;236,761, &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to further improve the financial <Col N="449" /> position of primary and secondary schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals under consideration at present to increase the student services charge for the 2003-04 academic year. Section 40 of the Universities Act 1997 provides that a university can determine and charge fees of such amounts for student registration, courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions or any other event, service or publication held or provided at or by, or produced by, the university. The Higher Education Authority can review the fees charged or proposed to be charged by the universities for student registration and courses and for lectures and examinations relating to those courses.</P>

    <P>Arising from such a review, the authority may, following consultation with the Minister, advise the universities on the fees which in its opinion should be charged. In the event that the universities propose an increase in the charge for the 2003-04 academic year, the procedure outlined above will be observed. As the Deputy is aware, the wider issues around student contributions to the cost of third level education are under review at present and any proposal to increase the third level registration fee for the 2003-04 academic <Col N="450" /> year would have to be considered in that wider context.</P>

The legislation provided that the tax relief would only be available for the period 23 January 1996 to 5 April 1998. The tax relief was allowed to lapse in part because of the small numbers of claims being submitted and I have no plans at this time to reintroduce the relief.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware from my replies to previous questions on this subject, Ms Ingrid Betancourt, a candidate in the 2002 Colombian presidential election, was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, on 23 February 2002. She remains in FARC captivity, along with the governor of Antioquia province, the former Governor of Meta province, two former cabinet Ministers, 12 deputies, 47 members of the State security forces, and three US citizens.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that the Colombian authorities continue to be engaged in careful and sensitive moves to secure the release of Ms Betancourt and the other kidnap victims. On 31 January 2003, President Alvaro Uribe established a commission to evaluate the possibility of a humanitarian exchange of hostages held by FARC for FARC prisoners held by the Government. The three-man commission is composed of: Monsignor Luis Augusto Castro, Vice-President of the Colombian Episcopal Conference, Mr. Angelino Garzón, a former Minister for Labour, and Father Darío Echeverri, the Secretary of the Catholic Conciliation Commission.</P>
      <P>The FARC is apparently demanding that the Government instead establish a high-level political group to discuss the question. In addition, it is demanding as a pre-condition for discussions the restoration of the kind of &ldquo;clearance zone&rdquo; ceded to it by President Pastrana in 1998 but which he withdrew in 2002 when he judged that the FARC had abused it.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that the Colombian authorities are acutely conscious of the need to deal with this issue in a sensitive and caring manner, as they strive to secure the release and ensure the safety of their many political colleagues, as well as all the other victims, who are being held hostage.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers. I would regard any action of the type suggested, which has the effect of contaminating the water supply of a community or putting the health of that community at risk, as an extremely serious development. However, to class an instance of sewage pollution as germ warfare is not, in my view, in keeping with the seriousness of the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction against which the Government has taken a very active stand.</P>
      <P>The Government is concerned about the continuing humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Territories, and the damage to the environment that is being caused. As I have previously stated, Israel has clear responsibilities as an occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Among those responsibilities is the requirement that harm to the indigenous population should be minimised and that they should have access to the necessities of life, including fresh water.</P>
      <P>I have asked our representative office in Ramallah for a report on the alleged Israeli action.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 90, 97, 104, 111, 120, 139, 144, 151, 158, 165, 172, 179, 186, 199, 200, 232, 254, 266, 277 and 296 together.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the grant scheme for minor works is set out in the 2003 school building programme which was published in January. The programme shows that &euro;18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant &euro;12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of &euro;3,809 to each school and &euro;5.6 million for payment of the <i>per capita</i> element at &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for this review are being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 92, 99, 106, 113, 120, 132, 146, 153, 160, 167, 174, 181, 188, 197, 202, 230, 256, 279 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>Substantial funding has been made available to schools in recent years to promote the use of information and communications technologies in teaching and learning and to prepare students for participation in the knowledge society.</P>
      <P>However, my Department is subject to budgetary constraints in 2003 and this will limit the amount of ICT capital grants which can be provided to schools this year. My Department will be contacting schools in this regard in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Government remains fully committed to supporting schools in the promotion of ICT skills and applications in teaching and learning. To this end, the National Centre for Technology in Education is currently conducting a nationwide census of all schools on behalf of my Department in order to determine progress achieved in meeting ICT needs and objectives as well as resource requirements going forward. The findings of this census, which will be available by mid-year, will inform future policy and funding priorities in this area having regard to available budgetary resources.</P>

      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has statutory responsibility for advising me on curricular matters. I understand that when the current syllabi for leaving certificate English were developed, the considered advice of the NCCA was to provide two syllabi &ndash; at ordinary level and higher level.</P>

      <P>It is for the management authorities of individual schools to decide whether to seek approval for the leaving certificate applied.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate applied is one of the options of the revised senior cycle structure. Each year, all second level schools are invited to apply or reapply to provide the programme. Schools which express an interest in introducing the programme are provided with briefing and teacher in-service support by the leaving certificate applied support service.</P>
      <P>Support for second level schools in the free education scheme which introduce the leaving certificate applied includes: an annual resource grant calculated on the basis of &euro;158.72, £125, per leaving certificate applied student; grants for the purchase of necessary equipment and an enhanced teacher allocation.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate applied is currently being offered in 261 second level schools. A further 40 schools have indicated their intention to introduce the programme in September 2003.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the report of the action group on access to third level education; and the plans he has to implement the 78 recommendations contained therein.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10453/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The action group's report was published in July 2001. Responsibility for implementation of many of these recommendations lies with my Department. Some recommendations require action on the part of other Departments. On a wider level, the recommendations call for action on the part of third level institutions, schools and community and voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>To date a number of measures have been taken by my Department in response to the main recommendations in the report. The most significant spending recommendation of the group concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>Following a review early in 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and to &euro;1,600 for students residing within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; of &euro;1,490 and &euro;596 respectively, for eligible students, on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance for partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged <Col N="688" /> families. Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, administered the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million. ADM Limited, which is continuing to administer the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.</P>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>I have given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority. My Department is engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority with a view to bringing the national office into operation in time for the academic year 2003-04. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>
    <P>The action group recommended that the various interventions at early childhood, primary and second level to address disadvantage be reviewed by the educational disadvantage committee. To date the work of the committee has addressed many issues related to the integration and cohesion of service provision to students in greatest need. In addition, the outcomes from the educational disadvantage forum have clearly signalled the need for an integrated and comprehensive policy framework for educational inclusion and for more coherent structures to be <Col N="689" /> established, at both policy and operational levels. A report on the deliberations and discussions of the forum has recently been presented to me.</P>
    <P>Some of the action group's recommendations relate to the achieving of targets for access to third level education, over the period of the national development plan, in relation to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability.</P>
    <P>I am committed to progressing these, and other, recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure of office as Minister for Education and Science. In this context, the Deputy will wish to be aware that when the current Government first came into office in 1997, spending on third level access measures totalled &euro;508,000. In 2002, this had risen to &euro;23.98 million which represents, by any standards, a quantum leap in committed resources. The 2003 provision is &euro;26 million.</P>
    <P>My Department is also conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. Some of the issues being examined, such as the reform of student supports, are issues in relation to which the action group on access to third level education made a number of recommendations.</P>

      <P>My Department has considered the case put forward by St. George's national school for the need to expand provision at the school. While we acknowledge that additional accommodation will be required to meet the growing needs of the area, the extent of accommodation required has not been finally determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" />The provision of the additional accommodation which will be required is contingent on the level of funding available under the capital budgetary allocations for 2004 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology was established by the Government in June 2001, with the responsibility of promoting excellence in research in the three broad disciplines of science, engineering and technology. The emphasis is on innovative and original research, which is aimed at generating knowledge.</P>
      <P>In 2002, 219 postgraduate scholarships were made, which involves expenditure of &euro;10.9 million up to 2005. A further 58 basic research grants were awarded by the council, which will involve expenditure of &euro;7.9 million up to 2005. The council also launched a post-doctoral fellowship scheme in November 2002, and awards under this scheme will be announced in 2003. The total expenditure under the council in 2002 was &euro;4.486 million. Its allocation for 2003 provides for a significant increase in expenditure, to &euro;10.5 million.</P>
      <P>Within the available resources, my Department will continue to support the work of the council as it seeks to generate new knowledge in the areas of science, engineering and technology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education Act 1998 obliges schools to identify and provide for the edu<Col N="691" /> cational needs of all students, including those with a disability or other special educational needs. This involves the identification of those students who will need additional support if they are to benefit from the curriculum. This should take place within the context of the school's overall plan for assessment, planning and record keeping.</P>
      <P>Any child or young person who has difficulty in accessing the curriculum needs an individual education plan, IEP, also sometimes referred to as an individual profile and learning programme, IPLP. IEPs range in complexity from short-term strategies aimed at overcoming transient difficulties to detailed plans encompassing all areas of the curriculum. In general, IEPs focus on the extra programmes, methodologies and resources that some students need in addition to their entitlement to the general curriculum.</P>
      <P>IEPs should be developed collaboratively by all the adults who are involved on a regular basis with the student who is the subject of the plan. International research on the effectiveness of IEPs has consistently emphasised the value of the support of, and contributions by, parents. This process of bringing together all those who know and care about a student is as valuable as the IEP itself. My Department has consistently recommended this process and continues to support it in published guidelines and through programmes of continuing professional development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 to 215, inclusive, and 217 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department that all teachers working with children with special educational needs, including children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, will have relevant training. In recent years, there has been a major increase in the level of additional teaching resources made available to schools to cater for children with special educational needs, including children with ADHD. These additional staffing appointments bring with them the need for additional training in all aspects of special educational provision and this is being addressed on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Through the colleges of education, my Department funds a range of postgraduate and induction programmes which are designed to provide the additional knowledge and skills that teachers may require in catering for the children in question. Local courses are also provided through the education centres network and these include courses specifically on ADHD. In addition, my Department recently provided funding for 135 teachers who participated in an e-learning summer course on ADHD. This innovative course was made available throughout the months of July and August 2002.</P>
      <P>The existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training, primary, in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs. Students undertaking the bachelor of education degree or the graduate diploma in education, primary teaching, in St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate Colleges of Education now follow a course module on special education. This module covers the broad range of issues in special education.</P>
      <P>In the Church of Ireland and Coláiste Mhuire, Marino, colleges of education, particular attention is paid to special needs and learning difficulties arising from various factors under &ldquo;method studies&rdquo; in english and mathematics. In the case of the Froebel College of Education, students have a course module under &ldquo;remedial work&rdquo;. This deals with learning difficulties arising from special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to clarify the position regarding educational assessments for the Deputy. The general aim of the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, is to assist all students <Col N="693" /> to develop to their potential and to maximise the benefits of their educational experiences, with particular regard to those having special educational needs. At present, practically all post-primary schools and approximately 1,950 national schools are served by the NEPS.</P>
    <P>In those schools served by the NEPS, the educational psychologists take referrals of children suspected of having ADHD. They work in collaboration with teachers and parents and use agreed diagnostic criteria in order to identify children with these conditions. In most cases, they refer such children on to clinical services for further advice, as it is usually necessary for full diagnosis and support to be provided by a multi-disciplinary team. The educational psychologists continue to provide advice for the teachers of children with ADHD on educational programmes and behavioural management.</P>
    <P>The special educational needs of children with ADHD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. Many children with the conditions in question are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and/or special needs assistant services. Where the level of the disorder is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and special needs assistant support is provided where required. It is my intention to continue to build on these developments so as to ensure that all children, including children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, receive the support they require.</P>
    <P>My Department has no plans to provide specific education mediators who would be responsible for liaising with parents of children with ADHD and EBH in the situations mentioned by the Deputy. It would be expected that, where difficulties arise, the relevant professionals working with such a pupil would consult with the family and school in arriving at a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that the matter of suspension and discipline is generally considered in the context of the school code of discipline. Guidelines have issued to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in this area. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
    <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair <Col N="694" /> and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
    <P>Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, a board of management of a school, with the agreement of the patron, shall publish and provide the policy of the school concerning expulsion of students, subject to the proviso that any such expulsion may be appealed to the secretary general of my Department under section 29(1)(a) of the aforementioned Act.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student, suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than 20 days in an academic year, or expels a student from the school. An independent appeals mechanism is in place to deal with section 29 appeals. Under the Act, an appeal must be dealt with within 30 days, with a provision for a 14 day extension to this period, if required. As a matter of course, home tuition hours are sanctioned as an interim education provision while a section 29 appeal is proceeding. Where an appeal is upheld, the secretary general may give such directions to the board of management of a school as appear expedient for the purpose of remedying the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department introduced revised arrangements during the current school year for processing applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support. Under the former system, there were no set application or allocation dates for this support. Given the significant expansion in the level of resources being allocated for special education purposes, the lack of set application and allocation dates posed significant administrative difficulties for my Department and the lack of clarity in this regard also posed concerns for schools.</P>
      <P>Resource teaching and special needs assistant support is now allocated to schools on a term basis. I am satisfied that the new term-based approach is bringing greater certainty and efficiency to the allocation process. This has been generally welcomed by schools who now have a clearer indication of the timing of allocations and can plan accordingly.</P>

      <P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

      <P>The extension project at Maynooth post-primary school is currently at stage 3 of architectural planning. It is included in section 7 of the building programme for 2003.

      <P>The 2003 schools building programme has been published. Full details of projects are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the budgetary allocation it was not possible to include further projects in 2003. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on applications that could not be included in this year's programme. Schools should use their devolved grant to deal with urgent health and safety works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of measures to improve teacher supply has been introduced in recent years. The intake to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically. Since 1999 over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the undergraduate <Col N="707" /> B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</P>
      <P>Since 1996 postgraduate diploma courses have been run by the colleges of education to further increase the number of B.Ed graduates. In February 2002, 461 students commenced the postgraduate course and they will graduate in June 2003. A further postgraduate course commenced in February with a maximum of 460 places available on the course and will conclude in May or June 2004. A total of 1,633 students completed the postgraduate course between 1996 and 2002.</P>
      <P>The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-7. At present there are 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education.</P>
      <P>Between 2002 and 2003 it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>My Department is examining the feasibility of providing a modular type course for second level trained teachers currently teaching in primary schools who hold the higher diploma in education and the necessary academic requirement in Irish. This proposal will be discussed with the colleges of education in the near future. It would, if implemented, enable these teachers to become fully qualified primary teachers.</P>
      <P>As well as increasing the number of student places in the colleges of education, my Department has introduced a range of initiatives to address the current shortage of qualified teachers. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who study Irish to honours level as an academic subject are now recognised as fully qualified. In addition, primary degree holders with the higher diploma in education are now paid on the trained salary scale in respect of temporary teaching service.</P>
      <P>Teachers trained in EU countries are also paid at the trained rate for up to five years pending attainment of the necessary competence in Irish. Teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department are granted the same provisional recognition as EU trained teachers. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who successfully complete the three year Montessori course in St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, that is recognised by the NCEA, and those who attain the Montessori qualification on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College are recognised as fully qualified for substitute teaching. Such teachers are also fully recognised for teaching service in certain categories of special schools and classes where Irish is not a requirement on the curriculum. Fully qualified teachers trained outside the State <Col N="708" /> are also fully recognised to teach in these categories of schools and classes.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures are contributing significantly to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. I am committed to ensuring that the existing shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated within the next two to three years.</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for the national educational psychological service conducted a detailed examination of the need for psychological services in primary and post-primary schools. As a result of its findings, it recommended that 200 psychologists are needed, of whom about 180 would be in NEPS and the remainder elsewhere in the educational system. The planning group also recommended that this target should be achieved over a period of five years, beginning during the school year 1999-2000 and that the psychological service should gradually be expanded to all primary and post-primary schools during that time. The Government accepted the group's report and decided in early 1999 that the recommendations should be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NEPS was established on 1 September 1999 with the 43 psychologists already employed in my Department. Over the past few years it has <Col N="709" /> expanded gradually on a national basis in accordance with the Government's decision. The recruitment of additional psychologists has involved the organisation of two competitions over the past few years through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. There are now 120 psychologists in NEPS. Recruitment is set to continue until the target number of staff has been achieved.</P>
    <P>During this development phase those schools that do not yet have direct access to a psychological service from NEPS can avail of the scheme for commissioning private assessments. This scheme is administered by NEPS pending the full expansion of its service to all schools.</P>

      <P>At primary level the ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in 1996-97 to 19.0:1 in the 2001-02 school year while at second level the ratio has fallen from 16.0:1 to 14.0:1 in the same period.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 to 263, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I intend to ensure that all children, including children with ASDs, receive education appropriate to their needs. All children with special education needs within the primary school system, including children with ASDs, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs of children with ASD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>Many children at primary school level, with disorders on the autistic spectrum, are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of resource teachers and/or special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities receive enhanced capitation grants and operate at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. Special needs assistant support is also provided where required. At present there are 115 such classes for pupils with autism in the primary system. This includes three special classes for pupils with Asperger syndrome which is on the autistic spectrum.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates additional resources to individual second-level schools to cater for special needs pupils enrolled in those schools. Applications for resources are referred to the national educational psychological service and each case is considered on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seven facilities in the State delivering educational services on a pilot project basis using alternative educational methods for teaching chil<Col N="715" /> dren on the autistic spectrum; three are CABAS facilities. The CABAS teaching method employs a comprehensive application of behaviour analysis to schooling approach. These facilities together with a number of educational services for children with autism in other settings such as special schools, special classes and children integrated in mainstream schools are currently being evaluated by my Department's inspectorate. It is expected that the evaluation process will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on autism is lengthy and complex. It contains approximately 180 individual recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates and early intervention, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services and the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues.</P>
    <P>The scope of these recommendations is such as to require a multifaceted response. My Department's key focus to date has been on progressing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with autism in line with the task force's recommendations.</P>
    <P>A key development on the structural front has been the decision to establish the national council for special education. It will have a local area presence and will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including persons with autism. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. Recently a chief executive was appointed to the council and the objective is that it will be vested shortly.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to confirm the rights and entitlement of persons with disabilities, including persons with autism. The objective of this legislation, which will be based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, will be to provide a statutory guarantee of education services for persons with disabilities, including persons with autism. The Bill will provide a clear and enforceable statement in law of the rights of children and adults who, because of disabilities, including autism, have special educational needs and will propose to put in place a statutory structure, which will guarantee their education. Provision will be made in the Bill for a formal appeals mechanism. My objective would be to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Quest>further to the recommendation in the report of the task force on autism that his Department urgently reviews the practice of attaching explanatory notes regarding special arrangements in examinations to the candidate's certificate of results given the statement in the report that flagging of results reduces the value of results achieved and undermines their status; the progress achieved in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>On foot of a Government decision, I formally established the State Examinations Commission on 6 March 2003. The commission now has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. I am aware of the concerns of the task force in this area. However, in policy terms the measures introduced were implemented to enhance the inclusiveness of the examinations system, while maintaining its integrity and transparency. Under the new system, it is open to a student with special needs to apply to have part of an examination waived, and to be marked out of 100% on the balance.</P>
      <P>Where an element of an examination is waived so that the purpose regarding that element of the examination has not been met, or where the method of examining has been significantly altered, the Department's guidelines provide for the presence of an explanatory note on the candidate's certificate of results. This note is to the effect that &ldquo;all elements of the examinations were assessed except the xxxx element&rdquo;. This option is considered preferable to that in use in many other jurisdictions under which either the special need or nature of the arrangement provided is noted on the certificate, or no special accommodations are made. The use of an explanatory note facilitates reasonable accommodation to be made for inclusion of students with special needs, while ensuring the overall approach is transparent, valid and defensible in assessment terms.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for education provision for pupils with special needs, including those with autism, from age four to 18 years. Responsibility for service provision for young adults over 18 with special needs lies with the appropriate health authority. The report of the task force on autism set up by my Department contains approximately 180 recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identi<Col N="717" /> fying prevalence rates and early intervention, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services and the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues.</P>
      <P>My Department's key focus to date has been on progressing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development of services for persons with autism in line with the task force's recommendations. A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the National Council for Special Education.

      <Quest>the amount awarded to each school in County Cork under the information technology grant scheme each year since the scheme was introduced; the amount that has been awarded or that is to be awarded in the current year; when he expects such unpaid grants to be paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Substantial funding has been made available to schools in recent years to promote the use of information and communications technologies in teaching and learning and to prepare students for participation in the knowledge society. Information technology grants were issued in two phases under two separate initiatives. Payments were made in May 1998 and December 1999 under the Schools IT2000 initiative and further grants were issued in December 2001 and May 2002 under the blueprint for the future of ICT in education. Details of relevant payments to primary schools in County Cork have been forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, my Department is subject to budgetary constraints in 2003 and this will limit the amount of ICT capital grants which can be provided to schools this year. My Department will be contacting schools in this regard in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Government remains fully committed to supporting schools in the promotion of ICT skills and applications in teaching and learning. To this end, the National Centre for Technology in Education is currently conducting a nationwide census of all schools on behalf of my Department in order to determine progress achieved in meeting ICT needs and objectives as well as resource requirements going forward. The findings of this census, which will be available by mid-year, will inform future policy and funding priorities in this area having regard to available budgetary resources.</P>

      <Quest>if a procedure will be investigated in Archbishop Ryan school, Lucan, whereby registration for the school takes place in a listed priority (details supplied), to determine if such a priority list is discriminatory; if an obligation exists for the State to find a place within a reasonable distance for a five year old child of parents who are not Catholic or Travellers, whose child has been turned down for a place at this school and who is also not high enough up on the list for the local Educate Together and Gaelscoileananna; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64(1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she or he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
      <P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the education Act. In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000, which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from dis<Col N="734" /> criminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</P>
    <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of. In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of the inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.</P>

      <P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64(1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she or he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
      <P>Pupils and parents enjoy a number of legal rights regarding their choice of school for primary education. These derive from the Constitution, legislation and my Department's rules. Statutory rights to choice of school derive from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting &ldquo;the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, section 15 (2)(<i>d</i>) of the 1998 Act provides that a board of management of a primary school shall &ldquo;publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school . . . and ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are <Col N="735" /> respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</P>
    <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.

      <P>A review of student support provisions is being undertaken within my Department, with the aim of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. I anticipate that the review outcomes will be submitted to me in the very near future and when I have had an opportunity to consider <Col N="736" /> its contents, I will bring the matter to the Cabinet. Following consideration by the Government, I will make a determination in relation to publication and appropriate arrangements for consultation.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House previously, I am mindful of the need to avoid, as far as possible, uncertainty for students and their parents.

      <P>In 1998, my Department established the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI. Since its launch, awards of &euro;605 million have been made. The cumulative impact of PRTLI to date has been significant, including new research funding to 15 third level institutions in total, including six institutes of technology; nine research centres completed in 2002, in addition to the four completed in 2001; 62 new and expanded research programmes have been established; 40 new inter-institutional programmes-initiatives have been established; and over 2,000 peer reviewed publications to date arising from PRTLI funded programmes, over 2.5 years, representing a 250% increase in output in those funded areas compared to the previous period.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that this dedicated programme of expenditure is only one of the available funding mechanisms within the third level sector. Other agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health Research Bureau also fund specific initiatives within the sector. Within the available resources, my Department will continue to support research as a key priority for the generation of the necessary skills to serve the knowledge society.</P>
      <P>The Government remains fully committed to the PRTLI, notwithstanding the pause in capital funding under cycle 3. The role of the programme in the overall architecture of the education system and the knowledge economy is recognised and my Department is working closely with the Higher Education Authority in seeking to maximise this contribution into the future.</P>

      <P>In April last year, the then Minister of Education in Northern Ireland, along with my <Col N="740" /> predecessor, announced the establishment of the first ever all island centre of excellence for children with autistic spectrum disorders. The centre is to be established at the former St. Joseph's Training School at Middletown, County Armagh. Proposals for the centre envisage the following:</P>
      <P>a diagnostic support and educational assessment service for children and young people referred to the centre with a suspected or confirmed autistic spectrum disorder; a training and advisory service for parents, teachers and other professionals; an individual learning centre; an autism research, dissemination and information service; and residential accommodation with care staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> The centre may in time be asked to broaden its remit beyond the area of autism to encompass other special needs area, including dyslexia. As the legal formalities relating to the project have yet to be completed, it is not possible for me to comment on a timescale at this point.</P>

The principal of the school, who has been contacted in this matter, has indicated that no such submission has been made by him.</P>
      <P>However, I can confirm that the relevant VEC has made application for additional support services for a number of children with disabilities in its area, including children from the school in question. This application is currently being considered by my Department and I am hopeful that a response will issue shortly.</P>

On the basis of the budgetary allocation it was not possible to include any further projects in 2003.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new disadvantage programme, Giving Children An Even Break, was launched in 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. Over 75% of primary schools took part in the survey. Indicators such as unemployment, medical card possession and rented local authority housing have been found in the past to be reliable indicators of levels of disadvantage in schools.</P>
      <P>The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. All of the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage were invited to participate in Giving Children An Even Break.</P>
      <P>The programme subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual &lsquo;at risk' pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>Over 2,300 participating schools in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>Rural schools, with the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage, have been allocated the services of a teacher/co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. The schools are also benefiting from the allocation of supplementary grant aid towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. My Department is giving consideration to appropriate in-career development to support the work of the co-ordinators.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the programme it was indicated that it would operate for three years and be subject to external evaluation. Its future will be determined in the light of the outcome of the evaluation and in the context of a broader review of the range of initiatives to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was launched in 1996 and the aim of the project was to discriminate positively in favour of schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds. The five-year pilot phase of this scheme ended on 30 June 2001.</P>
      <P>All schools included in Breaking the Cycle are now included in the new disadvantage programme, Giving Children An Even Break and will retain their existing entitlements under the former scheme. The issue of whether this initiative requires a dedicated national co-ordinator is being considered in the context of a broader review of the range of initiatives to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2002, my Department introduced the school completion programme, SCP, which is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving incorporating the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives, mainly the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI. The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sites for participation in the programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of <Col N="744" /> pupil retention rates at second level using my Department's post-primary pupils database. Based on this analysis and having regard to the funding available, 82 project sites &ndash; 65 new project sites together with the existing 17 ESLI projects &ndash; were selected to participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 82 school completion projects, my Department is continuing to support 53 second level schools, which were funded previously under the stay in school retention initiative but were not selected for the project strand of this programme on this occasion. These 53 schools, which includes the school referred to by the Deputy, will be supported under the stay in school retention strand of SCP up to 31 August 2005. My Department is currently reviewing the funding of the 53 second level schools under the stay in school retention strand of the school completion programme and all schools will be notified of the outcome shortly.</P>

      <P>The position is that my Department in conjunction with consultants are re-examining the level of works necessary to stabilise the cliff at Dock Road. Any works proposed for the stabilisation will be undertaken so as not to interfere with the nesting habitat of the kittiwake colony. If possible, a scheme will be designed to improve the nesting conditions for the birds. I have allocated funding in respect of cliff stabilisation works at the Dock Road and Island Road this year.</P>

    <P>In regard to the work at Island Lane, Waterford County Council has advised that, as this <Col N="748" /> work is reinstatement and repair work, planning permission is not required. Negotiations are currently in progress with contractors with a view to commencing the works next month. It is hoped to have the Island Lane works completed in early summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In April 2000, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,711 new residential places were required to meet the identified needs for these services. The annual report is compiled from the regional datasets provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. A delay in the submission of one regional dataset meant it was not possible to compile the information which forms the basis for the annual report. This was the case in relation to both 2001 and 2002. The 2001 report from the national intellectual disability database is currently with the printers and will be published within the next few weeks. The 2002 report will be available by early summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the impact of the 2000 development programme is reflected in the 2001 data, this data does not reflect a significant reduction in the number of persons seeking residential services in particular in the period 2002 to 2006. The 2002 data, which will reflect the impact of the 2001 development programme are currently being collated and validated. In April 2000, information <Col N="750" /> from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 912 new day places were required to meet the identified needs for these services. The 2001 data indicates that a similar number of new day places are required over the period 2002 to 2006. It should be noted that in addition to the day places required to meet the needs of those awaiting placement in the services as mentioned above, the additional funding allocated in recent years also provided for those requiring a change in day services. These include young people leaving school and requiring rehabilitative training places or those moving from rehabilitative training to other areas of the services such as sheltered work, activation or services for older people.</P>
    <P>Despite the very significant investment in services in recent years, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. A review of the waiting lists between 1997 and 1999, conducted by the Health Research Board and published in the 1999 annual report from the national intellectual disability database, showed that while 269 people from the original waiting list of 1,439 received full time residential services in the period, the waiting list had grown by an additional 238 places, that is, 507 had joined the waiting list in the period. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population. The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's query regarding estimated average waiting times for persons for whom a need is identified, I cannot give specific commitments for 2004 and onwards in relation to any element of the health services as these issues form part of the annual Estimates and budget discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services was published in March 2002. My Department is currently supporting the implementation of a key recommendation of the report relating to human resource planning through the provision of an additional 30 training places in clinical psychology. This represents a doubling in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, following a request received from my Department, the director of the health boards executive has undertaken to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards to develop an approach to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the joint <Col N="752" /> review group. This will be undertaken in the light of service imperatives, funding priorities and relevant developments such as the recommendations on investment in education and training included in the action plan for people management published in November 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force on autism, which was established by the Department of Education and Science, has put forward a range of recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services, the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues. The scope of the task force's recommendations is such as to require a multi-faceted response involving educational and health care inputs. The task force's recommendations are currently being considered by both Departments.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant investment in both health related and educational supports for persons with autism in recent years. Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated by my Department to services for persons with autism or intellectual disability in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with autism or intellectual disability. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with autism and those with an intellectual disability. In particular &euro;14.6 million has been invested by my Department in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. <Col N="754" /> This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school-going age. The health boards have been developing regional diagnostic and assessment services and these are at varying stages of development. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the detailed information requested by the Deputy and it will be forwarded to him as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>Work on the strategic rail review was carried out by a consultancy consortium led by Booz Allen Hamilton. The consultancy costs were &euro;649,558, including VAT, and the printing of the report has so far cost &euro;45,115, VAT exempt. The review provides a framework within which the Government can implement and prioritise an ambitious and realistic programme for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector in Ireland. It lays the foundation on which we can revitalise the railways and plan a modern and efficient transport system for the benefit of this and future generations.</P>
      <P>The review contains a recommended investment strategy that has been broadly endorsed by the Government. While this strategy in effect constitutes the priorities for action, the Government, in adopting the review, recognised that over the 20 year period flexibility and adaptability would be required to take account of emerging land use and settlement policies. Accordingly, it is recognised that in the light of developing business for both passenger and freight traffic it is possible that the rail investment priorities might vary over time.</P>
      <P>I have already announced that I will be establishing an implementation group that will be charged with rigorously monitoring the implementation of the rail investment programme and reporting to me quarterly on progress.</P>

These buses have improved the quality and reliability of the fleet, as well as providing for increased services. In 2003, Bus Átha Cliath is planning to purchase a further 78 new buses.

      <P>The strategic rail review, which I published last week, provides a strategic framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland. The consultants who carried out the review considered over 150 submissions received from groups and individuals in various parts of the country during the public consultation phase. The south Sligo rail study, which was submitted to the Department in 2002, was considered by the consultants during the course of their analysis. The schemes evaluated by the consultants were selected on the basis of consideration of, among other things, existing studies and reports, reasonableness in terms of potential patronage, use of existing networks, population catchment and consistency with national policy, such as the national spatial strategy. The south Sligo scheme, as well as others listed in the report, were considered by the consultants not to be so significant as to warrant a special analysis at this stage. The consultants did recognise, however, that circumstances could change which would make a revisitation of such schemes appropriate at some time in the future.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> I am informed by the Garda authorities that the information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of prosecutions and convictions for the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor in licensed premises and clubs to persons who are already intoxicated is not readily available. It could only be obtained by means of the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>

      <Quest>the criteria used to determine the 2003 non-national roads allocations to county councils which gave increases or decreases (details supplied) to county councils over the 2002 figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In determining the annual non-national road grant allocations, the objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs. This process is guided by a range of criteria, including road pavement conditions, traffic volumes, length of road network and suitability, eligibility in relation to EU co-financing and special development needs.</P>
      <P>In addition, non-national road grants include a number of grant categories such as: discretionary maintenance and improvement and restoration maintenance grants which are block grants and predominantly mileage based; restoration improvement grants which are based on multiannual restoration programmes submitted by local authorities to the Department; and other categories which are project specific such as EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme and the grant category non-national roads to support housing and other development.</P>
      <P>The last category applies to 15 local authorities. It is the variation in allocations under this category in 2003 compared to 2002 which is largely responsible for the increases and decreases referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>This multiplicity of criteria, together with the impact from year to year of projects as they advance from commencement to completion, necessarily entails divergence in the annual levels of allocation between local authorities.</P>

      <P>Revised requirements regarding public notice of intention to make a planning application were established by part 4 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001. These include a requirement to give notice of intention to make the application in an approved newspaper, and the erection or fixing of a site notice or site notices in accordance with detailed requirements set out in the regulations. The regulations also require each planning authority to publish weekly lists of planning applications received by them.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied these requirements provide reasonable and adequate publicity around proposed developments. It would be inappropriate to add to them at this time either in relation to the type of development mentioned in the Deputy's question or otherwise.</P>

      <Col N="763" />A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out recently. In light of this, and in view of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised.</P>
    <P>In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme my concern was to ensure that resources should be focused where the need is greatest. In line with this payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued. This was done because people who had been previously unemployed often find work opportunities either at home or <Col N="764" /> abroad during the summer months. Participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to an unemployment payment, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is in the first year of a four year primary degree and will be on a break during the summer period between academic years. He is not entitled to payment of the allowance for this period.</P>
    <P>We have ensured, in a situation where priorities had to be set and choices made, that the position of people in the greatest need of assistance under the scheme has been protected.</P>
