      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Cheann Comhairle as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an Bhille seo. Is fíor nach bhfuil sé cosúil le Billí eile ar chuir mé fáilte rompu le déanaí. Tá dhá rud i gceist sa Bhille seo. Tá sé ag déileáil le scaradh na ndaoine atá fostaithe ag Aer Lingus. Chomh maith leis sin, tá sé i gceist deis a thabhairt don Rialtas Aer Lingus a dhíol do dhaoine agus chomhlachtaí príomháideacha. Is trua é go bhfuil an Rialtas ag dul síos an treo sin. Tá sé scanallach go bhfuil an tAire ag cur leis na ráitis atá déanta aige le tamall anuas. Tá sé ag iarraidh fáil réidh le hAer Lingus as portfolio an Rialtais.</P>
      <P>Níl mé sásta cuidiú nó tacú leis an bpríomháidiú seo atá á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas ar chomhlachtaí Stáit. Glacaim leis go bhfuil gá le scaradh. Ba chóir go ndéanfadh an Rialtas admháil go bhfuil an fhoireann tar éis athrú iomlán a dhéanamh ar Aer Lingus. Níl mé sásta glacadh leis an Bhille seo, áfach, mar go bhfuil sé mar chuid den ionsaí ar chomhlachtaí Stáit, atá tar éis a lán airgid a thabhairt don chiste Stáit chun go mbeimid in ann maireachtáil go dtí seo. Smaoinigh ar an méid airgid atá curtha isteach sa chóras Stáit ó bunaíodh iad. Chomh luath agus atá fadhb éigin ann, nó a fheiceann an Rialtas go bhfuil, fiú, brabach le fáil as seo, tá sé ag iarraidh é a dhíol.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with the purpose of this Bill. I have no problem with the first part of it, which relates to the employee share ownership plan. Those who have turned around Aer Lingus by working non-stop deserve recognition and reward for Aer Lingus's miraculous recovery. Aer Lingus and its associated companies have contributed to the Exchequer, ensured that we have had a national airline over the years to provide for the tourism industry and contributed to the economic recovery and boom in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" />I will not support a move towards privatisation. We should not allow the private sector to acquire a controlling interest in a State company. The State should not be allowed to sell the family treasures, but that is what the Minister intends to do to Aer Lingus and other companies in the long run. It is an absolute disgrace. It does not augur well for the future. We should ensure that public services are retained. I accept that there is a need for greater efficiency and modernisation, but the staff of Aer Lingus have shown that they are well capable of modernising. The fact that they have turned around the company in such a short time is a miracle. It is a testament to the Aer Lingus workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said it is a good idea to split Aer Rianta in three. The private sector will not be interested in acquiring Aer Rianta if has been divided in such a manner. Will Aer Lingus be based in three places even though it is a separate company? Will there be a Shannon Airport Aer Lingus and a Cork Airport Aer Lingus? The issues of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are linked and have been from day one. They are not tied as a company, but they are tied because airports have been the backbone of the growth of Aer Lingus. The two companies have worked well together.</P>
      <P>If we allow the sale to go ahead, we will lose something that is vital for this country, as an island nation, to have and to control. If one wants, one can allow other players into the Irish market. We have already allowed other companies to use our airports, etc. Many people have cited the example of Ryanair, but that should not detract from the fact that an island nation needs a national airline. The Minister is preparing the way for privatisation. That, in itself, is wrong. It is based on a right-wing, short-term ideology. It should be rejected out of hand.</P>
      <P>If one examines this Bill and the Minister's other pronouncements, one will find that they have all been disastrous. The enactment of this Bill will be a disaster in the long-term. The Minister's plans for Aer Rianta, the Red Cow roundabout and the Dublin Port tunnel have been disastrous. It has emerged today that his idiotic plans for the M50 at Carrickmines are equally disastrous. The Minister is not listening to the people. He should listen to those who are experts in this field because they understand where the future of the country lies. Does the Minister want to turn this country into a limited company? Why not sell off the Parliament and privatise the ushers outside? Let us not have them as public servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party would have poor share options.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are growing. We have potential, having turned matters around. It is Fine Gael which has poor share options, since it is going backwards.</P>
      <P>We have seen one disaster after another. There is the current battle at Carrickmines, and an EU report mentioned on RTE last night criticised the basis of the EPA report. That was another debacle where we must wait until we eventually come to the reasonable position of going around Carrickmines Castle. It has been shown that it can be done.</P>
      <P>In this case, Aer Lingus has shown that it is capable of being run as a public company. It can be profitable and yet, at the same time, ensure that its employees and stakeholders benefit. If the Minister sells it off, we will not be stakeholders and will have no control. The workers will suffer in the long run. All other airlines, which are private companies, do not have the State to look after their needs. There has been major criticism of the other model that the Government seems to be moving towards, that of Ryanair, which does not recognise unions and whose employees must work long hours. There is much more in the standards and working conditions. Pilots, hostesses and other employees have complained, and that is why we have had a major strike in Ryanair.</P>
      <P>The ethos and <i>raison d'être</i> is to look after number one. In Ryanair's case, that is Michael O'Leary and its shareholders. In the case of Aer Lingus, and other public companies, it the public interest. That can sometimes mean that it will be unprofitable one year and profitable the next. I cannot figure out the logic of the Minister's idea that we, as an island nation, should sell off one of the ways in which we can get off this island and attract tourists to it. It is a brand name that is known and supported by Irish people abroad specifically because it is an Irish company owned and benefiting the State and the Exchequer. If the Minister sells it off, they will go to every other airline. Many people in Ireland prefer to use Aer Lingus on that basis. If it is no longer a State company, they will switch, and we will lose it, since the company will collapse, with ramifications for those working for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the company remains in public hands and that we recognise the great strides taken by Aer Lingus's workers in turning around a loss of &euro;139 million in 2001 to a profit last year. We are selling off a profitable company which will probably make a greater profit again this year. The predictions are great for the coming years, yet we are selling off a company that can pay into the Exchequer on an ongoing basis. It is not the once-off treasure trove that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, would <Col N="272" />love. Retaining the company will ensure that we benefit in the longterm. The company has triumphed at a time when others collapsed and went to the wall. The organ grinders in this Government, the Progressive Democrats, are telling us that the public sector is not efficient. Aer Lingus is proof that it is efficient and can remain so.</P>
    <P>The truth is that those in the public sector are the people who have built up Ireland and, though they deserve their rewards, have not been getting them. That is one of the stark results of the Celtic Tiger which we can see absolutely blatantly. The workers have not benefited to the same degree as the bosses. However, in this case workers who have not benefited so far will not do so in the long run. I concede that the Minister is introducing measures to allow them to benefit through the employee share ownership plan. However, in the long-term they will lose out because, if the Government has its way, the company will no longer be in public hands.</P>
    <P>It is all part of the Minister's transportation plan. He wants to privatise everything and ensure that transport is not in public hands. He wants to privatise Dublin Bus and the roads, and that is why we have tolls everywhere, with more planned. He will probably impose another toll on the port tunnel when it is open. He wants to privatise Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta &ndash; the whole lot. As I said, why not privatise this building, bring in Michael O'Leary and let him run the Government? That seems to be what is happening in the background.</P>
    <P>Where is the logic in selling this off? The Dublin Government is selling off something. Another Government might see that it is a profitable company and decide to take it. I can envisage the Belgians or even the British Government deciding that, since Aer Lingus is a profitable brand name, they should take it over. Then another state would be running our State airline. That is ridiculous for a small country dependent on air and sea transport. We do not even have the latter any more. We have no national State ferry line.</P>
    <P>All this is sold to us as part of EU negotiations. We are told that we must open the market. We can do that without opening the coffers to sell off our valuables and family treasure. Aer Lingus and the related transport organisations, CIE and Aer Rianta, are the family treasure. They have worked well for us in the past and can again in the future with a little modernisation and more efficient methods to deliver the service for which they have been set up.</P>
    <P>The Minister is planning in this Bill to &ldquo;facilitate any private sector investment process in the event that the Government embarks on such a process&rdquo;. I hope it will never embark on that, but knowing the Progressive Democrats, who control this Government, it will embark on it as soon as the Bill is passed. I cannot envisage the Minister, who has accepted their philosophy <i>en bloc,</i> waiting around too long. To what other airline is he planning to sell it? Which investors has he lined up? There are none, because it is an ill-thought-<Col N="273" />out plan, and we should not be taking this path. I appeal to him to take the national interest to heart and ensure that our interests and those of future generations are protected. That is what we are talking about here.</P>
    <P>If we sell this off, we will have lost out. We sold off our telephone system, and we now have absolutely no control over the delivery of telecommunications. We cannot say to Éircom, Vodafone or whomever else that they must provide a better service in the west, for example, since the system is no longer in State hands. We must go through a regulator and make an appeal. The companies can then counter appeal. We do not control them any more. If we control State and public companies, we can at least have an input on their future plans. They can be tied to the future development of the country and the spatial strategy, if the Government has not totally rejected it.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus is privatised, who will fly Ministers back and forth to decentralised locations? Will either Padraig Ó Ceidigh and Aer Arann or Ryanair put on such flights? Perhaps Michael O' Leary will put on special flights from Knock Airport for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs or a special flight for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism from Kerry as a token of gratitude because companies such as Ryanair could bid for Aer Lingus, which it does not respect, and drive it into the ground. In return for this opportunity, perhaps Michael O' Leary will fly Ministers back and forth to the locations which have been chosen for decentralisation. For instance, I am sure Foras na Gaeilge would love an airport in Gweedore.</P>
    <P>There is no logic to recent Government decisions, including those on decentralisation. The spatial strategy has been turned on its head and, in this case, the Government is turning logic on its head by selling off a profitable company which could benefit people in the long-term and ensure Irish interests are protected.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist eile a ardú agus rá le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre gur chóir dó díriú ar bhunreacht nua na hEorpa agus, go díreach, na himpleachtaí maidir le comórtas a thabhairt isteach in áiteanna agus earnálacha eile ar nós sláinte agus oideachais. Sin cuid de bhealach an Rialtais seo agus an Rialtais roimhe. Tá siad tar éis an príobháidiú a thabhairt isteach trí rá go bhfuil gá leis tarlú toisc go bhfuil an tAontas Eorpach a rá linn go gcaithfimid é seo agus é siud a dhéanamh. Ní ghlacaim leis sin. Measaim gur chóir do leithéidí Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre féachaint air seo go dian agus seasamh suas i gcoinne a leithéid de chonradh atá á phlé faoi láthair. Sa deireadh thiar thall, is oibrithe a bheidh thíos leis. Sa chás seo, is oibrithe a bheidh thíos má chuireann an tAire an Bille um Aer Lingus tríd an Dáil.</P>
    <P>Tacaím go hiomlán leis na ceardchumainn nuair a chuireann siad i gcoinne príobháidithe agus phlean iomlán an Rialtais. Sa chás seo, tá sé ag pleanáil Aer Lingus a phríobháidiú. Impím ar na ceardchumainn brú a chur ar an Rialtas gan <Col N="274" />dul ar aghaidh leis an mBille seo, agus an dá rud sa Bhille a scaradh ó chéile le dhá Bhille a dhéanamh de &ndash; Bille amháin mar gheall ar na scaireanna, agus, má tá an tAire ag iarraidh dul ar aghaidh leis an bpríobháidiu in ainneoin an ghearáin atá déanta agam, Bille eile dó sin. Ba cheart dó bheith ina Bhille iomlán difriúil. Le fada tá mé i bhfabhar tacú leo siúd a rinne an comhlacht seo a atógáil ón bhun suas. Tá mé ag iarraidh gur féidir leo buntáiste éigin a bhaint as an obair ar fad a rinne siad le cúpla bliain anuas. Aontaím leis an chuid sin den Bhille. Impím ar an Aire an dá chuid den Bhille a scaradh ó chéile agus dul ar aghaidh le dhá Bhille, ceann amháin do na scaireanna, agus an ceann eile don bpríobháidiú. Beidh argóint cheart againn ar an bpríobháidiú, agus tá súil agam nach nglacfar leis sin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, not having expected to do so. I am glad to see the Minister, who is obviously hoping the debate will end relatively soon because there has already been a great deal of discussion on the Bill.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is threefold. First, it proposes to give effect to the employee share ownership plan within Aer Lingus, which has been agreed by the Government and the Aer Lingus unions. Second, it will facilitate any private sector investment process which the Government may wish to follow, depending on policy. Third, it will establish a new pension scheme in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>A key section of the Bill is section 3, which facilitates the Minister, should he decide to sell off part of the State's interest in the State airline. Section 4 deals with facilitating the issuing of new shares. Sections 6 and 7 relate to ensuring that the ESOP is represented on the Aer Lingus board and facilitate the establishment of employee shareholding schemes themselves.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the concept of selling-off all or part of the State's interest in Aer Lingus, the ESOP or ESOT idea and how it has been successful in other companies such as Eircom, in regard to which we made some mistakes. The ESOT is an example of good policy which has worked well for those involved. I also wish to make some general comments on Cork Airport, Aer Lingus's involvement there and its future and how the company has transformed itself under a new management mindset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of dangers associated with the selling-off of Aer Lingus. The Minister knows that Fine Gael does not have a problem with the philosophy of privatisation. However, when one considers privatising a company like Aer Lingus, a significant number of issues need to be debated carefully. The Fine Gael spokesperson on transport, Deputy Naughten, has on numerous occasions called for a White Paper on Aer Lingus to map out its short, medium and long-term future as the Government sees it. Without a White Paper, any plans to privatise Aer Lingus will be viewed with a sceptical eye as a way for <Col N="275" />the Government to use the company as a cash cow, offering the Exchequer a significant opportunity to gain revenue on a one-off basis. This would be a mistake.</P>
    <P>If the Minister hopes to privatise Aer Lingus and gain the support of the largest Opposition party, he will need to map out his strategy surrounding that process in a detailed manner. I do not have a problem with the ideology of privatisation, but in Aer Lingus's case we are dealing with a company with much pride whose logo has been carried by aircraft as flagships for Irish people and Irishness. We must be careful how we map out its future. The logo on Aer Lingus aircraft is precious to Irish people living in New York, Boston and other cities across the US, as well as other countries.  A considerable number of Irish people living abroad have a great attachment to Aer Lingus as a symbol of the journey between Ireland and their new homes. This should not be dismissed as emotional nonsense because it is more than that.</P>
    <P>One of the more practical concerns which needs to be taken into account in the White Paper revolves around the slots retained by Aer Lingus at Heathrow. These are extremely valuable and if Aer Lingus were to lose them we might not be able to get them back. It is crucial that the number of slots held by Aer Lingus at Heathrow for flights to and from Dublin, Cork and Shannon be maintained. People too often refer to the mistakes made during the privatisation of Eircom. In this instance, however, a parallel exists. When we sold Eircom, we unfortunately also sold the physical infrastructure that existed across the country. As a result, we are struggling to roll out broadband. The process in this regard would have been much easier if the State had retained the physical infrastructure to which I refer. It is important, therefore, that we should not lose what I consider to be a national asset, namely, our slots at Heathrow through the sale of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the role of Aer Lingus in the future. Do we want the Government, on behalf of the people, to have an interest in the State airline? Is it vital that we should have a shareholding in Aer Lingus and, therefore, be in a position to exert influence over its policies? Is this required, for example, in respect of regional development? Under its plans for decentralisation, the Government has made a clear statement that it is beginning to take seriously the concept of developing the regions. If we follow through on that logic, there surely must be a need to provide air links to the different regions. Would the State airline not have a role to play in that regard? I would be sceptical as to whether Aer Lingus would continue to provide its various regional services in the future if a ministerial shareholding in the company did not exist.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with the concept of the employee share ownership plan. The Govern<Col N="276" />ment and the Aer Lingus unions did a good day's work when they managed to agree an acceptable ESOP arrangement for the staff. There are many good examples of ESOPs, but I am most familiar, due to the nature of the brief I hold, with that of Eircom, which has been a phenomenal success for its members. The staff of Eircom have a 30% shareholding, making them the largest shareholders in the Valentia Group which runs and owns Eircom. The members of the Eircom ESOP have received substantial cash returns as a result of part of that shareholding being cashed in. There are two staff directors on the board of directors, the total membership of which is 11, which means that the staff have a significant influence on the direction the company is taking. They have set out a 20-year plan which offers real stability for Eircom going forward. I suspect there will be major changes in Eircom and the nature of its ownership and shareholders during the next 12 months. However, there will be no change in the consistent approach the ESOP takes towards the company. That approach offers the kind of stability a company of that importance to Ireland needs.</P>
    <P>The Eircom ESOP is the largest single Irish investor in our telecommunications industry. I obviously exclude Vodafone from this as it is not, as such, an Irish company. The Eircom ESOP is a successful model which began when the company was State owned and which has continued since it was privatised, surviving all the mistakes made during that process. It has emerged on the other side stronger, able to offer real value to its members and with the power to influence, in a significant way, the future direction and policies of Eircom.</P>
    <P>One can see the potential value of trying to transpose that model to a company such as Aer Lingus. If we make the strategic decision to privatise Aer Lingus the future &ndash; I am not stating that Fine Gael either favours or is opposed to it at present because we are not willing to decide until the White Paper emerges &ndash; the ESOP model used in Eircom, if it were to be adopted in a similar way in the national airline, could offer real and measurable returns for its members. This model does not merely represent the unions, nor does it, as such, represent the company; it is concerned with the interests and shareholdings of its members. It introduces a new way of negotiating between unions and management within a company and offers a new and viable option for a company such as Aer Lingus, which needs to improve efficiencies in order to face up to competitors that have entered the Irish market in an aggressive way, primarily through offering low fares.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment now on some of the changes that have occurred in Aer Lingus recently. The past 12 months have been phenomenally successful for Willie Walsh and his crew at Aer Lingus. Significant changes have been made, leading to a great deal of pain for some of the staff and unions. However, management, staff and unions <Col N="277" />have managed to move forward together in order to ensure that Aer Lingus has a future. Only last year, the idea of selling Aer Lingus would have been rubbished because the company, which seemed for a number of months to have a bleak future, was not worth very much. Now, however, it is extremely healthy, making profits, has a bright future, is ambitious and is worth a considerable amount of money. It is important to record our recognition of the efforts of those involved and the change in the company's fortunes. If the Minister has assisted that process, his contribution must also be recognised.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, about a number of the decisions that have been made. The first of these is the discontinuation of the service between Cork and Dublin, which is a mistake. I am regularly informed that flying from Cork to Dublin is not viable. However, I fly that route regularly and the aircraft on which I travel are nearly always full. This decision, under which Aer Lingus is giving its slots to Aer Arann, is not positive. I am not stating that Aer Arann is not positive in its outlook because the opposite is clearly the case.</P>
    <P>It is unhealthy that only one airline carries people between Cork and Dublin, Ireland's first and second cities. As a person who believes in the benefits of competition, I would like to see Aer Arann and Aer Lingus competing on the Cork-Dublin route, as opposed to a cosy arrangement whereby Aer Lingus would hand over its passengers on that route to Aer Arann. There is a great deal of concern about the unavailability of jet planes on the Cork-Dublin route. Cork people are now forced to fly on propeller planes which, while adequate, do not provide choice. The way to offer choice and good value for money on that route is through competition.</P>
    <P>I hope companies like Jetmagic, Ryanair and others will consider competing with Aer Arann on that route, given Aer Lingus's clear indications that it will not be willing to do so in the future. That is an example of what could occur if Aer Lingus operated solely from a profits mindset and without the influence of ministerial policy.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, by and large, achieved its success in the past 12 months through the introduction of lower fares. It is currently operating on a competitive basis with Ryanair. It has significantly upgraded its website and its levels of communications and marketing have also improved. The new mindset in Aer Lingus has transformed the company. The willingness of unions to accept that transformation has been extremely helpful.</P>
    <P>Cork city has a population of more than 200,000 people and serves a region of approximately one million people. It is unacceptable that it still does not have a transatlantic route. A person from Cork, Ireland's second city, wishing to fly to the US is required to drive to Shannon Airport or fly to Dublin, fly back to Shannon and then fly across the Atlantic. That must change. While I support the viability of Shannon into the future, that does not mean we cannot facilitate a <Col N="278" />transatlantic route from Cork through minor runway alterations and so on.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with an ESOP, of which I am supportive, and the potential for privatisation of Aer Lingus. The Minister must produce a White Paper which maps out how he and the Government view Aer Lingus in the short, medium and long-term in the context of its being a flagship company and an ambassador for Ireland in the sky and in other countries, thus ensuring the value to &lsquo;Ireland Incorporated' is not damaged. We must not think about this in the short-term as a means of putting significant funds into the national Exchequer in the build up, for example, to an election and then, four or five years later, regretting the decision. That must not happen.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Transport is to obtain Fine Gael's support on privatisation of Aer Lingus, we must be reassured, by way of a detailed White Paper which can be debated at length, that we are not making a mistake which the country will regret in three, five or ten years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is not harmful to review Aer Lingus's performance and to congratulate its management and staff on their tremendous efforts in the past couple of years resulting in the company's return to profit. If a point needed proving, it has been. Notwithstanding Aer Lingus's losses in previous years for a variety of reasons, when the decision was made to turn the ship, or the plane in this case, and to become efficient, effective and competitive, it was possible to do so.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances, it is not harmful to review where Aer Lingus stood some years ago and the destination at which it has now arrived &ndash; no pun intended. I remember when air fares were, to say the least, prohibitive and when it cost the guts of one's salary for a round trip from Ireland to the United Kingdom. It was said at the time that air fares could not be reduced, but it was possible to reduce them. Ryanair forced everybody to focus on that issue. There must be strong competition if we are to obtain the best from public and private companies. There must also be a willingness to serve the consumer and not those participating in this area, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and so on. I will come back to that issue in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone involved must be willing to serve the consumer to the best of their ability. We must consider the rate of increase in air fares, their upward trajectory in the past 20 years and the level at which they might now be but for competition. That illustrates the way things could have gone and causes one to wonder if the companies would have been any more profitable. I doubt it because lack of competition would have made them lethargic in their application to consumer needs and nobody would have gained. The lesson to be learnt is the degree to which competition has benefited the consumer and those companies providing the service. Aer Lingus must be cred<Col N="279" />ited for turning the company around, making it profitable and responsive to consumer needs and in making it a major player in its field.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Coveney said earlier, it is not harmful at this time to consider the future of Aer Lingus. I recognise that, during the drafting of this Bill, a great deal of effort and energy was spent in dealing with unions and management and in recognising the share options likely to be and required to be available. Notwithstanding all that, we cannot proceed in this regard without support from the consumer or without the benefit of the competition which currently exists in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The flotation of Eircom and its subsequent sale has left a question mark over issues such as privatisation and competition. I know Members on the Government side will say it was a successful sale from the Government's point of view, but it was not successful for the consumer or the casual investor. The casual investor wants to make a patriotic contribution to the national economy and does so willingly. However, the casual investor does not like to be walked into a position where, having bought shares, he or she is then told that it has become expedient to sell the shares at a prearranged price, not necessarily the price paid for them. While it may turn out well for Eircom, it is not good for the future public purchase of shares in major national companies. We must be careful that we do not go down this road again as the dictum &ldquo;Once bitten, twice shy&rdquo; applies. Whatever the benefits to those who made profits, the consequences for those who lost money are highly suspect and they will be careful to avoid a recurrence.</P>
    <P>Having met with and recognised the needs of both the unions and the company, the Government must be aware that other needs must also be met. Failure to do so could cause irreparable damage, not only to Aer Lingus and its ancillary services, but to the trust of the people in the economy. This must be borne in mind at all times.</P>
    <P>I know the long-term plans for Aer Lingus and that there are divided views on the airline, Aer Rianta and associated bodies. We live in changing times. Airline companies cannot operate without ground services. Whatever the future holds for Aer Rianta, the company will have a bearing on the airlines using Irish airports. I think of a point raised with me by a holidaymaker who left Dublin Airport this summer. Due to excessive traffic, this person got to the airport a little late and had to park in the short-term car park. On returning seven days later, he found that the car park fees were almost as great as the cost of the holiday. Surely this cannot go on. While the Minister and I know that car parking in Ireland is expensive, the most expensive car parking in the world must be found around Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>It raises serious questions about the competitiveness of our economy in this area. While Aer Lingus can be profit making, if the attendant companies are not equally profit making, con<Col N="280" />sumer friendly and competitive, then no one will win. In the review of the structures of Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and other bodies, a clear decision must be made as to their role and function, how they impact on each other, and how they serve the public both individually and collectively. After all, they depend on the public for their existence. We must recognise that it is not all about share options and returns to investors; the consumer is the biggest shareholder of all and has the right to shift business elsewhere if needs are not responded to. While there are few options for people wishing to fly from or to this island, others will provide new options unless existing companies are competitive and responsive to the needs of the consumer.</P>
    <P>We need to innovate and now is the time to do it. It is generally recognised that our public transport services are not immediately responsive to consumer needs. This is not a personal vilification of the Minister. I have concluded that he wears a hard hat most of the time to deflect the darts thrown at him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Fianna Fáil meeting in Killarney, the Taoiseach said that his party members were becoming thin-skinned and advised on a course to be followed to thicken the skin. This was totally unnecessary as I felt they were doing quite well at the time.</P>
      <P>We must provide an innovative service to the consumer. Why not examine how further services can be provided in the provinces and between the provinces and the capital? Many areas currently have no services, yet cheap and competitive services could easily be provided. If it is possible to fly to Paris for 5 cent, it should be possible to fly from Dublin to Galway or Derry for a reasonably competitive price.</P>
      <P>The Minister and others will tell me that I do not understand this. I know how it operates. I know what would have happened if the rise of the late Jim Mitchell had been halted when as Minister, he encouraged competition in the airline business. This is now benefiting Irish passengers. This is a good time to look at the extent to which travellers in Ireland can be offered competition in the airline sector. There is little competition in this area and Deputy Coveney mentioned that each time he travels with Aer Arran all seats on the aircraft are full. Every other European country has an internal air service with small aircraft regularly flying between cities that are no bigger than the cities here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several regions also have no rail service and a very poor bus service. According to reports, the good people of this city who are in charge of transport do not want motorists to come into the city because they will not be able to find a place to park. If they park where they should not and leave their cars in that position for too long, they could be clamped. If clamped, they must pay <Col N="281" />heavily to have it released, if they are lucky to get it released. In such circumstances it behoves us to examine how best to serve the needs of these consumers. It is high time we did so and it is possible. A fair effort must be made at examining alternatives to motor transport for those who wish to travel to and from the capital city on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>People say we should park our cars somewhere. If we knew where to park them we could do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. I am also trying to point out ways in which we can provide alternatives. One cannot fly one's car into the air and therefore one has to have a place to park it at an airport. I already mentioned the cost to one unfortunate traveller for parking his car at a certain airport. I doubt if he will again park it car in such a manner.</P>
      <P>As a mere user of the airlines, roads and various other forms of transport, I believe it is no harm to examine the options and recognise that whatever changes we make should be made not only for the benefit of the companies involved but also the consumer, in whose hands the future of the airline companies rests. The consumers can vote with their feet and bring their business elsewhere if necessary.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Section 3</i> provides that the Minister for Finance may sell, exchange or dispose of his/her shares in Aer Lingus Group public limited company. The Minister for Finance is the major shareholder in the airline. Provision is also made that any funds received in respect of the sale or disposal of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus will be paid into and disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I am sure this is the intention, and I am sure the same applied in respect of the Eircom shares. However, I have serious doubts about the extent to which the sale of Eircom benefited the Exchequer or those who bought shares in the company. I reject any assertion to the contrary. A repeat of the performance in respect of Eircom will lead us nowhere except into sadness. The Minister should bear in mind that the Eircom experience is not the best one to use as a rule of thumb in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred earlier to the employee share ownership plan, regarding which the Government and Aer Lingus have already come to an agreement with the unions. This is fine. However, it must <Col N="282" />also be borne in mind that those who are likely to use the services of the airline also need to be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides enabling powers to facilitate a sale of all or part of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus. Appropriate provisions are made to enable the Minister for Finance to enter one or more agreements in connection with the sale of the shares in the company, including customary provisions contained in a shareholders' or underwriting agreement as the Minister may wish. The Minister will have to recognise the extent to which approval, or otherwise, may be granted for his proposals in this House. There must be a clear recognition that he and his successors do not have a <i>carte blanche</i> to continue acting according to their whims <i>ad infinitum.</i> This is because the good of the company and country are at stake, as well as the good name of the process embarked upon.</P>
    <P>I had intended to deal with the private sector in this area but time does not permit. Ryanair is the major mover in the private sector and it has suggested that it can provide services at a much more competitive rate. It may well be that we do not necessarily agree with all it says and does, but if the opportunity arises we need to examine what it has to offer, how it proposes to make such an offer and the impact its proposals will have on the airline industry and the economy in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. When we hear the name &ldquo;Aer Lingus&rdquo; we automatically think of Ryanair, the cost of fares to London ten or 15 years ago, which amounted to £200 or £300, and of how things have changed radically. It is important to acknowledge the role Ryanair has played in ensuring that Aer Lingus has become more efficient.</P>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill although, as the Minister is aware, Fine Gael has some difficulties with it. These may be more to do with a lack of clarification than anything else. I particularly welcome the concept of share options. Although this country is relatively young, it has many State bodies. In the initial stages people may have been motivated by patriotism, which may have been diluted in recent years. It is a fact of life &ndash; maybe it was always this way &ndash; that money is king and that if people feel they can benefit economically from their work, they will work more efficiently. It must be acknowledged that Aer Lingus has turned around in the past 18 months and one has to commend its workers for their effort. They should be rewarded accordingly. Almost all State bodies should go down this track. The day of State bodies being top heavy and representing a cost to the Exchequer is nearing an end. It is important to realise that the taxpayer ultimately pays for such bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a function of any arm of State to provide employment to the public. The use of many <Col N="283" />State institutions as employment stores in the years before the last general election imposed a pressure on the public finances. Employees should have been taken on only to improve efficiency or because of an increasing workload.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of the share options, which has worked well in other companies. I hope it will maintain the momentum towards greater efficiency in Aer Lingus. The airline is now competing with airlines with low-cost fares and its website has been upgraded. I was on an Aer Lingus flight during the week and its staff were most efficient and tried to make me feel at home. They let me know where I could get the best deal, etc.</P>
    <P>The main provision of the Bill is to give the Minister the authority to privatise Aer Lingus. I do not have great difficulty with the concept of privatisation but there are certain pitfalls to be considered. The main pitfall for Fine Gael arises from the party's concern that the concept has not been explored as fully as it should have been. Deputy Naughten has tabled an amendment to the effect that, prior to the publication of a White Paper on the privatisation of Aer Lingus, Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill. He said we will not agree to this part of the Bill, which means we will not agree to the overall Bill, until the publication of a White Paper on the issue.</P>
    <P>Air transport is similar to rail transport 20 or 30 years ago. All one has to do is go to Dublin Airport to see how busy it is. A generation ago it was unique for people to travel by air but nowadays people go to New York for the weekend to do their Christmas shopping, or back and forward to the Continent with no difficulty. The concept of the honeymoon in Blackpool is long gone, as people head off to the Seychelles and the Cayman Islands. The danger is that Aer Lingus has many lucrative slots in Heathrow. Is it possible that the company could be bought just to use those lucrative Heathrow slots, with Ireland becoming a secondary destination? Transatlantic travel could be aimed at Heathrow and central Europe, leaving us out on a limb with consequent losses. We have an important geographical location, as evidenced by the request of the Americans to use Shannon in the Iraq war, which should be borne in mind. As air travel becomes more frequent our position should become more attractive.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with pensions and it is very important to get that right. I have seen the difficulties in my constituency with IFI in Arklow, where there has been much contention about pension rights. Most employees pay into a pension fund but very few people, apart from those directly involved in its administration, are aware of how the pension system operates. This is a failing we all have. If I lost my seat in the next election and I was then asked about my pension <Col N="284" />rights, I would be unclear and so would many other Members. The new criteria for State pensions were outlined in the budget and that drives home to us how little time we have. We all think we will go on forever and we do not put an emphasis on looking at our pensions. It might be something of which the Ceann Comhairle is aware, but I am not that familiar with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan spoke about car parking fees and &euro;20 per day for parking is over the top. I cannot recall many new car parks being built in Dublin Airport. It is not as if the fees go towards any loans, as I assume those car parks are long paid for and, by today's standards, they were not that expensive to build in the first place. It is prohibitive to pay that money for short-term parking and I also have concerns about the long-term parking system, where items in cars may not be that safe as those car parks are virtually impossible to police.</P>
    <P>I was coming in from the airport on Wednesday night and though I am very familiar with the road, I missed my turn off the M50 for the Naas Road because of roadworks. I know road signage is an issue close to the Minister's heart. We must look at the signage around Dublin Airport, because the situation is chaotic when one is coming out of it on a winter's evening. One is driving on a wing and a prayer because one does not know where to turn off.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that there are discussions in the EU about pilot flying hours, which are probably the equivalent of the Hanly report on doctors' working hours. It is probably easier for a pilot to fly an aircraft than to drive a car but it is important that they have adequate rest times. Where I live in Wicklow there is a continuous stream of aircraft overhead and one evening last week while I was looking at the vapour trails overhead I saw a sudden dip as one aircraft avoided another. We often hear about near misses and I thought of inquiring whether there was a near miss. One aircraft was coming from the east and one from the west and one could see the sudden dip in the trail of one aircraft. The work of air traffic controllers amazes me. It is a very stressful job and they are to be complimented. However, we should be aware of the health and safety issues associated with that job.</P>
    <P>Regarding regionalisation, it is important to have balanced growth. I am told there is no such thing as the Shannon stopover but I was watching the television recently and my son, who is nine, asked me to explain the Shannon stopover when it was mentioned. I explained it to him as best I could but when he asked me why it was done I could not explain it. I am told it is not an automatic stopover any more and perhaps the Minister will tell me what it is called now. Those in Shannon would argue that the stopover is in Dublin but it is important that those on transatlantic flights, Americans or those from the west of <Col N="285" />Ireland, have the option of landing in Shannon. For many people in the greater Dublin area it might be quicker to land in Shannon and drive to one's destination than it is at present to land in Dublin. It took me two hours to travel 38 miles yesterday morning and I fear for what my penalty points would be had a garda followed me.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general thrust of the Bill. Our society has changed and the new generation is progressive. Despite the vitriol we may heap on them on occasion, our civil servants are also progressive. On occasion people may hanker back to keeping things the same but we must evolve with time and often society itself evolves much quicker than its institutions. If things do not work out we can always go back to this but it is important to change. I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill but we have a major difficulty with buying a pig in a poke, so to speak, and we would like to see a White Paper before the Minister makes definitive plans to sell the airline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen" hpid="Mr. J. Breen Mr. J. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill. Any plans by the Minister to sell part of Aer Lingus must be considered carefully and must be looked at in terms of what is best for this island as a whole, not what is best for Aer Lingus as a corporate entity. From a County Clare point of view, they must be looked at in the context of Shannon Airport and the surrounding area.</P>
      <P>Shannon is ideally located as the gateway to the west of Ireland and the local infrastructure is improving. Hopefully the Ennis bypass will start in 2004 and, with a rail link to the airport, it will be an even more inviting destination for tourists and business people. Aer Lingus has been a very successful public enterprise over the years and has benefited from the bilateral agreement, with transatlantic flights becoming the bread and butter of Shannon. There has been a significant knock-on impact on tourism development in the west of Ireland as a whole.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the recent rescheduling of flights to Dublin and the lack of a service to mainland Europe from Shannon has had a negative impact on the economy of the region. The establishment of a new board of management for the three airports gives no guarantee to Shannon or Cork and, in light of this Bill, I question Aer Lingus's commitment to the airport, the west and the mid-west.</P>
      <P>If a private company or another airline got its hands on part of Aer Lingus could Shannon kiss Aer Lingus goodbye in the interests of profit margins? That would be to the detriment of the local economy and the development of further tourism and business initiatives. Will Shannon Airport suffer the same fate as Cork Airport given that Aer Lingus discontinued domestic flights to Cork? This cannot be allowed to happen in an area with good prospects for economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus may be a small carrier but its brand <Col N="286" />is synonymous with Ireland. A vibrant national airline is needed and Aer Lingus should remain as an independent carrier within the State structure and should not be sold off piecemeal to private industry. If this is the Minister's intention, he should outline his proposal and give assurances to Shannon and Cork Airports that their viability as tourist destinations will be safeguarded in any deal.</P>
    <P>We in Clare are concerned about Shannon Airport and I hope the Minister will guarantee that the new board will be good for the airport. I encourage the Minister to ensure Shannon Airport is safeguarded in his proposals. He is from the west and will be aware of what the people think of the airport. It is an engine for growth in the area and, without a bilateral agreement, it will be in dire straits. I seek an assurance from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to the debate and I have taken careful note of the issues raised. The Bill marks the conclusion of a traumatic period in the airline's history which centred around the events of 2001 and the survival plan. Following the enactment of the legislation, the Government will have fulfilled it commitment on the increased employee shareholding in exchange for the full implementation of the survival plan. I join Members in complimenting the staff and management on the turnaround in the company.</P>
      <P>I also welcome Members' support for the employee share ownership plan provisions in the legislation which will result in an increase in the overall staff shareholding of up to a limit of 14.9%. The legislation is necessary to give effect to the increase from 5% to 14.9%. However, given the changed fortunes of the airline and its current performance, the 14.9% shareholding represents a valuable stake. This is consistent with Government policy in terms of the stake available to employees in State companies and, depending on the value of the airline, it could be worth between &euro;40 million and &euro;100 million &ndash; a considerable amount. These shares will be held privately. When arguing about who owns what, it is important to bear in mind that the workers are in a special position in that they work in the company and generate profits, although they are also private individuals who will own a share in a valuable company. It is not proposed to increase the shareholding beyond 14.9%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new profit share scheme agreed with the company under the ESOP package was also sought by the unions, largely as a means to enable the ESOP to maintain its shareholding at a maximum of 14.9% in the event of the involvement of a third party investor. The ESOP agreement also includes a provision for appropriate consultations with the employee share ownership <Col N="287" />trust in third party investment negotiations that may occur.</P>
    <P>A number of Members commented on the delay in bringing forward the ESOP legislation. While agreement on the ESOP framework was reached in December 2001, the necessary legal documentation was only concluded in March 2003. There were a number of a reasons for this, including the highly complex nature of ESOPs in general from a legal, technical and administrative point of view. There was also a delay in commencing negotiations because of industrial action taken by pilots in the first half of 2002.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members who welcomed the inclusion of an enabling provision to allow Aer Lingus to establish new pension schemes for its employees and pensioners. I acknowledge the support of the House in this regard. Once the legislation is passed, Aer Lingus will decide when a new pension scheme will be established and the terms of such schemes will be negotiated with the trade unions. The normal arrangements for pension schemes in State bodies must be approved by the Minister for Finance, and that will apply in this case.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the representations made to the Department on behalf of former employees who hold company pensions, including the campaign by the Retired Aviation Staff Association, about the terms of the existing scheme. Officials from my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach met representatives of RASA on a number of occasions to discuss their concerns. A further meeting took place on 19 October 2003. Unfortunately, there has been no obvious solution to address their concerns, despite detailed examination in recent years. There is no guarantee that their concerns can be addressed in a new scheme but, nevertheless, I will continue to liaise with the company to ascertain whether a solution is possible. I am sympathetic to and understand their position. The company will meet the RASA representatives again soon to discuss these issues. I urge the company to make every effort to resolve this issue to the satisfaction of the pensioners.</P>
    <P>A number of Members also referred to the Aer Lingus proposal to standardise its European fleet, which is the culmination of a highly competitive 15 month process conducted by the company. A detailed business case was submitted to my Department regarding the purchases and I approved the investment proposal. The company is moving to a single aircraft type for non-transatlantic business, and this will result in efficiencies in the system. Aer Lingus is purchasing the aircraft from its own resources. The State is not involved in the transaction nor was it involved in the selection process. My only role, on behalf of the shareholders, was to review the business case put forward by the company on the investment <Col N="288" />proposals. Aer Lingus advised that offset was not used as an award criterion in the selection process and that it had no relevance to the company.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate focused on sections 3, 4 and 5 which facilitate a sale of all or part of the State's shareholdings in Aer Lingus and the issue of new shares by the company. Contrary to the assertion made by a few Members, no decision has been taken on a sale transaction by Aer Lingus. The Government and I have not made a decision on the timing of such a transaction and I do not have potential investors or buyers lined up or in mind nor have any been contacted. I sought a report from the company on its opinions in this regard. I am studying it and will bring it before the Government as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that the Government's priority is not one of raising funds for the Exchequer through a possible sale. The issue is one of providing the best future for the airline and how Aer Lingus can best continue to serve the country. I am opposed to approaching the matter as a means of collecting a few bob for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to Fine Gael's suggestion to lay out the arguments and options in detail on paper. We should try to quantify and measure the options and set out in a strategic manner the aviation options facing the company. Fine Gael's request is sensible. I do not want to commit to a White Paper on the subject but I am interested in providing all the information to the House in detail. Many Government Deputies also asked for similar detail to be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be provided prior to Committee Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will think about that. The request to lay out the options before any sale is sensible. If we embark on any such disposal I will give thought to doing that. The arguments and options can be published and discussed.</P>
      <P>My focus since I took office has been to secure the future of Aer Lingus. For almost 18 months I have consistently supported the company in its decisions and efforts to turn the company around. The Government acceded to the company's requests and stood by it in many difficult decisions. I did not and would not interfere with unpopular decisions on route choices because I appreciate that difficult decisions were made to turn the company around. Given the airline's recovery and the new business focus, it is time to look at future options and choices, rather than wait for a downturn or crisis to force our hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must also take into account the fact that the aviation industry, both globally and nationally, has changed significantly in the past ten years, particularly in Europe. Further and ongoing change is inevitable. Some of this will be driven by developments between the United States and the European Union in their open skies talks. It <Col N="289" />is the Government's wish that Aer Lingus continues to make a significant and valuable contribution to the country and to tourism, regional and economic development. Everyone must agree it can only do this if it can compete successfully, operate profitably and have access to a variety of funding sources to facilitate its growth.</P>
    <P>The issue the Government must consider is whether Aer Lingus can do this better in the private or public sector and if any vital strategic matters could influence that choice. I will set out those issues another time. It would be negligent not to consider them. We should not forget that twice in the past decade, while in State ownership, the airline has been on the verge of collapse. Given the particular nature of the aviation sector, there are no guarantees for the future.</P>
    <P>Airlines need to have the maximum flexibility to respond to whatever market or other conditions the sector will face. The company may be publicly owned but it operates in a viciously competitive private sector area. My prime objective, despite comments to the contrary made in contributions to the House, is to secure the future of the airline and its contribution to tourism regional development and national economic growth.</P>
    <P>In the interests of airline staff and management who performed so well in turning the company around, it is important that the shareholder clearly signals its intention regarding ownership before too long. It is not in the interests of proper management of the company that continuing uncertainty should hinder future planning. By asking the Government to examine the options, I act in the best interests of the State and Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies said that EU state aid rules were misrepresented. I do not accept that. Under EU rules the State can seek to invest as a normal shareholder in Aer Lingus, as pointed out by a number of Deputies. It can also be done when the company is making a profit. In such a case there would be opposition from other airlines alleging State aid. There would also likely be an investigation by the European Commission before approval for any such investment would be forthcoming. Such investment is only possible when an airline makes commercial returns.</P>
    <P>It has been Government policy for some time, certainly since 1990, that future funds would not be invested in Aer Lingus, whether in the form of aid or investment. On commercial or responsibility grounds, it would be difficult for Government to justify the injection of scarce Exchequer funds into a profitable Aer Lingus when many other competing priorities depend on State resources. The real problem is that the State cannot invest under EU rules when the airline is in crisis, even if so disposed. Therefore, while the airline remains in State ownership, it must <Col N="290" />depend on its own resources and funds. I must therefore consider the options carefully.</P>
    <P>The nature of the sector is such that there will always be uncertainties. It is essential that if any opportunities for investment arise, they are considered. Given the near certainty that no Government will buy new shares in a profitable company when there is no need to do so, and that it is forbidden by EU state aid rules to invest in a company in crisis, it is critical we look at the options available now that we have space. Given the history of the airline and the sector, I cannot be complacent on the issue. It is for that reason I asked the company for a report and will report to Government on the matter.</P>
    <P>During this debate Deputies raised concerns about specific strategic issues in the context of a State exit from ownership of Aer Lingus. They are worried that unless Aer Lingus remains in State ownership, the brand and direct links to key markets like the United States will disappear. There are also concerns about the Heathrow slots and the commitment of any new owners to regional development. I share these genuine concerns. Aer Lingus is a strong brand with an equally strong Irish identity. I do not believe that any potential investors, the public or others, would abandon a core market or cease to operate direct services on profitable routes thereby leaving gaps for a competitor to exploit. That would not make commercial or economic sense. If fares are competitive, direct services will always outperform indirect services. I believe the airline will hold on to those direct services as long as they are profitable.</P>
    <P>This concern was raised, particularly with regard to services to and from the United States. While under current bilateral rules only Irish and US airlines can operate on Ireland's US routes, I remind Deputies that an early outcome of the EU-US open skies talks is likely to be an agreement which will recognise the right, as set down by the European Court of Justice, that any European airline may operate services from any Irish airport to the United States.</P>
    <P>The slots at Heathrow are important because apart from Aer Lingus, only British Midland operates Heathrow-Ireland services. Their value arises from their scarcity. This may change when additional runway capacity is developed at Heathrow which is still the largest international hub in the world and important for the Aer Lingus network. I share the concerns of the House. We must be careful as to how we handle the issue because it is essential that we continue to have access to these hubs in the future.</P>
    <P>I must clarify that Ireland does not own slots in Heathrow Airport. These slots are time slots held by Aer Lingus on the basis of a historical precedent, known as grandfather's rights. The allocation of slots at congested airports such as Heathrow is strictly governed by EU rules which <Col N="291" />are now under review. The current regulation allows for the exchange of slots but does not cover their sale. This has not prevented the development of a &ldquo;grey market&rdquo; in slots. I understand the current review will not address this issue. However, the revised regulation will, if adopted, specifically provide that if an airline is taken over, its slots can be transferred to the new owner. As this already happens in practice, it does not appear to change the current situation.</P>
    <P>This whole area of slots is a legal grey area, which is exercising EU policymakers' minds. I share the Deputies' concerns on this matter and will make stringent efforts to ensure that, in any changes of Aer Lingus ownership, great care will be taken on that issue.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contribution to this debate. Before any decision is made by the Government, I will lay out the arguments for and against the proposed sale. Many Members accuse me of having an ideological bent towards privatisation. I have no proposals to privatise Aer Rianta. I am allowing the regions an opportunity to compete and develop their own airports, which shows my confidence in Shannon and Cork airports. When a previous Administration came up with the privatisation proposal for Aer Rianta, I rejected it.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to privatise the railway lines, Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann. Instead, I am opening the markets to give the public a choice of using State or private transport operators. I reject this notion that private transport operators are shady and not in the same category as the State operators. It is a small country. The private operators are ordinary Irish taxpayers running businesses and giving employment. They are not pariahs but simply trying to make a living for their families and provide one for their employees. They should not be denigrated, as often happens in this House.</P>
    <P>Those against private sector involvement claim it is a principle. I have trouble with this argument because if a Member is left-wing, it is a principle.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, on addressing the fatal scourge of smoking in Ireland and prohibiting smoking in the workplace. Many of those arguing against the ban on smoking in the workplace seem to ignore the reason behind it. Some 7,500 people die every year as a result of smoking related illness. If we have to choose between saving lives and protecting publicans' profits we must choose lives every time.</P>
      <P>The adverse impact of tobacco consumption on health is well documented. Citizens are well aware of the threat tobacco smoke causes to their health and the majority support the Government's stance on this issue. This initiative is based on advice from health experts. There is consensus within the international scientific community and the World Health Organisation about the damaging effects of tobacco smoke and that there is no safe level of exposure to it.</P>
      <P>We cannot compromise on the health of employees. Those who suggest that there should be designated smoking areas ignore the fact that staff would still have to work in these areas. Tobacco smoke is not stagnant. It permeates the entire atmosphere of a room regardless of where the smoking takes place and without regard to areas designated as &ldquo;smoking&rdquo; or &ldquo;nonsmoking&rdquo;. This is not a realistic or acceptable option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" />We have heard people suggest that improvements in ventilation technology can deal with the problem of second-hand smoke. International research disagrees with this assertion. Numerous studies have concluded that even the best ventilation systems do not give workers adequate and full protection from the hazards of tobacco smoke. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the US and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists have concluded that even proposed new technologies, such as displacement ventilation systems, which may reduce exposure levels by 90%, still leave exposure levels which are 1,500 to 2,000 times the acceptable risk level for hazardous air pollutants. The expert group concluded that a smoking ban remains the only viable control measure to ensure that workers and patrons are protected from exposure to the byproducts of tobacco.</P>
    <P>The majority of Irish people do not smoke and it is the Government's duty to protect these people. Almost 70% of Irish people do not smoke. It is a pity that there are people in this country who put considerable time and effort into trying to stop this ban rather than embracing a plan that will save the lives of thousands of people every year.</P>
    <P>I welcome this amending Bill as it will strengthen the Act in a number of areas and will therefore protect it from any legal challenge. While vested interests may try to divert the debate from the core issue of health, there is no arguing with the fact highlighted by the lung experts that tobacco smoke is one of the major risk factors for death and disability in Europe. Not only does smoking kill about 7,000 people annually but it can also cause disease resulting in gangrene and amputation. Passive smoking has also been identified as a contributory cause of cot death.</P>
    <P>A recent report from the office of tobacco control indicates that the cost of smoking to the State amounts to about &euro;5 million per day. Not only will this ban save lives, but it will also save our economy money that we can put into other areas. It is not right to expose workers in Ireland to cigarette smoke that is as dangerous as asbestos.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's courageous and relentless determination to potentially save the lives of these workers. However, we must live in the real world. We cannot expect to impose the ban in places where people live. This does not just include private homes but also prisons, psychiatric hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, sleeping accommodation in hotels and guesthouses. I understand that exemptions must be made in these areas because they make sense.</P>

      <P>However, no other exemptions would be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, and section 19 contain standard provisions in respect of the Short Title, commencement and definitions of key terms used in the Bill. The maximum fine which may be imposed on a person guilty of an offence under section 47 has been increased from &euro;1,900 to &euro;3,000 while imprisonment has been removed as a penalty. The increase in the maximum fine is not particular to the smoking offence outlined in this Bill but is part of an increase in the level of fines for summary convictions generally.</P>
      <P>Having spoken to people in the catering industry and, in particular, to publicans, I am aware that they are concerned that they will bear the brunt of fines or imprisonment if a person is caught smoking in their establishment. I do not smoke and hope to see the day one can attend a function or spend an evening in the local pub or hotel without having to send one's clothes to the dry cleaners the next day or hang them out on the line.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment by the Office of Tobacco Control of a register of all persons who carry on, in whole or in part, the business of selling tobacco products by retail. It also makes provision to allow the charging of a fee by the office of social registration. The Bill prohibits certain marketing practices, including the sale by retail of cigarettes in packs of less than 20, the manufacture and supply for sale of oral, smokeless tobacco products, the sale of confectionery which resembles a tobacco product and is normally intended for children and the sale or supply of tobacco products which do not bear a warning as prescribed by the Minister. <Col N="299" />The sale or supply of tobacco products which do not bear a number in such form as may be prescribed by the Minister is also prohibited. All of these measures are welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Minister may prescribe the standards and requirements to be complied with in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. In addition, the office may require a manufacturer to provide information relating to the composition of proper tobacco products. It may also require the testing of tobacco products. Subject to certain requirements, the office may publish certain information and the results of tests. The Bill prohibits the making of certain claims about tobacco products and the sale of these products by means of self service. A derogation of the latter prohibition will be made for tobacco vending machines in licensed premises. These machines will be subject to regulations which will be made under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The sale of tobacco products to persons under 18 is banned and a provision is made whereby the Minister can prohibit and restrict smoking in specified places. We all welcome the prohibition on the purchase of cigarettes by persons under the age of 18. Unfortunately, there have been shopkeepers in many towns who sold one or two cigarettes to young people on their way to and from school. It is sad that people are greedy enough to sell individual cigarettes to young people.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for bringing forward the Public Health Tobacco (Amendment) Bill. The Bill represents the most comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation ever introduced in this country. It provides for a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays, and all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry. Provisions <Col N="300" />are made to introduce registration of tobacco retailers and tougher penalties for those convicted of sales to persons who are under age. The Bill includes a ban on retail sales of packets of cigarettes of less than 20, tighter controls on the sale of tobacco products from vending machines and a ban on the sale of confectioneries which resemble a tobacco product and are normally intended for children. The legislation will require the public disclosure of all aspect of tobacco, including its toxicity and addictive qualities. The Bill also improves protections against passive smoking.</P>
      <P>Tobacco smoking is very bad for public health. Medical evidence has repeatedly confirmed that smoking causes heart disease and stroke. It can also cause cancer and other health problems. Smoking tobacco products is one of the most unhealthy things a human can do. Life expectancy is lower in Ireland than the EU average. The diseases which primarily contribute to this are heart disease and cancer, and tobacco use is their leading cause. Smoking is a major factor in 90% of the 2,000 deaths caused by lung cancer each year. It also increases the risk of other cancers, including cancers of the mouth and throat. Smoking is also a primary cause of heart disease which is the greatest single cause of mortality in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Tobacco represents a significant burden to individual families and society through deaths, illness and medical costs. Reducing tobacco use will increase life expectancy and result in happier, healthier lives for many people. Year on year, evidence has been accumulated of the enormous worldwide threat to human health posed by the consumption of tobacco products. In recent years, studies carried out internationally have confirmed that there is a significant risk to the health of the non-smoker who inhales environmental tobacco smoke. This is referred to as passive smoking. I had my own bad experience in 1973 when my father died of lung cancer caused by chain smoking. I watched him for his last six months of life coughing and trying to get his breath as a result of his lungs giving up. I appeal to all smokers, especially young smokers, to give up the habit before it is too late. I do not want another family to go through the same experience we did in 1973 due to tobacco smoking.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children for putting the health of the people before anything else. I support his proposals for banning smoking in the workplace. It is the right way for the people of this country to have their health preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the Bill. I will put forward a different view and back it up with facts from the international and medical fields. I will challenge some of the points raised by Deputies earlier in the debate. I will put forward a different view that may not be politi<Col N="301" />cally correct or popular in this day and age, but I will call it as I see it and it will be a straight and comprehensive view.</P>
      <P>So far, we have not had a balanced discussion on this issue. The flow seems to be in one direction. We need to examine the facts clearly and see the reality. We also need to respect choice and reject the idea of a nanny state and health police trying to tell people over 18 what they should do in their personal lives. I represent the voices of working people over 18 who want a choice and would like to go to their local pub to have a pint and a cigarette. What is wrong with that? What is the big deal? The point was raised about vested interests. The only vested interests in this debate are people who want to go out and enjoy themselves in a social setting. Despite this, people want to remove it from them.</P>
      <P>I respect non-smokers and people who work in the trade. We can protect them and I will put forward proposals to do so but, above all, we must face the reality. Smoking is bad for a person, but too much of anything is bad for a person. Drinking is very bad for a person, as is over-eating. We have a crisis in this country with obesity. These are the realities so let us bring some balance into the discussion.</P>
      <P>Environmental tobacco smoke, or passive smoking as it is called, is classified as a human carcinogen by the World Health Organisation. The issue is not about the nature of a carcinogen but what it does. Almost everything we touch, eat and wash can be described as carcinogenic to some degree. I am sure that the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is aware of the number of carcinogens that are present in a cup of coffee, for example. Are we to ban coffee?</P>
      <P>On the figures of the numbers of deaths in Ireland, this is a matter about which the Government must be open and honest. A figure of 7,000 deaths in Ireland each year is widely quoted and was widely quoted in the debate as being attributed to tobacco-related illnesses. There is no scientific foundation for such a statement. However, we have all been fed this so often that we have begun to believe it. The figure relates to the number of deaths from cancers in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Let us study the figures. The National Cancer Registry of Ireland gives a figure of 7,500 deaths from cancer occurring every year. The most common cancers within this figure are skin, large bowel, lung, breasts in women and prostate in men. It does not indicate that these are due to smoking. These are the facts. The original assertion was a lie. A number of people have quoted this figure in recent months. However, like the figure of 7,000, it is lodged in the public mind and, unfortunately, many people believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware that the American Environmental Protection Agency study, which gave rise to this type of figure, was found <Col N="302" />by the federal courts in the United States of America to have, &ldquo;knowingly, wilfully, and aggressively, disseminated false information with far-reaching regulatory implications in the United States and worldwide&rdquo;. On account of this, the court ordered a summary judgment against the EPA and nullified the agency's environmental tobacco smoke, ETS, risk assessment.</P>
    <P>If one closely examines the expert report that was launched by two Ministers on the day the Minister for Health and Children announced his intention to introduce a ban, it was described by the Minister as being &ldquo;unequivocal in its requirement for such a ban&rdquo;. Clearly the Minister should examine the report in more detail. The report is couched in numerous caveats, such as &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;, &ldquo;could be&rdquo; and &ldquo;might be&rdquo;. On one matter it is clear. In its conclusions, it recommends further research to assess the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke, especially in the hospitality industry. The report states: &ldquo;that such a report is unequivocal in demanding a ban on smoking in the workplace, is bending the truth to an outrageous degree&rdquo;. These are the facts.</P>
    <P>We all support proper ventilation. It has been proved that it can be effective, even though listening to the debate in the Chamber and on radio and television, one would think ventilation was not an issue and that air supply could not be improved. The Minister's advisers have shied away from this claiming that outdated technology of one air change per house was ineffective. We moved on from that point years ago. We now have specifications in force for 12 air changes per house. There are pubs throughout the country certified by the health boards as a result of the six-year old, ongoing initiative for clean air in pubs. That is the reality. I accept that some pubs need to get their act together, but they should be targeted and put under pressure by the health boards. One should not blame the average working man or woman &ndash; the taxpayers of this country &ndash; for the inefficiencies of others.</P>
    <P>New studies are emerging about the efficiency of ventilation equipment, for example, the research carried out by the University of Glamorgan. Its research shows that ventilation can be highly effective at protecting bar staff and customers from the adverse effect of environmental tobacco smoke. In the United States, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory of Tennessee's study of restaurant and tavern workers in 16 cities and more than 1,500 subjects concluded a well-known toxicological principle that the poison is in the dose, and it is clear that the ETS dose is quite low for most people. A study carried out on ETS levels in the Canadian restaurant-pub, the Black Dog, indicated that ETS component concentrations in the non-smoking section were not substantially different from those measured in similar facilities where smoking was prohibited. The WHO suppressed its own 1998 survey results, <Col N="303" />which questioned the perceived health risks of ETS.</P>
    <P>On 16 May, the <i>British Medical Journal</i> published a major peer-reviewed study on the health impact of ETS in California. This major analysis, based on 118,000 California adult studies from 1959 to 1998, concluded that the results of the Californian CPS 1 cohort did not support a casual relation between exposure to ETS and tobacco-related mortality, although a small effect was not ruled out. Given the limitations of the underlying data on this and other studies of ETS, and the small size of the risk, it seems premature to conclude that ETS causes death from coronary heart disease or cancer.</P>
    <P>The editor of the <i>British Medical Journal</i> decided it would be a form of scientific misconduct not to publish this study. The research was initially commissioned by the American Cancer Society which then refused to publish it when it discovered the results. It was eventually published with funding from the tobacco industry. I accept that point. It is a fair comment. However, the Health and Safety Authority now claims that it was tobacco industry research, when it was first published in the <i>British Medical Journal.</i>Let us be honest and open in this debate. I will take criticism directed at me on the question of smoking and health and I will accept the reality, but I also urge people to listen to the debate. The Government's position was taken on the basis of misleading, selective and cherry-picked scientific evidence with all contrary evidence being suppressed. That is my point in the debate. If we are claiming to be democrats, we must be open. If one is claiming to be a progressive democrat one must be twice as open.</P>
    <P>Reliance is placed, even in the expert report, on experts who have lost credibility. One such expert, James Repace, was the individual who sought to prove that 150 bar workers died in Ireland every year from the effects of environmental tobacco smoke. He now recognises that this as a lie, so that figure should be disregarded.</P>
    <P>As someone who likes a drink and a cigarette &ndash; I will be open and admit that I smoke &ndash; I mix regularly in public houses and talk to bar workers, some 60% of whom in this State smoke. Despite this, people who claim to represent them and lecture the nation on the issue have not even asked them for their views. I do not think it is a very democratic state of affairs. I would also criticise the ICTU in that regard, because it did not consult its members on the issue. There should be a broader debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>The proposed ban is based on a selective reading of the report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace. More research is needed into the level of exposure of Irish workers to such smoke. The health effects of environmental tobacco smoke are far from <Col N="304" />proven, according to many studies. Those who have come to the conclusion that a smoking ban is the only option have not engaged in a thorough examination of the alternative control measures that could be put in place, such as quality ventilation or smoking rooms. Some sensible suggestions have been put forward. Why should there not be designated areas where people can have a cigarette and a drink? There is no big problem in that regard. Such a measure would protect staff. Why are the ordinary people being hammered again? I refer to the working men and women who pay their taxes and want to have a break every now and then.</P>
    <P>In arriving at the decision to ban smoking, sufficient consideration has not been given to advances in technology which reduce environmental tobacco smoke levels by more than 90%. The report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace, commissioned by the Health and Safety Authority and the Office of Tobacco Control, acknowledges that the number of studies with direct observation of occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is limited.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children should assess the economic impact of the proposed smoking ban. It is difficult to quantify this impact, but there are serious grounds for concern. I know from travelling in European countries like Italy and Spain that people from such countries will think twice about coming here after the ban has been introduced. They come to Ireland to enjoy particular dimensions of life in this country, such as music and social interaction. We do not have the sun &ndash; we have plenty of rain &ndash; but we have pubs, music and social interaction. When I spoke to people in Italy earlier this year, a common theme was the level of social interaction in Ireland. People from such countries like to go to Irish pubs to have a drink and a cigarette in peace, but the Minister is telling them that they will not be able do so. I do not wish to engage in scare tactics, but I advise the Minister to pay attention to next year's tourist figures. Tour operators, particularly those bringing tourists from continental Europe and short break visitors from Britain, have expressed concerns that the proposed ban will substantially reduce the volume of their business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although I am critical of the Government and taking a politically incorrect view, I am also putting forward suggestions that can bring some balance to the debate. At least 50% of each area of a hotel, for example, could be clearly designated as a non-smoking area. I accept that the bar and service counters, where there is a concentration of staff, should be strictly non-smoking areas and that effective air handling and ventilation systems should be in place to provide at least 12 air changes per hour. The performance and maintenance of air handling and ventilation systems <Col N="305" />should be subject to technical certification, similar to the present certification system for passenger lifts. Clear evidence of the proper maintenance of air handling equipment should be kept on record and made available to health and safety inspectors. Hotel bedroom literature should include leaflets outlining the harm which tobacco smoking could cause. Such sensible suggestions should be considered during this debate, but the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, and others who want to introduce a new nanny state will not take account of them.</P>
    <P>I respect the rights of non-smokers such as Deputy Callanan, who spoke earlier about his genuine health concerns. Just as non-smokers should always be facilitated, they should accept the rights of other people. I have said that I do not want to live in a nanny state. We should be able to accommodate each other. The State should be keen to accommodate difference, but the Government is not keen to accommodate the 35% of people who smoke. It will not surrender to those of us who are being hammered. This statement applies equally to other policy areas. There is plenty of room for compromise on this issue. I have urged the Government to carry out the research required from its own report and to consult fully with everybody.</P>
    <P>The Government should talk to everybody rather than giving its opinions and lecturing the nation, as such an approach does not work. I have been surprised by the approach that has been adopted. The Minister thought that it was a trendy and popular issue to pursue, while distracting the public from the problems in our hospitals, such as waiting lists. He is engaging in the politics of distraction. I feel that a sensible and productive agreement can be reached which avoids the problems with the current proposal.</P>
    <P>Science and truth have been manipulated and betrayed in pursuit of what the perpetrators believe is a legitimate cause &ndash; to discourage smoking. This is a clear case of the end justifying the means, regardless of the cost to society. I ask the public to listen to all the arguments that have been made before making an informed decision.</P>
    <P>I support sections 4 to 18 of the Bill. Section 4 relates to the &ldquo;prohibition of advertising of tobacco products&rdquo; and section 8 provides for the &ldquo;prohibition of certain marketing practices&rdquo;. I accept that people under the age of 18 have to be defended and that we have to be very careful. There is a need for legislation to deal with the retail sale of packets of less than 20 cigarettes and certain marketing practices.</P>
    <P>As the title of the Bill suggests, this is a public health issue. We have a duty to promote public health, but we should not be distracted from certain issues by blaming those who enjoy a cigarette and a pint. There are between 35 and 40 people on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital, which is in my <Col N="306" />constituency. Why are such people on waiting lists? I do not want to be told that the people in question are smokers. Having visited the hospital and spoken to patients many times, I know that 99% of the illnesses for which patients on trolleys are being treated are not related to smoking. I ask the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to get off the stage in that respect.</P>
    <P>My understanding of public health relates to protecting society, defending patients and improving the health services. Although the Government has been in power for almost seven years, over two terms, some people cannot even get a bed in a hospital. It is a disgrace. We should take a reality check when we discuss these issues.</P>
    <P>We should wake up to the real problems, such as disability services. I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is present because I have tormented him about this issue for the last six months. Such issues need to be dealt with. While I welcome the fact that last week's budget provided an additional &euro;25 million, when one speaks to families and the almost 2,800 people who are on waiting lists, one is told that another &euro;10 million is needed. The reality is that people with intellectual disabilities and their families were seeking &euro;35 million, but they were given &euro;25 million. The Government gave &euro;15 million to Punchestown, which was absolutely over the top.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the serious and comprehensive Hanly report in this context. Although this is supposed to be a public health debate, nobody has mentioned the golden hour &ndash; the first hour after a person is injured, for example in a traffic accident. The Government proposes to move certain services from communities. Most GPs and medical personnel say that there is higher chance of saving a patient's life if he or she is treated in the first hour. This is a public health issue. The Government proposes to relocate services so that it will take people two or three hours to get to a hospital. It is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I will not take any lectures from the health police about the realities. If one speaks to ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors and people in rural areas, one will be told that the golden hour is very important. I am quite lucky because I live in an urban area which is within ten minutes of Beaumont Hospital or the Mater Hospital. People in other parts of the country have to drive for two hours to get to a hospital. The Government is walking away from these issues rather than discussing them. It will not even question them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the rights of workers. As somebody who has been active in the trade union movement for 20 years, I respect the rights of workers. Most of the workers I have met have not been consulted about the proposed ban. Some 60% of workers have said that they will live with a compromise on the smoking issue. Some <Col N="307" />of them would love to see such a compromise. I know of many non-smokers who like to go to bars to have a pint and to enjoy the smell and atmosphere of smoke. One does not hear that mentioned very often. It seems that people are afraid to say it. I will not take any lectures on morality or health in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope that prisons and psychiatric hospitals will be excluded from the proposed smoking ban. When I spoke to a psychiatric nurse recently, I was told that assaults on staff would increase by 50% if patients no longer had the right to sit down and have a smoke. Serious problems in prisons and hospitals have often been defused when a member of staff gave a cigarette to a person to help him or her to calm down for five minutes. Such problems were resolved in a peaceful manner. Nurses have expressed their concern to me that the Minister's proposals will aggravate matters.</P>
    <P>I referred to old folk who have worked all their lives, many of whom are in their 90s. I do not accept that the Minister should decide they cannot have the right to enjoy a drink or a cigarette, whether they be in old folk's homes or at home. The Minister's ideas are off the wall.</P>
    <P>In the area of advertising we have a duty to protect citizens. They must be given the correct information. Children must also be protected as they have rights. Adults, however, have rights as citizens. They should always have the right to make decisions. We are supposed to live in a democratic society, though some of us would even question that. There are now people who tell us regularly what we can do in our private and social lives. We must broaden this debate and listen to the facts. I welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill and put the other side of the case.</P>

When the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced that he would impose a total ban on the sale and distribution of tobacco products in public houses and many other public places, he was taking a very hard line on what had been common practice among our citizens up to then. He regularly and stridently asserted that there would be no dilution whatsoever of his campaign or his determination to ensure that there would be no exemptions to the imposition of the ban on tobacco products in the various places he outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Minister has diluted the original proposal so much that it must be embarrassing for him to look back at his original speech where he set out his intention to have a total ban. In the hospitality industry, the landlord of the property rather than the customer must police the rules, <Col N="308" />which makes the Bill an interesting step into the unknown. It is ironic that, if one broke the law as provided the Bill and suffered the penalty of jail, that might be the only occasion when one could smoke a cigarette, because of the exemption for people in prison.</P>
    <P>The types of changes that have been made to the Minister's original intentions have caused it to degenerate into a farce. He wanted to be whiter than white and stronger and more coherent in his determination to ban tobacco smoking throughout the country than his counterparts in any other member state of the EU. He wanted to go further than anyone else to make his name by banning tobacco smoking throughout the State in public houses and places of work and recreation. I am not surprised that he has run into difficulties with this, considering that he could not gain the support or backing of his own Cabinet colleagues or Ministers of State in his own party. No sooner had his proposals hit the airwaves than his own Cabinet colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, was out of the traps to ensure a rethink of the ban. Notwithstanding that, even more hypocritical was the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey. The lie&mdash;</P>

      <P>It set out to be a courageous Bill, but it has now been diluted so much that there will be many places to smoke, including prison, which the Minister originally intended should be included under the ban.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is supporting the Bill in the interests of public health, and we would like the Government to support Fine Gael in its implementation rather than kow-tow politically to the frightened 40 whom we recently saw signing petitions to the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party on other issues. This indicates that the Government is not at one over a great deal of current legislation, including this Bill and the issue of decentralisation. There is much division in the Government at present, while, at the behest of the publicans, the Bill has generated heated argument around the country. In particular, it has surfaced at political meetings.</P>

      <P>I have reservations about asking the owner of the property, or the landlord licensed to trade from it, to do what amounts to the job of environmental health officers. That will not be workable. Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned that many of the workers in those establishments have had reservations about the implementation of the Bill, and perhaps their union, Mandate, was not representing their views totally accurately, since it has said at national level that it is in favour of it. I welcome that. Ultimately the only way to police it is peer pressure from customers who will insist that those sitting beside them do not smoke. That is perhaps how it should be formulated in the Bill, rather than expecting the publican and his staff to impose the law of the land on his premises through thick and thin. That principle signals to me that we are gradually heading towards a police state. We are expecting others to implement the provisions of this legislation, as well as the Intoxicating Liquor Act.</P>

      <P>Even though we are getting a second opportunity to implement the regulations in the context of this Bill &ndash; I welcome the fact that it is a public health Bill &ndash; the exemptions and changes dilute the original intention to the extent that it may be a completely different Bill from that originally drafted. The Minister came under enormous pressure from legal advice, as seems to be the case in many aspects of legislation when the legal advice from the Attorney General or the Parliamentary Counsel comes into play at the eleventh hour, making Bills completely different from what was originally envisaged. This happened this week with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill. At the 11th hour, the Attorney General suggested that the Tánaiste table an amendment which completely changes the tone and content of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate if the EU has given approval to these regulations and, if not, when will it do so? We expect the implementation of these regulations in the context of the approximation of laws and the implementation of various directives at EU level. If negotiations have taken place, when will there be agreement on a Common Position among member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome section 13 which bans the sale of tobacco products on our streets. This practice has been carried out for many years by people on <Col N="311" />O'Connell Street, Henry Street and others throughout the city. Although Finance Bills tried to deal with this a number of times, I am glad this Bill deals with the issue to give certainty to the ban on the sale of tobacco products on streets. This activity was generating considerable income for paramilitaries and criminal groups which used these products to launder money on the street. At the same time, retailers of such products have to pay rates and wages and compete with them.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael accepts the legislation and the fact that we cannot have passive smoking, given the reports from the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

He will also be able to ensure that the staff required to implement this Bill will be put in place and that it will be workable. We should revisit how we will impose the proposed sanctions on landlords and people renting property in the sale and distribution of products in regard to the smoking ban. It is a serious imposition on landlords that, through no fault of their own, a person could light up in a public house and the landlord would have to bear the consequences.</P>

    <P>It is of concern that the introduction of the Bill <Col N="312" />did not comply with EU regulations because it has created uncertainty. It questions the will of the Government in regard to the legislation's introduction, although I do not question the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, we heard that the Government will bring forward the legislation to establish the inspectors in April or May. Why was that not done at the same time as this Bill? It would have made sense for both Bills to be taken together. However, this Bill will come into force at the end of February but the legislation for the policing of it will not be published until April or May and, given how long it takes to process legislation, may not be passed until after the summer. This casts doubt on the Government's will to examine the full picture in respect of the European aspect and the policing of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be fair. No doubts have been cast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Deputies have pointed out, publicans have credibility in regard to policing the legislation and are now subject to a fine of &euro;3,000. I note that the penalty of imprisonment has been removed and a fine of &euro;3,000 is being introduced. While many publicans might not have a problem with such a fine, I know many who would, particularly in rural areas where many bars only open at 9 p.m. Such a fine would have an enormous effect on rural publicans in areas in which it will be more difficult to comply with the smoking ban because many customers are elderly and have limited choices, as opposed to cities where there are choices. Publicans will now have to insist that those people stop smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we fully support the Bill, the fact that publicans will be fined if they do not implement it is problematic. There is also a danger that people who are drunk and highly charged may become violent if a publican insists they stop smoking. Nevertheless, it is necessary to eliminate smoking in the workplace and we hope that, over a period of years, it will be eliminated in all workplaces. The Government should set a target of five or ten years over which smoking would be slowly eliminated from the areas which have been exempted, since prison officers, psychiatric nurses, prisoners and psychiatric patients have a right to a smoke-free atmosphere. We fully appreciate why, at this stage, implementing it on a blanket basis will not work in those areas and will create hardship. However, the principle is now established and there should be a long-term plan to phase out smoking. The ultimate objective is that smoking would be eliminated rather <Col N="313" />than banned after people realise how harmful the effects of smoking are.</P>

      <P>I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children which examined smoking and its impact on health. One woman who appeared before the committee was in a wheelchair and almost required a ventilator because of smoking. The woman required constant treatment just to stay alive and she was only in her 50s. She came before the committee to tell us the effect smoking had on her life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with those who try to claim that smoking does not affect one's health, but I respect their right to do so. However, they are wrong and they are misleading people who may be influenced by those who make such claims.</P>
      <P>I welcome the principle behind the Bill. The Joint Committee on Health and Children was unanimous in stating in its report that smoking is a cost on the basis that it affects people's enjoyment of life, particularly in their latter years. It is also a cost to the State, to taxpayers and, in the main, to the Department of Health and Children which must deal with people who have tobacco related illnesses.</P>
      <P>There are some doctors who believe that a person who is ill due to the fact that they smoke should be treated differently from someone who is also ill but who does not smoke. I do not subscribe to that but one can sometimes understand their point of view. It has been stated that, in the case of waiting lists, preference should be given, in terms of obtaining hospital treatment, to people who do not smoke and who look after themselves physically. I do not share this view but it has been put on numerous occasions to the committee of which I am a member by those who are involved in the medical area.</P>
      <P>This matter was debated during the summer and Government backbenchers openly commented on it. Headlines appeared in my local newspaper about my colleague in Limerick West and his view that the ban should not be instituted. To say the least, this debate distracted people's attention from the grave difficulties being experienced in the health area.</P>

      <P>My point relates to waiting lists. It is not acceptable that hospital authorities should have to complain that they are obliged to deal with patients in the back of ambulances in hospital yards as was the case during the summer. We should have been debating these issues at that time. The Minister of State can shake his head but, being a representative of a Dublin constituency, he is familiar with the problem. In the mid-west regional hospital in Limerick, people are obliged to wait hours to be seen in the accident and emergency department. Such delays would not be acceptable in the private sector but they are unavoidable because of the lack of investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

      <P>Yes. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, particularly in the aftermath of the contribution of Deputy Finian McGrath which I followed with some interest. It was refreshing to hear a politically incorrect approach from the Deputy. I welcome his initiative in this regard because it is only when one hears both sides to an argument that one can tease out the substance of a debate. The Deputy's contribution, which ran contrary to almost everything previous speakers had stated, has added a great deal to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I enjoyed the Deputy's approach because, perhaps like him, I see myself as a tobacco addict. I must admit that I will go to my grave a smoker. I <Col N="316" />do not smoke at present but I still wake up each morning and admit to myself, in my heart of hearts, that I am addicted to tobacco. Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are supposed to wake each day and admit that they are addicted to alcohol. I must admit that I will forever be addicted to tobacco.</P>
    <P>I do not smoke anymore. I grew up a couple of years ago when the advent of married life steadied my outlook and enabled me to give up the demon cigarettes. If I am in a pub, however, and have had a couple of pints and cigarette smoke drifts into my nostrils and thence, through my capillaries, into my blood, filling my veins with nicotine, the first thing I want is a cigarette.</P>
    <P>While, on one hand, I am turned off by the obnoxious smell of tobacco smoke and the fact that smoking is a disgusting habit, on the other hand I must admit that tobacco is my friend because it relieves the craving I, as a smoker, feel and relaxes me. Even though I know in my heart and mind that smoking increases my blood pressure, quickens my pulse and sickens my stomach, it satisfies that part of my brain that feels tobacco is its friend and it relieves a craving.</P>
    <P>We must recognise in debating this Bill that former smokers and smokers will find it difficult to accept this legislation. On the one hand a little devil will be telling them we are taking away their friend while on the other a rationale voice will be telling them tobacco is not good for them and that it is not fair or right that a non-smoker should have to inhale their smoke. That is the real essence of this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finian McGrath said his civil liberties are being infringed when he is prevented, following a hard day at work, from relaxing, having a pint, breathing in tobacco and having that lovely therapeutic sense that only an addicted smoker, as I was, has when satisfying his or her craving. Deputy McGrath should also recognise the right of the 70% plus people in the population who are equally entitled not to have to inhale smoke into their veins while in the pub. His contribution was interesting and important. It will always be difficult to make the direct causal link to show the exact number of deaths caused and the illnesses suffered by bar staff who inhale cigarette smoke.</P>
    <P>It is always difficult to legislate on matters such as this. One is always on a knife edge in terms of whether one is being excessive and when one should react to scientific information. Increasingly, the 70% of the population who do not smoke feel, regardless of scientific evidence, that they have a right to have a pint in a pub and not to have to inhale smoke into their lungs. That is why this measure, while certain provisions of it are very controversial, has been politically popular and welcomed. Most citizens feel this is the right thing to do. We will have to wait and see. We are in an experimental era. I believe this legislation may lead to an increase in the number <Col N="317" />of people going to pubs and restaurants because they will be healthier and cleaner environments. However, we will not know until this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Government, in terms of its management of this legislation, has sent out mixed messages, particularly in regard to its introduction. There was obvious confusion about whether the Taoiseach believed in his Minister and whether he would back up and carry out this measure. He now seems intent on following through on what he said. It is unfortunate the legislation will not come into force in January when most people expected it would be introduced. If it is not introduced, because of EU regulations, until later in the year, that will send out a message of poor Government and poor management of our affairs. I regret that.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to my addiction as a smoker, why I was addicted and what happened to make me become a smoker. It is important to analyse why a large percentage of our population continue to smoke, given all we know about its effects on health, the messages we have sent out and the restrictions we have put in place. One explanation that made sense to me, as a confirmed former smoker, was in a sense a Freudian analysis of why people take up smoking. People will say it is difficult to smoke that first cigarette, that it is not natural to take a stick of chemicals, burn it and inhale its fumes and that it tastes horrible and makes one feel sick. Unfortunately, it puts the addictive drug into one's bloodstream and once there the body will always cry out for it, ensuring the person remains addicted.</P>
    <P>The Freudian explanation sets out why we begin that process and what makes a 14, 15 or 16 year old person take up smoking. I do not remember who presented the argument but it pointed out that when smoking at a young age, people are saying to the opposite sex, &ldquo;Look how healthy I am, look at the fine specimen of a human being I am that I can actually take this poison. I am such a strong male, or female, that I can ingest this rubbish and remain strong and healthy.&rdquo;  That, to me, made a certain amount sense. Showing off to the opposite sex is the main reason many people take up smoking. Looking back to my early teens, that might have been the reason I began smoking. It is those types of deep rooted factors that contribute to people taking up smoking. We must continue to address this issue.</P>
    <P>We will not achieve a reduction in the number of people smoking by introducing strict regulations. We must work at clever psychological advertising tactics which point out that smoking is not sexy. It is very difficult to stop smoking and to rid oneself of the minute by minute, day by day, need to ingest the chemical into one's veins. Advertisements relating to death or to people having lung cancer do not work. What I thought worked was the advertisement, made two or three <Col N="318" />years ago, which put out the view that smoking is not sexy. It contained a character whose teeth were blackened and stained by cigarette smoke. That was a very strong and successful advertising campaign. We need to continue in that line as well as putting in place legislation and restrictions like the ones with which we are dealing today. We need to target people, particularly females, at a young age by illustrating that smoking is not sexy, that they do not need to smoke to be seen as an adult or fit person. We should demonstrate that it is far sexier not to smoke.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy McGrath's contribution. He said all addicts will feel they are being restricted by this nanny State. I hope they will also realise that smoking is not good for them and that it is not fair that the person sitting opposite has to inhale their smoke. Deputy McGrath should recognise the right of non-smokers to have a drink and to work in a smoke-free environment. That is the reason this Bill is being supported by all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>If the famous North American Indians had had the benefit and inspiration of the current Government in terms of smoking they would have survived as a serious entity for a lot longer. If Cochise, Mangas Coloradas or Crazy Horse had been able to call on the current Government in their pursuit of perfecting deflection and decoy through the use of smoke they would have been very successful and would be leaders in their society to this date. Unfortunately, they did not have the assistance of this Government or its inspirers. They were left to using smoke signals which, occasionally, became entangled and often sent out the wrong signals.</P>
      <P>That is not the case in this instance. The Government wrung its hands and tore its hair and wondered what it could do to deflect public attention from the real issue of delivering health services. The Government met with its well-paid political consultants who had obviously been watching old western films and thought of the smoke signals. They felt it could be done with smoke and mirrors.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his advisers sat in a circle and decided they were going to protect the people from themselves and proposed a smoking ban that turned out not to be a ban at all. My party generally supported what the Government suggested. We did so presuming that the Government intended doing what it set out to do. The Government's intention has now become vague, hence the confused smoke signals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister announced that this measure was good for the people and that he was going to enforce it. Suggestions were made that it might be difficult to enforce and police, but the Minister dismissed these and said he had the answers. Then the Minster for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, <Col N="319" />Deputy Cullen, rose up from the benches and said this would not happen on his watch. Other members of the front, back and nether benches took up his cry. While these benches are currently empty, I know the Members are here in spirit. Each Member in turn said this could not be allowed or tolerated.</P>
    <P>A smoker like me will weigh up an issue such as this, but for the general good of public health, one has to come down on the side of the righteous, whether or not they are correct. Perhaps they are simply being politically correct. How was the Government able to give so many confusing signals while pretending that everyone was on the same side? The North American Indians did not perfect deflectors and decoys to the same extent as the current Government. The Government succeeded in creating controversy about smoking in public places. The Government then asked itself whether it would support its own proposal. The reason this Bill has come before the House for a second time is that the Government was not sure that it would be able to see through its own proposals. Parts of the legislation had to be submitted to Brussels to be tested on equality grounds etc. The public is asking whether this Bill will ever be enforced and what is the Government's exact intention. The message the Government has given is that it is not serious about this. It is merely a smoke and mirrors method of deflecting public attention from real issues.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Finian McGrath said, smoking is definitely not good for one. I know this, as I am a sinner in this regard; I am not perfect and have never pretended to be. Unfortunately, many others in this country are not perfect either. Too much drinking is also bad for one. Jesus changed water into wine and I do not recall that He ever did the reverse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is relevant. Others have spoken about the police state and the politically correct society we propose to have. The Government proposes to superimpose itself on the wills, ways and lives of the people, either through this measure or by other means. I have a sense of deep unease about where we are heading. There may have to be a smoke police. The Minister for Health and Children has suggested that we should have a fat police to police those that are slightly overweight. I will not go so far as to say where that might end.</P>
      <P>The public feels this measure will become an Irish solution to an Irish problem, that no one will enforce the Bill and that everyone will have a different interpretation of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that while many inspirational thoughts can be gleaned from his side of the House, I will not outline them now.</P>
      <P>If the public concludes that the Government is not serious about what it is doing, as seems to be the case given the various opinions it has espoused, this measure will not work and we are only going through a charade. If this is the case, we must ask how far we are prepared to proceed with this proposal.</P>
      <P>The public thinks that smoking in public places cannot be stopped and that smokers are to be thrown on to the streets. As things currently stand, one cannot smoke at home as one may have a problem there, one may smoke in one's car and one certainly cannot smoke in a public place. While I understand this, where are the addicted going to be pushed? While I have no difficulty in not smoking for two or three days, some people cannot do this.</P>
      <P>Exceptions are now being made. Prior to this, the Minister said there would be no exceptions and that the measure would be enforced in all cases. What is going to happen to staff who are employed in places where the exceptions are being made? Earlier in the summer, people suggested to the Minister that exceptions might be made in the case of prisons, nursing homes &ndash; as elderly people felt they were entitled to their addiction at this late stage of their lives &ndash; and other places. The Minister initially refused to consider this and only came up with this notion late in the day. I received a letter from a relative of an elderly nursing home patient. This elderly man was deeply distressed at the thought that he would not be allowed to have an occasional cigarette. The message that what being sold originally was totally different to the message that is being sold now. If no exception to the ban was so centrally important to the success of the legislation, what are the Minister's thoughts on the proposal before us? I am not saying I am opposed to this proposal and I understand exceptions have to be made. If such high stock is set on the need to enforce this ban without exceptions, where does it leave the Minister now that exceptions are acceptable to the Government?</P>
      <P>Other speakers have suggested that it might have been better had the Government decided to phase in the ban from the very beginning and to designate smoking zones in public houses and restaurants. This would have worked well, although it might not have been quick enough or politically correct. Furthermore, it would have given people time to get used to the ban and adapt their lifestyles to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what will happen but I hope young smokers are not pushed out of hostelries <Col N="321" />on to the streets. This has happened in other jurisdictions and it is not a good thing, no matter what we may think. A means should be found to ensure it does not happen here. I will not suggest to the Government how it should go about this but it is its responsibility to find a way. It was so self-righteous when the ban was first contemplated that it believed the right approach was to be totally on the side of enforcement. It could even have banned smoking altogether, which would have solved all the problems.</P>
    <P>There are country areas with very few entertainment facilities, especially in the winter, or places where people can go to have a drink. People go to the pub to have a drink and sometimes to play cards, snooker or pool. This is their way of life and they may have difficulty pursuing it if they smoke and if the regulations are to be enforced in the way indicated. Some will say the rules were changed because smoking is bad for one and that this can be proven. This is fine, but other things are also bad for us. Forcing young people on to the streets is certainly not a great idea. The Government should have regard to some of the side issues that will have an impact in this area.</P>
    <P>This legislation is directed at the public to protect their health. They all accept that smoking is not good for them and that it should be curtailed and eliminated as soon as possible. However, some suggest that deaths allegedly caused by the carcinogens in smoke will be prevented when the smoking ban is introduced. This is not true, as Deputy Finian McGrath stated. Such deaths will continue. Let us not be too self-righteous. Those who wish to be politically correct should recognise that people will die from the very same smoking-related illnesses after the introduction of the ban. However, I accept the principle of the legislation, provided it is realistic, workable and not written on a tablet of stone as if it were the result of divine inspiration and as if one would be condemned to exterior darkness for all time and not a true and responsible citizen if one did not follow the line pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>If the great native American leaders had had the benefit and inspiration of the smoke detectors and deflectors available to the present Administration, they would have succeeded, although I know Crazy Horse had a fair amount of success without help from any quarter. It is probable that they would now be part and parcel of leading society. Maybe they would even have been converted to the same line of thinking as the Government in respect of smoking, even though they were and still are very well-known participants in that particular area.</P>
    <P>Two views obtain in respect of the smoking ban. This first is that one should live and let live. The second &ndash; the purest view of today &ndash; is that we should stop smoking. We accept the latter view but one must include a proviso that when <Col N="322" />we proceed in this direction we should be realistic, take cognisance of established practices and achieve our objective without causing too much discontent and disruption to society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>We fret obsessively over the health of the economy. We monitor rates of growth, inflation, unemployment and a host of other indicators but we need to remind ourselves that economics is a means rather than an end. It is time to hold the Government to account regarding the health of the people as well as that of the economy. It is very important that we do so. I compliment the Minister on addressing the public health concern regarding smoking because it was necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>The public health service provides a vital safety net when we are ill, but in practice it makes a relatively small contribution to protecting and promoting positive health and well-being and preventing premature death. Most people understand and accept the role of the State in safeguarding our health by, for instance, insisting on acceptable standards of food hygiene in the hospitality industry, prohibiting driving whilse under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or requiring compliance with speed limits on our roads. Few would argue that involvement of the State in these areas represents an unacceptable infringement of our personal freedom or interference with our civil liberties.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, however, when the State intervenes to protect the health of the population in a way that threatens commercial vested interests, the spectre of the nanny state is raised and the notion that the State should not interfere with our personal choice in matters related to health. The debate on the imminent ban on smoking in the workplace, including bars and restaurants, provides a clear example of this phenomenon. Smoking causes approximately 5 billion deaths world-wide each year, including approximately 7,000 deaths in Ireland. As a cause of death in this country, smoke dwarfs all other factors in our external environment. Paradoxically, our reaction is muted because deaths from smoking are so common.</P>
      <P>Faced with a Minister for Health and Children who is genuinely committed to tackling this scourge, opponents claim he should focus on the real problems of the health service, such as waiting lists and over-crowded accident and emergency departments. The need for adequate access to high-quality health services for all is clear and we should not underestimate the challenges we face in this area. However, it is time to broaden the debate on health from its almost exclusive and obsessive focus on health services to encompass a wider agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chorus of criticism, bordering on ridicule, that greeted the recent suggestion by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, chairman of the Oireachtas Sub-Com<Col N="323" />mittee on Health and Smoking, that Ireland should consider a fat tax illustrates the challenge we face in this area. Specific proposals for taxes on food items would need careful consideration, as they might be socially regressive. Deputy O'Keeffe should be commended for initiating a debate on the important topic of obesity, which is now regarded by the World Health Organisation as a dominant global health issue.</P>
    <P>I can speak from experience as a licensee operating a small hotel and licensed restaurant, while my family operates a bar. People are somewhat disappointed with Tadhg O'Sullivan's health grounds argument on behalf of the vintners. He was ill-advised to take on the World Health Organisation on the risks to public health of smoking in bars when discussing the detrimental effect that the tobacco ban would have on the licensed trade. The opposite may be the case and a positive line should be taken on this public health issue, though that might not be applauded by the vintners. We spend a lot on health services but preventative medicine and public health awareness and education in schools are also important.</P>
    <P>From working in the retail trade I know that many young people, from college age down, are smoking. In my experience huge numbers of them are doing so. Public health education is very important. The Minister should consider producing a video to educate those in schools and colleges, given the level of addiction to alcohol and tobacco among young people. This should be done at national school level, where the temptation starts. This was discussed during the Private Members' debate on obesity, though the Minister will be hoping for results with the older generation of people who are hooked on smoking in bars.</P>
    <P>The licensing laws introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may be difficult to implement and while the Garda have indicated they will not police this ban, it should be administered through the health boards. However, the ban can be self-policing and the reaction of the trade should be good, as people will be able to enjoy themselves in a smoke-free environment. It will distinguish Ireland as having taken the lead on a public health issue, particularly as every year 7,000 people, almost 150 people per week, die from illnesses solely attributed to smoking. People do not realise that.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to be decisive and to police this from the start. He is beginning to concentrate on public health and this gives the message that he wants to educate people about preventative health and extending their lifespans through diet, controlling their alcohol consumption and so on. I welcome the fact that the message is being given that smoking knocks years off one's life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" />I was disappointed by the vested interests in this area, notably the hoteliers and restaurateurs. Some people, including politicians, were intimidated by statements that trade would be so damaged that pubs would have to close down. That is totally off the mark and if people took a positive attitude they would see that this move should open up a whole new market.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that by 2030 almost 50% of the US population will meet the current criteria for clinical obesity. Ireland is not far behind the US in this area, with approximately one quarter of middle-aged men and women exceeding the clinical obesity threshold and clear evidence of an emerging epidemic of obesity in childhood and adolescence. As a society we must choose between taking measures to tackle this epidemic or simply watching it unfold. If, as seems likely, we take the latter option, we had better plan for major increases in resources for patients with obesity-related diabetes and kidney failure and we will need to match our US cousins in facilities for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity. Although our health and life expectancy have improved steadily over the past century, it is not an immutable law of nature that these favourable trends will continue in an environment designed to maximise calorie intake and restrict opportunities for exercise.</P>
    <P>I believe in the promotion of public health and the Minister should spend some of his &euro;10 billion budget promoting exercise and education in public health. The Government's obsession with spending can be seen from the Hanly, Brennan and Prospectus reports, as well as the health strategy document. I heard Mr. David Hanly at a debate on his report last week and I was disappointed by the lack of accurate costings, though that is a matter for another debate. If one is talking about investing in public health, a public health programme dealing with schools in every health board area is vital, as is advertising on the national airwaves. The Minister's work on dietary awareness and food promotion, restricting advertising, and public health awareness would pay off in five or ten years' time, when the State would save huge amounts of money.</P>
    <P>The level of objections to the smoking ban arose from people being indoctrinated with the belief that it interfered with their privacy. However, we must look at public health in the context of the economy and preventative medicine is important in that regard.</P>
    <P>Food advertising for children is geared towards the wrong kinds of food. As a retailer, I know that if one looks at the shopping baskets of those on lower incomes, they are full of Coke, crisps and other high fat products. That is down to education, because one rarely sees them buying fish or fruit products. Though those products are good value for money, they are seldom bought.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" />A parallel promotion could be done with the Department of Social and Family Affairs on getting good value for one's social welfare payments. A total of &euro;10 billion has been allocated for social welfare payments. Analyses of spending are alarming as people purchase dear products with low food content which is bad from a dietary and public health point of view. The Minister should conduct a public health promotion through the social welfare system because it would not cost a fortune. A public health awareness campaign could be aimed at the lowest social class in terms of spending. The people concerned smoke excessively and purchase the worst food products, which generate significant profits for retailers, as none of them is in the top 20 products in terms of value for money. Advertisers and retailers are priming people because their stock comprises products that will cause significant health problems.</P>
    <P>Following several decades of research, preventive strategies focused on alerting the population to the health problems of obesity and advising people to eat less and exercise more will not turn the tide of this epidemic. In the context of the obesity epidemic in childhood, it is estimated that in 1999 the food industry in the United Kingdom spent £300 million on creating advertisements designed to capture children's imaginations and specifically to encourage them to buy or ask for foods high in sugar, salt and fat &ndash; the three killers.</P>
    <P>Dietary issues are not covered by the legislation but are related to public health. While the merits of fat, sugar or salt taxes may be debated, as a society, we need to consider measures to restrict our exposure to food which is damaging our health and that of our children. For instance, there is no reason Ireland should not emulate Sweden where advertising targeted at children under ten years of age is prohibited. The tightening of food labelling regulations might also be considered in order that people know how much saturated fat, salt and sugar is in their diet. The option of fiscal measures that would discourage the food industry from producing and aggressively marketing unhealthy products should also remain open. To adopt such measures is not a manifestation of the nanny state. The level of salt and sugar in people's diet is causing problems.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State is listening attentively to public health concerns. I am a retailer and salute the Minister for Health and Children for taking a solid line on the anti-smoking ban. It is regrettable he had to make a number of derogations but, in a number of cases, for example, psychiatric hospitals, this was understandable. If he had wavered and back tracked on his decision, it would have been a disaster because he would have lost a great deal of respect among the public having taken a stand on such an important public health issue. It will be a few years before he is commended for his actions. <Col N="326" />However, he is in a position to tackle other public health issues relating to advertising, food labelling and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has planned the use and promotion of public health labels at points of sale. As the reaction of the licensed trade has been not to accommodate the ban, it is important that the Minister should ensure licensees display signs relating to public health concerns in order that patrons will know establishments are adhering to the Government's public health policy. Whatever about the removal of ashtrays, public health signs should be visible in bars and restaurants. Does the Department intend to market the ban as a public health concern? This is one of many measures which it is considering. I hope licensees will take responsibility and actively pursue the ban in order that customers will be aware of what is expected of them.</P>
    <P>Sponsorship of events by tobacco and alcohol companies is a matter for another day. However, the registration of tobacco products under the legislation by retailers is important. The great difficulty in many supermarkets is that people aged under 18 years work at check outs which creates problems in terms of the sale of tobacco products.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the legislation because this is public health issue No. 1. I hope he will introduce other public health measures that will be equally effective in the long-term and will be in the interest of the well-being of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members for their contributions. Deputy Perry's comments on public health were particularly interesting. While he went beyond the scope of the legislation, I agree with him that investment in public health generates a return for the Exchequer and the general well-being of the population. Significant amounts are spent on advertising by the food industry as it engages in public health propaganda campaigns. Investment by the State in this area is minuscule compared with investment by private companies, which often produce wrong and dangerous images about our eating and drinking habits.</P>
      <P>With regard to the threat to public health from tobacco consumption, there is strong support in the House for this important initiative. Public health authorities in many countries have grappled with the problem of how to prevent persons from taking up smoking and to get smokers to break their addiction once it is established. I reminded Deputy Durkan that the phrase, &ldquo;An Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;, was coined by a former Minister for Health and Taoiseach. We have devised an Irish solution to an Irish problem on this issue. Ireland will be one of the first countries to give a firm lead in this area which is very much to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" />There is no single solution to deal with the tobacco epidemic. A comprehensive approach of the type undertaken by the Government through the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, this amending legislation, education and information initiatives and cessation programmes is necessary to maintain the battle against tobacco on all fronts. Strong legislative measures will remain an important public health instrument in countering the tobacco threat. Much has been achieved to date in reducing the incidence of smoking among the population. The level of smoking stands at 25%, according to the most recent survey evidence. This is in stark contract to the level of 43% that prevailed in the 1970s. This welcome reduction translates into lives saved, serious illness prevented and avoidance of the pain and suffering involved in death brought on by tobacco related diseases such as lung cancer and emphysema.</P>
    <P>Our success in improving the health status of the nation is linked to reducing further the level of tobacco usage and, especially, preventing younger persons from beginning the smoking habit. If the incidence use by young persons can be reduced, we can make considerable progress towards a tobacco free country. I am aware that much effort in promoting and supporting tobacco-free initiatives has and is being carried out by a range of groups and organisations.</P>
    <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published two reports on health and smoking the conclusions of which left nobody in any doubt about the nature of the threat posed by tobacco consumption. The cardiovascular health strategy group report, Shaping Healthier Hearts, also made clear the importance of reducing smoking levels to reduce the incidence of heart disease which is one of the biggest causes of mortality in Ireland. Organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation carry out splendid work in advancing the health message and encouraging the cessation of smoking. The positive health message is getting through to people. Smoking tobacco products and environmental tobacco are seen as significant risks to the health of smokers and non-smokers. The introduction of smoke-free indoor workplaces in 2004 will be another positive step in the smoke-free initiative we are undertaking. Many workplaces are already smoke free and employers and employees realise the benefits of working and socialising in a clean smoke-free environment.</P>
    <P>Addiction to tobacco based nicotine is powerful and difficult to break. I understand the difficulties smokers experience in trying to quit. Most smokers commence their addiction before adulthood and many who quit only succeed after a number of attempts. The Department of Health and Children is undertaking an enhanced smoking cessation programme to further assist those <Col N="328" />trying to quit. Nicotine replacement therapy was made available to all medical card holders who smoke. The national Break the Habit campaign was developed on a partnership basis between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards. Additional smoking cessation officers have also been recruited by the health boards.</P>
    <P>Tobacco remains a significant burden to individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. The positive measures being undertaken on a broad front in reducing tobacco usage will increase life expectancy and result in happier, healthier and better quality lives for many of our people.</P>

    <Title>Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2000 [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the House when this Bill was discussed previously and as spokesperson for this area I am glad of the opportunity to speak on it now. It is important to note that this legislation has been awaiting enactment for three years and it is a poor reflection on the Minister and the Department that it takes that long to get legislation passed. The Bill which is only now coming under serious scrutiny should have come before the House long ago. However, it is here now and I will not delay it further.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend and improve previous legislation in this area. The parent Bill is the Dumping at Sea Act 1996. This new amending Bill improves that legislation and is quite well drafted. The legislation has four key aspects, the first of which is to update the definition of harbour authority. Many harbours are now controlled by a port authority so it is important to update the definition to include them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to include &ldquo;the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands&rdquo; in section 5 of the parent Bill. It requires that he or she be consulted in certain <Col N="329" />circumstances before a dumping at sea permit is granted. This recognises that the State attaches increased importance to the world underwater as a heritage and natural resource. While the inclusion of a Minister from another Department may be cumbersome or delay the permit assessment process, it is an appropriate and acceptable requirement.</P>
    <P>The third element of this legislation is the requirement that all applicants for dumping at sea permits should publicly advertise their intentions. I support this. It is time we recognised that dumping at sea is similar to dumping on land where permission is required and there is no reason it should not be treated similarly in legislation. Dumping at sea has caused serious damage to the sea bed in some Irish waters. Just because we cannot physically see the damage does not mean we should ignore it. The sea bed has a valuable contribution to make and should be protected. A public advertisement of intention to dump will be required and 21 days will be allowed for stakeholders, interested parties or the public to express their concerns or support before the permit is granted. That process will be useful and must be supported.</P>
    <P>The final purpose of the Bill is to require, in certain circumstances, an environmental assessment of natural and archaeological heritage of a sea bed area before dumping occurs. That is important. The theme of this amending legislation is that of the State making a necessary effort in attaching increased importance and value to the underwater, including its life and natural resources, although it is of relevance only to the sea and not inland waterways.</P>
    <P>The Bill also allows the Minister to grant or refuse permits depending on conditions. It strengthens the enforcement aspect of current legislation by empowering the courts to impose monetary penalties and even a prison term of five years for illegal dumping. This is a welcome proposal.</P>
    <P>I hope the days of the cowboy operations of dumping refuse or silt material at sea are gone and, if not, we must ensure that those involved do not get away lightly with committing actions that will now be against the law. We need to be tough in this area but also reasonable and open when someone applies for a dumping permit, although there is no room for any flexibility when imposing a fine for illegal dumping at sea.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's significant investment in the national seabed survey. The new vessel, <i>Celtic Explorer,</i> contains fantastic machinery which will assist in recognising the potential of the country's coastline. After our people, our greatest natural resource is the sea that surrounds us. Our national waters comprise 11% of the EU total, yet we have no clue about what goes on there or what is happening on the seabed. I encourage the Government to continue to invest <Col N="330" />in the national seabed survey. It should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a cost.</P>
    <P>The survey will map out the seabed area around the coastline. This will assist in finding natural resources, such as oil and gas, and will help in managing fish stocks in a more efficient manner. Suitable areas, depending on their depth, will be located for breeding fish stocks. If these must be set aside to ensure that fish stocks survive and grow, a seabed survey will offers a significant advantage.</P>
    <P>The survey will also offer opportunities when addressing the problem of dumping at sea. Whether we like it or not, we need to dispose of materials at sea. It is a dirty process and it is important to locate the areas where it is suitable to dump waste, such as dredge materials. This can only be done in the context of having access to as much scientific information as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the roles of the <i>Celtic Explorer</i> should be to map out suitable locations for dumping certain types of material at sea. Harbours such as those at Cork and Waterford need to be dredged for silt on a regular basis which then needs to be deposited elsewhere, usually at sea. As an example, there should be a scientific map of the seabed around the entrance to Cork Harbour and its environs, which would identify the quantity of material to be dumped before granting operates a dumping at sea permit. They would then be in a position to identify suitable locations to deposit the material.</P>
    <P>It is important to deal with dumping in an educated rather than a haphazard way. In the past, a deep patch was sought outside a harbour which was filled with silt. The work of the <i>Celtic Explorer</i> should be linked with this legislation to ensure that the Minister takes a proactive role in sourcing suitable areas for dumping at sea. In this regard, the sensitivity to dumping at sea for some areas, such as those with high levels of aquaculture activity and fish farming, must also be taken into consideration. A combination of the work by the <i>Celtic Explorer</i> and the Marine Institute would be able to map the coastline. Targeting areas as suitable for dumping at sea will allow the opportunity to decide which should be used each year. In taking this approach, the Department should be looking for opportunity rather than counting the cost.</P>
    <P>Many Members will have seen the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on fish farming and aquaculture. It offered only one perspective on the industry, was critical and negative in tone and did not consider the positive aspects of fish farming. However, it raised an important incident involving an individual who had dumped a significant amount of dead fish in a sea harbour. The dumping was not reported but was discovered by the Marine Institute. There is probably an explanation for why it happened. I understand the individual concerned was forced to make a difficult <Col N="331" />decision about the use of his equipment and nets which meant that in an effort to save some fish he was obliged to dump a significant quantity of dead fish. It had the potential to do much damage to the seabed and its marine environment, but fortunately, this did not happen. The situation was also monitored.</P>
    <P>This incident highlighted a system that is not working. The Marine Institute has probably the best monitoring system in the world for aquaculture and fish farming in terms of covering life levels and fish populations in tanks and so on. However, there is no system for punishing those who regularly break the rules on dumping at sea. We have discussed this in the past and I hope the Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources is examining an alternative to shutting down an operation. There should be different levels of fines for different breaches of the regulations covering fish farming.</P>
    <P>We should study other models abroad while at the same time maintaining the excellent levels of industry monitoring by the Marine Institute. We could then sell aquaculture and fish farming in a positive light as it offers great possibilities and opportunities for this island. We have many suitable bays and inlets to allow the industry to flourish in parts of the country that desperately need investment and industry such as this.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago I was in Inishowen looking at fish farming operations in Lough Swilly. I was impressed by the levels of employment and the professionalism of those involved. Just as we need to assess areas suitable for dumping, we also need to assess bays, rivers and harbours for their capacity to take the pressures that fish farming applies to the environment in such enclosed areas of water.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill, which has taken three years to reach this stage. Initially I thought I had misread its title given that it contains the year 2000. While the Bill will tighten up the legislation in necessary ways, I would like to see policy coming from this to maximise the use of natural assets such as the <i>Celtic Explorer</i> so that we can take a strategic approach to dumping at sea rather than just a legislative approach whereby permits are issued on an individual basis. The Department should have a map showing where those who want to dump at sea should go. I hope the Minister will do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this necessary Bill. Like my colleague, Deputy Coveney, I wonder why we had to wait three years from initiation to Second Stage. As Second Stage will be completed today, I hope the Bill can be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have severe restrictions on dumping on land and, as our sea is a valuable resource, the same constraints and legal status should be <Col N="332" />afforded to dumping at sea. I welcome the extension of the limit from 12 to 350 miles and the requirement for a licence to dump at sea. As a licence is already required for a landfill dump, it makes sense for the same to apply to dumping at sea.</P>
    <P>Our sea is a valuable resource that has been mistreated over the years. Sewage from Limerick city goes into the Shannon and down to the sea. This will end when the Limerick main drainage scheme comes on stream. In my village, Adare, the sewage goes directly into the Maigue river and from there to the sea without treatment. There are proposals for a sewerage scheme in Adare, which I hope will start next year. It is unacceptable to treat our waterways, rivers and coastline in such a fashion in 2003 when we know the damage that can be done to fish stocks, marine life and the eco-environment of our waterways.</P>
    <P>An audit should be carried out immediately to identify clearly the villages, towns and even cities such as Limerick that dispose of sewage directly into our waterways and the sea. We should commence schemes to treat the sewage of such areas to ensure the sea is not polluted.</P>
    <P>For centuries there has been a problem with shipwrecks. People have only become concerned about these in recent years. The sea was an almost automatic dumping ground where people felt that, if it was not visible, it did not exist. Clearly shipwrecks have caused serious problems. Following a serious accident, those involved in the marine area have a responsibility to ensure that pollution does not take place. There should be insurance to cover such eventualities on an international basis. Often we have no control over the owners of vessels that sink. The most renowned shipwreck, the <i>Titanic,</i> which has been lying in the ocean for more than 90 years, was visited within the past ten years. Three wrecks from the Spanish Armada are believed to be off the Mayo coast. However, in 2003 such behaviour is unacceptable. With the level of commercial activity in the sea, it becomes a more important issue.</P>
    <P>As an island nation, the fishing industry is important to us. The Bill provides for the protection of fish life from damage by pollutants. We do not pay the attention we should to our marine and fishing industry. Over the centuries, even though we are an island nation with ample fish stocks available to us, we have never really developed the industry. It was strange that, during the Famine of the 1840s, people died of starvation while all around our coast there were stocks of fish. There is something in the Irish psyche that does not allow us to relate properly to and develop our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that we are belatedly discussing dumping at sea. It is a feature of our approach to the sea that the Bill is only being discussed in the <Col N="333" />House in 2003 when we should have been responding to the enormous asset of our coastal waters since the foundation of the State. Even when we joined the EU we were prepared to sacrifice some control of our fishing rights. At the time our agriculture industry was rightly supported. We should have taken the same approach to our marine industry to ensure the same protections were put in place. The failure to do that in the early 1970s had repercussions some years later when we discovered we had less control over our marine stocks. Despite this, there is still enormous potential to develop our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I remember the passage of the 1996 Act through the Houses. I was a Member of the Seanad at the time and we conducted very long debates on the legislation. Its most controversial aspect was the establishment of semi-State bodies. I cannot evaluate how successful the change has been. I do not know if an evaluation of the changes has been made, but their introduction in my area was extremely controversial. Foynes Harbour lost its independence to what is now the Shannon Foynes Port Company. I would like to see a detailed report on the degree of success of that development. On the ground we have seen much less activity at Foynes, but we do not have hard evidence to present to the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>While the headquarters of the estuary authority is at Foynes, the potential for development is still not being tapped. There is potential to increase the throughput of business at Foynes. There is a massive opportunity to develop marine industries and enterprises in the area. A new road to Foynes Harbour has made an enormous difference to Foynes village by taking heavy traffic away from it. Foynes is an extremely beautiful and very old village on the Shannon. Certainly, the new road has improved it. There is a marvellous opportunity to create employment in the marine sector by attracting industries to Foynes. The IDA should create incentives to encourage companies to recognise Foynes as an inland but deep harbour which can facilitate vessels up to 40,000 tonnes. Overseas investment by people involved in marine development, including vessel builders, repair companies and other off-shoot enterprises of the marine industry, should be attracted. At one point, a company examined the possibility of establishing a ship repair centre at Foynes. Such employment creation opportunities should be encouraged through incentives to bring much needed jobs to the area. Perhaps the Minister of State will consider greater investment in Foynes Harbour and bring it to the attention of the IDA which is responsible for creating incentives. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources may have views on how best to develop an asset such as Foynes.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House will ensure the control and containment of pollution. While no one can legislate for major accidents which may occur <Col N="334" />at sea, it is important to put in place legislation which makes provisions to address any possible unfortunate incidents. To be in a position to act immediately, we must put rules and regulations in place to address the kind of major accident which can happen off the coast of any island nation. This Bill will copperfasten existing legislation while safeguarding our coastal communities, harbours and coastlines.</P>
    <P>Most Members who have spoken on this legislation referred to their concern at the Sellafield plant. People living on the east coast are concerned about the plant polluting the sea. Questions have been asked about Sellafield for decades. Unfortunately, the nuclear fuel industry in Britain is very coy and protective in terms of the information it provides. Obviously, it has a vested interest in the continued operation of Sellafield. One reads of the concerns of prominent professionals in this field regarding what will happen to people on the east coast and throughout Ireland if anything happens at Sellafield. The events in America on 11 September 2001 would pale by comparison. It is frightening to envisage the damage which could be done if a similar terrorist act were committed at the Sellafield plant. I do not have the expertise to outline the exact details of what would occur, but it must be of concern.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, attitudes have changed over the years. I remember as a very young person the heavy promotion of the idea that a nuclear plant should be located in the Minister of State's constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That was before my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>A significant body of opinion held that the construction of such a plant was the way to go. According to statements made at the time, the plant was seen as a life-saver. It was to be the saviour of the ESB by providing cheap energy generation in Wexford. Thankfully, the plan was not realised. If someone were to propose the establishment of such a plant in Wexford today, I am sure the Minister of State would be the first to object. His constituents would ensure that he did. Attitudes to nuclear power have changed and we must be concerned about Sellafield and use every opportunity to voice those concerns. The matter has been raised at EU level by every Government over the last 25 years, but there is little evidence that our concerns have been heard. No planned programme to close Sellafield over the next ten or even 30 years exists. Self interest on the part of the British Government and the nuclear fuel industry is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that no illegal dumping at sea is carried out. People who dump must have licences. I note the Bill's provisions to reprimand persons who dump illegally. We have seen the effects of illegal dumps in Wicklow and else<Col N="335" />where. New regulations have been introduced in respect of the management of legal dumps. Activities in dumps up to ten years ago were unsatisfactory and regulations had to be introduced to control them. These regulations included requirements in respect of linings and the burning off of gases to minimise pollution levels. Many dumps throughout the country which were closed continue to cause severe damage to the environment. These problems may be related to the lack of knowledge and resources which existed at the time.</P>
    <P>Before anyone accuses me of straying from discussion of the Bill, I describe these problems to make a comparison with the problems created by illegal dumping at sea. Regarding a 40 acre dump in my council area, we are told that ten years ago they did not have the resources to run it properly, but that they now have the resources to do so. Surely the same applies at sea. We must ensure that the conditions, controls and regulations are of the highest standard. I do not know what these regulations are, but I am sure there is expertise, either within the European Union or internationally, to identify the best practices of dumping at sea and ensure there are controls. In ten, 15, or 20 years' time, this issue will be raised and people will talk about the controls on dumping at sea. While it is licensed, the controls are not exercised because of lack of resources. It is not good enough that the resources will not be applied to ensure that the highest standards are observed. Before 1960 there was not even a proper planning act in Ireland, there was no control over building, but look at the controls there now. The same controls should apply to the managing of our seas and our waters and our very important fishing and marine industry.</P>
    <P>I did not realise that aquaculture and fish waste were excluded from the 1996 Act and I find it hard to understand. I remember debating the Bill at Second Stage and in great detail at Committee Stage. I do not recall why the Minister justified the exclusion of these two areas from the 1996 Act. However, this Bill includes them in the controls of the 1996 Act, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>We hope that this Bill will pass through Committee Stage speedily and be back for Report Stage when we return after Christmas. I am sure the Minister of State would like to get it off his plate and put a notch on his gun.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the Second Stage debate on this Bill. This is the third day it has been rehearsed in the Dáil Chamber and I have also spent a number of days in the Seanad. There is obviously a significant interest on all sides of the House in the marine environment generally. There has also been a commitment from all sides to ensuring that it is appropriately protected and conserved. I appreciate the general welcome given to the Bill. There has been some criticism about the delay, but as I have been in this Department for only 15 months or 16 months I cannot carry the can for all of the delay. It is certainly very important that there is agreement to proceed with the remaining Stages of the Bill at a very early stage.</P>
      <P>The Dumping at Sea Act 1996, which, in fairness to different Governments, was an updating of the 1981 Act, is now being further updated with this Bill. There has been a strong commitment from various Governments over the years to ensure that dumping at sea is well regulated and that it involves strict enforcement.</P>
      <P>The debate was very wide-ranging and covered matters that included a number of more general issues concerning the environment, some of them relevant to the responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. We will certainly pass on the comments made during the debate on this Bill, because most of them related to sewerage schemes and water schemes and generally issues that pertain to that Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with the Deputies who rightly emphasised the need for rigorous control of dumping at sea. We must ensure that dumping at sea is permitted only where there is no other appropriate means of disposing of the material in question. This means, for example, that alternatives such as the use of materials for beach nourishment or landfill must be addressed, which Deputy Coveney alluded to in his contribution. As a practical example, I am pleased to say that two thirds of the material dredged in the major harbour improvement works at Killybegs harbour fishery centre have been used for the purpose of land reclamation. It is essential, in addition, that we have systems and processes which ensure that only material adjudged suitable on scientific evidence is disposed of at sea. Our regulatory process must see to it that any disposal permitted takes place in an appropriate location and in an appropriate manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coveney referred to the <i>Celtic Explorer.</i> I appreciate his comments on the national seabed survey. This major project will undoubtedly add significantly to the knowledge and understanding of Ireland's marine resources and help us, the scientists and the people <Col N="337" />involved, to ensure that they are managed and delivered sustainably and in an environmentally friendly way. It is very important that we continue to look at the updating and upgrading of the scientific evidence at all times.</P>
    <P>Seanad Éireann amended the Bill by the inclusion of requirements for details of all applications for permits received after 1 January 2001, and of any submissions or observations received in respect of such applications, to be published electronically by putting the relevant details on the Department's website, which I am pleased to say is in line with the commitment to an open and transparent permission process</P>
    <P>The Bill, being a technical measure, does not provide additional resources for enforcement purposes. However, Deputies will be aware that the Irish Coast Guard and my Department have highly trained staff and specialist equipment and are in the front line, with other relevant agencies, in continuous monitoring of the seas and in the quick response to any pollution threats or incidents arising from that. In addition, co-operative monitoring and assisted arrangements are in place with neighbouring states. We are working towards sharing satellite surveillance capability over a very wide area. Furthermore, the Irish Coast Guard is going to tender to acquire, early next year, a dedicated aircraft and experienced crew for remote area sensing to detect pollution at sea and to help in operations that deal with pollution incidents. They have already been carrying out aerial surveillance on a trial basis over the last two months.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the appeals process in respect of the decisions on applications for dumping at sea. It has not been considered necessary to establish appeals arrangements in respect of such permits. All ministerial decisions on applications for permits are based on independent expert advice covering all relevant disciplines. Moreover, the extent of public consultation arrangements and procedures for consultations with relevant Government Departments and statutory bodies means that there is every opportunity for all concerned to have their views taken into account before a decision is made.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the debate to a number of specific cases and events, including the proposals by the Dublin port company for reclamation in Dublin Bay. The position is that an application for a foreshore licence under the 1996 Act is with the Department. We hope to deal with that in due course. Perhaps it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on that today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney referred to the salmon mortalities in the Donegal bay area this year. He should be assured that we will not tolerate any wrongdoing or unacceptable practices by the fish farmers. I accept that there has been a lot of unwelcome media attention, but if wrongdoing <Col N="338" />took place, it is right that such wrongdoing should be highlighted. It is up to us in the Department to deal quickly and effectively with that.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Marine Institute is carrying out the investigation on an ongoing basis. I have asked the Department to conduct a comprehensive review of enforcement and control. I expect the review which is under way to be completed by early January. We will implement immediately any changes required. We will look at possible ways of dealing with monitoring and enforcement, perhaps involving independent bodies, as soon as the Department has produced its report. If changes are required, we will deal with them very quickly.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the effects of sewage discharges on the marine environment. I inform Deputy Neville who referred to the matter a few moments ago that the Government is committed to the provision of appropriate wastewater treatment facilities. Some &euro;2.7 billion will be spent on wastewater projects under the national development plan in the next few years. I am sure the places mentioned by the Deputy will be included in the programme.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of legislation is in place to deal with shipwrecks, a matter also mentioned by Deputy Neville. We will continue to update the legislative provisions in this regard and deal with the associated matters in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville and others referred to the Sellafield plant, in respect of which the Government has taken unprecedented legal action against the United Kingdom. The action is motivated by a desire to ensure Ireland's environment, especially the Irish Sea, is protected from radioactive discharges from the plant at Sellafield. I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be heartened by the fact that Deputies on all sides have encouraged him to take the strongest possible action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville also referred to the proposal made some years ago to build a nuclear power plant in County Wexford. The project was suggested by a Minister who was a member of Fianna Fáil at the time. I am glad to inform the Deputy that wind turbines are now in place at the location in question, Carnsore Point, to provide green energy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Neville spoke about Foynes Port. The Department of Communi<Col N="339" />cations, Marine and Natural Resources has in its possession a report which contains ideas about the development of the port. Deputy Coveney is aware that many ports face serious financial problems &ndash; some are on the verge of bankruptcy. The Minister and I have been in discussions with representatives of some of them. We will have to examine how they can make progress. The ports at Waterford and New Ross have substantial debts but the nearby Rosslare Port which is in the hands of CIE is making money. We will have to assess whether we should continue to operate the ports in the current manner if they continue to lose money. Perhaps we will have to consider amalgamations or other ways of operating them. We will have to examine their future operation and viability in a serious manner in the new year.</P>
      <P>I have signalled that I will bring forward certain amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. They will be tabled as soon as possible after Second Stage has been agreed. Explanatory notes will be supplied to the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I expect amendments to be submitted by Deputy Coveney and others. I will consider any good and practical amendments brought forward in an open manner. The Government does not have a monopoly of wisdom on how to deal with sea dumping.</P>
