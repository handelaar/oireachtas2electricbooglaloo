      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of topics under Standing Order 31 dealing with six different issues. I propose to deal with these separately and I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy James Breen.</P>

      <P>I move that the Dáil be adjourned under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of local and national importance, the closure of the Graham and Heslip factory in the Gort road industrial estate in Ennis with the loss of 42 jobs. It is a very sad chapter in the unemployment record of County Clare. I ask that the Government take action.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I wish to give notice of my intention to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, that is, the plight of students who have been promised a place in Malahide community school on the basis of a specific written commitment from the Minister for Education and Science to the effect that the new school project would commence in 2003, they have now been informed that there is no place for them in the school or in any other school in the area and the need for the Minister for Education and Science to take urgent action to deal with the situation. In view of the importance of the issue, I hope you will agree to my request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent importance, namely the information provided to the House last week during Question Time that the Phoenix Park tunnel is too narrow to provide rail services even though it not only can provide for the meeting of two freight trains in the tunnel but can also handle the widest trains ever used on the rail network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following motion of urgent national importance, namely the report by the OECD which states that the youth suicide rate has increased dramatically, placing Ireland second in a league table of people under 25 who take their own lives and the gross under funding by the Government of suicide prevention and research and the development of support for those bereaved by suicide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the ongoing lack of clarity, honesty and helpfulness on the issue, I ask that the business of the House be suspended to debate an issue of ongoing and urgent national importance, namely the need for the Government to honestly answer questions as to when it became aware of systematic abuse in institutions run by religious orders, why it took so long to address the issue, the manner in which it came to agree a deal with the Conference of Religious of Ireland and the role of various Ministers and the Attorney General in negotiating and concluding the deal.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be No. 13a Motion re: European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001; No. 1 National Tourism Development Authority Bill 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 2 &ndash; Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>]&ndash; Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) No. 13<i>a </i>shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 1 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the Order of Business in respect of the guillotine being placed on the National Tourism Development Authority Bill. <Col N="704" /> This deals with the amalgamation of Bord Fáilte and CERT and it is a matter of considerable importance to every Deputy in the House, in terms of how national tourism is marketed. Members on this side of the House feel very strongly that they should have the opportunity to voice their opinions.</P>

      <P>This Bill has already been given seven and a half hours time in the House. It is very important legislation in the context of having all this work completed before the beginning of the tourist season. Tourism is worth &euro;3 billion in foreign earnings, &euro;1.3 billion in domestic earnings&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I wish to draw attention to the kind of tourism facility this country needs so badly and in doing so I pay tribute to the Irish Seal Sanctuary in Fingal in Dublin north which has an amazing ability to attract hundreds of visitors to a beach, regardless of weather, to witness the release of seals which have been injured or ill and nursed back to health by wildlife experts, such as Brendan and Mary Price and Terry Flanagan. Next Sunday in Rush there will be another such release at 12.30&nbsp;p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council has given a site. I ask the authority to take on board this issue because it needs capital investment as Ireland is the only coastal EU state with no marine conservation centre. There is a clear benefit for tourism if this type of facility <Col N="716" /> can be developed which will not just be about attracting visitors but will also have an intrinsic value for the overall development of the country. To that extent it is important to focus on capital investment involving the local authority so there is a decentralised and vibrant tourism sector. It is also important to focus on the capital investment from the State which was promised before the last election but still has to be delivered. I hope the Minister and the National Tourism Development Authority will set this as a priority so we can have a facility which is so badly needed in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my support for the Bill which my friend and colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, has brought before the House. Many of the Bills which appear before the House can be described as historic, shaping the social fabric of the lives of Irish people well into the future. In years to come this Bill, which proposes the establishment of the National Tourism Development Authority, will be seen as such, establishing as it does the legal means by which Ireland's tourism project will be promoted on an all-Ireland basis. The Bill seeks to rationalise the promotion and development of tourism facilities and the services within the State. This can only be welcomed by all sides of the House as it recognises that tourism is the State's second largest industry. In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>If we build high standard physical facilities, we must also deliver appropriately high quality services. If the operational standards do not match the physical quality of facilities, then the market potential of these facilities may not be realised.</P>
      <P>I concur with that sentiment.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight some of the issues we should promote. It beggars belief that the Department and we as a nation have failed to provide a national conference centre. All the agencies involved in tourism development, whether hoteliers, Bord Fáilte or CERT have asked for such a centre. Through the Minister of State, I urge the Department and those involved to use every vehicle available to them to ensure a national conference centre is achieved. At one time substantial funding of the order of £19 million or £20 million was available for the promotion and development of this facility. I hope that is still available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to Bord Fáilte and CERT which are being merged to form the new authority. Both have served the industry extremely well. Some years ago Bord Fáilte decided its strategy and got Government approval for the development of sports facilities, particularly golf. We have seen <Col N="717" /> over the past ten years that this promotion and focus on providing the best of golfing facilities has paid off in a real way throughout the country. There is not a part of the country which does not have a major capital investment in the development of golf facilities and interrelated activities, culminating in the Ryder Cup coming to Ireland in the next few years which is phenomenal. I had the pleasure of attending one such tournament in Valderama. It is possible it will be one of the biggest sporting occasions in the country and in the promotion of tourism thereafter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that certain minority sports have been supported in recent years. I was informed yesterday that the substantial investment made by the Department in cricket over the past ten years is about to pay off, as a centre of excellence will be opened soon in north Dublin. More importantly, while the World Cup is taking place in South Africa at present the preliminary rounds will take place in Ireland. Twelve countries will come to Ireland, of which four will qualify for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. This has been made possible through the investment provided by the Department and the various agencies in relation to the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Sargent, mentioned the seal sanctuary. I would like to bring him up to date on a proposal that will soon be made to the Department for an Irish marine tourism and convention facility. He will be pleased to know that the site which the Fingal authority will be promoting is in Balbriggan. The idea behind it is that the centre at Portaferry, which my local authority visited recently, which has a similar development and ties in with the Irish seal sanctuary development there, has 90,000 to 100,000 visitors per year.</P>
    <P>I am sure when the Minister and the Department see this proposal, it will get the support it deserves. As Deputy Sargent rightly said, there has been a commitment of support for such a development in recent years. Approximately &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million will be needed for such a facility. The broadening out of this proposal may help to achieve what those who have been so vigorous in their efforts to have a seal sanctuary provided on our coastline have sought. I hope this proposal will get the support it deserves when it goes to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the Special Olympics will be held here in the summer. It is a unique opportunity for Ireland as every part of the country will be involved. I welcome the Government's support and all the voluntary work and I congratulate those involved in the games. I wish well to everybody coming to Ireland for the games.</P>
    <P>I return to the point about providing the highest standard of facilities. I refer to the investment in our race and dog tracks and the type of support these industries are getting. There was record attendance at Leopardstown last Saturday &ndash; some 17,000 people attended &ndash; and record betting of &euro;2.6 million on the track. That does not <Col N="718" /> happen automatically; it happens because the best of facilities have been provided. I urge the Department to continue to support the facilities the modern punter and consumer wants.</P>
    <P>It is a revelation for anybody to go to a dog track anywhere in the country. This has been a success story because Bord na gCon has invested in dog tracks. There has been a revolution in that the age profile of people attending dog tracks has changed, and the reason is that the best of facilities are available. I hope the Minister will continue to support that.</P>
    <P>Many among our immigrant population are drawn to tourism jobs because our own people seek higher pay and employment elsewhere. Although this will be of benefit by broadening the appeal of our tourism industry, we must be careful to ensure visitors still enjoy an Irish welcome by encouraging our people to stay in the industry. It is important the industry recognises that without proper wages and proper facilities, it will lose people. The industry is conscious of that and recognises that it must change and ensure the best working conditions are available to guarantee that the unique Irish culture and character is available to visitors arriving in our country.</P>
    <P>The Irish Open will be held in Portmarnock next year. I remember in the 1980s when it was first held in Portmarnock, there were only 50 hotel bedrooms in the immediate area. It is to the credit of Bord Fáilte and various Government initiatives that some of the best hotels in Dublin are available to cater for this most prestigious event. The Royal Marine Hotel, the Grand Hotel in Malahide, the White Sands Hotel in Portmarnock, Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links Hotel and the Great Southern Hotel at the airport have all been developed in the past 15 years. Without the tax incentives available for those investors to create bedroom space, it would not be there. It is most welcome for us in Fingal and Dublin north that when the Open takes place in June of next year, all of these hotels will be available to the visitors who will come to the area looking for the best of facilities and the highest standards. We are lucky in north county Dublin to have such facilities available.</P>
    <P>Promotion of Ireland as a whole, as an integrated tourism product, was always going to be one of the first manifestations of the Good Friday Agreement. It seems only logical and right that the complementary attractions of both sides of the Border should be combined to provide the absolutely unmissable holiday experience Ireland provides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill. I come from County Mayo where 15 years ago, some of the premier tourism resorts were located, including Achill Island to which thousands of people flooded on various weekends of the year. However, we have seen a change over the past ten or 15 years. One of the reasons for that is that a significant regional focus has not been <Col N="719" /> implemented by the different tourism authorities. I appreciate this Bill is about setting up a national structure but I hope when the focus turns to the regional situation, a greater emphasis will be placed on counties such as Mayo which enjoyed such success in the past.</P>
      <P>This Bill is important because tourism represents &euro;4 billion in foreign earnings and &euro;1.2 billion in domestic earnings. It represents 5% of GNP and accounts for one in every 12 jobs. By anyone's standards, it is a massive industry which needs to be tapped to the maximum. While we have been successful in attracting large numbers to our shores, it is increasingly important that when visitors come to Ireland, they get the quality and the range of services available in other countries. We must face reality in a competitive market. People will only come to Ireland if they get a good product, a good level of services and value for money relative to what is available in other countries in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I mentioned County Mayo at the outset. It is a good example because it has absolutely everything and I hope Members will forgive me for being parochial for a minute while I highlight the situation. Mayo has the highest number of blue flag beaches in the country. It has the beautiful town of Westport which enjoyed the 2001 tidy towns award. It has the most magnificent rivers and lakes and the best salmon fishery in the country in the River Moy and the lakes of Lough Mask, Lough Carra and Lough Cullin which attract many angling visitor each year. It has wonderful festivals, including the salmon festival in Ballina. One of my colleagues yesterday referred to the Gweesalia races festival. It has a great racecourse in Ballinrobe which attracts large numbers of tourists from around the country. It has Ashford Castle, despite the fact County Galway tries to claim it from time to time, a premier location which has brought in huge numbers of American and domestic visitors over the years. It has any number of championship golf courses one would care to visit. There is something in Mayo for everybody. One would have to ask, why in a county which offers so much, tourist figures have shown some decline? Maybe it does not enjoy the same premier location it enjoyed ten or 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>I bring to the Minister's attention the importance of an airport to a region. Thankfully, County Mayo has the benefit of a regional airport, Knock Airport. I mention this because I saw a programme recently on the PSO contracts awarded to various regional airports. I was struck by the high level of subsidy per passenger provided in these contracts to try to make a go of the airport. That is something I support because I am anxious that Knock Airport develops and is a huge addition to the tourism industry in County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every passenger who travels in and out of Knock Airport is subsidised to the extent of &euro;500, or in excess of that figure. I have no difficulty <Col N="720" /> with that while the airport is getting off the ground. However, I spoke to a hotelier in the county recently who contacted one of the carriers availing of this PSO contract to try to get added value from the fact people are travelling in and out of the airport &ndash; for example, bringing people to Mayo for a weekend in a hotel and to enjoy the various amenities &ndash; and to try to encourage people to stay in the county for more than one or two nights. What is surprising is that the airline carrier was not even interested in discussing the matter. Its attitude seems to be that the contract is in place, it is getting its money, and that is the end of the matter. I find that unacceptable, particularly in a county like Mayo. In my home town of Castlebar there has been huge Government investment in Turlough Park House. This is the only area outside of Dublin where the National Museum is located. Together with the other facilities I mentioned, it makes the area an ideal location. There are a number of attractions to keep tourists in the county for at least four or five days or longer. It is important when these contracts are being awarded to various airline carriers that every effort is made to force them to give value for money. I call on the new authority, which will focus on regional issues, to take up the matter with airline carriers prior to being given a contract to the various regional airports.</P>
    <P>Last night a number of my colleagues referred to cheap flights to various European destinations, which is what we are up against. We must have an attractive value for money package if we are to compete with flights for approximately &euro;10 or &euro;20 to other European capitals. It is important that we compete and give value for money. The regional airports should consider providing good value packages for people, which I believe can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The name Bord Fáilte, which is a household name, is to go. Everyone in the country is aware of the role Bord Fáilte played over the years. It has done some excellent work in bringing many thousands of people to our shores, for which we must be grateful. Given that the name has been synonymous with tourism in Ireland, it is a shame we are going to lose it, even though, under section 7 of the Bill the name, Fáilte Ireland, will probably be used for practical purposes. If a brand name has been successful in the past, it is important to retain it. One should not get rid of something that has had a positive impact. Sometimes it is good to have a fresh approach. I believe the new tourism development authority will take a fresh approach to tourism in this country, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>While much of my contribution has had a regional focus, it is because I believe it is badly needed. Coming from one of the most deprived parts of the country, access to and from the regions is scary. Tourism is not just a matter for the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, but for all Departments when looking at access to and from the regions. The N5 in County Mayo, in particular, is a disgrace. The section of the road from <Col N="721" /> Charlestown to Strokestown is absolutely appalling. When international partners recently visited many large industries in County Mayo, they asked whether they were travelling along the tourist track because surely it was not the main road to and from the county.</P>

      <P>It is a cart track; it is an absolute disgrace and one we cannot stand over. Since I was elected in 1997, we have been speaking in this House about this issue. The time for talking is now over. It is not just the N5 which is a disgrace, the railway service is also completely inadequate. I already referred to Knock Airport. We must develop these services if we are to provide a good quality product and value for money for people travelling to and from the regions. When the time comes to focus regionally on the matter, it should be done in a serious way once and for all, because it is one of the most important industries in the country and every effort must be made to develop it. It offers great opportunities for the future. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment Deputy Cooper-Flynn on her contribution because access is crucial for the development of tourism. When abroad approximately 18 months ago, the Minister of State's senior colleague and party leader came to the conclusion that while Ireland had a first world economy, it had a Third World infrastructure. Not a lot has changed since, nor does it seem to be changing at any speed.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the issue of the Great Southern Hotel group, particularly the Torc Great Southern, where I recently had the opportunity to meet staff while visiting Killarney. There is huge concern among the staff of the Torc Hotel and the Great Southern Hotel group as a whole in regard to the future development of the group. There is huge concern that Aer Rianta, the current managers and owners of the Great Southern Hotel group on behalf of the State, does not seem to prioritise the hotel group as part of its core business. It has huge potential to be a valuable asset to the development of tourism in the country. I ask the Minister to seriously consider tabling an amendment to the legislation to bring the hotel group under the control of the National Tourism Development Authority. It would make sense to have it under that authority rather than under Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>The Torc Great Southern Hotel was recently approved for sale by Aer Rianta but the sale was never formally approved by the board of Aer Rianta. It was put before the board of the Great Southern Hotel group. The Minister was never consulted on the issue, he was only advised in relation to it, which raises serious questions in light of the fact that the hotel is a valuable State asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" />The Minister for Transport is planning to establish three companies under Aer Rianta for the management of the three State airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon. He should establish a fourth independent company under the National Tourism Development Authority for the Great Southern Hotel group. That is the ideal home for the hotel group and I hope there will be an amendment to the legislation on Committee Stage to provide for this. The hotel group is not part of Aer Rianta's core business, therefore, it does not seem to be given priority.</P>
    <P>When the chairman of Aer Rianta recently met the staff he informed them that the group as a whole would make losses of &euro;8.3 million in 2002 and &euro;4 million in 2003. Yet in a presentation to an Oireachtas Committee a number of weeks ago, the chairman admitted that in 2001, which was a difficult year for the tourism industry, as was 2002, the group as a whole made a profit. Therefore, this is a profitable organisation but there seems to be a problem with the way it calculates the figures. Recent media reports show that the group made substantial profits in excess of &euro;40 million in 2001.</P>
    <P>I understand that Farrell Grant Sparks Consultants are looking at turning around the Great Southern Hotel group to make it more efficient and more profitable. It is imperative to put a stay on the sale of the Torc Hotel until the consultants' report is published. Given that this is a profitable hotel, it should be open during 2003. If the hotel remains closed it will become worthless as a going concern. The property will be devalued and it makes no sense to close the hotel, which has not been allocated a marketing budget, during 2003. It has been taken off the 2003 brochure for the Great Southern Hotel group, which gives rise to serious questions about the priority the board of Aer Rianta places on the group as a whole. There are two Great Southern hotels in Killarney and it does not make sense to sever them because they are at different ends of the hotel market.</P>
    <P>The Jurys Hotel Group has two hotels in Cork, Limerick, Galway and other towns that have a smaller tourism market than Killarney, to cater for two distinct elements of the tourist population. The Great Southern Hotel Group has traditionally operated two hotels with distinct styles in Killarney, but the family hotel is to be flogged off by Aer Rianta. It is important to note that the employees of the Great Southern Hotel Group, particularly the Torc Hotel, have rights. Legislation provides for a transfer of undertaking, but it seems that Aer Rianta is trying to abdicate its responsibility in that regard by scattering its staff and not selling the hotel as a going concern. There would be a huge public outcry if the obligations and undertakings of a private sector employer were abdicated in such a manner, but that is what is happening in a semi-State company. I ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to examine this matter comprehensively. The ideal home for the Great Southern Hotels Group <Col N="723" /> is under the new tourism development authority rather than Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The regional airports are a massive asset in the development of tourism in the regions. If we are serious about promoting tourism in the regions, we have to invest in regional airports. It is incorrect to say that every passenger arriving in Knock Airport is subsidised to the tune of &euro;500 &ndash; passengers are subsidised to such a level for return trips. It is important that regional airports are given grants for capital investment and marketing. The authorities in the regional airports are concerned that their marketing grants will be reduced. Accessibility to the regions is crucially important as part of a balanced tourism policy and our airports should be helped to bring many more tourists into the regions. More resources need to be allocated to Bord Fáilte to develop new tourism products. Leader groups have done a tremendous amount of work to promote tourism and develop tourism projects.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for the protection and retention of old buildings. Thatched houses have become virtually extinct in many parts of Ireland due to the fact that thatching grants available from the Department are pathetic. It is not financially feasible for anyone to put a thatched roof on a house. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is aware that many houses that used to be thatched are now covered by galvanised sheeting, which is left to fall in. The roofs of many old houses have fallen in as a result of a lack of repairs. The thatching grant that is available is inadequate to meet the cost of thatching a house. The skill of thatching is dying out as a consequence.</P>
    <P>The restoration grant for old buildings is also a Department of the Environment and Local Government matter. Roscommon County Council received about &euro;42,000 last year for such works, which would hardly be enough to repair one house properly. People are moving out of old houses because grants are not available to any great extent and because the cost of the work required to restore such houses to a proper standard is far in excess of the funds available. It is cheaper to build a new house than to restore an old house. Historic buildings and other old buildings have been deserted and left to fall into ruins &ndash; they can be seen throughout the country. It is not worth one's while to meet the huge cost of restoration work that has to be done within the regulations.</P>
    <P>Tourism has not been properly developed in the midland region, which includes the counties I represent in this House, Roscommon and Longford. Bord Fáilte has ignored the midlands. The fact that the midland region has been divided between a number of different tourism authorities has not helped its cause. The development of the River Shannon, the region's biggest asset, has not been assisted by the fact that over 30 organisations are involved in its development, <Col N="724" /> control, management and promotion. Bord Fáilte has concentrated its efforts on the coastal counties, meaning that tourists speed through the midlands on their way to the west, the south-west or the south-east. I am not arguing that tourists have to stay in the midlands for two or three weeks &ndash; the levels of tourism in the region would dramatically increase if tourists could be retained there for one or two nights. Visitors coming to Ireland on package trips promoted by Bord Fáilte should be encouraged to stop in the midland counties for a few nights. There are many hidden tourist attractions in the midlands. The potential of fishing and shooting holidays in County Roscommon should be developed.</P>
    <P>Rivers like the Shannon and the Suck are huge assets that have not been developed to their true potential. The maintenance of the River Shannon is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. Important pump out-stations that are not in place on the river should be provided. There is a severe shortage of berthing facilities along the River Shannon. I ask the Minister of State to visit the waterways of County Fermanagh, including Lough Erne, to see the development that has taken place there. It is a shame that similar facilities cannot be put in place along the Shannon. The development of an aquatic centre on Lough Ree has been proposed and should be encouraged. The cruiser market along the river should also be promoted. Many people stay in the Erne waterway and do not travel along the Ballymore-Ballyconnell canal to get to the Shannon. They feel they have to travel too far to get a berth, as facilities have not been developed further up the waterway.</P>
    <P>The only development on Lough Ree has been on the County Westmeath side, even though County Roscommon has more miles of waterway than any other county. The River Shannon passes through County Roscommon for about 70 miles and the River Suck, which passes through Ballinasloe, flows along the west of the county. Bord Fáilte seems to have ignored the potential for the development of County Roscommon's assets. The great thing about aquatic holidays is that they do not depend on the weather.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of maintenance on our waterways. A huge problem developed on the River Shannon two years ago when cruisers started to run aground. Air rescue services had to fly in to remove a family from a cruiser that had run aground on rock. It may be a couple of years before this becomes a crucial tourism issue, but it will cause concern in the immediate future if low water levels during the summer months persist for a number of years. Having visited the Clonown area of County Roscommon when he was president of the IFA, the Minister of State knows the detrimental effect the lack of maintenance on the River Shannon is causing on a day to day basis to many families along the river, and that will be compounded when it impacts on the tourism industry. Do we have to wait until then before action is taken? The maintenance of the <Col N="725" /> river has to be undertaken now, not in five years' time when the tourism market on the River Shannon is on the brink of collapse.</P>
    <P>Another problem with regard to midland counties such as Roscommon is the lack of adequate accommodation. I know of one guesthouse owner who could bring over a busload of anglers every week during the fishing season but there is no accommodation available for them. The decision taken in the budget to abolish tax incentives for hotels will have a detrimental impact on promoting and encouraging the development of facilities and accommodation in the midlands. I accept that the Minister for Finance may have an argument when he says that there is over-capacity in coastal counties and that there has been massive hotel development in places like Dublin and County Kerry. However, there is huge demand for accommodation and beds in the midlands and a special case should be made for regionalisation with regard to that tax incentive.</P>
    <P>A precedent has been set in the context of tax incentives for the upper Shannon corridor but we need to encourage additional capacity in those counties. Deputy Parlon is the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and I ask him to look seriously at this. There is no point talking about the regional development of tourism if we do not have the necessary beds and quality accommodation available.</P>

      <P>An amendment is planned. Some 56 new hotels will be included in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I would like to know the location of those 56 hotels. I can guarantee the Minister that very few of them will be in the midlands, which endorses the point I am making. It is crucially important that issue is considered.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure is vitally important to the development of tourism. The main arteries going into the west &ndash; the N5, N6 and even the N4 &ndash; are completely substandard roads for the volume of traffic on them. The N5 is the worst of the three and is nothing short of a glorified cart track. It is not able to cater for the existing volume of traffic and it is virtually impossible to encourage tourists to use such poor quality roads.</P>
      <P>The rail network is in a similar condition. The television advertisements from Irish Rail say it is not there yet but it is getting there, and that there are 67 new carriages on the way for mainline rail. What Irish Rail fails to tell us is that those 67 new carriages are to replace existing carriages which will be taken out of service. No new capacity will be created by the new carriages for the development of tourism or for bringing people to and from the regions. It is a pointless exercise and while it is vitally important from a safety perspective that the new carriages arrive, there is no potential for new services to and from the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The huge potential of the Atlantic corridor running from Sligo to Limerick to Rosslare port <Col N="726" /> is a good example. It was recently suggested to me that some of the carriages being taken out of service should be refurbished and put on an Orient express type tourist attraction, as has been done in the UK and Europe. A train service should be run from Rosslare through to Sligo. It would bring tourists&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to foreign tourists hiring cars, up to 12% of accidents in Ireland involve such tourists. There has been lobbying on behalf of the driving on the left campaign which could help to save lives and to ensure that tourists are made more conscious that they have to drive on a different side of the road in this country. The Department should look at that issue. Proposals were brought before the committee with responsibility for tourism in the last Dáil and they have the potential to save many lives on Irish roads.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate as the chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which is not a small title on its own. This is the second Bill to come under the committee's remit, as the Arts Bill has already come through. I welcome the fact that we are moving towards co-ordination because of all the complaints I have on the issue of tourism, the main one is that there are hundreds if not thousands of tourism organisations from village through to national level. They all call themselves tourism organisations but in many ways they are re-inventing the wheel. They do good work in their own right but a lot of money is wasted on administration and chairs, desks, computers and carpets. Many of the issues I would like to see addressed are duplicated while some that need to be dealt with are neglected. Anything that helps towards co-ordination must be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill approves the creation of a National Tourism Development Authority to promote tourism within the State and the development of tourism facilities and services which will include training and human resource and marketing skills development, and it has to be welcomed. The Bill's primary purpose is to create the new authority and to merge Bord Fáilte and CERT to create Fáilte Ireland. Therefore, three organisations will still be promoting tourism for the island of Ireland &ndash; Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the NITB. The ideal would be that one organisation would assume responsibility for <Col N="727" /> all the issues involved and work as one entity. This is not a huge island. It has four regions, which might be called north, south, east and west, but it is strange to think that there will still be three organisations for promotion and marketing. The word I dislike most with regard to tourism is &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; because I think it is the most abused word, and I will explain why in my contribution.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill states that the authority's functions will develop tourist traffic within and to the State. I hope that development will be literal in terms of product development. If there is to be product development, access must be the starting point or people will not get to Ireland. People access Dublin, Shannon, Cork and now Galway because there are flights to those areas, an improved road network and a train service that is being upgraded.</P>
    <P>With regard to my area, I thank the current Administration because under the same two partners in Government in the last Administration, the Dublin to Derry air link was put in place which gave my region some chance of improved access. However, a train service from Dublin to Derry is awaited. If I arrived in Dublin as a tourist, I would not like to sit in a car for the five hours it takes to get through the traffic to my region. In any case, that journey should not take five hours because it is no further from Dublin than Cork or Limerick. It is also a better part of the country.</P>
    <P>The problem of access has been exacerbated by the Troubles. With a more peaceful climate and the establishment of the Executive, I hope every effort will be made to improve relations and to consider my county as part of the north-west region. With a train service from Dublin to Belfast and from Belfast to Derry, there is no reason why a Dublin to Derry service should not also be provided to increase access to the region.</P>
    <P>When I first entered this House, the Bus Éireann schedule book did not indicate on the accompanying map that it was possible to travel by bus to Malin Head. Surely the first place visitors want to reach in a country is the most northerly or southerly point. It took me a year to resolve this problem and the scheduled map now indicates the route to Malin Head. This illustrates a view consistently held in my county that it is not recognised unless somebody complains.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and the other agencies should ensure that each part of the country is given the same right of access and that there is the same interest in having it accessed. Sections 14 to 18, inclusive, dealing with the membership of the board, reveal a bias, albeit a positive one, in favour of nominees from the north-west who can become members. This bias should continue with the appointment of the statutory board to ensure the north-west is given a fair chance and an expanded role so that it has the opportunity to catch up with other regions. In this regard I agree with five year membership terms and the rotation <Col N="728" /> of offices on the board. It will prevent board members from becoming too complacent.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the marketing and development of tourism facilities and services, including the recruitment, training, education and development of persons for the purpose of employment in the industry. The potential for tourism in my region has not even been touched on. Employment is very important and can be expanded by the tourism trade. The provision of good training by CERT is, therefore, welcome.</P>
    <P>However, I continue to be amazed that hotels in my region, an area of high unemployment, are unable to recruit staff. While I do not strongly object to foreign workers in this area for whom work permits are sought, there is still an opportunity for us to value hotel work undertaken by Irish staff. Hotel staff are the first people tourists meet on arriving. In view of this, it is important that there are Irish staff in Irish hotels. It is a basic requirement because tourists rely on them. If they have a bad experience in a hotel or guesthouse it colours the rest of their holiday. Despite the fact that hotels in my region pay the minimum wage, and more, to acquire staff, it is not seen as employment people want to take up, although there are very successful CERT training courses and I have met people who are enthusiastic about the support they received on them. I still await a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Naughten's comments on the grading of tourism accommodation. In the past few years, in excess of 20 hotels have been constructed in Dublin. If we continue to encourage people to go only to Dublin, as a place to visit or work, it will grind to a standstill. It is in the interests of all, including those inside and outside Dublin, to encourage people to go to other parts of the country. My region and some other locations have a deficit in terms of the variety of accommodation available. There is enough expertise in Bord Fáilte, CERT and the other agencies to address this problem. It does not require great study because there is enough material on which to work.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for funding of &euro;65 million to support enterprises and projects relating to the development of tourism traffic and the development and marketing of tourism facilities and services. While I am pleased that the legislation will be backed by financial resources to ensure that facilities are provided, I question the value of the recent allocation of &euro;30 million to market holidaying at home.</P>
    <P>Tour companies in my region have over the years brought busloads of tourists to local hotels once or twice a week. They run package holidays at cost price and while they do not provide a great deal of turnover for the hotels concerned, it keeps them open throughout the year and keeps their staff employed. It also means that tourists will buy drinks and souvenirs in the local pubs and shops. It is a way of keeping small towns and villages alive during the year. These companies tell me if they got a small amount of support with <Col N="729" /> their marketing they could double the numbers they bring to their area. Instead, funding is diverted to activities, such as the marketing holidaying at home programme, which are of dubious use. Those who have a proven ability to bring people to a region should be supported by the relevant tourism organisation, which should ask them how they can be helped to expand their businesses.</P>
    <P>I agree with the many complaints throughout the country that tourists are being exploited. I recently visited Galway for a race week and was advised to stay in a certain bed and breakfast establishment. When I asked the price of the room I was told it was beyond my reach, despite the fact that my BMW car was in the driveway. That is a damning indictment of the attitude by some to tourism in this country and we are in trouble if we do not address the problem. I stayed in a different bed and breakfast in the city which was much cheaper and I had a very good experience. Had I been a tourist arriving by chance I would have given serious consideration to not staying in the city. It is very serious when one is told it is beyond one's reach to stay in a bed and breakfast in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Special Olympics will be a huge tourism event.</P>
    <P>I commend the people involved in the Special Olympics which will affect many towns throughout the country. They have done considerable work. They were looking for 30,000 volunteers and got 29,980, which is a great sign that volunteerism still exists. There will be a great opportunity for us to welcome people from all over the world and I know we will offer our hospitality. There is already &euro;20 million in benefit in kind. The organisers were looking for &euro;36 million to run the Special Olympics and they have collected &euro;32 million already. The sponsorship of individual athletes, run by the Bank of Ireland, will mean that they will get the rest. I wish the Special Olympics well and hope it will have a long-term, positive impact on tourism.</P>
    <P>We have a problem with our environmental image that needs to be dealt with. We need to deal with our litter problem and the fact that people are able to purchase cars that have failed their NCT tests, drive them around for a couple of days or weeks, burn them out and leave them as eyesores. The councils will have to get some support to get rid of the cars.</P>
    <P>What image do we want to present? Is our country to be a place where people come and drink until they drop? Is the only positive thing visitors will say that they were able to drink tens of pints? It is grand to link alcohol with our image in some respects, but we seem to be creating an image of ourselves as people who drink until we are senseless and fall down. I enjoy a drink but we need to examine our drinking culture.</P>
    <P>Who should we target? We should target more Irish people to attract them on weekend breaks. We will not necessarily get the sun worshipers for two-week holidays, because such people might <Col N="730" /> want to go abroad, but there are people who are prepared to holiday for a long weekend if they get value for money.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on putting the car ferry from Magilligan to Greencastle into operation. It has carried 150,000 people in three months. That is what I call marketing. It should be emphasised that if one puts such a facility in place it markets itself. If people have a means of gaining access to a destination they will talk about it and come back and encourage others to come and we will not have to spend a penny on marketing. We will have to spend money on putting up a sign to say where the ferry route starts and ends and state in a brochure that a ferry is available. Spending considerable sums of money is not always necessary. We spent only £6,000 marketing our ferry, but that was after it was established. It sold itself. I would like to see a train route and more cruise liners coming into the Foyle.</P>
    <P>We are not looking at our culture. We are not selling the concept of coming to Ireland to learn Irish, but we are selling the concept of coming to Ireland to learn English. We are not giving money to our local bands, which are folding up left, right and centre. It is proven in studies in other parts of the world that people will extend their holiday if their is a cultural event for them to participate in or attend. Therefore, if we gave a little money to our town and village bands, they would play during the tourist season and cause some excitement, thus adding another dimension to our tourism product.</P>
    <P>In Donegal we have initiated links with Scotland in terms of putting ferries in operation and I hope that the links will be expanded. Our marketing should take Scotland into account and refer to Celtic holidays. Of all the ventures in Inishowen, golf has been a huge success. It is a golfing Mecca because the car ferry links to Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, and one can gain access to the courses around Letterkenny. The Inishowen peninsula has a vast array of golf courses and even Nick Faldo wanted to buy the one in Glashedy.</P>
    <P>We still have an opportunity to develop horse racing. I would like to think the Minister will take an interest in it now that the sport is included under the arts and tourism brief. Salmon fishing is a pastime that we have not exploited sufficiently. We are working to allow it achieve its great potential. However, there are plans for a wind farm at the mouth of the Foyle and there is no evidence that it will not interfere with the major salmon fishery if it is situated in the proposed location. I do not want to lose a major fishery at the cost of getting 85 30-storey wind turbines. Everything has a place and there is a place for everything and I am not against green energy, but a balance needs to be struck when one considers the major salmon fishery. At the moment the balance is not in our favour.</P>
    <P>The attractions in Inishowen include Malin Head, Grianán of Aileach, the Donagh Cross, St. Mura's burial ground, Cooley Cross, Greencastle <Col N="731" /> Maritime Museum and the planetarium in Greencastle. We have and I hope we will continue to have a large fishing fleet in many of our ports around the coast of Inishowen. These attractions are only a drop in the ocean compared to what we have. We have so much to offer tourists if they get the chance and are encouraged to visit.</P>
    <P>There is a vast array of opportunities for marine leisure that we are not yet utilising. Destinations like the Swilly need an overall management plan which will allow us examine commercial activities, aquaculture, angling and the kinds of people who want to go jet-skiing, windsurfing or swimming. We have massive potential but we are not looking at the industry in an holistic fashion. There is so much more we can say, and as chairperson of the committee I hope we will be able to account for what people are doing. I wish the new authority well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Keaveney. She was on the money when she spoke about some of the wasteful marketing in recent years. I have experience of leaflets sitting on desks, which cost an untold amount of money and brought few benefits. I congratulate the Deputy on her courage in raising that issue.</P>
      <P>To declare an interest, I am still director of a company called Irish Cycling Safaris, which is involved in bringing tourists into the country. I founded the company 14 years ago. Therefore, I have had some experience of the tourism industry in those 14 years.</P>
      <P>It is good to have the opportunity to outline my thoughts on this Bill. I welcome its main thrust, which involves the amalgamation of CERT and Bord Fáilte. It presents an opportunity for a complete review and fresh start in respect of tourism policy. We should not be under any illusion that we need a complete review and a fresh start. My colleague, Deputy Gogarty, highlighted a key point yesterday on which people did not pick up. Tourism figures are showing a 3% drop in visitor numbers &ndash; I am open to correction. The key figure to which the Deputy pointed, which I also read in the papers, is that we are also seeing a 20% decrease in the average length of stay of particular visitors in recent years. This represents a 20% drop in the benefit and money accruing from tourism. That is indicative of a serious problem in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is a law of nature that countries that enjoy huge success in terms of tourism undergo an inevitable cycle. There is no doubt that our tourism industry over the past 14 or 15 years has been phenomenally successful. We have seen unprecedented growth from the late 1980s through to the early and mid-1990s. Perhaps success in this case breeds failure because there is no doubt that it, combined with the massive increase in numbers, put certain locations under too much stress. They received too many visitors in small areas and the quality of the welcome and the ser<Col N="732" /> vice decreased and the price of the service increased dramatically. Perhaps it is a law of nature that certain areas become popular, but their very popularity destroys some of the qualities they are selling.</P>
    <P>We should not be fatalistic and accept that trend or the deterioration in the quality of our welcome. The industry has been very aware of that and has been very keen to change it. I hope the State will row in to review the procedures and structures in the industry to try to undo the trend of poorer quality.</P>
    <P>Irish tourism has a great deal to offer internationally and we remain competitive in many ways. In my experience, the level of quality accommodation has improved dramatically over the past 15 years and is something of which we can still be proud. We have many excellent people who provide a very good and welcoming service. The quality of our food has improved in recent years though it is incredibly expensive and we are in severe danger of pricing ourselves out of the market. While our scenery is very beautiful, developments in terms of the extensive road network, one-off rural housing and agricultural pollution of our waters constitute a range of changes which are chipping away at the strengths and attractiveness of our environment. There is no one feature to which one can point that is synonymous with the loss of the quality of the environment. That quality is lost when a series of small events erode it until you go beyond the point at which a location is interesting to visit. That is a danger and we must tackle environmental issues to protect our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the new body attend particularly to matters in two areas, one of which is product development. The Bill is broadly worded and you could take anything from it. It grants authority to the Minister, the chief executive and members of the authority to implement key sections, in this case section 8 which provides for marketing and product development. One of the real failings of our tourism policy has been a concentration on marketing at the expense of product development. We should have concentrated on providing the products to support marketing. It is unfortunate that Bord Fáilte which was strong in product development and active in registration and monitoring of accommodation was discouraged in this area. From the late 1980s and early 1990s Bord Fáilte was driven towards being a marketing agency purely, but no agency has replaced it in terms of product development. Private companies were brought in to monitor accommodation, but that did not work as effectively as having a State agency do it.</P>
    <P>Product development is fragmented and unco-ordinated, which is something I am keen to see the new authority address. It should be a central State authority which directs investment and the development of our tourism products. Deputy Keaveney was absolutely correct to say that marketing is self-defeating in the long run if it is not based on proper product development in terms of <Col N="733" /> the welcome we provide and our tourism infrastructure. If we sell something we do not have, customers will know and the word will get out. In that case, no matter how much marketing we do, we will fail to convince tourists to visit this country.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of lack of product development. I ran a cycling holiday company which brought in between 2,000 and 3,000 people per year. This significant industry has gone through very difficult times recently and many of the companies involved have left. This is not so much due to a lack of popularity of cycling, but a range of different reasons. The increasing traffic on our roads is making it more difficult to find good routes although we still have plenty of quiet back roads which can be used. We need to develop those back roads as alternative cycling routes through tourist areas.</P>
    <P>That idea became very popular in the mid-1990s when I worked with others to develop a national cycle network which would largely be based on the provision of signage in key locations. The city of Galway is now impossible to cycle out of in safety. The Barna, Headford and Oranmore roads are very dangerous and fast moving, but ten or 15 years ago I could regularly bring groups straight to them from the city centre which was a lovely experience. We need to develop safer routes out of Galway, Killarney, Limerick and other important tourist points. There is a fantastic national park on the edge of Killarney, but it is very difficult to cycle from the town centre to it. It is an amazing place which we are not using.</P>
    <P>When trying to develop the national cycle network I went to the United Kingdom with a number of others where we visited Sustrans which has valuable experience in this area. We asked the charity to help us with a joint report on how to develop a network in Ireland and it agreed. In 1997 I presented to Bord Fáilte and the Minister's Department a very short report arguing the merits of investing in a national cycle network to make use of our assets. Ireland is one of the world's leading cycling destinations and this high value business brings in customers who spend &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per week. They do not want to be stuck in traffic or feel endangered while they are spending that much money.</P>
    <P>The report has languished since then and I have gone back and asked every second year whether there have been developments. I was told that a cycle network was included as a priority in the national development plan and that money was available from Europe within the &euro;100 million budget for tourist development. I was told that we were running into difficulties with Europe and that there was a conflict with the European Commission in terms of how money had been used in the past in this State to develop private rather than public facilities. A long delay in the allocation of funding resulted. I admit that I should have gone back to push it again and again, but it is the job of the State to <Col N="734" /> develop the network. I worked as a private operator and it was not my job to build public facilities. Five or six years on not one penny has been spent and the project is no closer to inception let alone completion, even though we are half way through the national development plan.</P>
    <P>We are missing a huge opportunity while all our competitors are putting facilities in place. France, Germany, Italy and Austria are the other leading international destinations for cycling tourism and they have developed national routes and produced brochures with great maps which explain where you can go and how safe it is to do so. We have not done that. I feel very strongly about this missed opportunity and this failure to ensure product development. No matter how much we advertise Ireland as a green destination, if we do not back it up with the facilities in question, customers will decide to go to the Loire Valley instead or to cycle down the Danube. They are not stupid. They will not go to Galway or Kerry, let alone Roscommon or Carlow or wherever else we hope to attract tourists.</P>
    <P>It is the small things which chip away at the quality of the experience, but which are very easy for a national board to address. We have a plethora of signage and it is the duty of the tourist board to make it easier for visitors to get about. If you get off the Tarbert ferry at Killimer you are faced with a wall of 20 or 30 different signs for various bed and breakfast accommodations. It litters the environment visually and provides no clear indication to tourists as to how to get to accommodation or other facilities. We need a central authority to tackle this because, unfortunately, local authorities do not seem to be able to do it. There has to be a common thread across the country that tourists can pick up on to better understand where to go and how to find amenities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will remember well the huge controversy we have had about how to develop our heritage industry. Do we develop large heritage sites or other facilities? I advocate very much the development of small, quality sites rather than large heritage centres. If one visits a Celtic or monastic site, having 400 or 500 other people there at the same time takes away from the special quality of the occasion. I would like to see tourists being dispersed as much as possible throughout the country to visit the plethora of interesting historical sites that exist. In order to do that, however, we need a good map of such sites as well as a good local structure, including small parking bays for two or three cars near stone circles and other such locations. The provision of such amenities would have to be co-ordinated nationally, with a plan for providing proper access to our heritage sites. It is not good enough to leave it to the Office of Public Works to put a fógra or notice which provides no information for visitors, such as access details or other arrangements. It should be the job of the new authority to develop a clear strategy for the clever use of heritage sites. I am disappointed that the Bill, as <Col N="735" /> published, gives no indication about that kind of thinking but is, instead, very general. It states that the board shall develop marketing, product and tourism facilities but it provides no sense of direction as to how that can be done.</P>
    <P>I could cite a whole range of product areas in this regard. Deputy Naughten made a valid point about the huge investment required to promote angling and protect our rivers. Without that product development issue being taken into consideration, however, we will not continue to attract anglers, whereas with it we will hardly need to advertise the facilities. The Acting Chairman, Deputy McGinley, will know of areas in his own constituency that once boasted fantastic salmon rivers and lakes &ndash; in the Bunbeg area, for example, and elsewhere. On a recent visit to Donegal I was told that one lake in the Poisoned Glen area contained only 50 salmon last year compared to thousands in previous years. Unless we develop that lake by restocking it, we will never attract visiting anglers there. If there were 50,000 salmon in the lake instead of 50 it would not have to be advertised because people would come from all over the world in huge numbers, even in the lashing rain of mid-winter. That issue has everything to do with the new tourism development authority and I want to see it engaging in this sort of work, although I do not get any sense from the Bill that it will do so. Perhaps the Bill can be amended on Committee Stage to include such a provision.</P>
    <P>Visitors seeking special interest tourism products, including angling, walking and cycling in which I am engaged, will come here in good times and bad. They are less inclined to be scared away by terrorist threats. Even if Ireland in general goes out of fashion, salmon fishing will remain the chosen pursuit of some anglers. In addition, outdoor pursuits such as walking and cycling are more likely to remain in fashion in an economic downturn. Therefore, even if we are going through a product lifecycle where Ireland may be, for a period, out of fashion as a general tourist destination, we can hold onto high value, high quality tourists who will return if we develop our special interest areas. Product development is the correct tourism strategy for this country, rather than going for the large volume, low value market where we will be fighting an uphill battle. The international perception is that Ireland is an expensive destination and the welcome is not what it was. Some visitors may choose other locations from among the many competing destinations around the world.</P>
    <P>From personal experience I can back up what Deputy Keaveney said earlier. In promoting my own company, I have attended many international fairs which featured a small desk selling Ireland. One might be in a hall at a messe or trade fair in Germany with 300 or 400 stands all selling their tourism products. My experience has been that I have had to jostle for position with Bord Fáilte which is promoting Ireland, along <Col N="736" /> with three or four regional tourism organisations producing brochures to sell particular areas in Ireland. To my mind, we were confusing the target audience because there were too many people marketing Ireland abroad. To take my own example of cycling and walking holidays, there might be seven or eight different flyers at a tourist fair, describing cycling holidays in the south east, north-west and the west. The people to whom we were selling were not thinking of Ireland in that way; they were thinking &ldquo;Maybe I'll go to Patagonia this year, or maybe I'll go to Ireland&rdquo;. Therefore, they needed one good brochure selling Ireland as a destination &ndash; not a plethora of brochures selling particular areas of the country.</P>
    <P>We have allowed a tier of regional tourism development boards to develop, which in many cases do some very good work, although I would like to see them concentrating on product development work since they should have the relevant local knowledge. I am not too sure, however, that those boards should be adding their voices to a central tourist authority when it comes to international marketing because that only confuses people, as well as being a wasteful duplication of resources.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the Bill as to how the local regional tourism authorities will relate to the new national tourism development authority. I understand that the regional authorities have to be subservient to the central authority, but that has not been clear in the past five or ten years. There is often much confusion as to where the real authority lies or from where funding emanates. The new authority should comprise an amalgamation of what is good in both the public and private sectors. I do not know how the Minister will achieve it but I would encourage him to provide a staffing structure for Bord Fáilte whereby people can transfer between the industry to the new national tourism development authority. In that way the new authority will not become a fixed, rigid structure with the private sector operating on the one hand and the State on the other. There needs to be a flow of staff from one to the other so that good ideas can be shared.</P>
    <P>I would beseech the Minister, who has huge power in appointing all 12 members to the board of the new authority, to put a spread of people in and not just the standard, big business representatives. I was going to say single, white males but we do not have many of those. A spread of interests among board members would create a diversity of opinion from people involved in a range of interests, including the environment and consumer affairs. The board would not just be reflective of the tourism industry, therefore, but would provide a broad range of directions for the new authority which is very welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the National Tourism Development Authority Bill which provides the House with an opportunity to discuss <Col N="737" /> the country's overall tourism product as well as highlighting some development issues from the local, regional and national perspectives. I have listened carefully to the debate and I note that many speakers, while dealing with national issues concerning the legislation, have also mentioned the desirability of developing local and regional attractions in their areas. That is what has happened with regard to tourism funding. Up to now we have had a number of national bodies, including Bord Fáilte and CERT, in addition to local tourism organisations. Local authorities have subscribed to those local organisations which have been successful to a certain degree. We continue to increase our numbers as well as attracting people from other parts, who would not normally visit this country.</P>
      <P>Given the challenges posed by developing markets in attracting holidaymakers world-wide, we need to sharpen our focus and our tourism product generally. The Bill will sharpen that focus in establishing the board of the new authority and determining how we are to deal with existing tourism structures. Members of the new board should be drawn widely from the industry and beyond. We need new thinking in the authority, including a new commercial approach and new blood in the industry to bring us into the next phase of developing the tourism product nationally. This should be done while not forgetting the successful foundation work that has been contributed to date by the other organisations. We are talking about marketing Ireland as a product and we will have to determine exactly what that means. Ireland has to be marketed as a quality destination which is constantly competing with other destinations offering sun, sea and sand. That is what seems to be happening in the marketplace. We have a good product but we are not considering the full picture; we are not placing sufficient emphasis on this country's physical attributes.</P>
      <P>Many speakers in the debate have referred to recreational pursuits such as fishing, hunting, riding and shooting, which form part of our tourism industry but we have not done enough to market those products abroad. We need to examine how we can develop each of those activities. Mount Juliet in Kilkenny is an example from the private sector where investors have been willing to build on a product which offers fishing, shooting and riding in addition to golf. We need to provide more assistance to those who are willing to help us in the national effort to attract visitors for such activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alongside such considerations, we must pay more attention to protecting the environment. Ireland is seen abroad as a place with a green image where one can relax and, despite the weather, enjoy a range of activities in the comfortable surroundings of quality hotels or bed and breakfast establishments. I am concerned, however, about the cead míle fáilte upon which we built our tourism product. Visiting hotels, guest houses and restaurants one can see that the <Col N="738" /> welcome has deteriorated. CERT was involved in this area but the new authority will have to focus its attention on this aspect. Many tourists now complain about how they are being treated throughout the country, although only a small minority of operators fail to provide the standards to which people have become accustomed. The new authority will have to address standards in hotels, B&amp;Bs and other tourist locations. In recent years, concerns have been expressed within the industry about how tourists are treated on arrival here. Much more needs to be done to improve the skills of staff who are dealing directly with tourists. The economic upturn has made it difficult to recruit staff for the tourism sector and, therefore, it has become even harder to persuade owners of tourism premises to allow their staff to undertake further training. It is also difficult to provide staff continuity, thus maintaining the skills and standards in tourism establishments. The new authority faces a huge challenge so funding will have to be forthcoming in order for it to ensure that courses are made available to tourism industry employees who will be properly trained to meet and greet visitors.</P>
    <P>Many tourists travel from county to county visiting flagship national monuments which have been restored by the Office of Public Works or, more recently, Dúchas. Hundreds of sites, however, have not been properly restored and are not properly presented to tourists. For example, Kilkenny Castle is extremely busy even in off-peak visiting times. A huge investment has been made there and it attracts large numbers of tourists, yet there are tapestries wrapped in plastic in the castle's stores which cannot be seen by anyone. These should be brought out and presented for public view.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there are many old documents concerning the history of Kilkenny Corporation and Borough Council that should be properly presented because they would be of interest to tourists but funding is not available to do that. Funding is needed to present local tourism products to the public. It that were done, visitors might stay longer to see more of the country and they would better understand our heritage.</P>
    <P>The new authority will have to examine how heritage sites are managed. Currently they are managed through Dúchas and I do not intend my remarks to be a reflection on that agency's management structure. A new commercialism is required in that area, perhaps featuring a new management model to examine best practice as regards how historic sites are presented in other European countries. In that way the authority will be able to make accurate commercial decisions on how best to present flagship monuments throughout the country. The time has come for change in that area.</P>
    <P>Recently, I read a newspaper article about measures that are being taken to privatise the Coliseum in Rome. I am not saying that we should begin to privatise our heritage sites but that example from Italy only goes to show that <Col N="739" /> initiatives are being taken to change existing tourism management structures across Europe in order to present tourism products in a different way. These steps are aimed at ensuring that as much revenue as possible is earned for the upkeep of such famous monuments. The new national tourism development authority will have to examine the commercial aspects of our national heritage sites.</P>
    <P>There are sites that have not been restored and I cannot imagine that the new authority will look at the overall picture without also considering what exactly tourists look for when visiting this country. Some sort of consultative process will be required between Dúchas and the new authority in order to ensure that heritage sites which are not publicly accessible will be developed to attract tourists. Such measures will help to promote tourism throughout the country. The restoration plans for such sites should dovetail with the new authority's objectives. I have seen very little such movement in recent years, however.</P>
    <P>I can list a number of monuments in my own county which could prove to be huge attractions for visitors. In fact, they currently attract tourists even though no money has been spent on them. Grangefertagh tower, for example, is an excellent location for visitors who are interested in our historical attractions. I have suggested that Dúchas should improve locations such as Maudlin Castle in Maudlin Street, which could easily be roofed to become a museum housing artefacts of interests to tourists. St. Mary's Church in Kilkenny is an extremely important site, yet no money has been spent on it and it is falling into disrepair. The monument and graves around it are being broken and vandalised and nothing has been done. When thousands of people visit the castle they miss an extraordinary building called the Hole in the Wall which is off High Street in Kilkenny. Ways and means must be found to make these very interesting sites open and available to the tourist. There is a great view from Tullaherin tower but it is not open to the public either. A common sight at all these unrestored monuments is a &ldquo;no entry&rdquo; sign and scaffolding surrounding the buildings. I cannot understand why we do not concentrate finances in a number of these sites, move through them meticulously and finish the restoration work so that tourists can safely visit them.</P>
    <P>There are many local products which could be developed. There is interest from the United States in the coal-mining area of Laois-Offaly-north Kilkenny and this could be developed. I hope the board will engage with the other agencies that are funding products such as this to ensure they are dovetailed with the board's objectives.</P>
    <P>Kells priory is a local initiative about which I have always been concerned. It is the oldest mon<Col N="740" /> astic site in Europe and was allocated &euro;300,000 in 1999.</P>

      <P>Over 10,000 to 15,000 people visit that site in a two-week period and I believe that such a number of people would not be seen in IMMA over many months. Artists such as Barry Flanagan, Elizabeth Frink, Lynn Chadwick, Peter Randall Page and 20 other emerging Irish artists have been exhibited over the past years but the site still failed to obtain a grant of &euro;10,000 from the Arts Council this year although the British Arts Council has provided support to the tune of &euro; 3,000 to &euro;4,000 for each year of the exhibition. This is an example of a local community taking the initiative by presenting a serious monument in its care and matching it to art and culture. This is not dumbed-down art because these are fine, leading edge artists who are universally recognised. They looked at Kells and made the decision to participate in the event. It has become a tourist attraction as a result. Now when people come to Kilkenny Castle for the opening of Kilkenny Arts Week they will automatically visit Kells to see not only the historic site but also the exhibition which now has a reputation for showing art of high quality which can be easily appreciated. That project has helped to bring art to the people and ordinary people can now appreciate the work of those leading figures. The 20 emerging Irish artists are given the opportunity to exhibit with leading artists. It was a huge blow to that local community when the money was not allocated to them. Of course, that will not put a stop to the local initiative and I am glad to say it will continue and I give it my support and will continue my involvement with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of arts festivals are held throughout the country, including the Kilkenny festival, and I am pleased they were allocated special funding <Col N="741" /> by way of a different fund. The Kilkenny festival attracts huge numbers of visitors. It gives the local community an opportunity to express itself through art and music, for example. It is a festival in which the local community can participate and which develops an appreciation of the arts.</P>
    <P>It is important to take into consideration the presentation of festivals, in particular the parades on Saint Patrick's Day. That day is our opportunity to market ourselves through television to a world-wide audience. It is important to invest in those festivals and ensure that local culture and heritage and, for example, local bands, would be kept alive. A small amount of money would give a lease of life to these local ventures.</P>
    <P>Any tourist who leaves Ireland satisfied with his or her holiday could be regarded as a voluntary salesperson for the country. We should remember that when we are making decisions relating to tourism. I visited New York last year and met the people working for Bord Fáilte. I understand the challenges they face in encouraging visitors to come to Ireland rather than other places. We must do everything possible to promote the country and to show it as a green, informal and enjoyable place for a holiday. That links back to local communities and local festivals and local support for our culture and heritage. We are dealing with a niche market and we must make the investment in tourism on that basis. I commend the Bill to the House and I hope that the members of that authority will look beyond their own body to see how other State agencies are funded and how they contribute to tourism. This industry will face a huge challenge in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis an mBille atá os comhair an Tí inniú. I welcome this Bill which seeks to amalgamate two agencies, Bord Fáilte and CERT, which have given outstanding service to the development and quality of the product. We do not give much attention to CERT in this House even though it has been in existence since 1963. It has educated many employees in the tourism business both at home and abroad. The most important people in any tourism business are the staff. Many CERT-trained staff have worked abroad and then return as successful managers of hotel developments in particular. I favour the amalgamation of both organisations. It is a logical step to bring the staff of a very successful organisation such as CERT into the front line of the maintenance of high standards of service and expertise and quality of delivery of the food product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy McGuinness I represent the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny. The tourism industry is one of the biggest employers in Kilkenny. People often forget that it has such a major impact on so many livelihoods. There are 15 hotels in Kilkenny city, 11 of which have been built within the last ten years. The person who started the ball rolling in relation to expanding the quality of the product <Col N="742" /> was the late Bobby Kerr of Newpark Hotel in Kilkenny. The hotel, which was built in 1966, has developed a reputation second to none. The directors took a big risk and made a large investment to ensure that it was best placed to take advantage of conference and convention events as well as the normal functions any hotel development would have. The atmosphere generated there by the late Mr. Kerr and his fellow directors was more like that of a family home than an hotel.</P>
    <P>There are 19 high quality restaurants in Kilkenny City. Despite the fall off in tourism numbers in many parts of the country, Kilkenny seems fortunate to be able to maintain its numbers. That is possibly because of its proximity to the capital and the excellent product offered throughout the year in terms of hotel, leisure, golfing and other activities. Even in winter we are fortunate to be able to attract many events and visitors. Some come for late night activities while others come for sporting and leisure activities. Our product seems to be attractive to visitors, particularly those from the Dublin area. There is a big spin-off for agricultural production and marketing in the general hinterland of Kilkenny which is often overlooked. A huge amount of money is being recycled in the local economy through tourism and that is probably the most important element of the tourism product.</P>
    <P>This signals the need for State involvement. We often spend enormous amounts of money through statutory bodies such as the IDA trying to bring overseas investment into the country when we already have a tourism product here with which we could do a great deal more with imagination and product development. Often we depend on private investors or the local community to come up with ideas and we wait for people with good ideas to come forward to Bord Fáilte or some other statutory body for assistance.</P>
    <P>State agencies should have a more pro-active approach. They should develop more proposals and seek investment from local, national and international people to develop the product in areas suitable for tourism development. We often react to events rather than being pro-active in developing niche tourism products. Whether in Cork, Carlow or Kilkenny the advantages we have should be exploited and we should promote investment by people who have made money over the years. Many of these would like to invest in an imaginative way but should be given some support from the State to do so.</P>
    <P>It was a mistake in the budget to reduce the measures relating to capital allowances. This will result in a deteriorating level of investment in pubs and in product development in regard to hotels, catering and guest houses. People who know our bedroom capacity is not as high as it could be and who want to invest in our tourism product are now having a rethink because of this budget measure. I urge the Minister for Finance to look at this issue again in the context of the Finance Bill. He should look at tourism as an <Col N="743" /> indigenous product in which people would like to invest if they got some tax incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>Tourism affects all of us but not all of us realise the importance of the product. It is crucial that we protect our environment and have clean air and water. All Departments must help the National Tourism Development Authority to achieve those objectives and to ensure that nothing is done to damage our environment, our landscape or the quality of the infrastructural measures needed to sustain tourists. For example, the Department of Agriculture and Food proposals concerning the nitrate directive or the expansion of the REPS scheme are crucial not only to the welfare of agriculture and farmers but to the overall protection of our environment. Assistance from Departments would help those involved in farming to sustain themselves and would also be part of a wider package of measures needed to keep our environment pleasing to tourists.</P>
    <P>Insurance is a huge issue in regard to land owners who would like to offer greater access to their land. The people of rural Ireland welcome visitors. They like to see opportunities made available for forest or established walks but they have not the capacity to open many of these areas to the public because of the insurance issue. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a role to play in this issue to help the National Tourism Development Authority. There are cross cutting issues relating to tourism that are affected by the activity or lack of activity of other Departments. Insurance is one of those issues.</P>
    <P>Dúchas is an unsatisfactory organisation in the delivery of its expenditure and product. There are many examples of where money has been allocated but not spent. In 1995 the Augustinian priory in Kells, County Kilkenny, had money allocated to it under the operational programme on heritage but eight years later that money has not been spent. It would not happen in the private sector. Eight years later there is nothing to see but a room in this beautiful village which is a spin-off location for visitors to Kilkenny City. The priory has a great deal of history attached and is an important national monument. Nobody in Dúchas seems to care or show responsibility or accountability for money allocated eight years ago.</P>
    <P>It is frustrating for public representatives to have the House delegate authority to a statutory body such as Dúchas which is then not answerable to any Deputy or Minister. The Minister must be more pro-active in dealing with organisations like Dúchas which is at arms length from everybody. It seems to be a law unto itself. It is not acceptable that proposals for places such as Grace's chapel in my parish of Tullaroan or proposals advanced years ago for the development of a coal mining museum in Castlecomer or any other issue should be shelved. Dúchas seems to be doing its own thing in an unaccountable <Col N="744" /> fashion and nobody at national level is ensuring that the good programmes are properly implemented as outlined in the programmes published every five years under the development plan. I would appreciate it if the Minister expressed my concerns to Dúchas.</P>
    <P>Tidy towns competitions, FÁS and local community groups are making improvements. It is a retrograde step to cut back on community employment schemes, which made a major contribution towards enhancing the tourism product. FÁS, through the community youth training programme, made a major contribution in my parish of Tullaroan through Brod Tullaroan, which is both a GAA museum and a heritage centre. Were it not for the activity of FÁS, this product, which is making a major contribution to the development of tourism in west Kilkenny, would not exist. The national tourism development authority needs to co-ordinate its role with other statutory bodies such as Dúchas and FÁS to ensure that nowhere is neglected in our efforts to develop tourism.</P>
    <P>Our built heritage is of crucial importance. In the city of Kilkenny we are fortunate to have Kilkenny Castle, which has great drawing power for visitors from all over the country and further afield. Once people are in the city we need to give them ancillary tourism products. Some 350,000 visitors per annum come to Kilkenny and we need to be ready to take advantage of the fact that these people are already in the vicinity. We need to get them to stay overnight and to explore other parts of the county such as those I mentioned that are eight or ten miles out the road.</P>
    <P>Castlecomer is one of the most neglected areas in my constituency. It has suffered a loss of jobs recently through the demise of Comerama. Tourism can potentially give back employment to this area and this matter should be considered. Otherwise, we have to spend an enormous amount of money trying to attract replacement jobs through IDA Ireland. There is a proposal at the moment in this regard that should be explored. The tourism authority would do well to look at some of these proposals to enhance the tourism product.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify some issues in regard to the Bill? There is no reference to the regional tourism organisations, although they have played a role in co-ordinating the effort between various counties and through local authorities. The South Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation Limited has done a reasonably good job. Flagship tourism destinations such as Kilkenny Castle, Waterford Glass, Ferrycarrig in Wexford and the Rock of Cashel are a Mecca for tourism in their respective counties and through imaginative programmes co-ordinated by the regional tourism organisations they have been able to maximise their potential. It would be a retrograde step if we did not continue to have this current level of co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the role of the regional tourism organisations and tourist offices <i>vis-à-vis</i> Bord Fáilte, particularly, given that they <Col N="745" /> currently receive significant funding from it? The Bill is not specific in regard to the product, the staff and the relationship between RTOs and Bord Fáilte. Existing staff must, understandably, have concerns about the new structures and roles being developed in the area of tourism. The position needs to be spelled out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about a national convention centre over the past ten years. It is believed that we are losing out on an enormous number of potential visitors. Various studies have been carried out by successive Ministers which confirm this, yet nothing has happened in regard to building a centre. The previous Minister, Deputy McDaid, talked the talk but, unfortunately, he did not walk the walk in delivering that product from EU funding. That money is probably no longer available.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I proposed to him that we look at the building of regional convention centres. In the Minister's constituency a convention centre almost exists already with the number of hotels in Killarney, but I am sure it could do with another facility to enhance tourism through state-of-the-art facilities for the type of product on which we are currently supposed to be losing out in international terms. I propose Kilkenny as a suitable location for such a convention centre. There are sites available which would enhance the image of an existing tourism location by this value-added product through conferences and conventions.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has experience of constituents who are not so keen on the side-effects of potential new industries for their areas. They want an omelette without breaking eggs. They want to protect our heritage to the exclusion of certain industrial developments that might come into an area. Nobody would have a problem with the type of developments to which I am referring, which would be compatible with existing hotel and catering facilities in any area. Regional conference centres would help to dissipate the concentration of activity in the capital city, which is in line with the national spatial strategy where the objective is to move people out of the capital into the regions.</P>
    <P>The area of angling has been referred to by previous speakers. We have to tackle the illegal activity that has been taking place for too long off our coast. We need to allow fish to come up the rivers. It is a sad reflection on our State that we turn a blind eye so often to the type of activity that goes on off our coast. Our fishery protection vessels must take a more proactive role in ensuring that in our estuaries, in particular, the law is enforced and fish can come up rivers such as the Nore, the Suir and the Barrow in the south-east so that those who go fishing will not come home disappointed every day.</P>
    <P>There are a number of challenges facing the tourism industry. I was surprised the Minister for Defence did not mention on the Order of Business this morning that even though we have &euro;4 billion in tourism earnings it was a retrograde <Col N="746" /> step to impose 1% VAT in the budget on the bottom-line profitability of our tourism sector. It is an indigenous sector that is doing well for employment and local communities at a time when we are under pressure in terms of costs and competitiveness, among other things. On too many occasions we have priced ourselves out of the market and if we continue to do so we will kill the goose that laid the golden egg.</P>
    <P>The Ireland of the welcomes is not always evident and we need to look at both the attitudes of staff and the issue of law and order. The standard of signage is very poor in many parts of the country. There is an opportunity to redress some of the measures in regard to capital gains and capital allowances that will enhance the possibility of further investment by individuals who wish to develop the tourism potential in their localities. It is an indigenous resource that still has enormous potential for development, which is needed if we are to compete with other European destinations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and give credit to the Minister for taking this initiative. I add my voice to that of the Deputies who have praised the great work done by Bord Fáilte and CERT over the years. Their trojan work for the tourism industry has sometimes gone unnoticed.</P>
      <P>My constituency is similar to that of the Minister in that it is hugely dependent on tourism. The area has many small farmers and fishermen who supplement their income with tourism activities. Tourism is an important industry in this country, one which has been growing rapidly in recent years. I have no doubt tourism will surpass agriculture and fishing in its value to the economy in many areas of rural Ireland on the west and south-west coast in time to come. Agriculture is changing rapidly and tourism is becoming more important.</P>
      <P>In the western part of my constituency we do not have a sufficient number of hotels. I am delighted to note that there are advanced plans for a new hotel in Schull in west Cork. I believe development on it is to begin next year. This is an area close to the Minister's heart and one which badly needs an hotel. In the 1960s, PJ and Finbar Murphy had the foresight to build the West Lodge Hotel in Bantry. This has been a huge asset to the town and to the region and I acknowledge their initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed recently to hear that Bantry House is to close to visitors this year. Bantry House attracts between 40,000 and 50,000 visitors annually and is a major tourist attraction. It has wet weather facilities and is a wonderful asset in west Cork where we have our share of soft, wet days. I ask the Minister to take a hands-on approach to this matter and to see what can be done. I acknowledge that the House is in private ownership and that difficulties might present themselves but the loss of Bantry House to the region I represent would be like the loss of Muckross House to Killarney or the Rock of Cashel to County Tipperary. I am, therefore, concerned <Col N="747" /> about this matter. Bantry House has considerable adjoining land and perhaps some of this could be sold. The owners of the house also own the foreshore rights to Bantry Bay. I will encourage the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to buy out these rights in order to throw a financial lifeline to Bantry House. I hope this is a temporary glitch and that whatever is necessary will be done to ensure that the house re-opens next year. The significance of Bantry House to tourism providers in the region is enormous. We cannot walk away from this problem and I urge the Minister to look closely at it.</P>
    <P>The Martello tower on Garinish Island has been closed to the public for the past two years. The tower, which is one of the salient features of the island, has been closed for safety reasons. I looked at the tower last year and I am convinced that it could be made safely accessible to the public. It is one of the jewels in the crown of the region.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the various tourism organisations on the amount of money spent in developing tourism in west Cork. Mizen Vision, for example, is widely supported, it attracts numerous tourists and is a huge success. Leader invested considerable money in this project and I acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Hill walking has become a successful aspect of tourism in Cork and other counties, such as Kerry, Clare and Mayo. Hill walking in Ireland has a greater number of participants than golf. I am an admirer of all sports but I have never been a great golfer. I have had more success with a hurley although I am not very good at that game either. Much economic benefit could be achieved through the promotion of hill walking throughout the country. In my area there are two registered tourist walks. I was closely involved with the development of the Sheep's Head walk. It took two or three years to get the project up and running. We negotiated with local farmers and commonage holders, we sorted out the insurance issue with the help of Bord Fáilte and there was also county council involvement.</P>
    <P>In the adjoining Beara peninsula there is currently an impasse, about which I am concerned. The farming community is at loggerheads with the tourism organisations and many of the walks on the peninsula have been closed. A top-up REPS grant was promised to land owners who allowed tourists to walk through their land in a safe manner. I ask the Minister to discuss this matter with the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs to see if this problem can be rectified. Closing these walks is a huge blow to the economy of these regions. Much money and local effort have been put into developing these walks. There was considerable consultation with the farmers and the local community and walks are a wonderful attraction. When I occasionally walk a few kilometres across these hills on a Saturday or <Col N="748" /> Sunday I am amazed at the number of people I meet using these facilities. Walking is one of the healthiest exercises we can have and is very inexpensive. It should be encouraged particularly as the Department of Health and Children is constantly looking for ways to cut our health care bills. Hill walks have been a fantastic success. If the impasse that has arisen in the Beara peninsula is not resolved it will have a knock-on effect in other areas in west Cork, Kerry and further afield. That would be a pity.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to criticism of Dúchas. I am not in a position to criticise Dúchas but I ask the Minister to consider one or two matters. We had an unhappy experience at the Warren beach near Clonakilty and Roscarbery where the presence of a sea pea colony prevented the funding or works to prevent coastal erosion. The sea pea have apparently left but meanwhile many of the sand dunes and much of the local pitch and putt course has been washed away. It is necessary to break shells in order to scramble eggs. In this instance I was disappointed with the approach taken by Dúchas. Funding has now been put in place by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to put groynes in place to stop further erosion. The Warren beach is a huge asset to the area.</P>
    <P>There is a notion abroad that Dúchas is an independent body which is not accountable to anyone. I ask the Minister examine the principle of corporate governance. I have come across this idea in my work with the all-party committee on the Constitution and it is being modelled on what the Department of Finance is doing. The idea of corporate governance and accountability might be broadened to other Departments. The Minister might consider this idea.</P>
    <P>We are used to hearing of Bord Fáilte and CERT and we will be sorry to see those names going. Nevertheless, I support the thrust of what the Minister is doing. The new National Tourism Development Authority will be a major asset. I have no doubt the Minister will achieve a major success and will benefit Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>I hope the situation in Iraq will be safely concluded and that American tourists will continue to come to Ireland. American tourists are hugely important in west Cork as well as in places such as Killarney, Dingle, Parknasilla and Kenmare in the Minister's constituency. When the international situation stabilises we must redouble our efforts to attract American and Canadian tourists. We need tourists from all areas but American tourists are a huge part of the Irish market. When the world settles down I hope this market will be rejuvenated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to follow my colleague in complimenting the Minister on bringing forward this very important Bill.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech on Second Stage the Minister set out the importance of the foreign earnings of the tourism industry to Ireland. The economy earns approximately &euro;4 billion from foreign tourists <Col N="749" /> and &euro;1.2 billion from domestic tourists. That is a huge amount of money and a good deal of income. It behoves all of us to work hard to ensure the tourist market increases and that Ireland holds its own on the international stage of tourism. We have to acknowledge openly that there are more competitors for those tourists' dollars, euros or whatever. More countries recognise the value of foreign tourist earnings and have entered the market. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, countries such as Poland with Warsaw and Cracow; Hungary with Budapest, the Czech Republic with Prague &ndash; beautiful cities which are well worth visiting &ndash; are competing. We have to ensure our product is up to the same standard or higher so that customers not only come to Ireland but return here. That is very much part of the Minister's strategy. It is no use having a customer once, we want them to come to Ireland again and again.</P>
    <P>I was dismayed by some of the contributions from our Green colleagues who appeared to totally denigrate the Irish tourist product but given that they supported people attacking aircraft with hatchets, it is not surprising. Be that as it may, tourism is very important. The basic strategy of dividing the two tourism functions, the marketing function from the product function, is the way to go. As I understand the strategy, Tourism Ireland will market Ireland as a tourist destination on a national basis, North and South, and will focus exclusively on bringing tourists to Ireland, where the National Tourism Development Authority, which will combine the internal functions of Bord Fáilte and CERT, will bring the product up to standard.</P>
    <P>We have some of the finest ingredients of the tourism industry anywhere in the world. We still have very friendly people, beautiful scenery, ancient history and monuments and a relatively green environment compared with many other countries. With those positive ingredients the challenge for us is to ensure that the tourist who comes to Ireland has an enjoyable experience. I hope the authority will be proactive along with all the State agencies and local authorities in regard to those who come to Ireland. For somebody coming off the ferry we should make sure the signage is good and in different languages, that the roads are good and that people have easy access to information on the web, through leaflets and pamphlets.</P>
    <P>I have raised the issue of clamping on many occasions with my local authority, Dublin City Council. Is there anything more negative than the clamping of a tourist's car? Tourists may be in breach of parking regulations of which they are not aware. We should ensure the parking regulations in our cities and towns are shown in different languages to ensure tourists' cars are not clamped. We must work hard to ensure bona fide tourists have an enjoyable experience and do not encounter such negative aspects.</P>
    <P>Integrated ticketing between all our public transport facilities is essential. We must also look <Col N="750" /> at the products on offer. In the city of Dublin there are some marvellous products such as the National Museum; three great galleries, the National Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art and the Hugh Lane Gallery which has the permanent Francis Bacon exhibition, a treasure trove of paintings, and his original studio. We have a great music scene. We have a great pub scene and I do not apologise for saying that. It would be naive to think people would not enjoy the pub scene in Dublin. That is a plea for responsible enjoyment in drinking and not a plea for alcoholism. While we have to find a balance, it is part of our culture and I make no apologies for that. Part of the image of people who come to Ireland is that they will be able to mix in an enjoyable social atmosphere with music and so on. That is part of what the Irish marketing and tourist package should be.</P>
    <P>We can do more in Dublin. While there are some moves afoot, we are badly in need of a convention centre and it should be a priority for the Minister. We are losing a great deal of business in Dublin because we have no major convention centre. I am pleased to learn the Abbey Theatre will be refurbished. In the long term, we should consider the possibility of an opera house. Dublin should have an opera festival like most capital cities. We also need a Dublin museum and some work has been done on starting such a museum in Stack A in the Customs House docks.</P>
    <P>More could be done in regard to James Joyce and William Butler Yeats. A greater number of Nobel prizes for literature came out of Dublin and Ireland than anywhere else in the world. We should herald and be proud of that achievement. There should be some way of underlining our incredibly rich literary heritage. As Lord Mayor of Dublin in 2001-02, the first function at which I officiated was the opening of the James Joyce school in Newman House. I was flabbergasted that people from Japan, China, America, Korea, South America and all over the world wanted to learn and study the writings of James Joyce. He is recognised as one of the finest writers ever in the English language. We must do a little more work on marketing the huge literary aspect of the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that we also have to work on our competitiveness. That is the key issue. When people come to Ireland, they must get good value for money. That does not mean we should market Ireland at the bottom of the barrel. People do not expect something for nothing but they want value for money and a top quality product. We have some of the finest beef, fish and dairy produce in the world. The job for the National Tourism Development Authority is to ensure those products are available to the tourist on a value for money basis and to ensure there is a high standard of cuisine and service.</P>
    <P>While much marketing research has been done, there should also be a proper complaints system for those who have not had a good experience in Ireland. I commend the Bill and thank the Mini<Col N="751" /> ster for the energetic way in which he is reforming the tourism sector. I look forward to the future development of the industry in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and the fact that there will be more cohesion in the area of marketing and developing our tourist product and of ensuring excellence. I pay tribute to Bord Fáilte for the excellent work it has done down through the years in developing the tourist business which is of enormous benefit to the economy. The tourism industry employs 140,000 people and generates foreign exchange of &euro;3 billion per year which is of enormous benefit to the State. We must protect it and ensure its further development. The Bill before the House is a step towards that end.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to CERT for its work in the area of training. We have some good people at the coal face of the industry but we must ensure they are also marketers for the industry. Those who serve in bars, restaurants and in the preparation of food and those interacting with tourists are our most important marketing people. We are beginning to hear from time to time that visitors do not receive the same welcome as they did in the past. I do not know how factual that is but we hear more comment in the media that we are less friendly and that we do not give the same welcome to tourists as we did in the past. That is a pity. CERT could intervene here by ensuring its trainees are fully aware of the need to be marketeers for the industry and that visitors are treated as they expect to be treated. It does not take a lot of effort to be nice to people. It should be part of the job description of a person at the coalface of the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>In paying tribute to CERT, I understand there may be some industrial relations problems remaining in regard to the amalgamation of Bord Fáilte and CERT. I hope those problems will be dealt with and maybe the Minister will detail the situation in his reply. The one thing needed in both organisations is full and enthusiastic support for and acceptance of the merger so that they unite quickly and become a cohesive organisation to service the industry. Any difficulties in that area will create sluggishness at a time when one needs excellence.</P>
      <P>I wish to turn to the west and south and what has happened there. Last year was not one of the best years for the west and south in terms of tourism. I understand that while the first six to seven months of the year were extremely bad, there was a pick-up in the latter five or six months from July onwards. That was a welcome trend, but there is a need to actively promote the west and south. The Dublin-Belfast axis is progressing and we have seen how the Dublin tourism trade has increased, especially since Shannon's status was changed. I welcome that change but we must be conscious of difficulties which have developed in the tourism industry in the west and south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" />Much investment has gone into the tourism industry in those regions and the product is good. We need to place additional emphasis on the promotion of the west and south. I welcome the US Airways decision to fly to Shannon and Dublin from Philadelphia. It is, however, disappointing Ryanair has decided to reduce the Frankfurt-Shannon daily flight to a weekly one which is of no value. Ryanair knows its business and it is doing this for totally commercial reasons, and I suppose it is difficult to criticise that.</P>
    <P>Another issue is how expensive Ireland is in comparison to other countries. It is becoming more expensive for tourists. Surveys of tourists refer more to how expensive it is. We are losing competitiveness in this area. As in the case of other industries, hotels and suppliers are being hit heavily by insurance costs. We go on about insurance in this House but it is time to take a serious look at how insurance has increased and at tackling the problems in this area. An increase of 40% &ndash; up to 200% in certain circumstances &ndash; in insurance costs in one year for hotels and so on is a crippling expense. Electricity costs have gone up by 14%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a final point which applies more to local authorities than to tourist boards. Local authorities in most counties seem to have no interest in road signage which is shoddy because of age and is not maintained. If signage is broken or falls, it is not replaced. That is something which should be brought to the attention of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their comments on the Bill and I appreciate the general support it has received in the House. This Bill provides the legislative framework for the proposed national tourism development authority. It is imperative that the authority is up and running by March. We must maintain the momentum we have established. The longer it takes to get the authority up and running, the greater the chance for organisational drift, and that is something I do not want. In addition, staff of the existing agencies and the industry will be faced with growing uncertainty unless the authority is up and running. In these times, such a situation would be particularly unhelpful for the industry.</P>
      <P>It was said by many Members that tourism is a very broad field. The activities and influence of the authority will be wide-ranging. Members referred to several of the activities, strategies and orientations with which the authority will be concerned. While I agree with a lot of them, I do not believe it is appropriate to make detailed provision for all these in the legislation, especially in a tightly focused Bill such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" />The authority will, as one of its first tasks, draft a mission and corporate plan. These will be informed by national tourism policy. The review of that policy is under way and Members will have the chance to have their say in that process. That mission and plan will no doubt address many issues which have been raised in both Houses. Some issues will be addressed by detailed regulations made by the authority and some may, if necessary and appropriate, be addressed by ministerial direction.</P>
    <P>Members raised a number of points and I wish to respond to some of them. Before I do so, I associate myself with those Members who mentioned the great contribution made by Bord Fáilte and CERT over the years. It is right that we should place on the record our appreciation of the great work and achievements of these two organisations over the decades.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate about competitiveness. There is a perception that something is wrong. In the tourism field, incidentally, perceptions are sometimes far more important than the reality, and I suppose the same is true of politics. It is word of mouth, as Members said, which gets much of the business and which loses the business as well. The message is clear. This issue is not about prices, it is about value for money. A visitor can pay &euro;100 for a meal and be well satisfied. The same visitor can pay &euro;20 for a meal and be less than satisfied. We need to deliver value for money and we need to be perceived as delivering value for money. That is the issue and, if I may say so, the challenge.</P>
    <P>Government may have a role in dealing with this but it is primarily a matter for the industry. To be fair to the industry, there is good value for money. I recently launched the Discover Ireland brochure which contains good deals and I urge people to avail of them.</P>
    <P>The industry would argue that it is under increasing pressure in the area of costs and this must be borne in mind during our debate. Many Members have mentioned this and I would be foolish to deny there are significant cost issues for the sector. Nevertheless, any operator in any sector who is under cost pressure must see if he or she can manage the cost base better.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say this but for the operators in the field who are under increasing stress and pressure, it is not always easy to see these things or even to know how to go about some of them. That is where the new authority could have a role to play. As some Deputies argued, the authority should consider working more closely with tourism operators, particularly the SMEs, to help them achieve efficiencies and to organise themselves to best exploit the opportunities available to them. That is the way to go.</P>
    <P>I share many of the concerns expressed by Deputies in regard to insurance. Deputy Wall was particularly eloquent on the topic. My colleague, the Tánaiste, recently announced a package of proposals to tackle the issue. These include the establishment of a ministerial committee to <Col N="754" /> oversee implementation of the reform programme, including publication of an action plan to implement the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report within a target timeframe and the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board on an interim basis. If we are honest, we will recognise that there has been concern about insurance over the lifetime of several administrations. We know it will not be resolved overnight, but at least we now have a clear programme of action which has been set in train. I hope the authority will be able to make an input into the reform process from a tourism angle.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by many Deputies that we should attempt to spread the benefits of tourism growth beyond the honey pot areas and to build up areas with clear potential, or areas which may not be likely to emerge as major tourism centres, to assist niche tourism operators within these areas. That is the thrust of the Government's tourist product development policy. We have sought to give priority to the needs of some of the less developed areas and we have provided these areas with the opportunity to access funds. We have organised matters so that they receive favourable weighting. We have set up an independent decision-making mechanism and laid down clear transparent criteria. After that it is up to private operators, local authorities and communities to come up with quality proposals.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that the scheme operates effectively and efficiently. Once we have gone through the first tranche, we may need to look at its promotion and administration. It will be a priority task for the new authority to look at the whole product development function which, given Bord Fáilte's focus on marketing, has been somewhat less than optimally resourced. On a general point, we must continuously up-date the nature and quality of our product to meet evolving consumer demands. These are issues the new authority can consider.</P>
    <P>For an island, access, particularly air access, is of crucial importance. Many Deputies raised this issue. There is no doubt we need to have the optimal supply of routes and capacity at reasonable cost. That is important nationally and also for the regions. We had significant losses of capacity last year, particularly on the north Atlantic. Capacity was down approximately 20% at the peak season, which meant less seats and higher prices. While this may have been good for carriers, it put a break on visitor numbers in the peak season. I am pleased to report that we are beginning to recover some of that capacity.</P>
    <P>Everyone will welcome the return of the Baltimore-Washington route and there will also be a general welcome for the decision of US Airways to travel to Shannon and Dublin from Philadelphia. This will increase to eight the number of gateway cities in the United States from which people can access Ireland. This can only result in increased business, all else being equal. Given the vital importance of access issues, I have been <Col N="755" /> working very closely with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to support him in his efforts to develop our air transport sector in a way that will facilitate rapid growth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan and others referred to interdepartmental co-ordination, given that the responsibility for many matters which impact on tourism is spread across a variety of Departments and agencies. He mentioned the possibility of an interdepartmental agency tourism committee. I understand his argument and appreciate the suggestion is put forward in a constructive spirit. On one level I do not have a problem with the theory of the proposal. However, we have had such committees and councils in the past and they were not particularly effective.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the strategy within the tourism Department has switched to a direct bilateral engagement with individual Departments on specific issues of policy which may have a major impact on tourism. This approach has worked well and has had a good influence on access policy. Once the institutional reform package is completed, we will focus on engaging more closely with one or two other Departments on issues crucial to tourism. It will also be part of the authority's remit to make authoritative input to policy-making in areas of crucial importance to tourism.</P>
    <P>Issues were raised in relation to the environment. This is an area to which I would like the authority to devote more resources. Bord Fáilte Éireann has a long record of concern in the environmental area. It was probably well ahead of other State development agencies in this regard. The twin pillars of Irish tourism have always been people and places. The physical environment is one of our fundamental tourism assets. Bord Fáilte Éireann's Tourism Development Plan 2000-2006 and its current product development scheme are infused with a clear environmental orientation. Nevertheless, it is true that staff resources devoted to the environmental area in Bord Fáilte Éireann declined in recent years because of the priority given to international marketing. That process simply needs to be reversed.</P>
    <P>The joint Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT group, which laid the groundwork for the merger earlier last year, recommended that the authority should have a strong environmental focus which is well integrated with its product development function. I fully support that recommendation. I intend to ensure the authority has a strong environmental focus and I expect to see that focus reflected in the authority's mission and corporate plan. There is a need for balance, common sense and mutuality of interests to be established in debates on tourism and the environment, particularly on sensitive issues. I hope the authority will be a force to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan and others stressed the importance of taking the interests of staff into account in this merger. I assure him and others this will be done. There has been an intensive consul<Col N="756" /> tation and preparation process for more than a year to prepare the way for the merger. Staff have been continuously up-dated on developments and this process will continue. I met the unions. The interim board and chief executive officer designate, in particular, are in the process of addressing various industrial relations issues and I am confident a satisfactory outcome will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputies were concerned that the human resource function now held by CERT should not be lost in the new organisation. I assure them there is no fear of that happening. Many Deputies raised issues about tourism that are in reality human resource issues, issues about quality of service and so on. The logic of this merger is that we must have a much greater integration of the physical product and services sides. The authority must also continue to encourage the industry to develop its image as a good employer.</P>
    <P>Many, if not most, Deputies raised the issue of signposting. There is no argument about this. It has been a source of major concern to my Department and the tourism agencies over the years. It is an issue that has been around for many years and many Administrations. It has been one of the major visitor complaints and something must be done about it. The Government made a commitment to put in place a five year rolling programme to ensure non-national roads are signposted properly. I am pleased we have commenced the process and that a ring-fenced provision has been made for signposting in an initial tranche of five counties, including Kerry, where &euro;750,000 will be provided this year. I hope this extends throughout the country so that we will have adequate signposting because it is of immense importance. I extend my congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for taking on board our concerns in this regard.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the &euro;65 million limit. This is a limit in respect of cumulative capital expenditure by the authority over and above voting on the annual Estimates. The current limit for Bord Fáilte Éireann is £50 million. Under the national development plan, &euro;130 million has been allocated for the tourism product development scheme. Less than half of that money will come from the EU and the remainder will have to be found in the budget of my Department and possibly other Departments. In such circumstances, the suggested limit of &euro;65 million, which has been agreed with the Department of Finance, is deemed prudent.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies, particularly Opposition spokespersons, for the strong support they have expressed for this Bill and the proposed new authority. My Department is engaged in a radical overhaul of the national tourism agencies and a corresponding overhaul of national tourism policy. The Bill before us is a vital part of that package and I commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2002, which was amended and passed by the Seanad, is designed to extend and strengthen sea fisheries legislation in a number of important respects. The fishing industry has welcomed it. Members of this House will note that, in order to maintain the momentum of reform and as a consequence of a Seanad amendment to section 1 of the Bill, the Bill, if passed, will be operative immediately on its signature by the President and will not require a ministerial commencement order or orders.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of an independent statutory appeals process for the licensing of sea fishing boats, to give effect to a commitment in the programme for Government. Part 2 and Schedule 1 contain detailed provisions in this matter. For ease of reference, a consolidated text of the current sea fishing boat licensing legislation, section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, is attached as an appendix to the detailed explanatory and financial memorandum which was published with the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill also enables Ireland to give effect to the 1995 United Nations agreement concerning the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. Such stocks, which are generally in the high seas and are vulnerable to over-fishing, require concerted international efforts to protect them properly. Part 3 of the Bill contains the detailed implementation provisions required. Schedule 2 to the Bill sets out the text of the agreement and Schedule 3 lists the highly migratory fish species requiring protection. At the end of this Second Stage debate, I will seek formal Dáil approval, pursuant to Article 29.5.2 of Bunreacht na hÉireann, for the terms of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken to strengthen existing sea fisheries enforcement legislation, notably by including among sea fisheries protection officers additional Naval Service ranks, from <Col N="758" /> sergeant and petty officer down to and including corporal and leading rating, and Air Corps ranks down to and including the rank of corporal. This is being done in the interests of greater efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement effort &ndash; section 21(1) &ndash; and increasing out of date penalties for certain serious offences &ndash; sections 24 and 25. Other penalties will be comprehensively reviewed when consideration is given to updating and consolidating the sea fisheries legislation I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent appeals process for the licensing of sea fishing boats. An interim non-statutory appeals process was established with effect from 25 November 2002 by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. These arrangements will be superseded in due course by the comprehensive statutory appeals process provided for in this Bill. The non-statutory appeals arrangements allow appeals made by licence applicants against proposed licensing decisions notified on or after 25 November 2002 to be considered by an independent lawyer &ndash; Mr. Niall Beirne, BL, of the Law Library &ndash; nominated by the Attorney General. Details of how to make an appeal are notified to licence applicants with each proposed decision. If a licence applicant confirms in writing that he, she or it does not wish to appeal, or if no appeal is made within a month of notification, the proposed decision automatically becomes final. If an appeal is made within a month of notification, the licensing authority will have regard to the outcome of the appeals process when making a final decision on the application, in accordance with the law as it stands. No such appeals have been made to date.</P>
    <P>Under Part 2 of the Bill, applicants for sea fishing boat licences, licensees and third parties will be entitled to appeal licensing decisions. The final decision on such licensing will be made by the independent appeals officer, who will be a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer with a minimum of five years' practice. Determination of the appeal will be subject to the determination being in conformity with the law, including the legal obligations of the State arising under EU or other international instruments; such policy directives in relation to sea fishing boat licensing as the Minister may give in writing from time to time &ndash; section 3(4) specifically provides that the Minister cannot intervene in any particular appeals case; and judicial review by the High Court if an application is made thereto, in accordance with section 14 of Bill, within three months of the determination on the appeal in question by the appeals officer.</P>
    <P>The following matters relating to sea fishing boat licences will be available to the public electronically, via an appropriate website, as part of the transparent independent statutory appeals process provided for in Part 2 of the Bill: applications made to the licensing authority for sea <Col N="759" /> fishing boat licences &ndash; section 4 (6)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill; decisions on those applications by the licensing authority &ndash; section 4 (6)(<i>b</i>); appeals made against those decisions to the statutory appeals officer, when appointed &ndash; section 6(1); and decisions by the statutory appeals officer on the appeals and an explanation of the decisions &ndash; section 11(6). Details of all licence applications received on or after 1 January 2003 are published on my Department's website, www.dcmnr.ie, to give momentum to the licensing reform and to accord with section 4(6) of the Bill, which was added by the Seanad. I should add that the programme for Government promises a fundamental review of sea fishing boat licensing policy, as the last such review was undertaken more than ten years ago. The review has been under way for some months.</P>
    <P>The review group's necessarily wide-ranging remit includes a review of the current licensing law, as well as a variety of other issues of concern to the sea fishing industry. The review group, comprising experts from the Department, the Office of the Attorney General, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Marine Institute and the sea fishing industry, aims to report to the Minister by 30 June next. A key factor in the group's deliberations and the basis of its main report is the awaited clarification of last year's decisions on the Common Fisheries Policy, notably regarding the permitted overall size, composition and capacity of the Irish sea fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>The review group has made two interim conservation related recommendations to the Minister, who has accepted them. Polyvalent boats not precluded by their licences from fishing for herring and or mackerel, but which did not fish for the species in 2002 or 2003, will not break the active pelagic requirement of fishing for either of the species for 16 weeks in each of four successive years. Polyvalent boat owners will also have the option to have 2002 and 2003 included for the purposes of their active pelagic track records, subject to having fished for at least a minimum period of eight weeks in each of those years.</P>
    <P>The review group may decide to report early on issues which it may consider to require an urgent decision from the Minister. The group will consider outline proposals, recently published by the Minister and circulated to the fishing industry, for the regularisation of small unlicensed and unregistered inshore fishing boats. As the Minister advised the House on 5 February in answer to Parliamentary Question No. 226 of that date, the outcome of the consultative process will be carefully considered by the Minister, before he finalises the scheme for introduction as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the UN agreement set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill. The modalities for detailed implementation of the agreement are a matter for the party states and other parties to the agreement to decide from time to time, in light of conservation and management imperatives and the <Col N="760" /> best use of available surveillance and enforcement resources. Concerted international action in implementing the agreement should serve as a strong deterrent to over-fishing and so help minimise enforcement costs for Ireland. The EU is anxious to secure complete ratification of the agreement by the EU and all 15 member states <i>en bloc</i> as early as possible, so as to signal its commitment to sustainable fishing on the high seas and elsewhere, and has requested Ireland to make the necessary arrangements to progress the legislation and other measures required to enable it to ratify the agreement.</P>
    <P>Enactment of this Bill is a prerequisite to enabling Ireland to ratify the agreement and become a party state thereto. Ireland is now the only EU member state not yet ready to ratify the agreement and is under considerable pressure to do so. The assistance of this House in the matter is appreciated. Ireland's obligations under the agreement are already factored into the multi-agency enforcement programme planned for 2003, which, in any event, will involve increased activity by sea fisheries protection officers of all of the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>I will propose amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage so as to provide enabling power for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to prescribe by regulations fees for sea-fishing licence applications and licences. The types of sea-fishing licence applications and licences to be subjected to fees have yet to be decided, as have the level of fees to be charged.</P>
    <P>No fees are chargeable under the current legislation, namely, the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2001, in respect of any sea fishing licence application or licence. That somewhat unique position is not tenable in view of the fact that licensing costs are at least &euro;500,000 per annum and growing, and are met in full by the Exchequer. The main categories of such licences are those for sea fishing boats and for limited fishing for certain specially protected fish species. The required motion of instruction to the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the required financial resolution will be moved for Dáil approval before Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is intended to give statutory effect to the implementation of provisions on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to conservation and management matters. The fishing sector has been very important to the Irish economy and over many decades has been particularly important to our coastal communities and responsible for a large number of jobs from Dublin to Donegal and <Col N="761" /> around to Kerry. I am pleased with the rationale behind the Bill and believe the instruments in it will ensure a fairer and more equitable fishing environment and a more sustainable industry.</P>
      <P>This Bill has a number of functions and one of the most important is the establishment of an independent statutory appeals process for the licensing of fishing boats. Legislation in this area includes the Fisheries Act 1997 which provided comprehensive new licensing procedures for aquaculture activities and the Fisheries Act 1999 which brought significant change to the structure, management and organisation of the fishing industry. The provisions of the Bill are a welcome addition as they represent a streamlined and more accessible version of these Acts. The Minister has introduced genuine improvements in licensing procedures. Proper licensing is essential to any industry and this Bill ensures that the system remains fair to all. Those with genuine cases that might have been rejected up to now have an opportunity to appeal decisions. This is a welcome development and one consistent with the wishes of the industry.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry can learn a great deal from the way the appeals system is modelled. The Bill has set out the principles of making appeals, from the co-ordination of written submissions to oral appeals and an advanced system of public notification. Overall, I am certain that such a system will benefit all involved and ensure the efficient and cost-effective management of a fair appeals process.</P>
      <P>Sustainable fish stocks are essential if the fishing industry is to have a future. At a meeting of the Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources before Christmas, there was discussion of the high level of discards and juvenile fish being caught. This was a big problem years ago and it seems there has been no improvement when up to 70% of catches are still discards. It is worrying with regard to the decline in fish stocks and is something that this Bill will help to address. We must care for fish stocks to ensure a good future for the fishing community and industry. If the catching and destruction of discards continues, there will not be a secure future for the industry.</P>
      <P>The Bill aims to grant the relevant authorities the powers to board and search all fishing boats, Irish and international, which is important so that quotas can be enforced. Given the number of non-Irish boats in our fishing waters, it cannot be denied that such powers will be invaluable in ensuring catch levels do not exceed European quotas. It is important that the Bill allows for the search of any fishing boat and enables the authorities to investigate catches. The penalties proposed for breaches of the regulations are justified and fair. They are necessary to guarantee that such breaches will no longer occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major issue facing the fishing industry today is conservation and management of rapidly depleting marine resources. The combination of sea fishing boat licences, a fishing appeals process <Col N="762" /> and extra legislation for the protection of fish stocks makes for excellent legislation which will help to secure the sustainability of the industry.</P>
    <P>In recent negotiations, the Irish fishing industry got a harsh deal. While the Minister secured some concessions with regard to the level of quotas and reductions, there was failure on the bigger issues. With regard to the Irish Box, there has been a failure to secure continued restrictions on Spanish access. I am concerned that the policing of the Irish Box needs to be greatly improved; the Minister must ensure that Spanish boats do not enter the area and that the identities of boats and their crews are known. With fish stocks so low, it is terrible to see others take fish from us.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say that the Naval Service, Air Corps and fisheries protection officers are to be used with greater efficiency and effectiveness as part of the enforcement effort. They have among the hardest jobs going and are unsung heroes in their work of conservation and protection of the fishing industry. It is easy for politicians to criticise that work and to say that those services should be doing 101 different things. However, they have a hard job to do and I commend them for doing it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of harbours &ndash; I realise the Minister of State is familiar with Wexford and the south-east &ndash; there is a chance to ensure a strong fishing industry if all harbour developments are carried out to proper safety standards. We depend on our coastal areas and fishing will be an important industry for the country in the future. We must ensure that the right investments and improvements are undertaken.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I hope it will make the seas safer and improve fishing and boat licensing and the overall industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. One can have all the fishing boats in the world but problems will arise if there are not enough fish to catch to provide fishermen with a living. The policy of this country must continue to be focused on sustaining the quantity of fish in our waters and in ensuring that Irish fishermen have the opportunity to catch enough fish to provide them with a decent living. Anything else is unacceptable to the industry.</P>
      <P>Thousands of people are involved in the fishing industry. I am from County Louth, which is a fishing county. Many people are employed in the industry at Clogher Head, which is a big fishing village. Like all fishermen, they are very concerned about the future of the industry and they have expressed grave concern about the Minister's apparent deal on the Irish Box. There is no certainty about what happened, which means it will be for the Irish and Spanish Ministers to decide later how much extra Spain will get. Otherwise, the EU Commission would have ruled definitively on the margins to be allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishermen on the east coast are concerned that those who continue to fish in the Irish Box are moving north, while those in the North of Ireland <Col N="763" /> may also try to converge on the Irish Sea and in the process push out those who already fish there, especially those who fish off the coast of County Louth. That must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a much higher dependence on, and consumption of, fish in continental countries than in Ireland. In terms of volume, the Irish market is small. It appears that cod fish will become a rarity. A recent television programme showed how, when new cooked fish was introduced to fish and chip shops, customers reacted favourably until they were shown the fish they were eating at which point some expressed unhappiness with the appearance. It illustrates the need not only to conserve existing popular fish stocks, but to fish stock that is not currently in the food chain, some of which is caught and discarded. There is now an opportunity to allow fishermen to intensify their efforts to catch and market the many species of fish that would be new to consumers. Perhaps the Minister will address that aspect.</P>
    <P>Surprisingly, I have been informed by some fishermen that they do not have a problem with increasing the size of the mesh they use to catch certain species but they are not supported in this by the regulations. The use of smaller meshes means catching smaller fish that have not matured, which has a negative impact on the conservation of fish stock. The use of larger nets avoids this problem.</P>
    <P>From speaking to fishermen in County Kerry it is clear that many people make a living from inshore fishing, thousands of them part-time. While they welcome the impending regulation of their industry, they hope it will not prove expensive. It is a big business on the western seaboard, in counties like Donegal and Kerry, and it needs to be nurtured and supported in a way that will support the income of the small unlicensed and unregistered in-shore fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for outlining some of the key provisions of the Bill so cogently. A main purpose of the Bill is to establish an independent appeals system by putting the interim system on a statutory basis. The Bill also incorporates the 1982 convention on the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks which cross the boundaries of a number of countries. Ireland signed the convention in 1995, but has effectively blocked its implementation in the European Union regional area. I understand the Department of Foreign Affairs has long pressed for the enactment of this legislation to rectify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of an independent licensing appeals system is welcome. Section 3 provides that the appeals officer will be an experienced legal official. I understand that the following sections, down to sections 8, 9 and 10, follow the format for the establishment of a number of other appeal systems. Many Deputies are familiar with assisting constituents in making appeals and the <Col N="764" /> Bill clearly sets out the various stages involved, including oral hearings and submissions.</P>
    <P>I especially welcome the Minister's comments on the use of an appropriate website. Since I became my party's spokesperson on fisheries I have found the Department's website helpful. As of last night, four or five applications for licences were placed on the site. I welcome section 11, which provides that the appeals officer will have absolute discretion to make a final determination.</P>
    <P>The commencement provisions set out in the Bill were amended by the Seanad. Other amendments will be required and the Minister of State indicated he would introduce some on Committee Stage. I previously objected to provisions of the kind set out in paragraph 3(<i>c</i>) of the First Schedule, which defines people by age, which is, or should be, unconstitutional. In section 4(<i>a</i>), politicians seem to be barred from almost every major State activity or system. That seems to be standard in legislation at the moment and I have some queries about it.</P>
    <P>A fully independent appeals mechanism in the licensing system is long overdue. There have been allegations of favouritism towards districts around the coast, depending on who is the Minister or Taoiseach of the day. One of our colleagues in the Seanad mentioned that there were famous Dingle licences, possibly associated with the occasional presence in the locality of a very prominent Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Our current system is based on the policy document, Licensing of Sea Fishing Boats: Policy, Criteria and Administration. A key aspect of the document concerns the conservation and rational exploitation of available fish stocks. &ldquo;Sustainable fisheries&rdquo; and &ldquo;maximum employment&rdquo; should be the key phrases in the basic philosophy of the Irish fishing industry. The document sets out in great detail the problems with which we have had to deal in respect of the EU regime and equivalent capacity, as well as the issue of economic linkages.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on two occasions during Question Time when we will get the final report on the review of sea fishing licence policy. The Minister told us the group carrying out the review has made a number of recommendations, which he has implemented in respect of polyvalent boats, the most multi-functional boats, and the different options people have in relation to their track record in fishing. It is regrettable that six or seven months into the term of this Administration, we are still being promised this major report.</P>
    <P>I presume this Bill will have an impact on the likely outcome of the report and that we will have to legislate further for issues that may be raised by the review group concerning the policy when the Department produces the fisheries (consolidation) Bill. I would welcome an update. The Minister mentioned that we will possibly have the full report in June.</P>
    <P>Despite the developments that have taken place, concerns about licensing policy around the <Col N="765" /> coast are continually brought to my attention and that of other spokespersons. I have repeatedly asked the Minister, Deputy Ahern, about the amazing decision seemingly made by his predecessor Deputy Fahey regarding our largest freezer trawler, the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i>, owned by Mr. Kevin McHugh. It was apparent that Deputy Fahey had to engage in lengthy negotiations with Franz Fischler and the EU over two years to ensure that this huge 144 metre boat could be placed on the Irish register. Given that we were making our case in respect of this matter and that we had a fine committee led by Mr. Pádraig White, our distinguished former public servant, it was extraordinary that we were embarrassed that this major, single-owner ship was taking up so much tonnage on the Irish register. The decision was very strange and I have asked the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to look back over the era concerned to see what lessons can be learned.</P>
    <P>In recent days we have had reports from Lorna Siggins, the distinguished marine journalist, and others that there are allegations of offers of 5,000 tonnes from another vessel, the <i>Veronica</i>, which is also owned by Mr. McHugh, but which exceeds the Irish tonnage level. It seems that some very strange decisions are made on licensing policy.</P>
    <P>We have also had complaints about developments such as that in Lough Swilly in north-east Donegal. There are allegations that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has been encouraging the licensing of Dutch-controlled operators regarding a huge territory of the Lough Swilly seabed for bottom-cultivated mussels, while our indigenous fishermen with small whitefish boats and the men who traditionally manage the wild oyster fishery are being pushed aside. Section 8 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 states clearly that the awarding of any aquaculture licence over a wild oyster bed is illegal, yet they seem to have been awarded. We are hearing reports that massive vessels are sailing up and down the Swilly and operators in traditional fisheries are not being treated fairly. I want the Minister to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>During the term of the last Dáil, our Green Party colleagues asked repeatedly for the integrated coastal zone management plan and conclusive legislation. It is regrettable we have not addressed this. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, could have done better at the beginning of his term of office in addressing in a global way, with reference to the Pádraig White report, the overall future of our fisheries by way of a White Paper, rather than having adopted the <i>ad hoc</i> approach used to deal with the CFP negotiations and later other matters that arose. While many welcome the regulation concerning small, inshore vessels under 12 metres, other operators are concerned because their licences were very clear-cut in the past. These operators followed the conservation plans of the Department and now feel they could be penalised. I hope the legislation will improve and develop these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" />Most of the legislation relates to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. Schedule 3 of the Bill outlines the interesting species, mostly tuna, pomfret, marlin, swordfish etc. In particular, I welcome section 19 of the Bill, in which the Minister is giving authority to declare conservation areas, and section 21, which extends the powers of our Naval Service and Defence Forces at all levels to allow them to act as fishery control and protection officers.</P>
    <P>The 1982 convention is model legislation. It lays out criteria to which we can still aspire in many respects 20 years later. The key elements of it, such as long-term conservation and sustainable use of these migratory species, could be applied to any wild fish species. The precautionary approach as implemented by the Department's Marine Institute is also important. The recognition of the importance of biodiversity and human activity in the environment is welcome. Article 18 sets out the duties of flag states which we have discussed at length in committee. The abuse of flags and the use of flags of convenience flouts our determination to conserve many areas of our seas. It is generally Spanish boats that do this by flying British or French flags. We need to address the problem more comprehensively in our own legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the convention and our belated implementation and adherence to all that it entails. I hoped today to get the first opportunity to review more extensively than is possible with a short question the performance of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. It is the view of the Labour Party that his performance has been dismal. He has been engaged in a holding operation like the little boy with his finger in the dyke. He seems to have no plans for our industry. It has been striking to see the statements on everything from broadband, broadcasting and the semi-State sector to oil and gas which are posted hourly on the Department's website. Everything conceivable is mentioned except our fisheries, which are the basis for a key indigenous industry employing 25,000 workers and broadly involving perhaps 100,000 people. The constituencies of all Members present are likely to be inhabited by these people. In Howth town and peninsula, which is in my constituency, can be found a vital part of the economic infrastructure of north-east Dublin.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's brief has been difficult. I attended Franz Fischler's press conference and listened to the Commissioner speak at length about what he intends to do and how difficult it will be for Irish fishing communities. He used the words &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; and &ldquo;hard&rdquo; to describe everything and he described his aim of closing off huge areas of our seas. I told the Minister on the radio one Saturday before we departed for the negotiations that he faced what was probably the biggest test of his career. He has failed that test. <Col N="767" /> He said the Hague Preferences were retained and that he gained extra whitefish stocks while the moratoriums on fishing for cod in the Irish Sea and hake in the Celtic Sea had been lifted. He said our quotas had only gone down by 5%, but he was immediately contradicted in that by the fishermen's leaders. He declared that we had a key input into the new Common Fisheries Policy. Much of what he said was pie in the sky. He had not put the national review group's report at the heart of the Common Fisheries Policy as he said he had. The Minister also failed with regard to total allowable catches and quotas. While he said we faced huge fleet reductions, what he arrived back with was disastrous.</P>
    <P>That was the case with the Irish Box. The day he returned from Brussels he said he would appeal to his Spanish counterpart to act responsibly in this matter, but by then he had been metaphorically netted by the Spanish Fisheries Minister. The softly, softly approach to Viga and the other ports of northern Spain has resulted in a disaster for the Irish Box. It was a disaster because the Minister refused to address the relative stability of quotas in a sensible, coherent way before the negotiations. Our quotas are based on the historic quotas from 1973 to 1976. Since we entered Europe the majority of our Ministers in this portfolio have been Fianna Fáil Deputies. Throughout the 1970s and in 1986, when Spain and Portugal joined the Union, they failed to address the issue of the size of the quota. This nation has at least 11% of the seas of the EU, but is allowed a miserable 4% of the quotas based on the 1973 to 1976 figures. That is the fundamental problem and nobody has rectified it.</P>
    <P>I read the contribution of distinguished former Minister, Senator Daly, in the Upper House in which he stated that nothing could have been done for the fishing industry in 1973 because it was too small. On the contrary, the industry was a significant part of our economic infrastructure and had great potential. The industry's vulnerability was one of the reasons the Labour Party and one of our great local representatives, former Minister, Justin Keating, opposed entry into the European Community. We felt that our fisheries were being sold down the river. The issue of relative stability of quotas has never been addressed and Deputy Dermot Ahern did not go to Brussels to change that. The Pádraig White report makes it clear that the socio-economic aspects of the Common Fisheries Policy demand greater economic development for peripheral areas of the community than for centralised areas. Our continuous quota is at variance with the idea of developing coastal communities whose basic income comes from fishing.</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy and the socio-economic rationale behind regional policy have never been integrated and the Minister did not seek to have that happen. However, it is the failure in terms of the Irish Box which poses the most serious threat to the future of Irish fishing. <Col N="768" /> Although the issue has been a slow burner in 2002, we are still hearing reports of a Spanish armada off northern Spain and northern Morocco. Neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach has kept track of what passed between Spanish Prime Minister, José Maria Aznar, and Romano Prodi in the months leading to the review of the CFP. Spain's record should have caused us to fear the worst. Is it not striking that one of the Spanish boats arrested and towed to Galway for flying a British flag had 4,500 tonnes of illegal monkfish on board? The Spanish have never been interested in conservation. The idea that we allow huge numbers of extra boats into a part of our territory when conservation is a key word of our fishing policy is contradictory. There have been disturbing reports that the Minister has made an informal deal with the Spanish and that we are beginning to see the impact of what this will mean over time.</P>
    <P>While activity is still low in that area, the only recourse for the Minister will be to go to the European Court. As Mr. O'Donoghue of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation pointed out, we need concrete alternative proposals from the Minister. It is no wonder that Jason Hooley and the Irish South and West Fishermen's Organisation felt they had to take matters into their own hands with a blockade.</P>
    <P>An equally disastrous result of the Minister's achievement on the CFP is the appalling scenario which faces Donegal and fishermen in the north-west in regard to the nine days at sea rule. This has been overshadowed by the issue of the Irish Box, but it is as potentially catastrophic.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ahern allowed Irish interests to be caught up in the determination of Franz Fischler and the EU Commission to dramatically introduce new rules for the cod stocks in area six. The British Government, of course, for whatever reason &ndash; some say for political reasons &ndash; was not determined to defend its own fishermen. Our fishermen, however, were allowed to be caught in the net again. There have been reports in recent weeks that the Inishowen port of Greencastle risks being wiped out as a key landing port because of the operation of this new regime. Lorcán Ó Cinnéide, the chief executive of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, and others have raised concerns about safety issues and query why other conservation measures such as fish size and separators were not utilised in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to quotas and total allowable catches, it was very striking that immediately after the Brussels negotiation, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, was challenged by the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation and others who claimed that there was up to a 9% cut in our white fish quota and perhaps a 7% reduction in our pelagic quota.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problems remain. As my colleague on the Fine Gael benches said, we await the completion of the Brussels negotiations. I note that the Minister met the Greek Minister during the Greek Presidency and we have had <Col N="769" /> negotiations with Portugal. Spain and Ireland seem to have a &ldquo;softly softly&rdquo; approach. The European Commission seems to say that the box issue can only be resolved bilaterally. I accept that this legislation is a couple of steps forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise the huge socio-economic importance of fishing to many coastal areas. I mentioned Greencastle and Killybegs but there are also other great ports like Rossaveal, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, which I know very well, Howth which is in my constituency, Clogher Head and other smaller ports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I should not forget Kilmore Quay. The hinterlands of all those ports are greatly assisted by the fishing industry. The industry was valued last year at &euro;550 million with at least 25,000 directly or indirectly employed in the industry. The Howth peninsula which is in my constituency has a long tradition of sea-faring. Howth fishermen and other fishermen from the other ports were the ones, and not the Department, who approached Deputies like myself with conservation proposals such as the improvement of mesh size, the closure of spawning grounds, the reduction of fishing in sensitive areas and a change to fishing for other species. The Howth Fishermen's Association and others have borne very stoically the closure since 1999-2000 of the Irish Sea spawning grounds at this time of year. As their representative, I join them in their feelings of bitterness at the results of the negotiations held before Christmas. We believe there should have been more detailed preparation and a more serious effort to acknowledge the support of the fishing industry to our communities.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a small step and I may put forward some amendments on Committee Stage. This is the first time, other than Question Time, that I have been given an opportunity to discuss the fishing industry in the House. I ask the Minister to pay more attention to the industry and to adopt a more dynamic, proactive approach. In one sense, <i>per capita</i>, we are the great fishing nation in the European Union and the style of this Administration should reflect that. I commend the Bill.</P>

      <P>When I read this Bill the sentence that jumped out at me in the explanatory memorandum was that the EU is very keen that we ratify this as soon as possible so that we can &ldquo;signal our commitment to sustainable fishing on the high seas and elsewhere.&rdquo;  The European Union and most of the developed fishing industry desperately need to show some interest <Col N="770" /> in conservation and sustainability of fisheries because that is the last thing that has happened in the past 20 years since the original convention. It is shocking to think that it is 20 years since that very laudable document was introduced. We have utterly failed to live up to the precautionary principle, to the ideals of sustainability which were so cleverly and clearly outlined in that convention.</P>
      <P>It is now a time of crisis for fisheries because of over-exploitation. At the latest Johannesburg summit a date of 2015 was set to reduce the unsustainable behaviour of fisheries throughout the world. Many people in the environmental movement believe it was an incredible failure of the Johannesburg process to cut back the resolution of the problem yet again by another decade or so. It is about time we started acting and not just talking about sustainability. It is a shame on this country that environmentalists believe that the Irish Government is just as bad as the rest when it comes to talking about conservation but not living up to it. We will chase after our own quotas regardless of conservation consequences. We will try to protect our interests when what is needed throughout the developed world is a genuine commitment to conservation. I can only hope but I am very sceptical that the enactment of this Act will move in that direction.</P>
      <P>I refer to the United Nations convention on conservation. There is one area where I believe we are not carrying out our duties of conservation and that is regarding the protection of other species which are caught up in the fishing of migratory species such as tuna and marlin. I am speaking about the catching of common dolphin and harbour porpoises by Irish fishing vessels. The Minister will be aware that there has been much controversy about the application of twin trawling techniques in the Bay of Biscay by Irish boats where on certain occasions, it is reported, twin trawling boats have caught up to 30 dolphin in one trawl, causing the deaths of those dolphins.</P>
      <P>The Irish public buys its tin of tuna and feels that all is well with the world again because we have tackled the issue and we are now buying dolphin-friendly tuna, but that is not the case. When I contacted the Minister's Department on this issue, I was told that a small contingent from BIM was sent to test out a new sonar device which was designed to keep dolphins away from the nets. This is only a minuscule investment in terms of time and attention and it is not being taken seriously. When I asked about the commitment for the next season beginning in May that each boat would be required to carry out preventative measures, yet again there were no plans. On the issue which this Bill deals with, how to fish migratory fish such as tuna, it seems we are in disregard of the UN convention which we are trying to enact. We are talking the talk but not acting out the conservation measures that are proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Irish Sea and other closed-in waters we still see large depth dolphins caught in gill netting systems. The numbers may have gone down <Col N="771" /> slightly because our level of fishing has gone down but it is still going on at an unsustainable level and is diminishing those populations. The public would be up in arms if it was aware of the lack of Government activity in this area.</P>
    <P>A solution was mentioned in regard to tuna fishing. This Bill is primarily about those migratory species. It is worthwhile talking about the possible use of long lines with hooks on them but we must be careful. There has been talk, because of the lack of success for Irish fishermen in the twin trawling system, of moving towards a long line system. In the introduction of any such system the Minister would have to apply a technique where lines are laid beneath the water surface so that seabirds are not caught up in them. This has been a problem in similar systems around the world where fulmars or other birds going for the bait coming off the boats get caught and killed. If we are to develop the fishing of these migratory species we will have to be the leading country in terms of conservation measures, but I get no sense of that happening despite this Bill coming before the House today.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the issue of how this legislation could improve the lot of Irish fishermen. I used every opportunity I got in the debate with the Minister to raise the issues of the Irish Box and the difficulties faced by the Irish fishing industry. I have said that we should use conservation measures in a positive way in terms of restricting fishing activity and giving our local smaller boats a chance. For example, Irish fishermen fishing for hake in the south-west waters use a 120 mm mesh net by regulation whereas Spanish and French boats possibly use 100 mm filament net. However, if an Irish Naval Service boat tries to prosecute they have the excuse that they are allowed to carry that net because they could have been fishing in the Bay of Biscay or elsewhere, where such a mesh size is allowed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in this instance we could use this legislation to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and to insist that if they are in Irish waters they cannot carry that net. We could say the mesh size is against our conservation measures and is not allowed. That would be one way of restricting the invasion of foreign boats in Irish waters. When I put this possibility to the Minister the reply was that it would not be possible. The lack of effort in conservation is to be criticised. It is not sustainable in terms of fish stocks nor does it protect our jobs.</P>
    <P>A detail in the explanatory notes on the Bill which sets out some of the licensing agreement was interesting. To reiterate what Deputy Broughan said, when one reads the considerations that are taken into account in licensing a boat it is astonishing that conservation measures are just put in as a postscript at the end. The first four or five points that have to be taken into consideration are local economic interests. When we look at the section in regard to boat licensing we wonder what our Government was doing when it gave such a massive tonnage licence to boats like <Col N="772" /> the <i>Veronica </i>and the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i>. How can the Government possibly justify the tonnage given that it will bring less jobs than would have been the case with an allocation of the tonnage to a greater number of boats? It will bring less landings and less benefits to Irish ports. It is time the Government gave an explanation of its rationale in licensing those boats. Silence is not a sufficient answer if the Government is espousing conservation policies.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the appeal system is welcome. I welcome the general content of the Bill. However, it will be to no avail if the Government does not pursue the conservation agenda rigorously. Fish do not have votes and that is part of our problem. Ultimately, if we continue to ignore the need to maintain viable fish stocks the people whose livelihoods depend on those fish stocks will realise that our lack of implementation of conservation measures cost them their jobs in the long run. The State had better stop signing Acts and ratifying treaties unless it implements them. That is my criticism of the fishing policy pursued by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a step towards bringing the area of licensing into the public light. This issue has caused a good deal of difficulty in the past where certain large operators appear to have been treated by a different set of criteria from others. It has allowed them to establish a good deal of control over the fishing industry in parts of the country to the detriment of smaller individual operators and entire coastal fishing communities.</P>
      <P>The issue has brought a certain degree of mystery to many within the industry up to now. As the Minister is aware, I and other Deputies raised the question of the licensing of one particular large operator. While not casting aspersions on the Minister or his officials I have not received a satisfactory reply to that matter.</P>
      <P>I cannot explain to fishermen in the south and west how an enormous amount of tonnage was given free to one operator. It is an injustice that people who are trying to get licences and tonnage must pay &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per tonne when other people can get it for nothing. This can only serve to create an atmosphere of suspicion and bad will. Therefore to the extent that this Bill lifts the veil of secrecy on such matters it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of another case where I made a representation to the Department in regard to the refusal of a licence to a person in Donegal. He felt that he was given no adequate explanation as to why he was refused and why others were granted licences. It is these anomalies and inconsistencies that create bad will and difficulties. That individual appears to have run into a concrete wall in attempting to receive an explanation. It is to be hoped that such cases will no longer occur and that all decisions are potentially open to examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some fishing organisations made representation to the Minister and the <Col N="773" /> Department over certain provisions and they were able to suggest amendments and improvements in the legislation which have been incorporated. That is welcome. It is healthy that people actively engaged in the industry are allowed the opportunity to consult and make suggestions. I commend the Minister for that. One of the issues they were instrumental in getting implemented was the right of third parties to object to the granting of licences. This has been incorporated in Part 2, section 8. That provision will allow interested parties to scrutinise the process of the granting of licences and it is welcome.</P>
    <P>I hope this level of consultation with the representatives of fishermen will continue, particularly as we enter the critical period of review of the Common Fisheries Policy and try to resolve the ongoing difficulties regarding the Irish Box conservation area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the conservation aspects of the Bill which give effect to the UN agreement on the conservation of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. Everyone agrees on the need to protect the particular species involved and there would appear to be no controversy in that regard. I would, however, contrast the reasonable and rational basis of this measure with the current lunacy that appears to govern the EU's intervention in the conservation of commercial species within Irish waters.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the recent legal decision to open up the Irish Box and the grave implications which that has for the future of Irish fishing. Fishermen are likewise concerned &ndash; concern is the mildest expression &ndash; with the manner in which the directives on, for example, the conservation of certain whitefish stocks are being implemented. This has led to a number of arrests of Irish fishing vessels and an increase in the level of bad feeling in regard to the whole area. Last month the <i>Ardent</i> was arrested in Castletownbere after its third day fishing that month. Bad weather led to a number of boats being tied up in January, which meant there was effectively no income in the households of those concerned.</P>
    <P>I have fished for many years in Fenit. Last night I flew down to Kerry to go to the house of a great friend of mine from Fenit who was lost yesterday off Loop Head. He had 40 years experience in the fishing industry. I also went to the house of the two young fishermen on whose boat he was fishing. The grief of the families and the loss to the communities is indescribable. This small fishing village, which has suffered greatly in the past, has again been hit by a terrible tragedy.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are taking more and more chances in order to make a decent living. They are going further west off the coast than ever before. This presents greater difficulties for them to encounter, yet they are met with more and more regulations and rules, mostly emanating from Europe, which is detrimental to our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The best people to conserve the fishing industry are those who are involved in it, as they have a vested interest and make their livelihoods from <Col N="774" /> it. They know the extent of current fishing stocks. Involving them is the best way to proceed and ensure a successful outcome to conservation. The notching of lobsters in conjunction with the fishery boards has been successful in conserving stocks, which has shown signs of recovery. This is a good example of the type of measure which needs to be brought in. The fishermen themselves have spearheaded the conservation of the oyster industry in Fenit.</P>
    <P>As I remarked in the House last week in regard to farming, Irish coastal fishing communities are in crisis &ndash; and that is an understatement. The level of regulation and restrictions upon them has led to a steady decline in income. This is a disgrace when it is contrasted with the amount of fish that is taken out of Irish waters by EU vessels. It has been said that Ireland has been a net beneficiary of EU membership but when the issue of fishing rights is taken into account we become a net contributor.</P>
    <P>While I support what the Bill sets out to do in regard to licensing appeals and the conservation of species, a great deal more attention needs to be focused on the immediate problems facing the industry. I will continue to raise this point. The Government needs to consider the plight of the fishing industry. It needs to prioritise its efforts in addressing the needs and requirements of those engaged in it. I hope the Minister of State will take these points on board and give them the attention they urgently deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is important legislation but I am somewhat concerned about certain elements it does not contain. Anyone who lives beside the sea, particularly in the west of Ireland, as I do, realises the importance of our fishing industry.</P>
      <P>At school we learned about the value of our natural resources and what it meant to have such a rich resource off our coast. Before we joined the EU in 1973 we probably did not realise our potential in that regard. While EU membership allowed us to get money for development, we gave much away over the years. We had derogations but now the day of reckoning has come.</P>
      <P>While we all agree that over-fishing will spell the end of the industry and that conservation must be a feature of the industry, the EU often goes over the top in regard to regulations. I am particularly concerned by the impact of these regulations on the small boat fishermen and those who catch lobsters, those who go out in dangerous conditions to supplement their incomes from farming. As a result of EU regulation they no longer have any livelihood on the land and now they are being put under pressure at sea. I urge the Minister of State to look at their plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago legislation was introduced that effectively put sea angling clubs out of commission. I was involved in setting up the sea-angling club in Mulranny, which was an important part of the local community. Every member of the family was involved in it and had a great time. <Col N="775" /> As a result of over-regulation this vital lifeline to the community has gone in Belmullet where it had been a feature of local life for 35 years.</P>
    <P>I consider the legislation an over-reaction to safety. The boating tragedy in Wexford was due to people not wearing life jackets but those involved in sea-angling groups who are known to me do wear them and are aware of the safety aspects. They accept that it is necessary to have a responsible attitude. Insurance costs are high in this area and the onus is on everyone to have a safe system in place. However, what the law requires is above and beyond all of that. The sea-angling club in Belmullet is attempting to do something to address this matter, as will many other such clubs.</P>
    <P>While the legislation is aimed at strengthening our fishing industry, I am concerned that over-regulation may bring about its demise. This is similar to the nitrates and habitats directives. Much of County Mayo has been made almost redundant from a farming point of view. We do not yet have an official national park but there is one promised for Ballycroy. Such areas of land are diminishing in value because of the restrictions on their use due to conservation measures.</P>
    <P>If it was a question of the last salmon on the River Moy or the last grouse in the bogs of Erris, then there would be an outcry from An Taisce and such people, but nobody is shouting stop when it is a case of the last person in the west or north-west of Ireland. Professor Seamus Caulfield has predicted from the census figures that nobody will be left in Mayo by the end of the century. This is the area which I represent and it would be a terrible tragedy if this was to come about. We should be introducing legislation which will help to prevent that happening.</P>
    <P>I would like to see something in this Bill that would give me hope that there will be a future for this area. I fear that there is so much regulation that people are forgotten about. As someone once said, let us be treated as animals so that we might be treated better. We might be treated better if we were the last grouse or the last bat in the country.</P>
    <P>We are all in favour of safety at sea but it has been overdone and needs to be looked at again. Fishing is a proud tradition and people in areas such as Achill have been involved in sea-angling for generations. In the past, fishing was an important industry but the controls on driftnet fishermen have put people out of business. Such people may also have a farm but because of de-stocking they have been driven off the land. We were told that what is in mind in the Fischler proposals is to change.</P>
    <P>When we first joined the EU the Mansholt plan predicted that only large farms would be viable, and that is now the case. Many fishermen also depend on the land and we must consider these small people. We can overdo conservation. I agree with the need for conservation but the Minister must also take account of the small men. <Col N="776" /> The <i>Veronica </i>is a fine boat and is owned by an Achill man. The value of the quota of that boat is enormous but many small fishermen are trying to eke out a living on the sea. These small fishermen matter as well.</P>
    <P>When I was going to school we learned that we were not utilising the full value of our fishing industry. Since joining the EU the country has come on by leaps and bounds. Many economic activities have been deregulated and perhaps deregulation should have been applied to fish stocks also. However, we did not do that and now we must pay the price. The EU gave us large boats and improved piers but there is a price to pay for these developments.</P>
    <P>How far will regulation go? Is the schoolboy who catches one or two fish to be subject to regulation? We have not realised the potential of our fishing industry and it would be a shame if this potential, which was recognised for so long, was not developed. We have missed many opportunities over the years. Of all products, fish has the greatest potential for improving our health. All medical literature claims that omega-3 fatty acids help one to live longer and they are found in abundance in fish. The fish on the west coast have less chance of being radioactive than those on the east coast, but that is another matter.</P>
    <P>Licensing can be overdone. It must be fair and we must consider the small man. The <i>Atlantic Dawn </i>and the <i>Veronica </i>are massive ships but we must also consider the small fishermen and their communities, whether they are fishing for a few lobster or sea angling. I would like to have seen more emphasis in the Bill on conserving people rather than conserving fish. We are conserving fish, bats, salmon and many other creatures, but the people matter too. If there is no one to eat the fish what is the point of having a fishing industry? I say, as Shakespeare did, &ldquo;Pause there Morocco.&rdquo;  We should think about this. We are an island nation and our waters are an enormous resource. Our fish catch does not reflect the true value of this resource, and that is a pity.</P>
    <P>A licensing system is only as good as its enforcement. The Bill contains many references to enforcement. This has been our problem for many years. Fishermen have come from Spain and other countries and fished our waters with impunity. I hope this Bill will bring about an improvement in this situation. If we realised the value of our fishing industry and had a proper way of protecting our assets we would do much better.</P>
    <P>Fishing is big business but the small man matters and he should not be forgotten about. I am concerned about the over-regulation of small boats and I hope the Minister will consider this aspect of the matter. I urge him to meet the sea angling clubs and to try to find a way around this problem. If laws do not serve the people what is the point in having them? Conservation is important but people matter as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a general welcome for the Bill. The Minister of State has <Col N="777" /> said that even the fishing industry has welcomed it. I am sure not all the industry has welcomed it but there is, at least, a general welcome for the Bill within the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill will establish an independent statutory appeals process for sea fishing boat licences so as to give effect to the commitment in the current programme for Government. Under Part 2 of the Bill applicants for sea fishing boat licences and third parties will be able to appeal licence decisions and the final decision on such licences will be made by an independent appeals officer, who will be a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer and will determine the appeal. That may be a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Will the appeals system include securing tonnage for boats? Some small fishermen, particularly on the west coast, are penalised by having to acquire tonnage at considerable expense to themselves before they can even go out to sea. I ask the Minister of State to clarify this matter in his reply to this debate.</P>
      <P>Sustainable fish stocks are essential if the Irish fishing industry is to have a viable future. However, while ensuring conservation we must ensure that we have a fair enforcement system.</P>
      <P>Fishermen themselves are the most effective conservationists. The recent lobster stock conservation measures were implemented by fishermen and these measures have led to a recovery in lobster stocks.</P>
      <P>The benefit of the fishing industry to our economy has long been undervalued and underestimated. Fishermen go out in all kinds of weather and fishing is a hazardous employment. Deputy Ferris referred to a neighbour of his who was lost at sea. As some speakers have indicated, fishermen are now taking greater risks to ensure that they have a livelihood.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry should be an important part of our economy but this is not the case. We are tied by the Common Fisheries Policy into a false and inadequate quota system. We have 11% of the fishing waters but less than 4% of the fishing quotas. This is the crux of the difficulty in the fishing industry. Our fishing quota is insufficient and is disproportionate to our fishing waters.</P>
      <P>The last round of negotiations attended by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was disappointing. He secured some benefit in the white stock but he allowed us to be severely discriminated against. He had to appeal to the Spanish fleet to be responsible within the Irish Box. That was a weak position for the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The mechanics of putting in place a new social partnership agreement has been in progress for a number of months and the process is still not fully concluded. The farming pillar came to the negotiating table with a range of different requests, as did the other pillars. The sum of all the demands would have major cost implications for the Exchequer and would result in large-scale borrowings. I know that the farm organisations would agree, as would the rest of Irish society, that there should be no return to excessive borrowing and that a return to the borrowing levels of two decades ago would constrict economic growth and job creation and would lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates, which would not be in the best interests of the agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>Against this background the proposals made to the farming pillar on 31 January and again on 1 February are, within the context of the current partnership process, the overall resources available and the budgetary situation, significant. To indicate the comprehensive approach taken in relation to agriculture there are solid commitments on the CAP mid-term review, the WTO, the dairy sector, the beef sector and the food industry and improvements in the REPS, the farm waste management scheme, commonage framework plans, SACs, disadvantaged areas, stamp duty for young farmers, stock relief and land annuities.</P>
      <P>There have been suggestions that significant EU funding could be lost to this country in the area of Brussels-funded schemes. It is true that REPS expenditure is behind schedule but this reflects low demand &ndash; my Department has turned no one away. There is time to rectify this situation and I would point to this country's track record in drawing down such funding, which is the envy of many other member states. I am firmly of the view that all available EU funding can be drawn down to the overall benefit of the farming community.</P>
      <P>There have been suggestions from some quarters that we will leave some moneys &ldquo;on the table&rdquo; in Brussels due to lower than expected participation by farmers in REPS and the early retirement scheme. There is no truth whatever in that suggestion. We have to date fully drawn down our annual funding ceilings under the CAP rural development plan, which covers the REPS, early retirement, compensatory allowances and forestry. Furthermore, I am absolutely confident that we will continue to draw down our full allocation over the remaining years of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The total draw-down of EU funds for REPS, early retirement and compensatory allowances up to the end of January 2003 was just under &euro;900 <Col N="779" /> million. A further &euro;1.1 billion will be drawn down over the remaining years of the plan, which runs to the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I have instigated a major review of the REPS and this review, with the scheduled mid-term evaluation of the overall rural development plan, will further facilitate the effective implementation of the measures in the plan and the draw-down of EU funds.</P>
    <P>I would also point to the concessions in the budget and Finance Bill with regard to stamp duty and stock relief for farmers. Not only will young trained farmers benefit from this concession &ndash; these two measures alone will benefit farming to the tune of &euro;16 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Regarding disease levies, no consumer of services likes to have to pay more. However, this increase in levies must be placed in the context of a steep rise in the cost of disease eradication measures in recent years. For 2003 the Estimates for my Department include provision of &euro;216 million for measures relating to TB, brucellosis, BSE, fallen animals, rendering, scrapie and other diseases. A significant element of these costs relates to compensation payments to farmers which in 2002 totalled &euro;90 million. To alleviate the problem an offer has been made, within the partnership process, to the farm organisations to partake in a series of value for money reviews of expenditure. These reviews would take place this year to identify savings for the Exchequer and farmers, while protecting consumer health, animal health and animal welfare and complying with statutory requirements. Much progress can be made using this approach.</P>
    <P>As regards levies, under the 1996 agreement with farm bodies, it was agreed that these would be fixed at levels which would yield £10 million a year or 50% of compensation costs, whichever was the higher for the following three years. For the period 1996 to 2002, levy contributions accounted for 25% of compensation paid.</P>
    <P>I know that there are difficult choices for farming organisations and there are some aspects of the agreement that may not suit them. Similar choices are faced by all the pillars, who in a difficult budgetary climate may have to accept that the resources that were previously available to them will have to be restricted. However, the partnership process, which has served the economy so well in recent years, provides us with the best mechanism to ride out the present externally unfavourable economic circumstances and restore Irish economic growth to its previously high levels.</P>
    <P>The achievement of the general overall measures within the new programme and within current resources is just as important as any sectoral measures. Of equal significance is that measures that have been taken in this programme will, among other things, protect the general well-being of the economy which is, of course, of primary importance to farmers as it is to other sectors and will result in higher economic growth, <Col N="780" /> lower interest rates and lower inflation at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In addition, the farming community has a special interest in many if not all of the ten special initiatives being undertaken during the period of the programme. These include the cost and availability of insurance, tackling educational disadvantage, ending child poverty, care for people with disabilities and older people, and waste management among other things. The successful implementation of these initiatives will make a major contribution to our quality of life. All major stakeholders in society must contribute to this process and it is for this reason that partnership involving all four pillars is so vitally important.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the current round of partnership talks have been difficult but we have had many difficulties since the instigation of the whole partnership process in 1987. However, it should be remembered that partnership has served farmers well. I applaud their contribution to the partnership process over the years and their input into the series of previous agreements. I, like all my other colleagues in the Government, would like that input to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that following the budget announcement and the passing of the Estimates the forecasts for the Exchequer outturn appear to have been much gloomier than they turned out to be and that his Department adhered strictly to the recommendations in the report of the special review on Estimates and brought forward the doubling of disease levies? There are now additional costs for testing for BSE as well as the Government withdrawal from subsidising the rendering of meat and bonemeal. The farming community, rightly, is outraged at this complete desertion by the Government of a community that has suffered an income loss of 8.5% in the past year, probably the only section in society that has suffered as much. On top of that difficulty the Department imposed draconian measures on the farming community.</P>
      <P>In all honesty, did the Minister expect the farming community to enter the partnership and what did he offer the farming community, aside from aspirational commitments to negotiate on its behalf with respect to the mid-term review? Will he agree that some small tangible measure could have been brought forward, such as the reversal of the resolution on disease levies? Obviously flexibility is a great leadership quality. What some view as a U-turn can be viewed by others as innovative, and decisions can be made in the climate of the time. Will he agree, even at this late stage, to look at the reversal of the resolution on disease levies and re-examine the Government decision to abolish roll-over relief?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Timmins said some small gesture should be made to the farming pillar in the partnership talks. I reiterate that tangible and solid commitments were made. The proposal in <Col N="781" /> relation to the farm pillar extends to approximately 16 or 17 pages. I estimate that the cost of those proposals over the lifetime of the partnership would be up to &euro;300 million. The difficulty is that the farming interests had a set of requests which would cost in excess of &euro;1 billion. Like all other participants in the partnership talks they were not able to get as much as they sought. Having regard to everything concerned, a set of proposals costing an estimated &euro;300 million was reasonable taking the budgetary consideration into account.</P>
      <P>In regard to disease levies, for 2003 the Estimates include a provision of &euro;216 million for measures relating to disease. In the context of increasing from &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million within an overall cost of &euro;216 million the commitment in the partnership talks to review this whole matter this year is a reasonable one. Some people referred to the 1996 agreement. The 1996 agreement, in relation to disease levies, stated specifically that they would be fixed at £10 million per year or 50% of the compensation costs, whichever was the higher. Compensation costs last year amounted to &euro;90 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2002 public expenditure by the Department of Agriculture and Food amounted to &euro;2.8 billion. A record &euro;1.6 billion of this was spent on direct payments to farmers which accounted for nearly 69% of aggregate farm income and an average payment of &euro;13,000 per farmer. This very high level of public expenditure underlines the commitment of the Government to the Irish agri-food sector. At the same time, it should be remembered that farming is a cyclical business and is dependent on a number of factors, including the weather and returns from the market, both of which contributed to the overall income decline in 2002.</P>
      <P>With regard to those areas within my responsibility, I will continue to support farm incomes by maximising the level of direct payments to farmers, ensuring that the EU Commission utilises all available market management tools to support the markets and providing the best possible development framework for the sector.</P>
      <P>While bearing in mind that farming and farm incomes are market related and that farmers are not wage earners in the traditional sense, there is always scope for the farm organisations to contribute to the development and improvement of policies that have an impact on farm incomes. While emphasis may be placed at times on social partnership talks and the role of the farming pillar &ndash; I acknowledge this is important &ndash; it is often forgotten that my Department and its officials have always welcomed the input of farmers, farm organisations, the agri-food industry, consumers and the public into the departmental policy-making process on an ongoing basis. The policies adopted and market environment can assist farming significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree there was a significant drop in farm incomes last year. We have the figure of 8.5% but we also have the EUROSTAT figure showing that Ireland came in third worst of EU countries. That figure in itself is highly significant and it has not really been addressed in terms of the European situation. There is also a figure from Teagasc which shows that farm incomes were 15% to 25% less than the <Col N="783" /> average wage. That figure was reported recently. Is there any methodology or precise mechanism by which we can interpret farm incomes? There is considerable confusion among the public as to what farm incomes are in real terms. Most people are of the view that farm incomes are significantly less than the average income &ndash; 15% to 25% according to the Teagasc figure. Will the Minister outline how we might interpret, or get a fix on, farm incomes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Farm incomes and their determination are extremely complex. The bare statistics conceal the complexity of incomes because, as I said, they are not, in the traditional sense, wages or salaries since farmers are self-employed. A number of bodies compile statistics on farm incomes, including the CSO, EUROSTAT, Teagasc and the national anti-poverty strategy. I would welcome agreement by an objective independent body on what might be a reasonable interpretation of the figures because with statistics a variety of interpretations may be reached. The point I continue to make is that if people wish to compare figures and statistics in relation to incomes, they should compare like with like.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for appealing the destocking recommendations under the commonage framework plans will be operated jointly by my Department and Dúchas, the heritage service of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The basis of the appeals process will be a scientific reassessment of the original framework plans by other planning teams to be chosen by the farmers making the appeal. A contribution of up to &euro;1,300 will be available towards the cost of each reassessment.</P>
      <P>An appeal must have the support of at least 20% of the commonage shareholders covered by the plan in question who claimed area aid in 2002, although a simple majority of shareholders may overrule a request for an appeal. Each reassessment will be considered by the two Departments and, if it is not acceptable to them, it will be referred to an appeals board chaired by Mr. Gerry Scully, chief sheep adviser with Teagasc. Farming organisations and environmental groups are being invited to nominate representatives to the appeals board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer. I am sure he is aware that a large number of sheep farmers are concerned about this. I appreciate the Minister has given me some information but what about all the farmers who still <Col N="784" /> do not know what information is required? For example, do they need to specify the number of shares on the commonage? Do they need to send their herd numbers? Some farmers do not even know to where to send their applications. I know this because they have contacted me.</P>
      <P>This is a complicated issue. I can think of one case in the Ox Mountains involving four townlands, 1,500 acres, 35 shareholders and a destocking rate of 74%. In some cases, as the Minister is aware, farmers are being penalised for damage which they did not cause but which was caused by their neighbours etc. As the Minister said, to lodge an appeal, 20% of the shareholders must agree. In the case of 35 shareholders&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will do that. I refer to the difficulties for farmers. There are no guidelines or application forms. In the two weeks remaining, what proposals has the Department to let farmers know how to go about this rather than just telling them where to send their applications? </P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that as a result of destocking, many farmers will, effectively, no longer have a future in sheep farming. What proposals has he, particularly in the area of rural development, to allow those who will soon be former sheep farmers to remain living in rural areas and to earn a living there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have extended by two weeks the deadline by which farmers can appeal against plans that are already published. Notice of appeal against these plans should be sent to the Department of Agriculture and Food by Friday, 14 March. For plans that have not yet been published, the deadline for appeals will be three months from the date of publication. My Department has arranged to publish full details of the appeals process next week and will provide farmers with the necessary application forms.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, arrangements and compensatory payments in relation to overgrazing of western hillsides, in particular, were agreed by the Department, Dúchas and the farming organisations in 1998. That deal secured a generous REPS payment of up to &euro;242 per hectare to farmers with commonage. Everything possible is being done to help farmers in those areas. We want to reduce the amount of overgrazing and damage being done to the hillsides while at the same time have a reasonable return for farmers in those areas. That is why increased REPS payments were put in place. I hope that with the mechanism in place and the ultimate appeal to Mr. Gerry Scully's appeals group, there will be an amicable and reasonable outcome to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department provides attractive financial supports to help farmers to convert from conventional to organic methods. Under the rural environmental protection scheme, farmers in conversion can draw payments of up to &euro;13,280 a year. Once they have reached full organic status and can take advantage of the higher prices commanded by organic produce, they can draw REPS payments of up to &euro;9,680 a year.</P>
      <P>Organic farmers and farmers in conversion to organic status can also apply for a grant towards the cost of capital investment. These grants are given for purposes like the modification of animal housing or the purchase of new equipment. The scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector offers 40% grant assistance up to a maximum of &euro;50,790 for on-farm projects. Off-farm investment projects are also eligible and grant aid is available up to a maximum of &euro;253,948. The scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector offers 40% grant assistance up to a maximum of &euro;50,790 for on-farm projects. Off-farm investment projects are also eligible and grant aid is available up to a maximum of &euro;253,948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Organic Development Committee, which was published in April 2002, contained a number of recommendations to develop the organic sector in Ireland. It recommended a number of amendments to the rural environment protection scheme, and these will be considered in the context of the general consultative review of REPS which we initiated before Christmas. The Organic Development Committee also recommended the establishment of a national organic steering group to act as a driving force for the development of the organic sector and a basis for advancing partnership between the organic sector and the other principal essential interests. This group has already met twice and is monitoring the implementation of the other <Col N="786" /> recommendations of the Organic Development Committee.</P>
    <P>I believe the implementation of the recommendations of the Organic Development Committee will be of great benefit to existing organic producers, and it will create a stable environment that will encourage conventional farmers to consider the organic option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Organic Development Committee, the Minister signed off on this in 2000, as did Teagasc and the farm organisations. Will the Minister of State agree that one modest expectation of farmers was that training would be provided for those interested in the conversion to organic methods? How can he, therefore, square that expectation with the current scenario where Mellows College, which is the only training facility for farmers currently in conversion, is threatened with closure? I appreciate the existence of Johnstown Castle, but does he recognise it can only provide research and development, and the absence of Mellows College would make a nonsense of the recommendations of the Organic Development Committee? Is he meeting with Teagasc? Is he mindful of the importance of the threat which hangs over Mellows College and will he reverse that threat?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues and I meet with Teagasc on a regular basis at different levels. I do not know where Deputy Sargent gets his information. I assure him that no decision has been taken by Teagasc on the future of Mellows Agricultural College, Athenry. Obviously they have serious legal and financial responsibilities. They must live within the budget allocated to them, look at their assets and human resource base, the capital they deploy and the different sectors they service within agriculture. This is currently taking place in the organisation, and no decision on either a general basis or individual basis has even been considered by Teagasc <i>vis-à-vis</i> Mellows College, Athenry.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that we have rapidly pushed forward support for the organic industry. In recent years, farmers have drawn down &euro;30 million in grants for organic development. A national report was published last April and we set up the National Organic Development Committee last December. It has met on two occasions since. It has adhered to the recommendations in the national report and set up the different subordinate bodies to report to it on the development of the sector. I am optimistic about its future.</P>

      <P>The partnership talks involve a series of complex discussions between the Government and four pillars comprising the voluntary and community pillar, the farming pillar, the employers pillar and the trade union pillar. The agreement reached is not simply on the basis of what each pillar has received but also encompasses a series of shared societal goals that often involves an interlinking of areas of economic, pay, taxation and social policy. The final result is an agreement which covers a number of areas, some of which impact on each pillar directly and others such as macro-economic goals which benefit all through improving the economic climate in areas such as reduced inflation, reduced interest rates, higher economic growth, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" />There are difficult choices for the farming organisations, that some aspects of the proposed agreement may not suit them and that severe challenges confront the sector such as the mid-term review and the World Trade Organisation discussions. Similar choices are faced by all the pillars who, in a difficult budgetary climate, may have to accept that the resources that were previously available to them will have to be restricted. However, the partnership process, which has served us so well since 1987, provides us with the best mechanism to overcome the present externally unfavourable economic difficulties and restore Irish growth to its previously high levels.</P>
    <P>To indicate the comprehensive approach taken in the discussions on agriculture, there are clear and solid commitments available to the farming pillar, which have been incorporated in a policy proposal comprising 16 pages.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that is currently being overlooked. This is an overall objective for society, which is more important than what is available for a particular industry, sector or group. The overriding goal of the process is to continue the sustainable progress of Irish society as outlined in the NESC vision.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>This outlined a view of the continuation of Ireland's economic success and a nation that will be economically inclusive based on full employment, continue a trend of consistent economic development, be socially inclusive and continue to adapt the country to change. It would be well to quote from the overall approach adopted in the proposed agreement to underpin national development. It states:</P>
    <P>The degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook, both domestically and internationally, and the reality of a fiscal environment in which current constraints have implications for prioritisation and timeframes for delivery across policy areas and programmes, have resulted in a different approach being taken in the development of this Agreement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the achievement of the general overall measures within the new programme and within current resources is just as important as any sectoral measures.</P>
    <P>Of equal significance is the fact that measures that have been taken in this programme will, among other things, protect the general wellbeing of the economy which is, of course, of primary importance to farmers as least as much as it is to other sectors and will result in higher economic growth, lower interest rates and lower inflation at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In addition, the farming community has a special interest in many if not all of the ten special initiatives being undertaken during the period of the programme. These include the cost and availability of insurance, tackling educational disadvantage, ending child poverty, care for people <Col N="789" /> with disabilities and older people, and waste management, among other things. In the case of each initiative there is the need to put in place appropriate arrangements involving all the pillars to develop these initiatives further.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of these initiatives will make a major contribution to our quality of life. All major stakeholders in society must contribute to this process and it is for this reason that partnership involving all four pillars is so important. Therefore, I would hope that the farming organisations would look at the overall benefits of the partnership arrangements and the measures that are to be put in place that will benefit the Irish economy and obviously the farming community. The farming organisations are able negotiators and have participated effectively in the partnership process.</P>

      <P>While I hear what the Minister said about choices, will he appreciate that the choice for farmers seems to be to like it or lump it? Some kind of olive branch should be offered in what seems to be a dangerous stand-off. Will the Minister agree, notwithstanding the 8% reduction in income in the last year, the number of farmers who are not able to continue in farming and the loss of farms year by year, that there is a need to recognise the low morale in farming? For example, the animal disease levy seems to be taking in approximately &euro;10.</P>

Perhaps we might consider trading in land portions rather than money. There are many options the Minister should consider before closing the door.</P>

      <P>Partnership, and the whole process of partnership, has been the single greatest engine for driving the Irish economy. The results show that it has been a useful instrument in the economic progress that has been made since 1987. The farming pillar has been a valued member of the partnership process. The Government is most anxious that agriculture is accommodated within the restricted budgetary framework in which it operates. There is a proposal on the table for the farming pillar that takes account of the loss of revenue and the constraints on public finances. I estimate the value of the proposal to farmers to be up to &euro;300 million over the relatively short lifetime of this partnership programme.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office calculates aggregate farm income &ndash; operating surplus &ndash; based on the economic accounts for agriculture. It calculates output, input and income in agriculture at national level and measures aggregate income on all farms.</P>
      <P>My Department estimates average farm income, using statistics published by the CSO, in a number of ways. Average income per farm is determined by dividing operating surplus by the number of farm holdings. The average income per farm is not available for 2001 and 2002 as the CSO has not published data on the number of farms for these years. Average income per full-time job equivalent of family labour is calculated by dividing operating surplus by the number of family work units. The average family work unit is not available for 2001 and 2002 as the CSO has not published data on the agricultural labour input for these years. Average income per person employed is calculated by dividing operating surplus plus wages by the number of persons employed in agriculture, as estimated by the International Labour Office. Average income per person employed fell by 8% in 2002 following an increase of 14.5% in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national farm survey produced by Teagasc uses a different definition of income to that used by the CSO. Average family farm income as calculated by the national farm survey is the difference between gross output &ndash; sales plus direct payments &ndash; and total costs, including direct costs such as feedstuffs and overhead costs, including allowance for depreciation, interest charges etc. <Col N="792" /> It represents the total return to the family labour, management and capital investment in the farm business. The latest available figures for 2001 show that average farm family income, excluding off-farm income, increased by 17.3% to &euro;15,840.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>This shows a cumulative increase of 43% between 1999 and 2001. This figure is based on a mixture of data from full-time and part-time farms. The average family farm income on the farms classified as full-time was &euro;30,959. The average industrial wage, although not directly comparable, was &euro;24,600. EUROSTAT calculates the change in farm income per full-time worker equivalent, adjusted for inflation, in each member state and in the EU as a whole. This indictor measures the change in real &ndash; adjusted for inflation &ndash; agricultural factor income, operating surplus plus wages, related to the change in total agricultural labour input in annual work units. The EUROSTAT figures show that average income per full-time job equivalent, adjusted for inflation, declined by 11.4% in Ireland in 2002.</P>
    <P>The household budget survey is carried out by the CSO every five years and measures total household income. The latest survey was carried out in 1999-2000. It uses a narrow definition of a farm household. Rural farm households are defined as households where the principal occupation of the reference person of the household is farming or where the reference person is a retired farmer and there is at least one other household member whose main occupation is farming. As a result, farm households as published in the household budget survey represent around 88,000 households. The latest survey estimates that almost 60% of farm household income comes from off-farm sources, including off-farm employment, social welfare and other direct income. Farm household disposable income was &euro;29,692 after tax. This compares with &euro;30,538 for urban households and &euro;24,545 for non-farm rural households.</P>
    <P>Disposable income for farm households was slightly above the national average at 103% and when household size is taken into account &ndash; it should be noted that farm households were larger than others with an average of 3.56 persons &ndash; disposable income per household member is 89% of the national average.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy aims to reduce the number of farms and non-farm rural dwellers who are consistently poor to below 2% and, if possible, eliminate it altogether. Preliminary results from the ESRI's Living in Ireland survey shows that 3.2% of farm households, 7.2% of other rural households and 4.3% of urban households are below the 60% consistent poverty line. These different methods of examining farm income taken together are useful indicators of general trends in farm income. No single indicator could be considered to be the definitive guide to average levels of farm income.</P>

      <P>The Minister was recently reported to have assessed the average farm income to be &euro;45,000. The equivalent Teagasc figure for 2001 assessed the average farm income at &euro;15,840. A farmer would need to have 90,000 gallons of milk to earn the income claimed by the Minister to represent the average. The Minister knows that less than 5% of dairy farmers have such a large milk quota and a similar percentage of beef farmers are in a position to earn such a high income. As farm incomes collapse, the Minister should be able to provide correct and accurate information. Will the Minister confirm that he believes the average farm income in 2001 to have been &euro;45,000? If not, will he clarify that the Teagasc figure of &euro;15,840 for 2001 is correct?</P>

The Teagasc figures are public knowledge, as they were published in a supplement of the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>, which is widely read by Deputies who are interested in agriculture, on 23 November last. I like to compare like with like when I refer to figures. Those figures indicate that a net family farm income is on average &euro;15,840, but that the gross average income is &euro;45,538. I have no quibble with any of the figures, but it is important when referring to figures that one compares like with like.</P>

If so, what figure does he give? This area is complex, as the Minister stated, and I imagine that is also the case when these matters are discussed at EU level. If the Minister does not use a specific figure, perhaps he should meet the farming organisations and the Central Statistics Office to come up with a standard calculation. It is a shame if we cannot standardise the calculation of average incomes across the EU. In view of the fact that the Minister is well read in agricultural matters, will he tell me how other countries calculate average farm incomes?</P>

EUROSTAT calculates the change in farm income per full-time worker equivalent, adjusted for inflation, in each member state and in the EU as a whole. This indicator measures the change in real agricultural factor income related to the change in total agricultural labour input. The EUROSTAT figures show that average income per full-time job equivalent, adjusted for inflation, declined by 11.4% in Ireland in 2002. <Col N="794" /> I would welcome if we could all agree on some independent body to agree on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a range of concerns with regard to the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, including the impact on employment in the meat processing industry. I made my views clear at the Agriculture Council meeting last month. While negotiations have only just begun on the overall mid-term review proposals, I made clear to the Commission and to the other member states my position on the various elements of the package. I have argued that the proposals as they stand are not necessary, are not in accordance with stated EU multifunctional policy on the EU model of agriculture, are internally contradictory, costly and strategically badly timed.</P>
      <P>Following the publication last July of the Commission's proposals for the mid-term review of the CAP, I commissioned FAPRI Ireland to analyse the impact of the proposals on Irish agriculture. With regard to beef, FAPRI forecasts that Irish beef production, after de-coupling of premiums from production, would fall by 12% compared to an average EU decline of 3%. The disproportionate decline in Irish beef production is accounted for by the fact that a significant proportion of beef output comes from the suckler herd which is most dependent on the premium system. FAPRI has concluded that our suckler herd would fall by 30% after de-coupling. Such a reduction in the suckler herd would lead to a general reduction in the throughput in our factories and in our beef output.</P>
      <P>With regard to sheepmeat, the forecast fall in production would also be more severe in Ireland than in the EU as a whole. Lamb production would decline by 12% compared to an average decline of 8% in the EU and this decline would come from a fall of some 12% in breeding ewe numbers.</P>

All of the working groups and committees are starting to analyse the proposals next week. FAPRI has analysed them for the Department in Ireland and there is considerable analysis to do in Europe.</P>
      <P>The proposals as they stand are stark. They would have an extremely detrimental impact upstream and downstream &ndash; not alone in the food processing industry but throughout rural Ireland. Supply co-operatives and others would be affected. There are ongoing talks with the meat and food industry generally and I met the relevant chief executives of the dairy co-operatives and the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society on Tuesday last to discuss these matters and to have a coherent response to the mid-term review. That is the best way to tackle this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was generally for the same reasons but the main opposition was to the de-coupling proposal. Ireland did not have as many supporters opposed to modulation because a lot of European countries feel it is a good thing to reduce direct payments, especially to larger farmers, and to put that funding into a pillar for rural development. Ireland does not go along with that because the threshold is far too low at only &euro;5,000.</P>
      <P>With three votes out of 87 in the Council of Ministers, we have to continue to forge alliances with other countries to ensure these exceptionally harsh measures will not come to fruition. They will disproportionately affect Ireland if they ever see the light of day.</P>

      <P>Provisional figures of applications for first age and bull premium of 2002 show that the quota was exceeded by 113,292 or 11.02%. This will be somewhat reduced as the premium is only paid on eligible animals. The final overshoot will not be known for some time yet.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Commission's proposed intention of using 2002 as one of the base years for establishing entitlement to de-coupled payments was a major factor in the huge number of applications submitted in late December. The number of first age animals and bulls applied for in December 2002 was 321,802 which amounted to 28% of all 2002 applications and shows an increase of 27% over December 2001 applications. Of more importance, however, was that three quarters of the December applications were received on or after 19 December. It is probable, therefore, that most of the producers who submitted applications for special beef premium in December did so on the basis that 2002 would be a reference year for the purposes of the proposed single direct payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the figures. The real problem is that those farmers with over 50 premium rights will have to bear the full brunt of any cutbacks. Does the Minister believe there is a need for high quality full-time beef farmers and is he prepared to defend their rights so that they will not suffer this sort of cut? Is the Minister prepared to go to Brussels or elsewhere to have this situation rectified so that farmers will not lose out in the manner proposed at present?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned premium rights. If farmers get a cutback in the 2002 premium rights as a result of this, will that carry through to whatever decision is taken on the Fischler proposals in the future and, as full-time beef farmers, would they carry the penalties right through?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been helpful to the larger specialist beef farmers and I increased the 90 limit <Col N="797" /> to 180, which effectively allowed for the 360 quota rights. At the same time, to achieve equitable treatment for the smaller farmer, I decided to exempt them from any overshoot that might arise from the former decision. This meant that farmers submitting applications for premia in respect of 50 animals or less would not have to contribute to any clawback. This exemption is fully compatible with the terms and conditions of the special beef premium and it was agreed at the time I increased or doubled the 90 limit. It is fair and equitable.</P>
      <P>The negotiations of the mid-term review of the CAP are under way and while they will take some time I have made clear my objections to both the Commission and the Council. There are several months of negotiation ahead and the working groups are only now getting down to work to arrive at a definitive position on our initial proposals.</P>

      <P>I was helpful to the larger intensive farmers and increased their numbers, but the smaller farmers did not like it. Last autumn, farmers went to marts and paid over the odds for stores and weanlings. They did this because they took the view that 2002 would be the reference year. The result was an overshoot in our quota. It now appears that the larger farmers are aware of this but want the smaller farmers to pay the piper. That is unfair.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with regard to the cases of BSE discovered in animals born after the ban on meat and bonemeal was imposed, that those animals were born after the actual date on which the ban came into force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants was banned in 1990. I assume the Deputy's question refers to cases of BSE in animals born after enhanced control measures in relation to meat and bonemeal, specified risk materials and the processing of mammalian waste was introduced in October 1996 and February and March 1997 respectively. A total of five animals diagnosed with BSE were born in 1997 and two were born in 1999. Having examined the relevant records my Department is satisfied as to the ages of these animals.</P>
      <P>Despite these cases, the underlying trend in relation to BSE is extremely encouraging. The age profile of animals confirmed with the disease is increasing, and this illustrates the effect the controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 had on the rate of exposure. In 2002, less than 2% of cases were identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed is a positive indication that these additional controls are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline as older animals leave the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I welcome the figures for the current week which indicates a positive trend. I hope it continues. However, there are concerns about the fact that a number of animals have been infected which were born after the ban was imposed. Will the Minister indicate if he has up-to-date information on the reasons they were identified as positive with BSE? It is worrying that while younger animals have been infected, there is no report on the reasons for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Upton's interest in and knowledge of this matter and her constructive approach. BSE is a very difficult problem and a full understanding of the causative agents are not yet fully known. While the age profile of infected animals is increasing and the figures are falling in relative terms and while active surveillance has been introduced in the past 18 months, isolated cases involving younger animals will arise. Two such cases involving animals born in 1999 were discovered last year. One of the cases was notified by a veterinary surgeon as a <Col N="799" /> result of compulsory notification rules, while the other was detected when it was tested for the disease as part of a herd cohort of a BSE positive animal. Both cases were detected long before the animals could have entered the human food chain. Their early detection illustrates the effectiveness of the multi-layered control system.</P>
      <P>While both animals were discovered in the same geographic area and were approximately the same age, even though they were different animal breeds, we are continuing to extensively investigate the matter. However, it is too early for my experts to tell me that they have conclusive evidence or proof of reasons they should become infected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the lower numbers and what is happening in other European countries, will the Minister justify the slaughter of all animals in a herd where one animal has been discovered? Animals from other jurisdictions are being imported into the country and they could have other types of disease. It would be less dangerous for us to at least retain the one and two year old animals, if not all the herd, except for the birth cohorts of the animals concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my personal view that beef is the safest possible food to eat, although it is not possible to have a zero risk attaching to any food or drink. The controls in place include the removal of the risk material from the human food chain, compulsory notification of the disease, ante and post mortem inspections at all plants, whole herd depopulation, tracing and culling of birth cohorts and a ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal. There is now a comprehensive, active surveillance programme, which means that even fallen animals going into knackeries or being turned to meat and bonemeal are subjected to the Enfer test since it was validated. As scientific knowledge becomes available to us, we immediately introduce any change that can be made. I am hopeful and bordering on being confident that, as the older animals are washed out of the system, we will eliminate this disease in the next couple of years. However, I am sometimes disappointed by cases that arise. In a recent one, a particular cow was almost 20 years of age. I do not know why people hold on to cows for that length of time because older animals are more prone to diseases like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Bord Glas was set up by Deputy Kirk approximately ten years ago. Does the Minister of State agree that it has done a good job in the meantime? Does he agree that there is a danger it could lose its uniqueness if subsumed into Bord Bia? I know people have made representations to the Minister for Agriculture and Food in his constituency expressing concern over this matter. The issue is close to the heart of my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. Will the Minister of State tell me if Bord Glas will definitely amalgamate with Bord Bia? Is he concerned that the ethos of <Col N="801" /> Bord Glas might be lost if it does? If the amalgamation is to go ahead, when will it take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise that when Bord Bia was established initially, much consideration was given to the feasibility of amalgamation and to ensuring that it was linked to, and part of, the Bord Glas structure. There were different points of view and ultimately a decision was taken to form a separate board. However, the export responsibility of Bord Glas at the time was given to Bord Bia, and that responsibility still rests with the latter.</P>
      <P>I remember going to Japan in 1990 to find three Irish State agencies promoting different parts of the country with maps of Ireland with black spots over different areas for which they did not have functional responsibility. I felt that was a disaster and I remember coming home and recommending that we should have one national promotion board for the country. Had I got my way, I would have amalgamated the former Irish Trade Board, Bord Bia, Bord Glas, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Fáilte in order to have one national board.</P>
      <P>We have a massive public sector, a diplomatic service right across the world and other ancillary organisations carrying out similar functions. There is a considerable replication of valuable State resources and we will take this into account. The Deputy can be certain that any decision taken will be taken by Government. Legislation will be necessary and every Member of the House will get an opportunity, individually and collectively, to make a significant contribution to the final decision.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the different roles and responsibilities of the two boards. Bord Bia, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, always had a promotional role in terms of the export of horticultural produce. I understand the horticulture market is relatively small and that Bord Glas has particular responsibility for the development of horticultural produce as native produce, not necessarily for export, and that this significant developmental role might be lost or subsumed within Bord Bia. Will the Minister of State comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputies Timmins and Upton, I am highly impressed by the contribution made by Bord Glas since it was set up. It is a small operation, consisting of 11 board members and 12 staff members. We have to take into account the role it has played, the future of the industry, the sectors it represents, the link that exists with Bord Bia and the opportunities that exist. We are certain that any change in the <Col N="802" /> structure will involve a clearly defined place for the operations of Bord Glas as they exist today and have done for the past ten years. Any proposal that comes before Government, and ultimately into the House by way of legislation, will involve clearly defined roles for both boards. We are confident that rationalisation and amalgamation will bring new expertise, focus and extra resources, thus ensuring that we get the best of both worlds in the proposed new structure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The foot and mouth disease outbreak could have had a devastating effect on the economy and on the agricultural sector in particular. I commissioned a study by the independent economic consultants Indecon to establish exactly the economic effects of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and the potential effects had a major outbreak taken place in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Indecon report indicated that the effects on the agriculture sector would have been very severe given Ireland's reliance on agri-food exports. The loss of export markets in particular could have brought losses anywhere between &euro;1 billion and &euro;5.6 billion. This would also have led to major job losses and would have impacted on our GNP by between 0.96% and 5.41%, with potential longer-term damage to our reputation as a source of food exports. This loss pertains to the agriculture sector alone and excludes economic damage to other sectors such as tourism. The losses in this regard were estimated at &euro;200 million by a similar study conducted by Professor Alan Matthews of Trinity College.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the actions taken to restrict foot and mouth disease in 2001 were effective both in eliminating the disease and in protecting the agri-food sector from massive economic loss. One of the great achievements of the time was the confinement of the problem to County Louth. It took the brunt of the problem, but this allowed the rest of the country to continue trading. As a result, the impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis in 2001 was that Irish agriculture benefited from higher prices on EU markets and increased exports to the UK to the tune of &euro;107 million.</P>
      <P>A fact that is often forgotten when discussing the foot and mouth disease crisis in 2001 is that the country was also dealing with the impact of the discovery of BSE throughout Europe and the shock that this sent through the beef markets. This occurred at the end of 2000. To deal with this crisis, I put a range of measures in place to support the beef market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cattle destruction schemes were implemented throughout 2001 and into 2002 and under them 513,000 cattle were withdrawn from the market. <Col N="803" /> That supported the market price. The total cost of these schemes came to &euro;426 million of which the Exchequer contribution was &euro;217 million. State supports towards the rendering of meat and bonemeal, the need for which arose from the prohibition on the use of meat and bonemeal as animal feed, amounted to &euro;66 million in 2001 and &euro;45 million in 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. According to a recent Bord Bia report, lamb sales are down by nearly 40% and total beef exports for last year were significantly reduced. There are further concerns in the beef market in terms of labelling product with the country of origin which will skew the market negatively for Ireland. Has the Minister comments on how the market can be recovered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Ironically, we gained from the fact that Britain suffered a severe outbreak of foot and mouth disease, particularly in terms of its withdrawal from the French market. That proved valuable for Irish lamb exports and the price of lamb was at an all-time high during the 2001. It has, of course, returned to previous levels. The fact that 513,000 cattle were taken out of the market in 2001 meant that supplies for 2002 were lower. There are proposals in Brussels for decoupling whereby people will get their cheque in the post once a year without a need for production. Farmers are bewildered by this change of direction and the impact of foot and mouth disease and BSE. On top of that comes the WTO negotiations, the papers on which were released yesterday. These negotiations will have the effect of further liberalising trade.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to make precise judgments while all these things are in the melting pot. Through Bord Bia we continue to promote the fine image of Irish food, particularly of our beef and lamb in the French market. Last there was an all-time record in the export of beef to the UK market. The tragedy of that record of 240,000 tonnes was that 75% of it went into the lower end of the market in the catering and wholesale trade. Given our prime beef, the industry should be more professional and aggressive in getting that product into the upper end of the value chain to give a better return to the industry and to Irish beef farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to be allowed to raise this matter and to see that there are three Ministers in the House to listen, though perhaps not for long. This is a serious issue which involves <Col N="805" /> the disposal of all animals in BSE infected herds. I raise the matter because of the injustice to an individual farmer which has been brought to my attention, although there may be similar cases. The date of diagnosis of the herd was used against the farmer in question. I have information about that, but I do not wish to go into it at this point. While the technicality involved caused the loss to the farmer of at least &euro;6,000 to &euro;7,000, I wish to look at the bigger picture. The Book of Estimates showed that agricultural provisions have been cut by 9% since the introduction of the disease levy and this week the Minister has cut &euro;45 million from supports for the rendering of meat and bonemeal. In that context and in the context of good industrial practices, I question the need to destroy every animal in a herd.</P>
      <P>Our Danish counterparts who also trade in world markets have decided to cease to do that and they have got agreement from their markets, including Russia. Russia will accept animals in light of new arrangements. It is obvious that Brussels and the market structure accept this. How can we tell a farmer with a fine herd that due to one BSE infected animal, which may not have been raised on his farm, all his animals, including calves and young cattle, must be taken? It may have been the right thing to do when these circumstances first arose to appease the marketplace, but as the Minister said moments ago, we have the best testing regime. Everything that can be done is being done. In light of that I urge a re-examination of our practices. I realise I am not going to get the perfect answer tonight, but I would like to hear the justification for destroying an entire herd. Is there a veterinary or medical reason involved?</P>
      <P>The other day I came across a young man with cows giving 1,700 gallons of milk per year, who is to have his whole herd removed as a result of one animal which is not even in his herd at the moment. This is a very serious situation which represents a cost not just to the farmer, but to the nation at a time of dramatic cutbacks in the money available to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason meat and bonemeal can no longer be used in poultry and pigmeat relates to BSE and the dangers of possible cross-contamination. The Minister proposes to withdraw all subsidy from 1 March. I have received letters from meat factories and the poultry industry, as well as from Corry's Proteins in Cavan that is recognised for doing an excellent job on behalf of the industry generally. My correspondents say they will have to get &euro;150 extra per tonne for the waste going from McCarron's pig factory and the same thing is happening right around the country. This will mean a drop of &euro;3 in the price of pigs if Corry's Proteins and McCarron's can pass that on to the pig farmers, which would mean &euro;20 for each animal. I do not have an exact figure for poultry, but this situation affects beef and dairy products. This is a retrograde step and some efforts should have been made to phase it out, rather than just ending it abruptly. It is another reason it will be more <Col N="806" /> difficult to obtain agreement from farm organisations to join in the national wage agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Crawford's point of view on this matter which, as he will know, was also the subject of Parliamentary Question No. 10 earlier today. I raised the same issues on many occasions before being appointed as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The depopulation of herds in which animals are diagnosed with BSE is a policy with serious consequences for the beef and dairy sectors, for the national economy and for individual farmers whose herds are affected by the disease, as the Deputy has outlined in individual cases. It is not a policy which was embarked upon lightly, nor is it one which can be discarded lightly. In this regard it is worth reminding ourselves of the context in which this policy was adopted, and the possible risks involved in dismantling part of a framework of controls which has served this country well in controlling and eradicating BSE, and in providing customers for our agricultural produce with the assurances they require in relation to animal health.</P>
      <P>Ireland has implemented a whole-herd depopulation policy where BSE is confirmed since 1989. This procedure was introduced in the context of concern about the potential impact of the disease on human health, uncertainty about the epidemiology of the disease and for market reasons, which are in turn related to public sentiment in various countries towards the disease. Much has been learned about the disease since that time, although there are still some unanswered questions. There is general acceptance in the scientific world that there is no evidence of horizontal transmission and that the main route of transmission is through the consumption by cattle of infected feed, with a theoretical possibility of maternal transmission.</P>
      <P>European Commission rules currently require full depopulation, but allow for a derogation where measures of equivalent effect are in place. The minimum requirement is for the slaughter and destruction of the infected animal and of the birth cohorts and progeny born within two years of confirmation.</P>
      <P>Perceptions of the likely risk and reward are pivotal to a decision to continue or otherwise with whole-herd depopulation. With the current range of measures there are no significant public or animal health risks in moving to a partial depopulation approach which would be less costly than whole-herd depopulations. On the other hand, there could be potential market repercussions as well as implications for individual farmers. It is difficult to estimate or precisely quantify what these risks are but we have to acknowledge that the stakes are high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a combination of these reasons, most third country markets require that beef be derived from cattle from BSE-free herds and we, by virtue of the total herd depopulation policy, have <Col N="807" /> been able to provide an absolute assurance to those markets that this particular requirement has been met. The important point is that for a country that exports over 90% of its beef, we have entered several markets by virtue of the fact that we have total depopulation and that is acknowledged by third country markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>There are also sensitivities, particularly in relation to milk and most notably the infant formula sector which involves the export of 80,000 tonnes per annum, valued at about &euro;500 million, and employs approximately 850 people in this country.</P>
      <P>I have indicated before that all of the controls relating to BSE are under constant review to see if they can be improved upon or made more cost effective in light of operational experience, scientific knowledge or changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the issue of the subsidy to the rendering industry. In December 2000 a ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to farmed animals was introduced by the EU and that ban remains in place. As a result of the ban, feed grade meat and bonemeal, which had been a commercial product, became a waste material with a significant disposal cost. In addition, unlike most other EU member states, Ireland has no approved disposal facilities for meat and bonemeal, such as, for example, incineration or landfill. That is a problem that Deputies could perhaps face up to in various places throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I know about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>In January 2001, to address the emergency situation faced by the meat sector, my Department introduced a subsidy towards the cost of rendering offal into meat and bonemeal, and its subsequent storage. It was never the intention that the subsidy would be paid indefinitely and the policy of the Government has been to gradually return responsibility for disposing of offal to the industry itself.</P>
      <P>By the end of this month when the subsidy ceases, the overall expenditure on supporting the production of meat and bonemeal since the introduction of the ban will have been &euro;138 million. An additional bill for the disposal of the 170,000 tonnes in storage will have to be borne by the Exchequer at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of the subsidy, the costs associated with disposal abroad have been reduced. The industry has also had time to arrange outlets for the disposal of meat and bonemeal on an ongoing basis and has done so since last December. I am of the view that in the absence of the Government subsidy the industry will achieve greater efficiencies than at present. There are already indications that lower cost disposal options are being actively explored. I would <Col N="808" /> expect in those circumstances that rendering and disposal costs will vary within the industry as greater efficiencies are achieved. In such circumstances I would not be prepared to speculate as to what level of additional costs will fall on farmers. There is, however, every incentive for all the stakeholders in the industry to work towards the achievement of lower offal disposal costs.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge, however, that there is an ongoing debate concerning this matter. It is something that is under constant review in the Department of Agriculture and Food. I will take into consideration the points that have been made by Deputy Crawford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Scoil Íosa is also called Malahide community school and, apart from the fact that it is in my constituency, nationally it is a particularly special school. Its size is phenomenal, being the third largest community school in the country, but it also provides facilities for a wide range of abilities. It has the only follow-on facilities for children with special needs in that area. The largest ACLD, dyslexia and remedial units in the country are depending on Scoil Íosa for children going from primary to second level. There is significant demand for places there and it is not easy to find alternative accommodation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the capital investment programme for 2003 has halted the progress being made towards a larger replacement building for Scoil Íosa. I am begging the Minister of State to give this school the go ahead at the quarterly review stage, or before then. I know I will be joined by many others in making this request. The Minister of State should take into account the chronic difficulties that are being caused by having to tell over 43 applicant pupils that have been granted places, that those places will now be withdrawn. The importance of the replacement building was recognised by the previous Ministers for Education and Science, Deputies Martin and Woods. I hope the current Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, will recognise the work as being urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is tragic for those affected, particularly for families where a child may be moving on from primary level, yet cannot now join his or her brother or sister in the secondary school. In case the Minister of State suggests providing pre-fabricated classrooms, the current facilities are so dilapidated that a number of pupils cannot use the toilets. The school building is generally dilapidated. They are people with chronic special needs. I spoke today to the mother of a boy who is dyslexic. He is in an excellent local ACLD unit but if he does not get a place in the Malahide community school she said she may as well send him to Trinity College because he would be completely at sea without the support facilities for a child with special needs. He is being told that he cannot have a place. His parents are frantic with worry and are in a desperate situation. They will <Col N="809" /> either have to pay for grinds or stay up late at night trying to help him. They will have no quality of life. That is the situation facing many pupils who are affected by this freeze. I ask that the situation be reviewed in particular cases where there is a clear humanitarian as well as educational need.</P>
    <P>I am aware of another case where the medical situation of the parents themselves is so difficult that they cannot travel or bring their children to another school and it is not possible for the children to be sent to another school. I hope this matter can be resolved without the country getting itself into further hot water. The Government has had to face parents in the courts because constitutional entitlements to education were being denied to their children. Children with special needs are being victimised most particularly. They are the very children who perhaps come from a disadvantaged background and are then told that they should go to a grind school for their education. Instead of facing up to that basic inequality this decision accentuates the inequality. Those children that can go to the secondary school down the road which does not have special needs facilities will do so but children with special needs who cannot go anywhere&mdash;</P>

      <P>In June 1998, the school authority of Malahide community school made an application to my Department for an extension of the school accommodation. At that time, the Department and the school's management authority agreed a long-term projected enrolment of 1,050 pupils. A schedule of overall accommodation was prepared by the Department for agreement by the school authority. Subsequently the school authority indicated that it considered a long-term projected enrolment of 1,200 pupils was more realistic and appealed to the Department to revise the figure of 1,050 to 1,200. The Department acceded to this request following a review of the demographics of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A full design team comprising a consultant architect, consultant quantity surveyor, consultant structural engineer and a consultant mechanical and electrical engineer, was appointed in August 2001 following an open competition that was advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i>, to plan the redevelopment of the school. A meeting of the design team, officials <Col N="810" /> of the Department and representatives of the school's management authority was held in September 2001 at the Tullamore office of the Department to discuss the brief for the project. At this meeting, the design team was instructed to fully and comprehensively explore all available options for the redevelopment of the school including the possible rebuild option. The design team was further instructed that it should liaise with the school's management authority and as far as possible have due regard to the wishes of the school when framing the optimum strategy for the school's redevelopment.</P>
    <P>Further integral elements of the optimum strategy were outlined, namely, achieving value for money, the projected life span of a refurbished portion of the building and the possibility of a phased delivery of the project. The stage one and two reports relating to site suitability and the outline sketch scheme were submitted to the Department on 21 December 2001. These reports outlined eight possible options for the redevelopment of Malahide community school. Following detailed analysis of all options, the ultimate preferred option became the complete rebuild of the school on the existing site. The planning process has progressed to stage three &ndash; developed sketch &ndash; with a stage three report due to be lodged with the Department shortly. When stage three has been completed and accepted, the design team will be allowed to apply for planning permission for the project, a process that inevitably will take a number of months. Unfortunately, due to current budgetary constraints the project will not progress beyond this point in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that at all times the Department has worked in close co-operation with the school's management authority to achieve the most favourable solution to the school's accommodation needs. I would like to point out to the Deputy that there has been substantial investment in this school over the past number of years. Specifically, a re-roofing project was carried out at a cost of &euro;365,521.47 and drainage works were carried out at a cost of &euro; 292,016.27.&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment. I spent time in a somewhat similar position to the Minister of State, I know that he has the answer already before him whereas I do not. That might be changed at some stage in the future to make things more equal in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was to ask the Minister for Health and Children why a medical card was <Col N="811" /> refused in the case of Mrs. X, in view of the fact that her husband who cares for her is currently off work due to illness and mindful of the fact that Mrs. X has been in treatment for cancer for the past five years. That question was answered in the normal way and it was referred to the Eastern Regional Health Authority from whom I have received a response which stated that Mrs. X was refused a medical card on the basis that her income exceeded the guidelines for the issue of a medical card by &euro;359.85 per month.</P>
    <P>When I refused to accept that response, I received another letter in the last few days. The authority said that having reviewed the case again, Mrs. X exceeds the guideline for income by &euro;359.85 per week, not per month as mentioned in the letter of 10 February. Guidelines in respect of personal allowance are &euro;190.50 per week. There is a little needle at the end of the letter which states: &ldquo;She attends her GP once a month.&rdquo;  In other words, this is trivialising the nature of the person's illness.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider two points. It has always been the tradition that a person with cancer can obtain a medical card regardless of income guidelines. I was a member of the health board for 15 or 16 years and that question was debated on numerous occasions. There was never an occasion where a person with a terminal illness of that nature was refused a medical card on income grounds or any other reason. Otherwise the person could find himself or herself destitute over a period of time.</P>
    <P>What is most worrying is that the information provided in the reply to the question is inaccurate. I will outline the situation. In 2001, the patient's husband was in full employment on a five-day week. For the duration of 2002, he was unemployed from January to July 2002 and he was in receipt of unemployment benefit. Essentially, he was caring for his wife who is seriously ill. Their only income was her invalidity pension or disability pension plus his benefit. Both had a medical card at that stage. He obtained employment in July 2002 and worked from then until December. He was working a three-day week because his wife was attending hospital and receiving treatment on a regular basis. It was not the case that she merely attended her doctor once a month.</P>
    <P>From December 2002 to the present day, her husband is off work due to illness. He is in hospital today and is receiving sick benefit. He was told by his consultant to come back again on 17 April and not to work in the meantime. His wife has not worked since 1972. I was a member of the Eastern Health Board which I felt did its job well over the years. However, since the introduction of this third tier of administration there seems to be an attitude that attempts to justify the indefensible. If an issue is to be made of a case the powers that be should select a less sensitive case. It should be one they could stand over and justify anywhere. That is not happening. It is <Col N="812" /> most insensitive that a person who has a potentially terminal illness has the added burden of somebody prying into whether he or she is &euro;2 or &euro;3 over the eligibility limit, particularly when it was always the policy to offer such people a medical card regardless of financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State knows what has to be done although his reply may not take account of these matters. I have confidence in his ability to undertake this case and have it referred for urgent examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the matter raised by Deputy Durkan and will put what he has said to the chief executive of the relevant health board which I take is the South Western Area Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the general eligibility provision of the Health Act 1970 and the discretion invested as a matter of executive power with the chief executive officer of the health board to make determinations in this matter. It is interesting, at a time when we are reflecting on the structures of health boards, that the matter has come before this House for consideration when it could have been put down at the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that persons aged 70 and over are automatically eligible for a medical card without reference to their means. In all other cases the means of the applicant and his or her spouse are taken into account. Of course, as the Deputy pointed out, they do not conclude the issues involved and medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The guidelines are not statutorily binding and in cases where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the relevant medical needs or other circumstances justify it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had inquiries made in relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy in Question No. 3129/03. The position is that the person's household income has been assessed as being substantially in excess of the income guidelines for receipt of a medical card. It was for this reason that the application was refused by the chief executive officer of the board concerned. As the Deputy is aware, the person concerned may appeal the decision of the chief executive officer.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the drug payments scheme provides assistance for a range of approved prescribed medicines for any person or family unit whose drugs bill is in excess of &euro;70 per month. This person would be entitled to apply to be included in that scheme. I will raise the matters the Deputy has raised with the relevant chief executive officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item for discussion. The word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; may be overused but not as it applies to the chronic traffic congestion of west Dublin. Two factors are responsible for the intolerable conditions in the west of the county being worse than elsewhere. They are the ongoing Luas works and the West Link toll bridge.</P>
      <P>At peak times the congestion on the M50, the Red Cow roundabout and the Naas Road is at crisis proportions. On occasion traffic comes to a halt entirely and it is often not immediately apparent why this has happened. At peak times it scarcely moves at best and there is no policing of the traffic chaos. A simple temporary obstacle can have disastrous implications leading to mile long tailbacks. Traffic at peak times is backed up from the toll bridge as far as the Red Cow roundabout.</P>
      <P>Changes arising from the Luas works are aggravating an already chaotic situation. Nobody accepts responsibility &ndash; not the Garda, the local authority, the NRA, or the Government &ndash; and meanwhile citizens cannot get to work without experiencing acute stress and frustration. The toll plaza at the West Link bridge is tantamount to a barrier across the road.</P>
      <P>I make four suggestions to the Minister of State for immediate implementation. Gardaí should be assigned to point duty in the area for as long as the Luas works continue. The West Link toll bridge should be thrown open at peak times morning and evening. A dedicated traffic corps should be established reporting to a single director of traffic and the Minister should enter negotiations with the owners of the franchise on the West Link bridge to buy it back immediately for the State so that the toll plaza which impedes traffic can be scrapped.</P>
      <P>The M50 is no more now than a distributor road for Dublin and therefore unsuitable for the levying of a toll that only serves to back up traffic for miles around. As Operation Freeflow proved, the intervention of gardaí can help keep the traffic moving and take action on temporary minor obstacles. The cost on the State requiring that the toll plaza be thrown open at peak times would be but a fraction of the economic cost of the delays now being encountered. The same economic costs to business and motorists through aggravation would entirely justify the State acquiring the bridge, by negotiation or by CPO if necessary, in advance of its normal lifespan.</P>
      <P>A dedicated traffic corps is long overdue and I have long advocated its establishment. The Minister of State should deal with resistance from the Garda the way he dealt with the penalty points system. There should be no tolerance of turf wars or the kind of dithering that characterised the previous Government's response to straightforward decision making in the transport area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is not responsible for the Department but I ask him to tear up the script and address this motion as a person who must be caught in the chaos every working morning and evening of his life. It cannot go on. The economic cost to business and industry is enormous. The aggravation and frustration for citizens <Col N="814" /> who cannot get to work in the morning is intolerable. Once in a blue moon gardaí tootle by on their motorbikes oblivious to the world of any obstacle in the path of traffic.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got kudos, and I join in commendation of him, for making minor straightforward decisions such as telling the Garda to implement the penalty points system or for making other sensible changes that should have been done years ago. Sin ceist eile. On this issue why can we not take some stance to alleviate the standstill, the aggravation and the congestion in west Dublin in order to give hard pressed motorists some relief? Surely a few gardaí could be put on point duty to remove temporary obstacles.</P>
    <P>We cannot persist with the toll plaza on a distributor road. It should at least be thrown open at peak times. The cost in money would rebound to the State tenfold. The situation is intolerable and I ask the Minister of State to get up and tell us what he thinks should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a matter close to my heart. In my official responsibilities I am busy co-ordinating three Departments and cannot contemplate co-ordinating the number of agencies to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>It appears that the matter raised on the Adjournment was the traffic crisis in west Dublin arising from the Luas works. I am not in possession of all the facts in regard to the toll bridge from an official point of view, although I am in full possession of the facts speaking as a representative of the area. The second bridge is under construction and I understand it will be opened later this year. I believe it will alleviate some of the traffic on the toll bridge.</P>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy is a valid one, as to whether an examination should be made of the potential benefit to the Exchequer of purchasing out the toll, either in part or in whole. I suspect, given the value that this particular franchise now represents, that the purchase of the entirety of the toll would be a very expensive operation from the point of view of the State. The option of purchasing part of it, which is the substance of what the Deputy said is something that I will raise with the Minister for Transport, on whose behalf I give this reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment at the end of 2001, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has had statutory responsibility for the Luas project, which at present involves the provision of a light rail system on lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. Significant progress has been made on the construction of both lines. The depot at the Red Cow is complete and has been fitted out. The 26 trams for the Tallaght line have been delivered and are being tested and commissioned. Construction of the depot at Sandyford is complete and ready for fitting out. The first of 14 trams for the Sandyford line is due to arrive next week. Almost all the utilities and enabling works have been completed and the property acquisition programme is at an advanced stage. Track laying is proceeding on both lines. A test track from the <Col N="815" /> Red Cow depot to Kingswood in Tallaght has been in operation for a number of months.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands that construction of both lines will be completed early in 2004 with passenger services starting soon afterwards, when the system has undergone testing and safety checks. It is disappointing that slippage has occurred in the construction programme and the Minister urges all of the companies involved, both in the public and private sectors, to do all in their power to ensure that no further delays take place and that the earliest possible commencement date is achieved.</P>
    <P>Luas will provide Dublin with a new and modern type of public transport service that has operated successfully around the world. It will play a significant part in helping to reduce the congestion problems in Dublin. In order to allow the system to operate to its optimal potential, co-operation between all of the relevant State agencies will be required.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, there has been and will be disruption during the construction phase, particularly where on-street work is involved, but every effort is made by the RPA to keep inconvenience to a minimum. While specific local arrangements regarding the construction programme are a matter for the RPA, the Minister is aware that the agency and its contractor, AMB, are working in close co-operation with the local authorities and the Garda as well as local residents, businesses and other interested parties in developing traffic management plans related to their work programme.</P>
    <P>Prior to works commencing traffic management plans must be prepared by the main contractor, AMB, and submitted to the local authority for approval. These plans outline in considerable detail the phasing of works, the manner in which traffic will be managed during the different phases and include details of the positioning of barriers, the phasing or traffic lights and the locations at which signage will be erected. Suggestions received from local businesses and residents and from other interested parties are also considered and form an input to the multiagency team which meets regularly to ensure that the highest standards of traffic management planning are brought to bear in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Belgard Road crossing in Tallaght, for example, where double track was laid diagonally across a busy road junction, a series of partial and full closures were deemed necessary.</P>

    <P>Apart from the statutory road closure notice published by the local authority, the RPA also publishes large scale notices in national and local newspapers advising of the traffic management <Col N="816" /> measures being put in place.

    <P>Working in co-operation with South Dublin Chamber of Commerce, information relating to the traffic management measures to be put in place was disseminated to businesses in the west Dublin area. In addition, input was invited from residents and businesses in relation to issues, views and ideas that might be considered in developing plans for the works and during implementation.</P>

      <P>Works at the Naas Road-Longmile Road junction have centred on the establishment of a permanent new junction layout that will improve the throughput capacity of the junction for road vehicles and also facilitate Luas trams travelling to and from the city centre. These works are being carried out at present by AMB on behalf of South Dublin County Council in accordance with designs prepared by the county council and its consultants. These works are likely to take a number of months to complete.</P>
      <P>Similar care was taken in developing traffic management plans and communicating the changes to interested parties. Any new junction layout requires a settling-in period during which drivers become familiar with the changes implemented. Traffic patterns at the junction are being monitored and it is proposed to erect additional signage focusing on encouraging drivers to enter appropriate lanes on approaching the junction.</P>
      <P>Once again, the Minister would like to thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and looks forward to the completion of construction of the Luas and the commencement of services next year.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 90 pesticides and their metabolites for which tests exist. These are listed on my Department's website. There are an additional 400 to 500 pesticides used globally for the manufacture of plant protection products and while tests are available for the analysis of residues in the vast majority of these, not all of these pesticides have been validated in line with the requirements of an accredited laboratory.</P>
      <P>My Department has doubled the number of samples being analysed for pesticide residues over the past two years and we plan to increase this level of sampling during the next two years. Monitoring for pesticide residues in food is very resource intensive and at present no country worldwide has the resources necessary to test all foods for all pesticides.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, however, that the finding of a small portion of the vertebral column in the cut of beef exported to the UK did not constitute a public health risk to the consumer for the following reasons: (<i>a</i>) the piece of vertebral column attached to the rib bone is associated with a part of that bone which is at some distance from the location of the dorsal root ganglia, DRG: (<i>b</i>) the rib and attached vertebral column would, in the course of normal commercial processing, have been removed prior to the beef being offered for sale or consumption; (<i>c</i>) the carcasses from which the beef in question was derived were of bovine animals under 30 months of age, produced in compliance with all of the extensive animal feed controls implemented by my Department. I am satisfied that the particular incident, while representing a technical breach of the regulations on specified risk material, did not, in any sense, place the consumer at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the level of safety on our farms. Over the past ten years the number of people killed on farms remains unacceptably high. According to statistics available from the Health and Safety Authority there were 13 deaths as a result of accidents on farms in 2002. This figure shows a 46% decrease in the numbers for 2001. While there has been a marked improvement in the situation it is imperative that all farmers acknowledge that farming is a hazardous occupation and one that carries specific risks to themselves, their workers and their families. All necessary steps to minimise the risks must be taken. My Department has been involved in a number of initiatives with a view to reducing the risk to farmers, farm workers and their families. In 2002 a health and safety module was added to the mandatory 20 hour training course for all participants of REPS 2. The building specifications for all new Department approved farm building programs have been updated to take account of the most up to date health and safety requirements. In February 2002 the &ldquo;Farm Safety Action Group&rdquo; representative of a wide range of organisations, including my Department, was established by the Health and Safety Authority. The role of this group is to progress the matter of farm safety and, specifically, to identify and prioritise the key issues related to improving safety on farms; to detail the actions necessary to deal with the issues identified; to develop a national action programme, co-ordinating the actions of the representative organisations and assigning tasks; to publicise, effect and monitor the programme; to carry out appropriate research and liaise with relevant agriculture organisations; and to report regularly, and formally at least quarterly, to the board of the authority. The action plan is being finalised at present and will be published this spring.</P>

      <P>In the CAP rural development plan I secured very substantial funding, for the period 2000-06, for REPS, compensatory allowances, the early retirement scheme and forestry. The plan also includes an undertaking to give effect to certain aspects of the nitrates directive. Delivering on these undertakings is important for Irish farmers, the majority of whom are beneficiaries of one or more of the measures in the rural development plan. The European Commission has been pressing number of member states, including Ireland, for clarification and clear commitments in this regard and for an indication of the measures, and timescale, for full implementation of the nitrates directive. The Commission has indicated that continued support for the four measures in the rural development plan through EAGGF funding of up to 75% is conditional on an early and appropriate response by Ireland. Under the nitrates directive, a member state must either designate particular areas as nitrate vulnerable zones, or alternatively adopt an action programme covering its whole territory. The Government has recently decided to implement the directive by way of a national action programme, and a reply notifying the European Commission of that decision is being prepared.</P>

    <P>The Commission's detailed proposals for the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 were published on 22 January and presented by Commissioner Fischler to the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers on 27 January. At that meeting, Ministers gave their preliminary responses to the proposals.  The details of the proposals are now being examined in various Committees in Brussels and discussions will continue at official level and in the Council of Ministers over the coming months. I also intend to discuss the proposals bilaterally with my Council colleagues and I have already initiated that process. The Greek Presidency has indicated its intention to reach decisions on the proposals at the June meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council but it is clear that the timetable is dependent on progress made in the discussions in the months ahead. I have already outlined my concerns and made my overall opposition to these proposals clear at the January Council meeting. My objective in the <Col N="820" /> negotiations is to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the national beef assurance scheme is that the traceability elements have been fully operational since 1 January 2000. It was envisaged that other elements of the scheme, in particular the inspection and approval of farms, would be undertaken last year in conjunction with the annual round of testing. To this end, detailed discussions took place with the veterinary and farming representative organisations over a long period and a protocol for the conduct of the inspections was agreed. However, only a small number of inspections took place because of resistance to implementation of the scheme mainly by veterinarians whose union is seeking a centralised payment system for the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation establishing the national beef assurance scheme clearly provides that the costs of securing a certificate of approval are the responsibility of the applicant. The Exchequer has already invested almost &euro;50 million in developing and maintaining the traceability sys<Col N="821" /> tem that underpins the scheme and costs will continue to be incurred under this heading. The scheme is an important element in the drive to maintain and increase marketplace in a difficult sector and I am disappointed about the impasse that has developed in relation to its implementation. Discussions will continue with the veterinary representative body and the farming organisations with a view to resolution at an early date. I do not have plans at present to amend the national beef assurance scheme. However, I am examining the possibilities for greater integration between the inspection process under the Bord Bia beef quality assurance scheme and the national scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 45,000 farmers joined REPS during the first scheme which ran from 1994 to 1999, and farmers in REPS have received over &euro;1 billion in payments so far. In 2001, the number of applications for the new scheme was the highest since REPS began, and 2002 also saw a large number of farmers joining the scheme. It is clear, therefore, that many farmers are already aware of the advantages of a scheme that offers them an average payment of &euro;4,900 a year for five years.</P>
      <P>Although the advantages of REPS are clearly recognised already, I am anxious nevertheless to make sure that it continues to be relevant and attractive to as many farmers as possible. For that reason, I have announced a consultation process &ndash; open to all stakeholders &ndash; with a view to putting together a package of proposals that I can send later in the year to the European Commission. My intention is that the review of REPS will be wide-ranging, combining all aspects of the scheme including the individual measures, payment rates, controls and sanctions. All the main provisions of REPS are contained in the CAP rural development plan and any significant changes would require the Commission's agreement to amend the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first stage of the review process was an invitation to make written submissions, and I set a deadline of 10 January for these. My officials are now analysing the submissions and the next stage, a round of meetings with stakeholders, will begin shortly. In the meantime, and in line with the Government's commitment to simplify scheme documentation, I have made some administrative changes to REPS which are being put into effect at the moment. Farmers with more extensive holdings can now opt for a simplified REPS plan, while my Department will no longer look for title documentation for owned land but instead will check REPS applications against land areas declared for area aid. To facilitate farmers <Col N="822" /> and planners further I have, at a cost of &euro;1.3 million in copyright fees to the Ordnance Survey, made arrangements for planners to access and download land parcel information from my Department's land parcel identification system, which makes entry to the REPS much more simple and accurate for all new applicants.</P>

Furthermore, candidate countries were required to ensure that all their external borders satisfy the levels of controls required in the EU and to ensure full and effective <Col N="823" /> enforcement of the internal market control systems, from the day of accession.</P>
      <P>A number of food processing establishments in the candidate countries have been granted a transitional period in order to upgrade their facilities to meet EU standards. Such transitional periods are limited in time and scope and do not involve any exemption from food hygiene legislation. Products from the establishments concerned must be specifically labelled and may not be marketed in other member states during the transitional periods. The European Commission and the food and veterinary office will monitor the implementation of the EU rules following the accession of the new member states.</P>

      <P>I hosted a meeting of the main farming organisations and the chief executives of the main beef export companies last December. The purpose of the meeting was to review the state of the beef industry and to consider the best market strategy for the industry in the short to medium term. A number of issues were agreed at that meeting. First, the participants accepted that the Bord Bia market strategy involving Irish beef moving up the value chain within the EU and gaining a greater spread of markets in general, represented the best way forward for the industry as a whole. This will involve applying greater efforts in maximising the returns from core European markets, including Italy and Holland, targeting growth in European developing markets such as Scandinavia and France and developing niche opportunities in Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal. In this context the UK will continue to be our largest core market for beef and the strategy ahead will involve increasing the volume of overall trade at retail level in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, on third country markets there was an acceptance of the need to avail of every market open to Irish beef and in this regard processors will continue to supply the important Russian market and will renew commercial efforts to supply the Egyptian market, which is more competitive for Irish exports since the special increase in <Col N="824" /> export refunds which I negotiated last year. Efforts are also continuing in relation to other important third country markets such as the gulf states, South Africa and Indonesia. There was general agreement that margins would have to be available for all involved, both at production and processing levels.</P>
    <P>The participants agreed also on the importance of introducing mechanical classification at an early date. I undertook to press hard at EU level to advance a framework regulation to facilitate the early introduction of a EU-wide mechanical classification system. Early agreement at Community level would facilitate the introduction of mechanical classification later this year.</P>

      <P>Prior to the BSE crisis in mainland Europe late in 2000, Ireland had recovered all of its traditionally important export markets which had closed as a consequence of the earlier crisis in 1996. Following the crisis in 2000, which arose from developments in other member states, a number of third country markets imposed Europe-wide bans on beef imports. There has never been a restriction on Irish beef within the EU due to BSE.</P>
      <P>It is my policy and that of the government that Irish beef should be free to enter any market where exporters consider there are commercial possibilities. Where there are restrictions due to BSE, every effort has, and will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical level to have them removed. As a consequence of these efforts, Egypt, which had been our largest market for beef, lifted the ban on Irish beef imports in October 2001 and the resumption of exports is now a commercial matter for the industry. Furthermore, following contacts between the Irish and Russian authorities restrictions on the supply of beef from certain counties were lifted and this has substantially improved access to that market for Irish beef. Intensive efforts are continuing in relation to other traditional markets for Irish beef which remain closed to us, such as the gulf states, South Africa and Indonesia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>France is the principal export market for Irish lamb, with over 80% of Irish exports destined for that market. Marketing efforts are continuing with Portugal, Italy and Spain and as peak demand in these markets is for the Christmas period it is expected that returns from those markets will increase at that time. Lamb exports to Germany and Belgium have maintained consistent levels. All markets to which Irish pigmeat has traditionally been exported are currently open. Japan and Korea were reopened in 2002 follow<Col N="825" /> ing protracted negotiations aimed at lifting the bans imposed because of foot and mouth disease. Other countries such as Hong Kong, South Africa, USA and Russia were brought back before the end of 2001. My Department is engaged in attempting to negotiate access to new markets such as China and Australia.</P>
    <P>The extent to which such countries are willing to engage in such negotiations or to accept product varies, as do the procedures to be followed in each case. I am conscious of the importance to the pig industry here of having access to as wide a range of markets as possible and to this end my Department, along with An Bord Bia, will continue to pursue this issue with all countries offering realistic prospects for trade. Although some difficulties with markets have arisen from time to time in the dairy sector over the period since June 1997, these have all been satisfactorily resolved.</P>

      <P>The reported animal disease problems in the Askeaton area were the subject of a multi-agency, multi-euro investigation under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency, which was conducted over a number of years. The report of this investigation was published in August 2001 and it concluded that although a small number of farms experienced notable difficulties, there was no evidence of serious or unusual problems in the wider Askeaton area. In the light of the outcome of this most comprehensive and searching investigation, I see no basis for revisiting the matter. In so far as farm animals in any area of the country may fall ill from time to time, there are well established procedures involving private veterinary practitioners and, if necessary, the veterinary laboratory service of my Department, for looking into individual cases.</P>

Nominees to the appeals committee are being sought from the farming organisations and from environmental bodies.</P>
      <P>The basis of the appeals process will be a scientific reassessment of the original framework plans by other planning teams to be chosen by the farmers making the appeal. A contribution of up to &euro;1,300 will be available towards the cost of each reassessment. Each reassessment will then be considered by the two Departments and, if it is not acceptable to them, it will be referred to the appeals committee. Appeals are confined to a reassessment of the scientific basis on which the original destocking arrangements were made by the framework planning teams, and only one appeal may be made against each framework plan. An appeal must have the support of at least 20% of the commonage shareholders covered by the plan in question who claimed area aid in 2002, although a simple majority of shareholders may overrule a request for an appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's investigations into the two cases of BSE in animals born in 1999 are continuing. The first of these cases was confirmed on 29 November in a Montbelliarde bull in County Limerick, when the herd cohorts of a 1993, born infected animal were slaughtered and tested for the disease. The second case was discovered in a non-pedigree friesian cow in County Kerry in December 2002, when a veterinary surgeon, upon noticing clinical symptoms associated with BSE, reported his suspicions to the local district veterinary office.</P>
      <P>Both these cases were located in the same general area and were born within a week of each other. Both were about 45 months of age at the time of detection, well above the age threshold for testing in meat plants, and both were detected long before they could have entered the food chain. While factors have been identified in both cases which could be associated with BSE, it is still too early to draw any definitive conclusions in relation to either case. It would not be appropriate to provide any further detail at this stage lest it prejudice the ongoing investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, considerable time and attention has been devoted to the control regime for BSE. All of the relevant controls are fully operational and are kept under review. If ongoing operational experience indicates that controls should be adjusted, this will be done as necessary. Current controls include, <i>inter alia</i>, whole herd depopulation, tracing and culling of birth cohorts and progeny of BSE-infected animals, a ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to all farmed animals intended for human consumption, compulsory notification of the disease, <i>ante</i> and <i>post mortem</i> inspections at all meat plants, the removal of SRM from the human food and animal feed chains, and a comprehensive active surveillance <Col N="828" /> programme among all cattle over 30 months of age and all casualty cattle over 24 months of age in meat plants, and all fallen cattle over 24 months of age in knackeries. For the present the evidence is that these controls are working well, particularly in the light of the underlying trend in the level of disease. However, all aspects of the control measures are kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Controls on the importation of food into the EU from third countries have been set down in EU legislation. Under the single market there is free circulation within the EU. All animal product imports from third countries must come from establishments in those countries which are approved by the EU and bear an EU health mark, except in certain instances when a product may be imported under a licence. The food and veterinary office of the EU carry out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU will be approved. Where the food and veterinary office is satisfied that public health requirements are not being met by premises in those countries, the establishments may be removed from the EU-approved list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consignments of animal products coming from third countries must be imported through an approved border inspection post upon first entry into the EU. Importers are required to be registered by my Department and must give at least 24 hours advance notice to the border inspection post at which their consignment is to be landed. Goods failing to comply with the veterinary control checks carried out at the border inspection post may be detained for further examination and if necessary they may be destroyed. Once products have met with all required conditions, they <Col N="829" /> are released for free circulation within the European Community.</P>
    <P>In relation to fruit and vegetables a major concern for human health relates to pesticide residues. Produce, regardless of origin, is sampled and analysed by the pesticide control services of my Department and reports on their monitoring controls are published annually. The latest report, entitled, 2001 Pesticide Residues in Food, is available from the Government Publications Office, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The requirements on food retailers to indicate the country of origin of the products indicated by the Deputy are stipulated in various labelling regulations. In relation to fresh, chilled and frozen beef sold as cuts or as mince, the following information should be available to the consumer at the retail outlet: the country of birth of the animal; the country or countries where the animal was reared; and the slaughterhouse where the slaughter took place and the cutting plant where the beef was processed. If these are the same, the label should simply state: origin, name of the country. Where some, but not all, of the information is available, the beef is labelled non-EC.</P>
      <P>For poultry meat imported from non-EU countries that has not been treated in any way other than freezing, the country of origin must be stated on the label. It is not normally required that the labels of lamb and dairy products imported from outside the EU show their country of origin. If its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree, the country of origin must be given. However, EU legislation stipulates that the hygiene standards of such products must be to the same standard of similar products produced within the Community.</P>
      <P>There is no legislative requirements on the food service industry to provide the consumer with the country of origin of any product. Due to ongoing consumer concerns about this and other general food labelling issues, I established a food labelling group to examine all labelling issues from a consumer's perspective. This group reported to me in December and my Department is currently examining this report. Following this examination, I shall decide on how best to progress the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report contains 21 broad ranging recommendations, four of which relate to this issue of <Col N="830" /> origin. Most of the recommendations will need further consultation with the European Commission and other Departments and agencies. The European Commission has also initiated consultation with member states as part of its current review of food labelling legislation. This report of the food labelling group will form the basis of Ireland's input into this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures for the control and eradication of BSE in Ireland are among the most comprehensive in the world. These controls are multi-layered, and designed in such a way that even if one protective layer of control is breached, there are several other layers behind it to ensure that consumers are protected. The primary focus of BSE controls is the prevention of infection, primarily through a ban and on the use of meat and bonemeal in feed for cattle and sheep, and the protection of public health through the removal and destruction of potentially infective materials, the specified risk materials, SRMs, from all bovine and ovine carcasses intended for the human food chain or the animal feed chain. The rapid testing of cattle at slaughter provides added protection.</P>
      <P>In so far as the prevention of infection is concerned, the eradication of BSE from the national herd will ultimately provide the best possible protection for consumers. In this regard the change in the age profiles of animals confirmed with BSE in recent years clearly shows that the enhanced feed and SRM controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 have had a dramatic effect on the number of infections since that time. Only 2% of cases diagnosed in 2002 were less than six years old at the time of diagnosis compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in the year 2000. Furthermore, in the period 1 August &ndash; 31 December 2002, the number of cases, at 122, was 32% less than the number &ndash; 179 &ndash; in the corresponding period in 2001. This trend is continuing in 2003.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, rules requiring the removal of SRMs ensure that the tissues which can potentially harbour BSE infectivity are removed from carcasses at slaughterhouses and sent for destruction. This means that even where animals have successfully passed through the other layers of control, indicating that there is no evidence whatever to suggest they have BSE, all such material is removed before the carcass passes onwards into the human food chain. This is arguably the single most significant current control measure from a consumer point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, since 1 January 2001 Ireland, in common with other member states, has had a comprehensive system of targeted active surveillance for BSE in place. Under current EU legislation, all fallen and casualty animals over 24 <Col N="831" /> months of age and all slaughter cattle over 30 months of age are tested for the disease, using a rapid test validated by the EU Commission. In 2002 more than 685,000 such tests were conducted. The carcasses of cattle over 30 months of age are not permitted to enter the human food chain unless the animals in question have tested negative for BSE.</P>
    <P>In this context in relation to the two 1999-born BSE cases reported in November and December 2002, the first case was reported by a veterinary surgeon as a result of compulsory notification rules, while the second was detected when it was tested for the disease as the herd cohort of a BSE positive animal. Both of these cases were detected long before the animals could have entered the human food chain, and their early detection illustrates the effectiveness of my Department's multi-layered approach.</P>
    <P>Finally, Ireland's handling of all aspects of BSE is subject to ongoing scrutiny from various perspectives by independent bodies such as the EU's food and veterinary office, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and others and has been recognised time and again as comprehensive, rigorous and responsible.</P>

      <P>EU regulations introduced in 2000 require operators marketing beef in the Community to label it with certain compulsory indications so as to ensure full traceability of the beef. The compulsory labelling must provide the following information: a reference number or code which enables the beef to be traced back to an animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located; the approval number of the deboning hall and member state or third country in which it is located; and the member state or third country where the animal was born, fattened and slaughtered.</P>
      <P>Although EU regulations are directly applicable in this country, the European Communities (Labelling of Beef and Beef Products) Regulations 2000 &ndash; SI 435 of 2000 &ndash; were introduced to make provision for the operation of inspection and control measures, whereby veterinary inspectors of my Department have responsibility for ensuring compliance in EU approved plants, the local authority veterinary service have responsibility for domestic abattoirs and the health boards have responsibility at retail level. Furthermore, these regulations have been included in the 2003 service contract with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which provides the authority with an oversight role with regard to beef labelling.</P>

      <P>The 2001 foot and mouth crisis, both here and in other EU member states, has resulted in a clearer appreciation of the potential for frequent and unregulated animal movements to spread diseases. The critical importance of full traceability has also been highlighted, not just in the context of consumer protection, but also to facilitate the tracking of animal movements and contacts in the event of a disease outbreak.</P>
      <P>While certain activities and practices may have been regarded as traditional, it does not necessarily follow that they are consistent with current and prospective requirements in relation to animal health, disease prevention, traceability and other key concerns. The BSE, and latterly FMD experiences, and animal disease outbreaks in other EU member states, have highlighted the need to critically question and where necessary alter traditional approaches to various aspects of the livestock trade in the interests of ensuring that the sector can have a secure and viable future. Sale by auction of livestock must be conducted only in a licensed mart premises, as provided for under the Livestock Marts Act 1967 as amended. I have no imminent plans to change the regulations governing the operation of marts and I do not see grounds for adopting a more liberal approach to the trading of animals in the future.</P>

      <P>The incident to which the Deputy refers was brought to the attention of my Department on 16 December 2002 by the beef exporter who had been informed of the complaint by their UK customer. However, no public statement was issued by the Food Standards Agency, FSA, until reference to the matter was posted on the agency's website at the end of 2002. Thereafter, my Department was informed by FSA of the matter. Investigations into the matter have been concluded and the facts are as follows: consignment of vac pack beef which is commercially identified as a &ldquo;full rib&rdquo; cut was exported to a UK customer in the north of England. However, at the behest of the UK customer the consignment was, in fact, diverted to the Smithfield market in London. On inspection by an official of the Meat Hygiene Service, UK, at Smithfield it was found that attached to each of the ribs making up the cut was a small amount of bone remaining from the vertebral column; the vertebral column of bovine animals over 12 months of age is one of a number of tissues which, in the context of BSE, is identified as specified risk material and which is required to be removed and excluded from the food chain.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, however, that the finding of a small portion of the vertebral column in the cut of beef exported to the UK did not constitute a public health risk to the consumer for the following reasons: (a) the piece of vertebral column attached to the rib bone is associated with a part of that bone which is at some distance from the location of the dorsal root ganglia, DRG: (b) the rib and attached vertebral column would, in the course of normal commercial processing, have been removed prior to the beef being offered for sale or consumption; (c) the carcasses from which the beef in question was derived were of bovine animals under 30 months of age, produced in compliance with all of the extensive animal feed controls implemented by my Department. I am satisfied that the particular incident, while representing a technical breach of the regulations on specified risk material, did not, in any sense, place the consumer at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>In the single market situation food products are sold freely and governments do not have the power to set the levels of mark up at different stages of processing and sale. The Competition Authority established under the 2002 Act does however, has a statutory role in relation to ensuring that markets operate freely and this includes the retail sector. These considerations aside, I am conscious of concerns expressed both by producers and consumers that food prices have increased and that these increases, though less than in many non-food sectors, have not benefited producers proportionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factors determining producer returns and retail prices are complex. In the case of commodity sectors supported by the common agricultural policy, the return to the producer is only partly made up by market prices. Direct aids to producers which are financed by the European Union and which have been increased to provide a measure of compensation for reductions in EU <Col N="837" /> reference prices, constitute a significant proportion of producer income with the balance coming from the market. That market is mainly abroad as in the case of the major commodity sectors, over 80% of Irish production is exported.</P>
    <P>On the retail side, markets have become more sophisticated and processing standards have risen. The growth in prepared foods has been major and this is now the fastest growing sector within the food industry. For this reason comparisons are more complex to make than before. The Deputies will be aware that in our free market economy I do not have a role in determining domestic prices. However, this Government, through its policies for development of the food sector, has improved the capacity of the food sector to compete in a rapidly changing market place. The measures supported under the currency of the national development plan, embracing capital investment, research, marketing and promotion, emphasise the fact that the keys to future success are competitiveness and market orientation. A yardstick of the success of these measures is that the annual output of the food industry is some &euro;14 billion per annum including exports valued at some &euro;6.6 billion.</P>

      <Quest>if contacts have been made with the Commissioner in Brussels in the past eight months regarding the need to have the remaining 16% of County Monaghan reclassified from its present status to severely handicapped; the amount of extra funding it would cost the EU-Irish Government per year; if he can justify on either legal or moral grounds any further delay in giving these farm families their just rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department have met with European Commission officials on at least two occasions since May 2002 at which consideration was given to the possibility of reclassifying the remaining 15% of County Monaghan as more severely handicapped. As that part of County Monaghan is currently designated as less severely handicapped did not satisfy the criteria for designation as more severely handicapped when the last reclassification took place. In the meetings with my officials to which I have referred, the Commission officials indicated that any formal request now for further reclassification confined to a part of the country to the exclusion of other areas would inevitably lead the Commission to ask us to justify our current designation and classifications for all areas. As this could lead to the possibility of the current classification of disadvantaged areas being open to question the timing and nature of any further re-classification would require very careful consideration. It is estimated that the additional annual cost of extending more <Col N="838" /> severely handicapped status to the remainder of County Monaghan would be &euro;247,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The BSE control and eradication measures in Ireland are among the most comprehensive in the world. The value of these measures can now be seen in the positive underlying trend in relation to BSE. In the period 1 August &ndash; 31 December 2002, the number of cases, at 122, was 32% less than the number &ndash; 179 &ndash; in the corresponding period in 2001. This trend is continuing in 2003. In addition, the age profile of cases detected continues to increase. In 2002 some 2% of cases were identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed is a positive indication that the enhanced controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline as older animals leave the system.</P>
      <P>These positive trends have not, however, given rise to any complacency in my Department. It is necessary that we will continue to insist on the strict application of measures to control and eradicate BSE. Most of these measures, such as compulsory notification, the ban on meat and bonemeal, active surveillance for BSE in factories and knackeries, the ban on permitting specified risk materials to enter the human food or animal feed chains and the slaughter of cohorts and progeny of BSE infected animals are now required by EU law although a number of them were being applied in Ireland long before they became compulsory at EU level. Ireland cannot unilaterally decide to discontinue such measures. Others, such as whole herd depopulation are optional and based on national rules.</P>
      <P>Like all programmes, BSE control and eradication measures are kept under constant review and are enhanced and made more cost efficient in the light of operational experience, scientific knowledge and changing circumstances. Any adjustments which this ongoing process indicates as necessary will of course be made. However, while trends in BSE in this country are now manifestly positive and the disease is being successfully tackled in other EU member states also, we are still some considerable way from the point at which BSE prevention programmes at either national or EU levels could be phased out.</P>

      <P>Regulations governing the import of live cattle are, in the main, laid down in EU directives and are designed, in the context of a single European Market, to facilitate trade while protecting human and animal health. The main animal health requirements for intra-Community trade in cattle are that the animals must be individually identified, accompanied by their passports and an intra-Community health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the holding of origin certifying that the animals have in the last 30 days undergone negative tests for TB, leucosis and where appropriate brucellosis. CSO trade statistics indicate that in the year 2002, a total of 1,834 bovines were imported, all in compliance with the above animal health rules. Statistical records in the format sought by the Deputy are not maintained centrally by my Department.</P>

      <P>Following a resolution of the Council of Agricultural Ministers in May 2001, the EU's scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare was requested to report on the welfare of animals during transport, taking into account the provisions of existing EU legislation in this area. The committee established an expert working group and presented its findings in a report published in March 2002. The EU Commission is, at present, drafting a proposal for the amendment of Council Directive 91/628 on the welfare of animals during transport, taking into account the conclusions of the report of the scientific committee. The extent to which the forthcoming EU proposal will reflect the conclusions of the scientific report is not yet clear. Ireland's consistent position on animal welfare during transport has been to support measures which facilitate live exports in a manner which ensures the welfare of animals. In the meantime we will continue to insist on the stringent application of existing controls.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to radically change the TB eradication scheme as operated by my Department at present. Council Directive (64/432/EEC) is the relevant EU legislation that governs the national TB and brucellosis eradication programmes. The TB eradication scheme, operated by my Department, must comply with EU legislation, in particular that relating to movement and trade in bovine animals. The programme has been successful in reducing the level of bovine tuberculosis from 17% of animals in 1955 to 0.3% of animals today. The maintenance of this low incidence level of disease makes it possible for Ireland to trade with other countries and as 90% of bovine animals are exported, in one form or another, this is a valuable benefit to the Irish economy. My Department also has an ongoing research programme and liaises with international bodies and organisations in relation to TB eradication.</P>

      <P>The application period for the 2002 special beef premium scheme was from 1 January to 31 December 2002. The terms and conditions of the scheme state that any 2002 applications received after 31 December 2002 will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant. In view of the Christmas holiday period, special arrangements were made by my Department to arrange for the acceptance of special beef premium application forms at local offices as well as at the special beef premium unit in Portlaoise on all working days over the holiday period.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these special arrangements, the special beef premium unit is examining all applications received in the special beef premium unit in January 2003 to determine the date of posting. In instances where individual farmers wish to have their applications considered under the 2002 scheme and have relevant supporting documentation, such as a certificate of posting, confirming that an application was posted in good time, the Department will review the date of receipt of the application.</P>

      <P>A breakdown of BSE cases county by county for 2002 follows. It is not possible to be <Col N="841" /> definitive about the reasons for the variation in the numbers of BSE cases between counties. However, the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence is that BSE is primarily caused by the consumption of infected meat and bone meal by the affected animals. Therefore, the likely explanations for the variation in the numbers of cases identified in each county are the type of farming enterprise carried out and the cattle populations. The higher numbers of cases tend to occur generally where animals are more intensively reared and were, therefore, more likely to have been exposed to contaminated feed in the years prior to 1996, when cross contamination in feed mills cannot be excluded.</P>
      <P>The feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants was banned in 1990. Enhanced controls were introduced to prohibit feed mills using meat and bone meal to produce pig and poultry feed from producing ruminant feed, in order to prevent cross contamination of feed in October 1996. Controls in relation to specified risk material and the processing of mammalian waste products were also introduced at this time and in February and March 1997 respectively. A comprehensive ban on the use of processed animal products for feeding to farm animals is in place since 1 January 2001.</P>

      <P>The national steering group for the organic sector met twice, in December 2002 and again this week. I am very pleased that Mr. John Duggan, the former chairman of Glanbia, accepted my invitation to act as chairman of the group. Twenty organisations are represented on the group and its wide-ranging composition provides a basis for advancing the partnership between the organic sector itself and the other principal essential interests. At its second meeting earlier this week, the steering group established the two other additional structures recommended by the organic development committee, the organic market development group and the partnership expert working group. These will report regularly to the national steering group which in turn will keep me informed of developments.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases of BSE here in 2002; the number of cases of BSE discovered in animals born after the ban on meat and bone meal was imposed; if he has satisfied himself with the controls and measures in place to detect BSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2002, there were 333 cases of BSE, including four cohorts from depopulated herds. The higher number of cases in 2002 was due to the higher level of testing of fallen animals when 76,203 such animals were tested compared with 24,614 in 2001. The feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants was banned in 1990 and enhanced controls in relation to meat and bone meal, specified risk material and the processing of mammalian waste products were introduced in October 1996 and February and March 1997 respectively. To date, seven BSE cases have been <Col N="844" /> confirmed in animals born after the introduction of the enhanced measures. Notwithstanding the higher numbers and the small number of cases in animals born after 1996, there is an increasingly positive underlying trend in relation to BSE. This is clearly evidenced by the following. In 2002 some 2%, six cases, of cases were identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. In the period 1 August &ndash; end December 2002, the number of BSE cases, including cohort cases, identified, at 122, was down by 32% on the corresponding period of 2001 (179). This trend is continuing in 2003. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed and the declining numbers of BSE cases are a positive indication that the additional controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will decline as older animals leave the system. However, the various elements of the control regime will be kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>A complete listing of approved EU border inspection posts, BIPs, for veterinary checks on animal products and live animals imported from third countries has been published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> (OJ No. 344 of 2002, 19.12.2002) under Commission Decision No. 2002/986/EC. This listing sets out the locations, e.g. airports, seaports, railways or roadways, in each of the member states of the BIPs as well as the veterinary inspection functions for which the BIP has been approved by the food and veterinary office, FVO, of the European Commission. The FVO monitors each member state's BIPs and arranges approval based on its assessment of the character of animal products imported as well as the standard of facilities which are in place to provide for veterinary inspection of the products under three main categories: ambient, chilled and frozen. Out of a total of 283 BIPs in the EU 258 have been approved to carry out veterinary checks on imports of animal based products intended for human consumption. The following is a summary breakdown of these by member state:</P>

      <P>My Department conducts on-farm inspections of 25% of REPS participants each year, and for a further 5% it conducts both an on-farm inspection and a full check of their agri-environmental plans. Every participant is inspected at least once during his or her REPS contract. Sanctions for non-compliance with participants' undertakings range from 10% to 100% of a year's payment. Penalties are compounded for repeat offences, and in certain circumstances the scheme conditions provide for my Department to terminate participation and claim back <Col N="846" /> all payments already received. My Department's controls are subject to regular scrutiny by several auditing bodies acting on behalf of both the Government and the European institutions. Full records of inspection results are maintained and are available to these bodies.</P>

      <P>In so far as disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance, livestock premia and arable aid payments are concerned the statistics requested by the Deputy are not readily available. Farmers may be in receipt of one or more payments under the various schemes. However, a good indication of the number of farmers in receipt of EU subsidies per county is the number of area aid applications per county. In general each farmer must submit an area aid application each year. The number of area aid applications per county received in 2002 is set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>The first two directives to which the Deputy refers are (a) Directive 2001/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition and Directives 70/524/EEC, 96/25/EC and 1999/29/EC on animal nutrition and (b) Commission Directive 2001/36/EC amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. When transposing these Directives, my Department decided to use this opportunity to implement a detailed review of and consolidate the existing national legislation with a view to providing more comprehensive and user-friendly legislation in these areas in line with the stated Government policy on better regulation. I expect that this work will be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to beef labelling, the Deputy may <Col N="848" /> be referring to Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97. The regulation is directly applicable in Ireland. A legal services division has been established in my Department with the objective of, <i>inter alia</i>, improving legislative drafting and implementing the Government policy of better regulation so that legislation is clear, achieves its objectives, is not overly burdensome, is enforceable and has no unintended effects.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cattle who died from botulism in 2002; if he is satisfied that humans are not at risk from bovine botulism disease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2002, there were 36 suspected outbreaks of botulism on farms and 147 deaths of cattle attributed to botulism reported to my Department's central veterinary laboratory or regional veterinary laboratories. Botulism is not a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Animals Act 1966. It is caused by a bacterium called <i>clostridium botulinum</i> that causes harmful effects by producing a toxin. There are five types of the botulism toxin, A, B, C, D and E. Types C and D are common to cattle. Bovine botulism can be contracted by contact with contaminated decomposing organic material such as poultry litter which contain dead poultry carcasses when spread on land grazed by cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While humans may be affected by botulism, it should be noted that the specific toxins implicated in the conditions in humans are not those normally associated with the condition in cattle. It is also generally accepted that humans are resistant to the types of toxin that affect cattle. Furthermore, these toxin types are poorly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and the toxins themselves are inactivated by heat treatment. The risk to human health from consumption of milk or meat from cattle on farms with cases of botulism, therefore appears to be remote. However, as a precautionary measure, farmers are advised to wear gloves, to wash their hands thoroughly after handling poultry litter and to avoid unnecessary contact with the material. My Department has also, by way of a press release drawn the attention of farmers to the botulism problem and has urged them to take precautionary measures when handling poultry litter material. Furthermore, my Department has written to dairy processors advising them about the condition and asking them to distribute an information-advisory note entitled, Good Farming Practice with regard to Spreading Poultry Litter <Col N="849" /> on Land, to the dairy producers supplying milk to them. In the same way, poultry processors were also circulated with a similar information-advisory note. An information note on botulism for veterinary practitioners and instructions for practitioners when dealing with suspected cases of botulism on farm have been circulated to private veterinary practitioners by district veterinary offices and copies of good farming practice with regard to spreading poultry litter on land are available to farmers from district veterinary offices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission's proposals for the reform of the CAP were published only a few weeks ago. The process of examination of, and negotiation on, the proposals at EU level will take some months. The negotiations are unlikely to be concluded before June 2003 at the earliest and the outcome of those negotiations cannot be predicted at this stage. The deadline for the conclusion of the WTO negotiations is the beginning of 2005. The likely outcome, and its possible impact on the CAP, will not therefore be clear for some time.</P>
      <P>At this stage of both sets of negotiations, it would be inappropriate to plan for the ultimate outcomes. I established the agri-food 2010 committee in June 1999 to consider the implications for Irish agriculture of future developments at the EU and international levels. That report, and the Government's response, the Agri Food 2010 Plan of Action, are still essentially valid, particularly since it is my objective in both sets of negotiations to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and rural communities of the Agenda 2000 agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The lesson learned by the Irish and other European Authorities in responding to past food scares was the need to have a well prepared Incident Management Plan in place. Equally, the necessity to develop a crisis plan in Europe has now been formally recognised in European food legislation. The European Commission will draw up such a plan in close co-operation with member states and with the new European Food Safety Authority. The challenge of preparing a plan for Ireland is being met by each agency involved in food in Ireland, and also through the development of this inter-agency food incident management plan.</P>
      <P>The food agency co-operation council, FACC, was established under the aegis of my Department to promote the fullest possible practical co-operation between the State agencies involved in the food industry in the interests of the optimum development of the industry. Recent events and experience led the FACC to the conclusion that there was a need for a more transparent food crisis plan. The purpose of the incident management plan launched in December 2002 is to strengthen co-ordination between the Government Departments, enforcement agencies, food industry and consumers; facilitate a seamless local, national and international response; and develop transparent, documented protocols to initiate and conduct product tracing and recall and to assure adequate and timely communication with all stakeholders and the public during a food incident.</P>
      <P>The key elements of food incident management plan are incident notification mechanism; incident management; and incident information dissemination. This plan aims at ensuring that in the event of a crisis from whatever source in the food sector in Ireland, all of the State agencies involved in that sector act in a mutually supportive manner and together with industry, provide each other with the fullest practical assistance so that consumers are protected, public confidence is maintained, and the industry retains the capacity to recover.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission's proposals on the mid-term review contain significant proposals in the milk sector. It is proposed (i) to bring forward the Agenda 2000 proposals by one year, from 2005 to 2004; (ii) to impose additional price cuts in 2007 and 2008 with compensation by way of a dairy cow premium as under Agenda 2000; (iii) to increase quotas by 1% per year in 2007 and 2008; (iv) to extend the quota regime to 2014/2015; (v) to restrict access to intervention for butter; and (vi) to weight the price reductions more on butter than on SMP. At the Council of Ministers at the end of January, I outlined my position in relation to these proposals. I made it clear that I did not see any reason for bringing forward Agenda 2000 from the already agreed date. Neither did I see any reason at this stage for proposing further changes for 2007-08. I stated that my view was that any further reforms should be considered closer to that date when we will have a better view of the market conditions then prevailing and, crucially, the outcome of the Doha round of the WTO negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the approximately 11,000 tonnes of beef imported annually into this country the majority of EU beef originates or transits the United Kingdom. Included in these imports would be product exported from Ireland, which was subsequently re-imported for technical-commercial reasons and the re-importation of beef that had been exported to the UK for cutting up or processing. In this regard it is worth noting that Ireland exported a total of 445,000 tonnes of beef in 2002 of which 245,000 tonnes went to the UK.</P>
      <P>Beef originating in non-EU countries may be imported into the EU on payment of import tariffs or under certain agreed preferential quotas operated under the WTO. A condition of entry to the EU is that the beef must meet all EU veterinary and hygiene standards. These imports are largely used for further processing in the convenience food sector, as pizza topping, meat pies, or lasagne and are subsequently exported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any particularly new evidence supporting a link between Johne's disease in cattle and Crohn's disease in humans.</P>
      <P>My Department consulted the European Commission in relation to the suggested link. The report of the scientific committee on animal health and welfare on possible links between Crohn's disease and paratuberculosis, Johne's disease, which was published by the Commission in 2000, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusion about the suggested link between these two diseases. My Department also referred the matter to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, for an opinion on the matter and the scientific committee of the FSAI advised that there &ldquo;is insufficient evidence to confirm a link between Johne's disease and Crohn's disease&rdquo;. My Department continues to monitor the scientific evidence as it becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" />It is not possible under EU law to screen imported cattle for Johne's disease. It may well also be the case that any State agency promoting a voluntary screening of imported cattle for this disease may be of itself be in breach of Articles 28 and 29 of the Treaty on European Union which prohibits member states placing restrictions on imports and all measures having an equivalent effect.</P>
    <P>Unless and until there is sufficient scientific evidence to confirm a direct link between Johne's and Crohn's diseases it is unlikely that such restrictions can be justified on grounds of, <i>inter alia</i>, the protection of public health especially given the endemic nature of this disease in other member states.</P>
    <P>However, there is nothing to prevent any prospective purchaser from requiring private certification with regard to freedom from Johne's disease, from a vendor in respect of the purchase of cattle either imported from abroad or sourced within this country. This is a prudent precaution which will protect the purchasing herdowner and his-her animals and I would urge herdowners generally to take such a precaution when purchasing cattle.</P>
    <P>My Department in an effort to raise consciousness of the disease and to promote higher standards of hygiene management practices and calf rearing published and distributed two booklets in 2002 on Johne's disease; one of these is aimed at the farmer and the other at the private veterinary practitioner. Notwithstanding this and other measures, including the purchase and slaughter by my Department of diseased animals, and in some cases entire herds, I have come to the conclusion that the approach which this country has hitherto adopted to tackling the disease needs to be reviewed. The numbers of reported cases of the disease have been increasing significantly in recent years and I believe we now need a new and more resolute approach. It is abundantly clear that the prospects of success on this front are very much dependent on a concerted and sustained effort by all of the interested parties to address the disease. Such interested parties include farmers and others who import, sell and buy livestock, farmer representative bodies, co-operatives, breed societies, the veterinary profession and my Department. I am currently examining ways in which we can more effectively marshal the resources of all of these parties so as to give a new direction and momentum to our efforts to tackle Johne's disease in the national herd and to enhance the prospects of making real progress in this regard. I expect to be in contact with all concerned shortly.</P>

      <P>The Agriculture Appeals Office was established on 13 May 2002. To the end of 2002, 518 appeals were received. As of 11 February, 416 of these have been closed with the following outcomes: 143 cases were either allowed, partially allowed or revised by the Department in the appellant's favour; 34 cases were either withdrawn, not valid or out of time; one case involved the director of agriculture appeals giving advice to the Department under the approval and registration of dealers and dealers' premises scheme; and 238 cases were disallowed.</P>
      <P>In 2003, 93 appeals have been received. As of Tuesday, 11 February, three of these have been closed with the following outcomes: two cases were either allowed, partially allowed or revised by the Department in the appellants favour; and one case was disallowed.</P>
      <P>The mission of the office is to provide an independent, accessible, fair and timely appeals service for persons who make application under the Department of Agriculture and Food direct payment schemes, and to deliver that service in a courteous and efficient manner. One important element of the appeals process is that appellant's are entitled to an oral hearing and as of 11 February, some 215 have taken place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>The number of cases of BSE world-wide reported to the OIE, The World Animal Health Organisation, in 2002 was 1,698. Of these 333 cases or 19.62% were detected in Ireland. However, it should be noted that not all countries have provided up to date information to the OIE and therefore the data listed in its report understates the overall number of cases world-wide for 2002, whereas the case numbers for Ireland are up to date.</P>
      <P>It is also important to note in this context that since 1 January 2001, EU rules requiring intensive active surveillance among casualty and fallen stock over 24 months of age and healthy animals over 30 months of age intended for human consumption, have led to a substantial increase in the number of BSE cases detected in the EU. Equivalent surveillance programmes have not been established in third countries.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, the general trend of the disease is encouraging in that the age profile of animals confirmed with the disease is increasing. In 2002 some 2%, seven cases, of cases in Ireland were identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. In addition in the period August-December 2002, the number of cases, including cohort cases, identified, at 122, was down by 32% on the corresponding period of 2001, 179. This trend is continuing in 2003.</P>
      <P>The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed and the declining numbers are a positive indication that the additional controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will decline as older animals leave the system.</P>

      <P>In all, Ireland produces 500,000 tonnes of beef and consumes 65,000 tonnes on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that Ireland imports approximately 11,000 tonnes of beef annually, not all of which is consumed in the domestic market. The majority of EU beef imports originates or transits the UK and include beef products that were originally exported from Ireland for cutting up or processing, or product re-imported for technical-commercial reasons.</P>
      <P>Third country beef imports enter Ireland on payment of tariffs or under certain agreed preferential quotas operated under the World Trade Organisation. These imports are largely used for further processing as pizza topping, meat pies, and lasagne, and are re-exported in these forms. The importation of beef products is permissible under EU law provided that the products concerned comply with relevant EU veterinary and labelling legislation.</P>
      <P>The domestic milk intake by creameries and pasteurisers in 2002 was 5,036 million litres; of which imported milk amounted to 273 million litres or 5% of the total. The imported milk is made up of both liquid milk for human consumption from Northern Ireland and milk for processing. Much of the milk imported for processing would, of course, be exported in the form of milk products in line with the largely export-orientated profile of the dairy industry. Milk imported for the drinking milk market accounts for about 13% of that market.</P>

      <P>Under EU legal requirements, all cattle over 30 months of age as well as fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age must be rapid tested for BSE. As of 14 February 2003 part of <Col N="858" /> the cost of testing all male animals over 30 month and female animals over 30 month born after 1 January 2000 will be passed to the industry. In addition, from 1 March 2003, the Exchequer will no longer subsidise rendering and disposal costs of meat plants. These changes will reduce the level of Exchequer subsidisation of BSE measures.</P>
      <P>For the present, the cost of other elements of the BSE eradication and control programme will continue to be borne by the Exchequer. These include the testing of fallen animals, female animals over 30 months animals born prior to 1 January 2000 and the cohorts of BSE positive animals, the cost of herd depopulation, and the continued storage and ultimate disposal of meat and bone meal accumulated from 1 January 2001, when the feeding of meat and bone meal to all farmed animals was banned, to 1 March 2003. Part co-funding of BSE testing and herd depopulation measures will be continue to be provided by the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>Like all programmes, BSE control and eradication measures are kept under constant review to see if they can be improved or made more cost efficient in the light of operational experience, scientific knowledge and changing circumstances. Any adjustments, which this ongoing process indicates as necessary, will of course be made at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has now published proposals for a harmonised system of sheep identification. This proposal is based on individual identification, use of movement documents and registers, a central database and, ultimately, electronic identification. Many of the elements in this proposal are already in place in Ireland as part of the comprehensive national sheep identification system, NSIS, introduced in June 2001. I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are working well. I have consistently indicated that it would however be open to refinement and further development in the light of operational experience and to accommodate emerging demands and changing circumstances. In that context, the prospect of a harmonised system at EU level obviously holds potential for some change to aspects of NSIS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While much of the detail of the European Commission proposals will need to be discussed and examined in the coming months to assess its practical application and while I have concerns about some of the detailed aspects, I can support the broad principle which underlies the Commission's thinking &ndash; the need across the European Union for a robust, harmonised system of sheep identification backed up with good record-<Col N="859" /> keeping allowing full traceability of animal movements at all times.</P>

      <P>The current system of mushroom production evolved in the 1980s where growers invested in facilities, which included in the main up to three growing houses with ancillary packing and heating facilities with family labour being the predominant source of the labour supply. Some of the growers now exiting the industry are the owners of such units, which are now reaching the end of their technical and economic life. However, mushroom output has been maintained by growers who expanded beyond this original basic unit and invested in new equipment, such as environmental controls and new growing systems. Funding available under the NDP 2000-06 has assisted producers in this regard while the development of producer organisations under the EU grant scheme has contributed to improved marketing of their product. Currently there are 13 mushroom producers organisations in existence and these were in receipt of grant aid of the order of &euro;2.77 million in 2001. In 2001, total mushroom output was 68,000 tonnes with an estimated farmgate value of &euro;128 million, which represented an all time high for the sector.</P>
      <P>To help the sector adapt to the changing market situation, the two state agencies under my aegis, An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas, have jointly commissioned a study which will examine the structure and competitiveness of the sector over the whole production-supply chain.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job initiative programme is a work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or over. The fundamental objective of the programme is to prepare participants to progress into mainstream jobs. <Col N="862" /> Funding of &euro;46 million has been provided for the programme in 2003 which will provide for an average participation rate in the region of 2,490. There were 2,525 participants on JI in January 2003.</P>
    <P>Phase 1 and phase 2 participants of JI who are now on their fifth and sixth year, together with people referred to FÁS under the national employment action plan, will be targeted by the new high supports process which is being piloted in ten areas country-wide. This new process is designed to provide a flexible response for persons experiencing barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment in the open labour market, and will be based on the individual needs of clients with the support of a fund of up to a maximum of &euro;2,200 per person. The new high supports process aims to maximise progression into the open labour market of those being supported.</P>
    <P>FÁS is currently carrying out an internal review of the community employment and JI programmes which should be finalised shortly. This review will consider the future operation of these programmes in the provision of labour market services for the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged persons. In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is currently being progressed under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, chaired by my Department. The future policy direction of JI and other active labour market programmes will be further informed by the outcome of this process.</P>

This follows on the grant aid of &euro;3.582 million which was paid for developments carried out over the first two years of the scheme in 2001-2002. The 2003 scheme was launched on 6 February 2003 and will cover the period up to 31 December 2003.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the scheme remain the same as in the first round, which covered the 2001-02 period. These are to help producers meet the higher quality standards being sought by consumers and the high environmental and hygiene requirements demanded of all food producers.</P>
      <P>In addition, grant aid is also provided to producer organisations under the EU Common Organisation of the Market for Fruit and Vegetables. Currently 17 producer organisations are now recognised under this scheme and were in receipt of &euro;2.967 million in 2001. The scheme enables producers to benefit from their combined strength in producing and marketing high quality fruit and vegetables. Total marketed production of these groups in 2001 was &euro;163 million.</P>

      <P>Agriculture will face significant challenges in the immediate future arising out of reform of the CAP, EU enlargement and further trade liberalisation under WTO round. There are also challenges in relation to the environment and issues over how our food is produced. Farmers will have to adopt the most modern and efficient <Col N="865" /> systems and they will be required to farm in a manner that is sustainable and affords protection to the environment. At the same time there are increased challenges in relation to consumer demand for new product innovation and for food safety. To meet all these challenges, the industry will need to continue to be informed by good research.</P>
      <P>Irish agricultural policy at the moment is aimed at ensuring an efficient, competitive agricultural sector capable of delivering high quality, safe food. This has been clearly laid out within the Department's long-term strategy document Agri-food 2010 and within the current statement of strategy 2001-04. The significant role of research and development in this process is recognised and has been incorporated within the goals and strategies outlined in the statement of strategy.</P>
      <P>The application of scientific knowledge has played a pivotal role in the development of the agri-food industry to date. I appreciate the key role of research and development in this regard, in providing information on the most up-to-date and efficient practises. Research will continue to inform the sector and will play a key role in the future.</P>
      <P>In recognition of this, significant funding is provided by Government for research in the agriculture and food sector. Funding is provided to Teagasc for its research, advisory and education services. Public funding is also provided to the University sector for research in agriculture and food. The Food Institutional Research Measure, FIRM, of the NDP is the largest nationally funded food research programme currently in operation. In addition to all of those, my own Department also maintains farms and laboratories which carry out research and trials relating to animal and crop production and food safety.</P>
      <P>The Teagasc advisory services play a crucial role in the adoption of the results of research into farm practice. In similar manner, the results of food research carried out under FIRM are made available to industry through the RELAY dissemination project.</P>
      <P>However, public good research will not on its own drive an economically viable and competitive agri-food industry. Companies themselves also need to be involved. Sales and profitability are positively linked to in-company research, and thus in-company research and development is crucial to success.</P>
      <P>Research and development will be very important in providing a strong scientific and technological base to underpin the development of a vibrant and competitive agriculture industry, and enable it to meet the many challenges facing it in the future.</P>

      <P>The competitiveness of the Irish agri-food sector is vital to its ongoing viability and therefore this was a major issue that was addressed in the Agri-Food 2010 report. Many of the action points in the subsequent plan of action were designed to enhance Ireland's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As competitiveness is not a static concept, I am conscious of the ongoing need to maintain the competitive ability of all major sectors. I have initiated three studies to monitor this issue and to see how the Irish agri-food sector is doing <i>vis-à-vis </i>our major competitors.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department monitors the prices paid at producer level, it has no direct role in monitoring the differential between the producer price and the prevailing price paid to the consumer at retail level. I am, however, fully aware of concerns expressed that the gap between the price paid to the producers and the corresponding price paid at retail level by the consumer is excessive. <Col N="867" /> There are a number of complex factors, which have contributed to this variation in producer and consumer prices. However, as we operate in a free market economy, I have no role in determining the level of domestic prices charged in the marketplace. Single market rules dictate that products must be traded freely in the marketplace and governments do not have the power to influence the levels of mark-up at different stages of processing and sale. The Competition Authority established under the 2002 Act does, however, have a statutory role in relation to ensuring that markets operate freely and this includes the retail sector.</P>
    <P>One of my main priorities is to assist the development of agriculture and to seek the best possible supports in order to ensure adequate returns for the farming community. In 2003, my Department is providing &euro;2.8 billion in public expenditure to support the agriculture sector, of which &euro;1.6 billion will be paid in direct payments to farmers. It should be recognised that direct income payments now support farmers' incomes to a very considerable extent providing almost 70% of aggregate farm income. I also recognise that producers must be rewarded for providing the safe, quality and wholesome food that consumers demand. As with other sectors of the economy, the farming community is entitled to maximise returns from the marketplace.</P>
    <P>In this regard, my Department is fully committed to assisting the industry in improving its competitiveness and market orientation. In the national development plan, we are providing significant funding to meet the needs of the industry. Specific food related initiatives are being implemented to improve efficiencies at primary slaughtering and processing levels and to encourage progress along the value-added chain. These initiatives are designed to enhance the innovative, marketing, and human resources capabilities of the industry and their primary goal is to enable the producer to compete successfully in a rapidly changing and evolving marketplace. It is anticipated that this substantial investment will increase sales by &euro;2.5 billion by the end of 2006. At export level, we will continue to assist Irish producers, processors and exporters, in winning new markets world-wide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the beef and lamb sector, the overall strategy for the development of these sectors is to ensure that they achieve their full potential, thereby maximising their contribution to the national economy. This includes action on <Col N="868" /> a range of fronts to address competitiveness at production and processing level and to adopt a comprehensive strategic marketing focus.</P>
      <P>The main marketing focus for beef involves moving up the value chain at EU level through increased penetration at retail level in the UK, increasing exports to other core continental markets, targeting growth in European developing markets and developing niche opportunities. In addition, an important element of the marketing strategy is to broaden the spread of third country markets.</P>
      <P>In the context of broadening markets, improvement in the quality of cattle will be encouraged through the introduction by the processing industry of appropriate price differentials to reward producers for quality production. The introduction of such differentials will be a condition of eligibility for grant-aid for capital investment related to slaughtering capacity. My Department will also progress the introduction of mechanical classification in order to facilitate the introduction of a differentiated pricing structure. Better breeding will also be encouraged through the activities of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, and Teagasc. At the processing stage, the main strategy is to encourage the production of value added products.</P>
      <P>A revision of the sheepmeat regime has seen the introduction of a fixed rate premium, which has helped to underpin returns to producers. Better breeding practices have resulted in an improvement in the quality of sheep production. The national sheep identification and tracing system, NSIS, provides a modern and comprehensive traceability system for the sector. These developments will underpin producer returns and broaden market opportunities.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia, which has primary responsibility for the promotion of beef and lamb, continues to assist the industry in its efforts to seek new markets and maximise returns from existing markets.</P>
      <P>In regard to the developments of the pigmeat industry, a strategic study on the island of Ireland was commissioned jointly by my Northern Ireland counterpart and myself, to access the current state of the industry. The main findings of the report identifies rationalisation of slaughter capacity, scaling-up of plant size and better capacity utilisation as necessary prerequisites to positioning the industry to compete on national and export markets and to bring it into line with international best practice.</P>
      <P>There were other recommendations, such as improving the reliability and consistency of supply to the secondary processing and catering sectors, as well as the development of the value added sector and promotion of supply chain agreements.</P>
      <P>While most of the findings of the study are very much matters within the control of the industry, my Department has been working with the production and processing organisations to further progress the matter, and this initiative is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" />In the case of the cereals sector, my Department operates a range of services aimed at improving efficiency, quality and viability of cereal production, including the seed certification, seed testing, recommended lists of varieties etc. This is apart from the advisory, training, research and development services provided by Teagasc. All of these services provide a valuable contribution to the improvement of efficiency and competitiveness, and have ensured that Irish cereal producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.</P>
    <P>An important part of cereal producers' incomes is represented by the EU arable aid payments. My Department continually strives to ensure that these payments are issued promptly, and we have now reached the stage that over 90% of these payments are issued with one week of the commencement date for payment date laid down in EU regulations.</P>
    <P>In order to improve the quality and safety of grain, and to relieve pressure at commercial intake points at harvest time, I made provision under the national development plan, for grants for the development of grain storage on farms.</P>
    <P>These are just some examples which demonstrate the commitment which my Department has and will continue to have, to the development of the cereals sector.</P>
    <P>At production level, I have introduced many changes to the milk quota regime which have been extremely successful in achieving my overall objective of putting milk quota definitively in the hands of committed active producers, at the lowest possible cost. Due largely to these changes, in the last three years alone, about 460 million litres, 105 million gallons, of quota have been redistributed under milk quota restructuring schemes. In addition to improving access to quota, I also addressed the issue of cost of quota and the need to allow all producers the opportunity to develop their business. The maximum price of milk quota has been reduced by almost 30% since 1999, and is now at a level that is attractive to those considering leaving production and affordable and economically viable for those who wish to expand. In combination with a lower price, it has been possible to significantly reduce the real cost of restructured quota to producers, by the introduction, through the agreement by my colleague the Minister for Finance, on tax concessions on the purchase of quota.</P>
    <P>The benefits of this policy are already evident in the structure of the industry and it is my intention to continue this in order to further improve that structure and to allow the industry to remain competitive into the future.</P>
    <P>At the processing level, I have commissioned a study of that sector, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the industry. The overall aim of the study is to contribute to a coherent strategic development plan for the sector, which will make recommendations on actions to improve efficiency and long-term competitiveness. The study will focus on examining the <Col N="870" /> existing structure of the dairy processing industry, the market opportunities for dairy products and the product options to exploit these opportunities.</P>
    <P>The dairy study will be completed shortly and I expect that it will contribute to the development of the type of dairy industry that can continue to grow and expand in the face of increased international competition.</P>

      <P>The Commission's detailed proposals for the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 were published on 22 January and presented by Commissioner Fischler to the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers on 27 January. At that meeting, ministers gave their preliminary responses to the proposals.</P>
      <P>The details of the proposals are now being examined in various committees in Brussels and discussions will continue at official level and in the Council of Ministers over the coming months. The Greek Presidency has indicated its intention to reach decisions on the proposals at the June meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.</P>
      <P>I have outlined my concerns and made my overall opposition to these proposals clear at the January Council meeting. I told the Council that significant reform was not necessary at this time and would put pressure on the EU budget; the timing of such reform in the absence of further progress in the WTO round of negotiations was questionable; and the specific proposals were not in accordance with stated EU policy objectives in relation to the European model of agriculture and they would impact on Ireland disproportionately. My objective in the negotiations is to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 Agreement.</P>

      <P>The milk quota review group is a body comprised of representatives of the dairy industry, the farm organisations, technical experts and the Department. The review group considers various aspects of the operation of the milk quota regime and makes recommendations to me. The group does not issue reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ring-fencing provisions in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations 2000 as amended, apply where milk quota is attached to land in a less favoured area that is transferred by sale, lease, or gift. They require that the milk produced in respect of that quota be produced on the lands that have been transferred or other <Col N="873" /> lands within 48km of those lands. As regards a producer who wishes to transfer his-her milk quota to a different dairy-co-operative, he-she may do so provided he-she satisfies the normal transfer conditions that is, notification of the transfer is given in accordance with time limits and he-she commences deliveries to the new co-op. I am not considering removing the ring fencing provisions.</P>
    <P>The schemes for the transfer of quota on a permanent or temporary basis, that is, the milk quota restructuring scheme and the temporary leasing scheme, set out which type of producer has priority in the allocation of the available quota. However, the amount of quota allocated under a particular scheme is determined by the quantity available in the same collection area and, if sufficient quota is available, then all producers who apply, regardless of quota size, have access to additional quota.</P>

    <P>A total of &euro;307,519 was also paid in this area during 2002, which it is not possible to break down in the manner requested by the Deputy. The vast bulk of this relates to promotional material for the e-tenders website for the Department and, for the ECBI, advertising agency fees and production costs and public relations services. My Department produced one video as part of the performance management and development system training during 2002. The cost of this was &euro;219.14. In my Department, dealings with the media are primarily the responsibility of the press and information office. The office is staffed by four people. Salary payments to the incumbents in 2002 totalled &euro;171,304.92.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes is unable to re-issue the C2 certificate because of taxpayer's unsatisfactory tax compliance record. In addition to various returns that are outstanding, the taxpayer has an unpaid VAT liability for January and February 2001 and an unpaid income tax liability for the year ended 31 December 2001. The inspector wrote to the taxpayer and his agent on 5 February 2003 to explain what the taxpayer needs to do to bring his tax affairs up to date. The inspector cannot consider re-issuing the taxpayer's C2 certificate until such time as the taxpayer is fully tax compliant.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on media advertising for 2002 was &euro;251,605.51. This can be broken down as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) Expenditure under the general advertising subhead of Vote 38 of &euro;61,543.04 and expenditure of &euro;20,411.00 from the Passport Office subhead. Expenditure under these subheads includes advertisements such as the Department's opening hours over the Christmas period, advertising of employment opportunities, e.g. legal trainees in our legal <Col N="876" /> division, and the advertising of conferences. It is not possible, in the time frame given, to provide the Deputy with a breakdown of each item of expenditure.</P>
    <P>(ii) A total of &euro;18,336.92 relating to advertisements in the national newspapers advising the public of the availability of the revised White Paper on the Treaty of Nice and Seville Declarations in 2002, following publication in July 2002.</P>
    <P>(iii) A total of &euro;18,373.77 relating to advertisements in the national newspapers advising the public of the availability of the summary information guide on the Treaty of Nice and Seville Declarations in 2002, during October 2002.</P>
    <P>(iv) A total of &euro;132,940.78 relating to the design and production of a television and print advertising campaign for World AIDS Day 2002, as well as the purchase of space on TV networks RTE, UTV, Channel 4, E4, Sky, and TG4 and national newspapers &ndash;<i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>Irish Independent</i>, <i>The Star</i>, <i>Irish Examiner</i>, <i>Evening Herald</i>, <i>Evening Echo</i>, <i>Sunday Independent</i>, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, <i>Sunday World</i>, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> and <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also wish to be aware that the following media-related expenditure took place during 2002. The Communicating Europe Initiative, CEI, funds a range of projects and activities aimed at increasing public awareness about the European Union and Ireland's interaction with it. The CEI allocated a total of &euro;43,782.52 for two series of the &ldquo;Eurofile&rdquo; television programme. The programmes featured news and information about developments in the European Union and in the National Forum on Europe. The first series of &ldquo;Eurofile&rdquo; aired from February to May 2002 and was transmitted on City TV Dublin, Meath Province 5 Television and on the EBS satellite system. The second series of &ldquo;Eurofile&rdquo;, which was aired in autumn 2002, was transmitted on TG4. Also, Ireland Aid has contributed for a number of years to the operation costs of the &ldquo;Worlds Apart&rdquo; series on RTE Radio 1. In 2002 this contribution was &euro;47,000.</P>
    <P>Apart from the projects referred to above, there was no expenditure on promotional, educational or advertising videos. While there are no staff employed solely for public relations work, the Department's press section is its primary interface with the public and media. There are five permanent civil servants working in the press section and an information officer employed on a contract basis in the Department's development co-operation directorate. The salary costs for these officials during 2002 were &euro;243,933.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of student support provisions is under way, with the aim of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised in accordance with the following terms of <Col N="878" /> reference: to review the present system of tuition fees and student supports, having regard to international experience, in order to provide options for the Minister's consideration with a view to ensuring greater equity in access to and participation in higher education.</P>
    <P>This review will cover a broad range of topics relating to the schemes of student support including the level of maintenance grants, eligibility, income limits with respect to the grants and the free fees initiative and will consider various options taking into account international experiences in this field, including the issue of loans. Officials of my Department are conducting the review. However, some issues require the engagement of external expertise. In this regard, the Economic and Social Research Institute is undertaking work on a number of issues relevant to the review. Relevant recently published reports will also inform the work of the review group. It is hoped that the review will be completed in time to give sufficient notice of decisions which will affect students intending to enter third level education in the 2003-04 academic year. The provision of free medical care for third level students is a matter appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>

      <P>My Department does not provide direct financial assistance for the provision of student accommodation. In recognition of the difficulties students can experience in obtaining accommodation and following consultation with third level colleges, a special tax incentive was introduced to encourage the provision of dedicated student residential accommodation in section 50 of the Finance Act 1999. The tax incentive is available for expenditure up to 31 December 2004 where an application for planning permission is received by a planning authority by 30 September 2003. Therefore the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. The rent-a-room relief scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2001. It allows homeowners to rent out a room in their homes and have rental income up to &euro;7,620 a year tax-free. The scheme encourages householders to rent rooms to students.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 136 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review to which the Deputy refers covered a total of 788 applications from schools for resource teacher or special needs assistant support. The applications in question involved a total of 1,590 individual pupils in respect of whom support was sought. Of the 1,590 pupils involved, the review concluded that the applications in respect of 948, 60%, of these pupils conformed with departmental circulars and the resources sought in these cases have been sanctioned. In the remaining cases, where resource allocations were recommended by the national educational <Col N="881" /> psychological service as a result of the review, the resources in question have been sanctioned.</P>
    <P>The procedures schools are required to follow in applying for the supports in question involve the completion of a standard application form in respect of each individual child and a summary application form covering all the children included in the school's application. The individual pupil form requires particulars of the child's name, address, age, category of disability under Circular 8/2002 and the nature and level of the supports being sought in respect of the child. The summary application form requires particulars of the overall number of pupils in respect of whom support is sought, the total supports being sought in respect of those pupils and the total resources already sanctioned at the school to address special needs. Where an application seeks the allocation of resources on a shared basis with other schools, particulars of those schools is sought.</P>
    <P>The summary application form contains a declaration by the school principal confirming that the application has been discussed with the parents or guardians of the children and that their consent has been obtained to apply for the support being sought; that the application is supported by the chairperson of the school's board of management; that in making the application, full regard has been given to any support services already allocated to the school; that the application is based on relevant assessment reports presented in respect of the pupils in question and available for inspection by the Department; and that where a shared post arrangement is proposed, the authorities of the other participating schools are in agreement with the proposal.</P>
    <P>The main deficiencies identified in the NEPS review related to situations where the level of support sought in respect of individual pupils in a particular disability category did not conform to the support levels identified in the circulars as applicable to the disability category in question and situations where the relevant assessment reports required to support the application were not available at the school for inspection by NEPS. Deficiencies were identified in 642 cases. Where possible in such cases, NEPS made a recommendation as to the nature and level of the resources which should be provided and such resources have been sanctioned. However, in some cases, e.g. where the school was unable to produce the relevant assessment report, no recommendation for resources could be made.</P>

      <P>The 2003 capital programme has been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. In the light of contractual commitments carried over from 2002 it was only possible to allow 14 major projects to proceed to construction in 2003. The proposed new community school at Youghal, County Cork is at an advanced stage of architectural planning &ndash; pre-tender stage &ndash; and is listed on section 6 of the capital programme. When the new school project at Youghal can progress to tender and construction is dependent on the funding allocation in 2004 and subsequent years. In the meantime, the building unit of my Department has funded essential repairs to the roofs of the existing schools. Funding has also been allocated in the 2003 capital programme for essential improvement works to the mechanical and electrical systems to allay any health and safety concerns. This work will be carried out as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department's Estimates for 2003 include provision of &euro;13,785,000 for the general running costs of the National Educational Psychological Service. The work of NEPS psychologists includes the assessment of children for whom extra resources may be necessary to meet their special needs. The funding for NEPS includes provision for the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. This enables schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service to commission assessments from private practitioners.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure equitable access to the available funding, schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service may initially commission the number of assessments indicated in the attached table. If a school has used its allocation and feels that there is another child who is genuinely in need of assessment, then the principal may apply in writing to NEPS outlining the case for the assessment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 to 142, inclusive, and No. 144 together.</P>
      <P>Provision for children of pre-school age with autistic spectrum disorders is generally made available through the relevant health authority. My Department's involvement in provision for such children is currently confined to a small number of special pre-school class units attached to primary schools. The task force on autism has put forward a range of important recommendations ranging from the identification of prevalence rates and arranging early intervention, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the central role of parents, the required models of educational and health care inputs and the need for specialist training for service providers to structural, constitutional and policy issues.</P>
      <P>The scope of the measures proposed by the task force, including its recommendations in relation to early childhood support services, is such as to require a multi-faceted response involving education and health service inputs. To date, the focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with disabilities, including children of pre-school age with autistic spectrum disorders.</P>
      <P>A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to establish the National Council for Special Education. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children of pre-school age with autistic spectrum disorders. The council will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. The council will employ special needs organisers who will be accessible at local level and will be responsible for ensuring an efficient and effective response to persons with special educational needs, including children of pre-school age with autistic spectrum disorders. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are well advanced. A chief executive officer designate has been appointed and an order to establish the council formally will shortly be brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also my intention to bring forward legislation at an early date to address the rights and entitlements of persons with special needs, including children of pre-school age with autistic spectrum disorders. The Bill, which will be based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, will provide a clear and enforceable statement of the rights of children and adults who, because of a disability, including children of pre-school age with autistic spectrum disorders, have special educational needs, and will propose <Col N="887" /> a structure to guarantee their education. This legislation will include specific proposals to address the educational and other support service needs of children of pre-school age with special needs including autistic spectrum disorders and will put in place specific arrangements aimed at ensuring that the educational needs of such children are identified and addressed at the earliest possible date. My Department has recently completed a comprehensive range of consultations on the Bill with interested parties and it is my intention to seek to secure passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>In terms of early childhood education services, the developments taking place on the structural and legislative front will be complimented by the work of the Centre for Early Childhood Education which was established in 2002 at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra. This centre will have an important role to play in the development of a national quality framework for early childhood education services, including services for children with autistic spectrum disorders, and will work closely with the National Council for Special Education in this area.</P>

      <P>Teachers in pre-school classrooms for children with autism have access to the relevant training programmes, which are supported by the in-career development unit of my Department. The training in question is designed to enhance the skills of teachers of children with autism of all ages, including those children benefiting from early intervention initiatives. This training also addresses the matter of appropriate and defined intervention programmes as well as the process of evaluating the progress made by each individual child.</P>

      <P>Smoking is prohibited on all public service vehicles owned or operated by Dublin Bus. Under Dublin Bus by-laws authorised persons, <Col N="890" /> including inspectors, drivers and conductors, have powers to enforce regulations in this area. I am advised that Dublin Bus currently operates plain clothes monitoring to detect breaches of smoking by-laws on its services. In 2002 this operation resulted in 80 prosecutions with fines ranging from &euro;50 to &euro;240. In a number of cases the Probation Act was applied.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus proposes to continue with this type of covert monitoring operation this year. To date legal proceedings against 27 individuals have been initiated. This approach is a very positive one and deserves our full support. It is in everyone's interest that the prohibition on smoking on bus services is observed and enforced to ensure protection of passengers and Dublin Bus personnel from the harmful effects of toxic environmental tobacco smoke.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with dyspraxia is a matter for the ERHA and the health boards in the first instance. Health boards provide a range of support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible within the community. This includes residential respite care, day care, home support, including personal assistance ser<Col N="893" /> vices, nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also provided.</P>
      <P>Significant additional funding in the region of &euro;180 million has been provided by this Government since 1997. This level of funding is indicative of the Government's ongoing commitment to the provision of quality services and includes: over &euro;36 million for aids and appliances; &euro;60 million ongoing funding for the development of services, including residential, respite, home support and personal assistance and therapy services; just under &euro;35 million for capital projects; and a significant proportion of the remainder allocated in support of voluntary sector service providers.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector service providers is compiling the national physical and sensory disability database. When complete the database will provide the following: at local level, a detailed picture of each individual's health service requirements over a five year period; and at national level, detailed statistical information to assist in the acquisition of funds and identify priority services at which to target these resources.</P>
      <P>The database will be an essential tool in the delivery of effective services to people with physical and sensory disabilities in a planned and co-ordinated manner.</P>

      <P>RASA has sought enhanced pensions for pensioners of the Irish airlines general employees superannuation scheme. It seeks to bridge the difference between the annual consumer price index related increases awarded by the trustees of the scheme to the pensioners and salary movements.</P>
      <P>Pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, are matters primarily for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the company involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both companies have been meeting all of their liabilities towards the pension fund in accordance with the rules of the scheme. Neither Aer Lingus nor Aer Rianta is in a position to provide <Col N="895" /> additional payments into the pension fund to meet the claim by RASA.</P>
    <P>In response to representations, the case made by the association was forwarded in July 2001 by my predecessor, Senator Mary O'Rourke, for consideration to the Minister for Finance who has overall responsibility for pension matters in the public sector. The contents of his reply were communicated to RASA in October 2001.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance advised that it would not be appropriate to accede to the request from the association for an injection into the pension fund. He said there must be continued adherence to the longstanding policy in this area and that pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, are matters primarily for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the companies involved.</P>
    <P>There has been no obvious solution to this matter despite detailed examination over the past number of years. I have asked Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to keep the situation under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 2003 final Estimates, when published, will show a provision of &euro;50 million for Garda overtime. This represents a 16% reduction on the 2002 budget allocation. Part of the 2002 figure reflected a carryover of overtime payments in respect of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001. The reduction in the overtime budget reflects a general budgetary policy aimed at securing increased efficiencies in the deployment of Garda resources. I have discussed the management of the overtime budget with the Commissioner and he has put in place financial controls at all levels within the Garda Síochána with a view to obtaining efficiencies and value for money in the use of overtime. Strict monthly profiling of overtime expenditure is now in place.</P>
      <P>The current strength of all ranks of The Garda Síochána as at 10 February is 11,849. In April 2000 the Government agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, to a system of delegated authority under which recruitment is carried out to maintain the strength of the force at an agreed level. Last April the Government agreed to increase the approved strength of the force by 200 to 12,200.</P>
      <P>My position on the increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána is already well known. I refer the Deputy to my detailed reply in this matter to oral Question No. 2 of 6 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the issue of gardaí being available for frontline duties on the street, I have initiated, <Col N="898" /> in consultation with the commissioner, a review of deployment with the purpose of having as many existing tasks as possible performed by civilian employees and contractors. I hope to make a further statement on the outcome of this review in the coming months.</P>

      <P>As I have previously explained, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order 1925.</P>
      <P>Their function is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by prisoners. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committees has free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons the committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities. They also submit annual reports to me which are, subject to certain restrictions on the release of information of a personal nature, released to individuals who request them directly from my Department.</P>
      <P>In regard to the number of abuses reported by the prison visiting committees during the term of office of my predecessor, allegations of abuse made by a prisoner were examined by the Limerick prison visiting committee in May 2000. The conclusions of the committee were then referred to my Department. The matter was further investigated by an official of this Department and a response to the committee was issued in July 2000 on my predecessor's behalf.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have any direct function, or compile systematic information, in this matter. Its primary role in the area of recycling is to develop and put in place the necessary policy and legislative framework to facilitate a sustained expansion in national recycling performance across all waste streams.</P>
      <P>Subject to this position, some current facilities and uses in Ireland in relation to glass recycling as known to my Department are as follows: Rehab Recycling Partnership operates a glass cullet production plant in Ballymount, County Dublin, where most container glass, bottles and jars, collected for recycling in Ireland is pre-processed into crushed cullet. There are also a few smaller glass crushing plants in operation around the country. Following the closure of the Irish Glass Bottle plant in Ringsend last year most crushed and uncrushed cullet processed in Ireland is now transported to a facility in Northern Ireland for use in the manufacture of new glass containers, a small volume of which is transported to glass reprocessors in Britain.</P>
      <P>Glass cullet is also being increasingly recycled in road construction projects as bituminous road base aggregate. Such cullet is generally either surplus green cullet, for which it is difficult to obtain markets in Ireland, or cullet reject, that is colour contaminated or contaminated with ceramics.</P>

      <P>To qualify for payment under the <Col N="903" /> farm assist scheme a person must satisfy the conditions as to means. When calculating the means of a claimant a deciding officer takes into account all income enjoyed by the claimant.

      <P>The person concerned claimed farm assist from 7 April 1999 and was in receipt of payment at the weekly rate of &euro;111.80 up until 7 May 2002. This was the maximum rate of &euro;118.80 payable for himself less means of &euro;7 derived from farm income.</P>
      <P>A routine review of his means was carried out in April 2002. Following this review his means were determined at &euro;94 per week and his weekly payment was reduced to &euro;24.80.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the dental benefit scheme treatments are provided to insured persons, with limited exceptions, either free of charge or at a reduced fee. My Department pays the balance of the cost directly to the dentist at the agreed rates specified in a contractual agreement with dentists. To benefit under the scheme an insured worker must be treated by a dentist who has entered into and is operating under such an agreement with my Department. The scheme continues to operate and dental treatment is being provided by dentists who are adhering to the contractual arrangements into which they entered.</P>
      <P>A person who is treated by a dentist who is not currently participating in the scheme is not entitled to benefit under these arrangements and any costs incurred cannot be refunded under the scheme. This was made clear from the outset of the current dispute with the Irish Dental Association through newspaper advertisements which advised workers to check that their dentist was continuing to operate within his contract with the Department and, where appropriate, to contract my Department's Locall telephone service at 1890400400 to get details of dentists adhering to the agreed fees for treatments.</P>
      <P>Detailed proposals aimed at ending the current dispute have been worked out in negotiations over the past two weeks. These are now being considered by the Irish Dental Association.</P>

      <P>The day-to-day administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which provides for the payment of rent supplements is the responsibility of each health board.</P>
      <P>A health board must satisfy itself that a bona fide tenancy exists in respect of a property for which a rent supplement is sought. The means by which it discharges this obligation is primarily the responsibility of the health board but I am satisfied that it would not be possible to do this effectively without contact with the landlord.</P>
      <P>The first step in verifying the tenancy is the completion of the appropriate application forms on which the applicant supplies details of the household composition and means. The landlord must confirm details relating to the address, type of accommodation and the amount of rent being paid.                </P>
      <P>In addition to the application forms other documents, such as rent books-receipts or a copy of the lease agreement, may be requested by the health board. It is a matter for the health board to decide on the level of documentation it requires for the purpose of verifying the tenancy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the process currently used by the health boards, including those in the ERHA, to verify tenancies for the purpose of rent supplement is reasonable.</P>
