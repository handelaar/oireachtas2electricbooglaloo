      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, comprises the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. Legislation underpinning the establishment of NESDO was published in April 2002 and when enacted will place the three bodies on a statutory basis as part of the office. The primary role of NESDO is to add value to the work of its constituent bodies by creating the conditions under which synergies can be released, joint projects pursued and the potential for duplication minimised.</P>
      <P>The office promotes the development of a shared vision for realising these goals and encouraging the constituent bodies to maximise their impact through collaborative policy development initiatives. In particular, it performs its role by facilitating and promoting complementary programmes of research, analysis and discussion in the NESC, NESF and NCPP, providing shared administration and support services for the three constituent bodies and submitting to Government reports, recommendations or conclusions by a constituent body and arranging for their publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect legislation to create this office to be introduced? Will the office manage the new partnership deal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation will be passed as soon as the House and the Whips can agree to do so. To date, however, it has been working on a non-statutory basis and this has not resulted in <Col N="906" /> any great difficulty; it does not affect its work in any way. The organisation was set up on a non-statutory basis some time ago. All the constituent organisations have since moved into one headquarters for administrative and other purposes.</P>
      <P>It will not be the function of the office to look after the partnership. The NESC plays a role in providing a strategic report every three years on what it sees as the key issues for the State to deal with. An overview of the NESC strategy, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise, was published in November. That is their role in it. The priority of NESDO for the coming year is to promote complementary programmes of research, analysis and discussion by the three bodies. It will continue to provide shared administrative and support services. It will report on various initiatives. The NCPP, the newest of the three bodies, is compiling a number of reports on how partnership would work in the private sector. It has done a considerable amount of work and will produce a number of reports during the course of the year on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the extent of the cutback in funding for the NESC this year? Does the Taoiseach not consider that the cutback will seriously hamper its work in developing this new programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the benefits of the three organisations joining together, using a single administration and sharing the overheads is that it will create a saving in 2003. The total estimate for the constituent bodies of NESDO in 2003 is &euro;2.8 million, a saving of 8.6%. The corresponding figure for last year was &euro;3.078 million. There has been a saving over the period but that is due to the administration. It does not affect the staff. The staffing rate of the organisations is still the same, except in administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>How will this body function? What is the top tier of management? Will there be a director and a number of deputy directors and will they report to a board? Will the board be located in the Taoiseach's Department? Is the body under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisations are independent and have their own boards. The NCPP has nine staff: one executive chairperson, one director, five national co-ordinators, one executive secretary and one executive officer. The overall number of staff is a little larger. There are, effectively, two people with NESDO. The director is also the director of NESC. There are eight and a half staff with NESC, seven with NESF and nine with NCPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an independent board and a research group that works for the organisations. The board comprises members of the social partners and independent personnel. Mr. Peter Cassels is the executive chairperson for the national centre for <Col N="907" /> partnership. There are four employers' representatives, four union representatives, three people representing my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, an assistant secretary from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and four academic members who represent the business schools and other areas where partnership is part of the academic studies.</P>
    <P>They are linked into 23 outside organisations who have a base or an interest in developing partnership within the private sector. They are combined into a national research panel which advises the centre on a wide range of research programmes. Second, a network of strategic alliance partners has been established to co-ordinate the efforts of key agencies and Departments at national level and to bring about radical change and improved performance in organisations in the private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>The centre's strategy sets out a framework within which the centre will work in collaboration with many organisations. It has a small staff. It will develop this work from its previous incarnation when it worked as a partnership body within my Department under the last&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has its own subhead but my Department is accountable for it, as it was for the old NESF. When they amalgamated, they had their own subhead and accounting officer. They are not using any of the offices they previously used in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been a member of the NESC for a number of years, I would like the Taoiseach to outline where he thinks the synergy justifies the cuts already announced in the Book of Estimates in relation to the NESC. It seems NESC is in operation&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate for a Deputy to point out. The Deputy should ask a question for the Taoiseach to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the NESC has a staff of a director, three researchers and three secretaries, how can cuts be possibly justified at a time when economic intelligence has never been more necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply to Deputy Kenny, the staff is 25.5 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the figure for the NESC.</P>

    <Col N="908" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for the NESC is 8.5 people. The only savings achieved by bringing the three organisations together are that they do not have to rent separate offices &ndash; although the people who were in my Department were obviously not paying rent &ndash; and overheads are lower because they are using the same administrative staff. There have been no other savings &ndash; they have just used their facilities in a more effective way.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the role and function of the communications unit in his Department; the projected cost of the unit in 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3774/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total projected cost in 2003 for the communications unit in my Department will be &euro;273,471, excluding any subsequent benchmarking award. The total cost for 2002 was &euro;256,335. Some &euro;108,941 of the 2003 figure and &euro;97,218 of the 2002 figure is a direct cost to my Department with the remainder being borne by the five other Departments who have staff seconded to the unit at an average cost of &euro;32,906 each in 2003 and &euro;31,827 each in 2002.</P>
      <P>The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public. The communications unit works an 18 hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments. The work of the unit means Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensure they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. It is conservatively estimated that, in a full year, the communications unit saves Departments approximately &euro;175,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Departments have ceased the practice of paying commercial agencies for the production of transcripts? What was the overall expenditure on media relations, photographic services and advertising for 2001? Figures given last year seem to indicate that, in the Taoiseach's Department, <Col N="909" /> some &euro;30,940 was spent on photographic services even though the Taoiseach is well enough known around the country. Any time this question is raised, the Taoiseach is at pains to point out that this saves money and is good value. Will the Taoiseach comment on those points?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, the contract arrangements in place for all Departments for using outside services has ceased. They may seek transcripts or tapes of programmes on some occasions that would not be covered. The communications unit covers a range of programmes and media outlets, but not all of them. That practice saves a substantial amount of money.</P>
      <P>I gave information in response to questions on photographic services last week to a Deputy. I am not sure what the amount involved covered. I do not believe it covered the taking of photographs of me as enough people already do that. I have not followed the practice of some sporting organisations of charging for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach has done so for everything else, he will probably consider doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what other photographs were covered. If the Deputy wants that information, I am sure I could find that out for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made a remark last week that he would much prefer to watch young lads play football than read about such coverage in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>My addition may not be absolutely correct, but it seems that, excluding advertising, the cost of media relations and photographic services for all Departments amounted to more than &euro;9 million in 2001, which seems an extraordinary figure. Given that we are living in uncertain economic times, perhaps the projection of Government and Government faces should be seriously examined. If we are to lead by example, then example should be given from the top down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully that we should get the best value for money. Another Fine Gael Deputy tabled a question to me regarding the full cost of all advertising in the national media &ndash; whether on RTE, TV3, local radio or local newspapers &ndash; for my Department. The cost involved is approximately &euro;280,000. I checked this morning to ascertain how that amount of money could have been spent in this area. I noted that approximately &euro;240,000 was spent on the Forum for Europe. When the cost of some of the statutory advertisements is excluded, there is almost nothing left. Deputy Kenny should check the details of some of the figures and he would realise <Col N="910" /> that the cost involved is not as excessive as might be thought from merely noting the global figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Chair's practice is to call those Members who have tabled a question first.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach outline what role, if any, the communications unit in his Department has in relation to the important area of the North of Ireland and the peace process? Are staff in the unit tasked specifically with addressing this important aspect of the Taoiseach's work? Does the unit address the regularly repeated erroneous reports that appear in the media in relation to these important areas? Can the Taoiseach clarify whether the communications unit also addresses the British media or if that is a function of the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Government press office? What are the lines of demarcation in that area?</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, the Taoiseach referred to a question in relation to photographs. There was a significant increase in the expenditure on photographs last year as against 2001. Was that increase due to the Taoiseach having become more photogenic or was it due to the fact that there was a general election in 2002? The Taoiseach might share that information with the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's second question, my Department and my good accounting officers would not allow any expenditure that would in any way promote the political system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount should have been less because I would have been in my Department less often than I have been there this year or in a normal year.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's first question, the communications unit has no function whatsoever in either commenting on or having any influence over any of the media. It merely reports what the media are saying, and it provides that service not only for Ministers but for a large number of agencies across Government. The Government press secretariat deals with both the international and domestic press, and the communications unit has no such function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that expenditure on this kind of presentation to the media is out of hand. What exactly are 11 staff <Col N="911" /> doing in communicating to the media from the Taoiseach's office? What is this business of providing a service to Ministers? According to an article in <i>Ireland on Sunday,</i> the Tánaiste has five media staff in her office. According to the article, every Minister&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>What service does the Taoiseach's office provide to Ministers who, according to the <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> article, were staffed to the astonishing tune of &euro;20 million in 2002? That is &euro;20 million to spin the Government's line to the public, including &euro;250,000 on photographs alone. How can that be justified? Most people outside the House do not understand that most front benchers in this House operate on a man-and-a-dog basis. They have no back-up, aside from a poorly paid secretary. That is the entire back-up for front bench spokespersons in this House. How can the Taoiseach justify the imbalance between the resources he allocates to the Executive and the resources that are allocated to the Opposition? </P>
      <P>Commitments entered into by the Government and, expressly, by the Minister for Finance, in terms of providing an element of research back-up for the Opposition have essentially been reneged upon. We will now start from a baseline&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to Deputies Boylan and Kenny, whom I ruled out of order for making statements, the same Standing Order must be applied to every Member of the House, and I ask Deputy Rabbitte to confine himself to asking a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as it should be. I agree with you, a Cheann Comhairle. I ask the Taoiseach whether it is untenable to continue to run Dáil Éireann by allocating huge resources to the Government side of the House to spin the Government's position while leaving people on this side of the House dependent on a secretary who also has to support the TD in his or her public representative role of serving a constituency. Is it not the case that every Minister has a staff of approximately five or six people in his or her constituency office? This is not acceptable and cannot go on. As Deputy Kenny said&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a staff of six in the communications unit and it is a Civil Service function, as I have pointed out many times in this House. Its role is not to spin on behalf of the Government &ndash; if anything, it gives the media spin to the Government. It reports what the media are saying on various issues, so the Government is not spending enormous amounts <Col N="912" /> of money on putting out its own message. If one follows the logic put forward by Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny, this is a useful service.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputy Rabbitte worked in the Department he talks about and he knows that the five people in that Department constitute the press office of the Department. It is not correct to portray the press office of any Department as serving the individual Minister of that Department&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy does not know. The Deputy talked about the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Members of the press and others who wish to seek information about that Department contact the Department. That is how they work, and the Deputy knows that is true because that is the way it worked when he was in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>In my question to the Taoiseach I highlighted the erroneous reports on the peace process and asked whether the communications unit highlighted the media spin and brought it to his and his colleague's attention. The Taoiseach said the unit had &ldquo;no function whatsoever&rdquo; in this regard. His subsequent answers clearly indicate that it has a function. I presume the communications unit does not ignore all matters on the North of Ireland and the peace process. It must have some function. Will the Taoiseach revisit the answer he gave me in the first instance and address what the communications unit does about erroneous reports? What steps, if any, has he put in place in his Department to address the continual negative and inaccurate spin that is often applied by sections of the media hostile towards the vision of the Good Friday Agreement? Does the communications unit in the Department of the Taoiseach look at and address the detail in this area in the British media?</P>
      <P>If we are not all to get the staff required to address the problems highlighted by Deputy Rabbitte and others, why does the Taoiseach not share with the parties and the Technical Group the information the communications unit provides?

Why can Ministers not spin the media to themselves? They have personal spindoctors at considerable expense to the State. Why is an office in the Department of the Taoiseach needed to tell Ministers' spindoctors what the media is spinning on a given morning? Why can the spindoctors not do it? I fail to understand the point of the exercise. When multiplied by 15 for Ministers and 17 for Ministers of State, it is costing the taxpayers a fortune.</P>

      <P>The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts to ensure Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant new developments. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public. They operate for 18 hours per day on three working shifts. As the Deputy knows, this is not what happens in other Departments, where there is not such a range of people. If the Deputy really wants it, I can give him details of how many people were engaged as advisers and in media services five years ago, compared with now.

      <P>Given that the Taoiseach referred to the advice of the media on Government performance, how does this communications unit operate? Do the media come to the communications unit for advice or to give advice? How often does that happen? Does the communications unit go to the media to offer advice or to look for inspiration? How often does that happen, if at all? At these times of financial revision and restriction, does the Taoiseach consider that the funding of the communications unit and the various departmental communications units might be better spent on the schools building programme, services for people with disabilities or a host of other areas that are crying out for financial input at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those working in the communications unit do not go talking to anybody. They take what is in the national and some of the local media and portray the headlines and data as it comes across the airwaves to Ministers, Ministers of State and departmental heads who would not normally be listening to those programmes or are unable to listen to them all at the same time, so that they are up to date with what is happening and are able to respond to matters. They can supply detailed transcripts of interviews and matters of importance, when required. That saves conservatively about &euro;175,000, which was the amount being spent about six years ago. The entire cost at that time is probably now saved by this service.</P>

      <P>During the Cold War, the CIA had listening posts all around the former Soviet Union. Is the communications unit the Taoiseach's personal listening post as far as the Irish media are concerned? Is its function really to see that its Government masters are not in its view slighted or misrepresented by the media? Has it a specific instruction in regard to radio programmes, for example, to immediately alert the Taoiseach or another Department if it feels a Minister has been slighted so that he or she can retaliate quickly?</P>
      <P>Is the communications unit different from the spin doctoring and propaganda unit of the Taoiseach? Is there a division of labour between the listeners on the one hand and those who spin out the Taoiseach's line by making lengthy telephone calls late at night before the Sunday newspapers come out, etc., on the other? Is that a separate unit? Is the Taoiseach's figure of &euro;273,000 for the six staff really a gross underestimate of the cost to his Department of the whole communications business, not just the listening but the spinning as well?</P>

      <P>I have already provided the information the Deputy requested. The communications unit is not involved in activities other than reporting and summarising what has been listed. A detailed summary of newspaper headlines and some 7 a.m. radio news headlines <Col N="917" /> is faxed to the homes of Ministers and Ministers of State each morning and an electronic copy of it is made available to more than 100 users throughout the Departments at 7.30 a.m. The main news bulletins are summarised throughout the day. Summaries of &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, the lunchtime news, the evening and 9 o'clock television news programmes, current affairs programmes, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; are also available.</P>
      <P>The communications unit's role is confined to reporting the media in a more efficient way than would be the case if every Department used separate services, as they did previously. I do not give political direction to the individuals involved, nor do I have to. They merely prepare the report and send it out to 100 individuals across the agencies.</P>

      <P>I totally reject that accusation. The reality is the communications unit takes what is presented in the media every day and reports it. It does not have a political nature. I do not see how reporting what the national media is <Col N="918" /> reporting in a succinct way so that people are informed of what is being said and what is going on is killing off anything. People cannot listen to every programme. Even early in the morning most of the recipients of the report would be attending meetings. They receive an update of what is going on throughout the day.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 204 together.</P>
      <P>The annual competitiveness reports, produced by the National Competitiveness Council, comprehensively survey the competitive position of the Irish economy on the international stage. These reports examine key competitiveness issues, presenting a picture of the unfolding competitive position across the economy.</P>
      <P>The 2002 report confirmed many of Ireland's strengths but the council also highlighted the many challenges we face and the difficult choices which we have to make as we face an uncertain economic environment. It is clear that both the domestic Irish economy and the global economy face difficult times ahead. Given that Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world, it is important that steps are taken to position the economy to maximise the benefits and growth potential from any upturn in the global economy.</P>
      <P>The Government is already taking action to address the deficiencies identified through strengthening competition across the economy and implementing specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas such as insurance, continuing to invest in key infrastructure such as roads and broadband telecommunications and increasing investment in research technology and innovation which will provide the basis for future productivity growth.</P>
      <P>Sustaining competitiveness is a dynamic process and it requires sustained attention and ongoing commitment to achieving progress over a wide spectrum of areas. It has been a key underpinning element in the proposed new social partnership programme. The issues of concern in a competitiveness context, therefore, cover a wide range of issues and are the responsibility not just of Government but of all economic players.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="922" />
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Tánaiste's reply that she has no initiatives to propose which will tackle the rapid deterioration of our economic competitiveness. Does she agree that by deliberately increasing cost pressures the Government is causing job losses directly? Over the past eight months there has been an 18% increase in costs to Irish businesses and households while the Government has binged on an increase of 40% in public expenditure. We have a tax and spend Government and many of our firms are seeking tenders for world-wide business from low cost locations in eastern Europe. Given the national pay talks she has just concluded, will the Tánaiste indicate clearly the initiatives, if any, which are to be taken to improve this country's competitiveness and to ensure the recent trend in job losses will stop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hogan is somewhat ill-informed. The Irish economy is a very open one and 60% of our jobs depend on our export performance. The economy has grown substantially because we have embraced export growth and because we have been attractive to foreign direct investment. That continues to be the case. The Irish economy is doing far better than any of our competitor economies in Europe and the world but the reality is that ours is not a low cost economy. We do not have a low wage economy and I do not want us to return to being a low wage economy. We compete in high value-added activity and if we want high value-added jobs with good salaries and conditions then we must develop our skills base and productivity, which will be based on skills.</P>
      <P>That is why, notwithstanding the relative reductions in public spending, the Government has spent so much on science and innovation, for example. We recently attracted 80 of the top research teams from around the world &ndash; from Japan, the US and other countries &ndash; to carry out research in Ireland. That is an investment in competitiveness and the future. There is no doubt there are pressure points; inflation is a huge pressure point and much of Irish inflation is caused by low interest rates, oil prices and external factors but much of it is also caused by domestic factors. The Government is determined to ensure we introduce competition in areas where we have artificial constraints and there is no competition. I hope we have Deputy Hogan's support in that regard, as I read some worrying things&mdash;</P>

      <P>We were fifth in the league of nations according to the World Economic Forum report on competitiveness in 1996. We are now twenty-fourth. That is an indication of the Tánaiste's failure. When it comes to the Finance Bill will she reverse the decision on the abolition of CGT on roll-over relief which was proposed in the budget? Will she reverse the budget decision on the 1% increase in VAT? Will she devote more resources to State agencies whose funding was cut in the budget, such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA? Will she accelerate publication of some of the reports commissioned by the Competition Authority in order to deal with some of the blockages in the economy? Does she agree that the increase in stamp duty from 6% to 9% for non-residential businesses, which is hitting the commercial sector, is a real slap in the face for those who are innovative? It is doing irreparable damage to improving indigenous job creation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked me to put more money into Enterprise Ireland, among other suggestions. If grants were the answer to our problems we should have had full employment in the 1970s and 1980s, when we were heavily dependent on grants. The reality is that there are pressures, which is why we must be conscious of the wage deal. That focuses on wage moderation and while it is an 18 month deal regarding wages, it is a three year deal for the rest of the programme. That is realistic in the current uncertain environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> We live in uncertain times and notwithstanding the Deputy's comments, the economy continues to perform very well. We are conscious of the pressure points and regarding the 87 indicators examined over the past year, we did better in 24, we were constant in 14 and we worsened in 29. The story is not as black as the Deputy paints it. There are difficulties but they are being tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The breakdown for construction related fatalities reported to the Authority over the past five years is as follows: in 1998 there were 22 fatalities, 19 in 1999, 24 in 2000, 23 in 2001 and in 2002 there were 22. So far in 2003 there has been one construction-related fatality. In addition, the breakdown of non-fatal accidents resulting in more than three days absence from work over the past five years is as follows: in 1998 there were 664 notified non-fatal construction accidents, in 1999 there were 601, in 2000 there were 1,108, in 2001 there were 1,059 and in 2002 there were 1,121. So far in 2003 there have been 14 notified non-fatal construction accidents.</P>
      <P>My officials are currently working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on a weekly basis to progress the new Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Bill which will provide a legislative framework for health and safety for the next decade and beyond.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;if 22 nurses or journalists were killed the House would pay more attention. Does the Minister of State agree with Mr. Tom <Col N="925" /> Beegan, chief executive officer of the Health and Safety Authority, when he says there is a culture of non-compliance throughout the construction industry and that the Department has signally failed to address this? There is a management failure on almost 50% of sites and these deaths are caused by managers and companies in the construction industry. This is deplorable.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows I used to represent my party in this portfolio &ndash; I am substituting for Deputy Howlin today &ndash; and when I did I brought forward a Bill which the Minister refused to introduce for five years. It will have taken at least six or seven years before we finally see some decent legislation. The Minister is prepared to leave it to Mr. Justice Kelly and other decent judges to put gangsters who run construction companies behind bars. The Minister should have taken legislative action; his and his fellow Minister's records are absolutely appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty two deaths on construction sites in 2002 is 22 deaths too many. All of us condemn and are concerned at the level of accidents in the construction sector. Progress, however, has been made in recent years in prevention and awareness measures. A safety, health and welfare at work Bill will be introduced in April of this year. It is complex and extensive and my Department and the Parliamentary Counsel are giving high priority to publishing it as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The construction industry has been notorious in the past for being negligent about safety in the workplace but since the establishment of the Construction Safety Partnership and a range of other initiatives, there is a much better culture of prevention and awareness in the industry. Changes have taken place. There is mandatory safety representation on sites with more than 20 employees and mandatory safety training with registration cards and there are safety officers and defined roles for site safety representatives. These regulations came into effect on 1 January 2002. The FÁS safe pass safety awareness training programme is now training more than 185,000 people in the industry, with 300 tutors in place. The safety representative project has enabled the appointment of safety representatives on all sites.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says and I agree that this is not enough. I have asked the construction industry and ICTU to meet my officials and me to establish why the continuing significant efforts are not yielding better results. I have also asked for new codes of practice to be introduced in certain areas immediately, such as below-ground work, where it is clear building companies and builders are not following the existing codes.</P>
      <P>The HSA is vigorously pursuing through the courts any case where employers or building companies are found to be negligent and we will continue to pursue those cases aggressively. Also, there will be greatly increased fines and jail sentences in the new legislation.</P>

      <Quest>if she will establish an enterprise task force for County Monaghan to develop opportunities and seek alternative industries for vacant plants (details supplied) in view of its spatial hub status and its strategic location in the BMW region.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern and disappointment of the Deputy at the recent loss of jobs in a number of companies in County Monaghan. I recognise that in addition to the impact these closures have on the workers and their families, there is a significant effect on the economic life of the areas involved.</P>
      <P>Where difficulties arise for companies, or where major job losses occur, the full services of the agencies of my Department are available to work closely with the companies involved in addressing the difficulties arising and to provide whatever assistance possible to the workers affected.</P>
      <P>I note that of the four plants identified by the Deputy, three are still operating. In the case of one of these, while there has been a reduction in employment numbers over the past 12 months, I am not aware of any plans to close or to further reduce employment. In the case of the other two companies, in the event of failure to maintain the businesses as going concerns, the facilities will be marketed by the agencies with a view to securing their take-over as manufacturing operations.</P>
      <P>Despite recent setbacks, we can be confident about the future of County Monaghan and its economic development. Job vacancies remain very buoyant, with over 1,200 applications for work permits from employers granted last year and a further 180 work permits sought since 1 January 2003. The county's location within the Objective One region, together with the recent designation of Monaghan town as a hub in the Government's national spatial strategy, leave the county well placed to benefit from future investment inflows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, including the Monaghan County Development Board and county council, as well as other local bodies and interests, in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. Enterprise Ireland is currently facilitating a num<Col N="927" /> ber of new start-up businesses in the prepared consumer foods sector, to be based in the Lough Egish Food Park, and is also working with the furniture industry in the county in relation to design and technology. Also, with IDA support, a company servicing the consumer foods market was recently established in Carrickmacross and employs 60 people. It is anticipated that this number will increase as the company goes into full production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some significant changes since I submitted this question; CPV Limited can now be saved. Is the Tánaiste aware, however, that in recent times County Monaghan has suffered a quadruple whammy? The closure of Monaghan Poultry Products meant the loss of 300 jobs, 99 jobs were lost in CPV in Clones, 60 jobs in Lissadell Towels in Carrickmacross and 60 jobs were lost in Montex Holdings Limited in Monaghan. Yesterday, in neighbouring County Cavan, Teradyne announced that it was removing its operations from the area.</P>
      <P>We are seeing the erosion of long established industries, all of which produced high quality products. In most situations, we exported much of the produce, bringing much needed funds into the State. County Monaghan will slide into a depression unless urgent action is taken by the Tánaiste to set up a task force to seek alternative industries.</P>
      <P>We have been told that balanced regional development is the objective of both the national spatial strategy and the BMW authority. We want to see evidence of that with the establishment of a task force and a hands-on approach. Development must be targeted at County Monaghan. We are aware of Monaghan's newly acquired hub status but this requires both industrial and infrastructural development throughout the country. We are reliant on the indigenous industries of mushroom growing, furniture and shoe manufacture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position in the companies mentioned by the Deputy. The main reason for this is loss of competitiveness in sectors under intense pressure from low wage economies and this is certainly not a low wage economy. Also, to a large extent County Monaghan is heavily dependent on agricultural industry or basic manufacturing.</P>
      <P>The IDA is discussions with CVP Limited about the current situation. Its difficulties arise from extremely difficult market conditions coupled with the build-up over the past four years of compensation claims from employees, currently estimated at &euro;1.5 million. To improve efficiency, CPV initiated a voluntary redundancy programme in November 2002 and 40 people availed of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a task force could solve the problems, I would gladly establish it but it is not that simple. The designation of Monaghan as a hub and its <Col N="928" /> Objective One status will make it more attractive for a better balance of investment than has previously been the case. I hope new investment will be in areas other than agriculture and basic manufacturing, similar to the investment announced in Roscrea this afternoon. We must bring investment from that sector to counties that have not experienced high value added activity. The IDA tells me the pipeline for such investment is good for this year and Monaghan will benefit from that.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste intervene directly, taking a direct hands-on approach in relation to CPV in Clones? There are 99 jobs involved and the company has a full order book. The problem is that the parent company wishes to sell off the company. It is a profitable company and jobs can be saved. I ask the Tánaiste to intervene. This is a rare situation. The only thing holding back the sale is an IDA Ireland grant issued eight years ago, which has about one year to run.</P>

      <P>Yes, there is an outstanding grant of &euro;400,000 from taxpayers' money. Clearly, that is a matter for IDA Ireland and there are legal commitments in that regard. We have to protect such investment in companies but that is not a matter for me. It is for the agency involved to negotiate in relation to those matters. However, in the event that the company cannot be saved, it would be a priority to find an alternative investor. I understand that another party may well be interested in that facility and that will certainly be pursued.</P>

      <Quest>her proposals as to the way in which industry can neutralise the negative impact that carbon taxes and other stealth taxes will have on competitiveness.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed introduction of carbon tax is in response to our international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Taxation is one of a number of measures included in the national climate change strategy, which sets out a framework of mechanisms to help Ireland to meet this international commitment. While the introduction of a general carbon tax from the end of 2004 was signalled by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech last December, I should mention that the tax framework has not yet been developed. The Minister made it clear that given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consul<Col N="929" /> tation with interested parties on the design of the tax. This commitment to consultation is reiterated in the draft social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which states: &ldquo;In keeping with Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the announcement in the budget regarding the development of a general carbon tax, there will be full consultation with the social partners, having regard to the potential implications for jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I expect the Minister for Finance will initiate consultations to develop a framework for the tax shortly. My Department will be fully involved in the development process, where important issues for discussion are likely to include the level at which the tax will be set, the question of exemptions or reductions for companies engaged in other greenhouse gas reduction measures such as emissions trading, negotiated agreements and the question of recycling the tax. In developing the tax framework, a crucial consideration will be minimisation of any impact on competitiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two parts to my question. One part relates to carbon taxes, which I consider extremely important, and the other relates to general stealth taxes currently affecting industry. During questions to the Taoiseach earlier, there was much talk of the Government's communications unit. However, that appears to have failed to get the message across to the Government with regard to the massive loss of jobs throughout the country and the perception by industrialists and business people that the reasons for the downturn are stealth taxes, increased inflation and the general increase in costs which are the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. There have been massive increases in rates and waste disposal taxes&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Concerns both at national and international level about proliferation of dual-use and military goods, as well as associated activities, have increased considerably in recent years. At international level, the concerns have been strongly expressed in the various fora dealing with non-proliferation matters. The 11 September attacks in the US, as well as recent developments in other regions of the world, have inevitably heightened international anxiety in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the increasing focus on the necessity to strengthen strategic export control rules, it is important to ensure that Ireland's export controls are up to the best international standards. In this context, my Department has asked Forfás to undertake a review of our strategic controls systems with a view to recommending how best we can modernise and strengthen them to ensure full <Col N="932" /> compliance with Ireland's international obligations. Economic consultants have been commissioned by Forfás to carry out the review, which has just got under way.</P>
    <P>The review will be undertaken in two phases. Phase one of the exercise will involve the consultants interviewing the main parties who have a role or interest in the area of export controls. The objectives of this phase are to define precisely the study objectives, specify the specific issues to which this gives rise and identify the work that is needed to carry out the subsequent full phase two project. In this regard, it is envisaged that phase two will involve a much wider consultation process. I see no reason the reports submitted under the review should not be made publicly available. Clearly, the issues to be identified and any decisions to be made arising from the review will have to await conclusion of the review.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree with the results of the recent Amnesty International report, appropriately entitled &ldquo;Decoding the Deals&rdquo;? The title is also appropriate for a Department where the Minister has been in office, in coalition with Fianna Fáil, for almost six years. Does the Minister agree that as a result of the Amnesty International report it could be argued that if a company wanted to deliberately set up a system of licensing with a view to specifically frustrating parliamentary scrutiny of these dual use military exports, then Ireland would be the perfect model upon which to place it? While there is some acknowledgement that the report currently under way may be published, may we have a guarantee that it will be, and an indication of the timing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the licensing issue, many countries do not have legislation covering licence production agreements, that is, where a company allows another company to manufacture controlled products under licence. While there are no specific controls in Ireland on licensed production, important activities associated with this issue are subject to control. For example, any transfer of technology related to the manufacture of military items would be subject to national export licence requirements. Similarly, an export of any specifically designed parts or components related to the licensed production of military goods would also be controlled. While there is no reason to believe Irish companies avail of licensed production agreements to avoid our export control system, the previous Minister of State had indicated support in principle for the introduction of controls on licensed production. With regard to the other question the Deputy raised, we have no objection to the report being made publicly available.</P>

The list largely reflects the Wassenaar Arrangements munitions list. The WA is one of a number of international non-proliferation regimes of which Ireland is a member. Any items being exported must get clearance from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and also are subject to criteria set down by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>I understand the liquidation is progressing in an orderly and efficient manner, though it is likely to take some time to complete the process. Unfortunately, efforts by the liquidator to sell all or part of the assets of the company on a going concern basis have been unsuccessful to date.</P>
      <P>The liquidator has also advised me that based on legal advice received he has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements to enhanced redundancy payments. It is estimated that these claims increase the total value of unsecured creditors compared with the statement of affairs produced by the board in November last by more than &euro;60 million, though any dividend payable to the workers concerned will be reduced by the amounts received from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund of &euro;24.5 million provided by the shareholders.

It was a direct decision of the Government. We now realise from the Minister's reply that the information given at the time was largely unsubstantiated, that there is an <Col N="934" /> additional burden of &euro;60 million on the State for unsecured creditors of the company or the employees will pay the price for it &ndash; it is one or the other. What will be the changes to the pay-out to employees arising from what she has just said, where an additional &euro;60 million for unsecured creditors is required?

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the latter questions, as the Deputy will be aware are entirely a legal matter for the liquidator. It is not appropriate for anybody to interfere. It is a matter for the liquidator to decide at the time. We have had many discussions about this.</P>
      <P>The closure of IFI happened because substantial public moneys had been invested over a long period in this company and it still continued to have very serious difficulties. It was not justifiable in the current circumstances to invest more public money, more taxpayers' money, in a company which just could not succeed. Ireland is not unique among European countries in not being able to sustain a fertiliser industry.</P>
      <P>There are no implications for the taxpayers in the contractual arrangements of the workers. They are unsecured creditors. Under the existing agreed arrangement of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment and the statutory payment, they will get on average &euro;50,000 per employee. Depending on what the liquidator realises for the company but based on the best estimate, with the changed circumstances they will get perhaps another &euro;25,000 per employee. However, they will be unsecured creditors like other unsecured creditors and they have to take their position in the queue in that respect.</P>
      <P>The creditors will be paid. Obviously secured creditors will be paid first. The Government and the other shareholder have decided not to look for our money back for the loan we gave the company and that makes available to the liquidator more than &euro;34 million extra towards meeting the liabilities to creditors. I hope they can be paid as quickly as possible but that entirely depends on the speed at which the liquidator can realise resources from the sale of the assets.</P>

    <P>An important component of the Government's strategy on reconciling work and family life and developing family-friendly policies has been the introduction of legislation such as the Parental Leave Act 1998, the Carer's Leave Act 2001 and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001. This legislation, combined with increased maternity and adoptive leave entitlements and the development of child care services, will facilitate greater participation by women. The Government is also committed under the national <Col N="936" /> development plan to meeting the diverse needs of parents and children, including key target groups, by supporting the development of accessible, high-quality child care services.</P>
    <P>A number of agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are also adopting new initiatives designed to facilitate the increased participation of women in the workforce. The IDA has identified six of its existing business parks for the development of child care services, which will benefit both employers and employees and thereby enhance the attractiveness of the IDA parks to international investors. Gateway for Women is a FÁS initiative tailored to meet individual needs and focuses on addressing the concerns of women returnees, such as flexibility of training and accessibility of services. These measures are complemented by the development of child care services, which are the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said a few weeks ago that at least 27,000 women &ndash; out of more than half a million on home duty &ndash; were anxious to return to the work force. Yet I notice that Gateway for Women has only about 1,000 places. Ms Gráinne Healy, chair of the National Women's Council of Ireland, noted recently that the availability of child care places is still a major problem for tens of thousands of women who would like to return to work. Is it not the case that the Minister, along with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has refused yet again to address this seriously?</P>
      <P>We know from documentation that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, wanted to cut the number of places on the community employment scheme to 15,000, but she was overruled. We also know that FÁS fought for at least 22,000 places. We found this out under the Freedom of Information Act before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 112, 127 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Council Regulation No. 1334 of 2000, as amended, provides the legal basis for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology. Dual-use goods are defined as goods which could be used for both civilian and military purposes. <Col N="939" /> The regulation sets out the list of dual-use goods that are subject to export control and is updated regularly to take account of EU member states' obligations as participants in various non-proliferation regimes. It is within this legislative framework that Ireland meets its international obligations to control dual-use items.</P>
    <P>The list of military items subject to export control is set out in orders made under the Control of Exports Act 1983. The list largely reflects the munitions list set out in the Wassenaar Arrangement and the common list of military equipment covered by the EU code of conduct on arms exports. The most recent list is contained in the Control of Exports Order 2000. While Ireland does not have an arms industry in the normal meaning of the term, a small number of companies produce, as part of their product lines, items that are listed in the Control of Exports Order and accordingly are subject to export control. Applications by Irish companies for military export licences are subject to the strictest examination by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs in accordance with the criteria contained in the EU code of conduct. End-use assurances are necessary in respect of all such applications.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to working in all relevant forums towards the establishment and improvement of arrangements for better monitoring of arms brokering activities. Our objective is to devise a clear framework for legitimate brokering activities and to inhibit undesirable activity. EU member states are addressing the problem of control of arms brokering. Discussions have centred on guidelines and procedures for monitoring this activity. Some member states already have national legislation on the subject. It is hoped that an EU common position can be agreed as soon as possible on the agreed guidelines that can be used as the basis for national legislation in the matter. Concerns at national and international level about proliferation of dual-use and military goods, as well as associated activities, have increased considerably in recent years. At international level, the concerns have been strongly expressed in the various forums dealing with non-proliferation matters. The attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, as well as recent developments in other regions of the world, have inevitably heightened international anxiety in this regard.</P>
    <P>Given the increasing focus which is being given to the necessity to strengthen strategic export control rules, it is important to ensure that Ireland's export controls are up to the best international standards. In this context, my Department has asked Forfás to undertake a review of our strategic control systems with a view to recommending how best we can modernise and strengthen them and ensure full compliance with Ireland's international obligations. Economic consultants have been commissioned by Forfás to carry out the review, which has just begun. The <Col N="940" /> review will be undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 of the exercise will involve the consultants interviewing the main parties, including Amnesty International, who have a role or interest in the area of export controls. The objectives of this phase are to define precisely the study objectives, specify the issues to which this gives rise, including the issue of parliamentary scrutiny, and identify the work that is needed to carry out the subsequent full phase 2 project. In this regard it is envisaged that phase two will involve a wider consultation process. Clearly, the issues to be identified and any decisions to be made arising from the review must await the conclusion of the review.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach visited Mexico in January last. Enterprise Ireland welcomed the opportunity to participate in the visit by the Taoiseach as it gave an opportunity to raise the profile of Ireland in Mexico, present a strong platform to develop links to the Mexican market and provided Enterprise Ireland clients with an excellent opportunity to strengthen and deepen their links with actual and potential Mexican customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The companies that participated in the trade mission were chosen to reflect the cross-sectoral opportunities that currently exist in Mexico. A total of 18 representatives from Enterprise Ireland's clients participated in the mission and these engaged in more than 80 meetings with Mexican customers and potential customers. The <Col N="941" /> major sectors represented by Enterprise Ireland's clients on this trade mission were the software, engineering and educational sectors. The mission also included the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Irish Dairy Board, which had their own programmes. During the visit the chief executive of Enterprise Ireland held meetings with the major trade organisations, the Ministry of Economics and the premier bank in Mexico.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult at this early stage to quantify the actual impact of the trade mission in terms of, for example, deals done or partnerships formed, Enterprise Ireland is confident that, in the medium to long-term, client companies will secure significant business in Mexico. A formal review process on the visit is now under way. Based on information currently available to Enterprise Ireland, it can be stated that all the participating client companies are of the view that their participation was well worthwhile for the following two reasons. First, the presence of the Taoiseach gave the mission, its participants and, indeed, Ireland, a high profile in the local Mexican media. Second, as the Enterprise Ireland breakfast was hosted by the Taoiseach, this enabled the companies, through the ambassador's invitations, to attract the presence of senior representatives from their targeted actual and potential customers. More than 200 representatives of Mexican industry attended the breakfast.</P>

Were any mechanisms put in place whereby companies which Enterprise Ireland assists in Silicon Valley in California would be enabled, through the North American free trade agreement, to enter the Mexican market more freely? Will the Minister outline the current state of the export trade to Mexico?</P>

      <P>Enterprise Ireland has closely monitored the opportunities in Mexico over the last number of years and exports are estimated to have been worth approximately &euro;460 million in the past year. That is a threefold increase since 1997. In 2001, the last full year for which information is available, Mexico was our 21st largest export market and Ireland had a trade surplus of almost &euro;310 million with Mexico.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's moment of truth on Iraq has arrived. He will have to remove himself from the traditional comfort zone of the fence. Last week the Taoiseach had difficulty answering a straight question on this issue because, he said, he wanted to wait and see what would happen. Something has happened. The inspectors have made some progress and over 100,000 people in Ireland have marched, as have millions more worldwide. It is time for the Taoiseach to seize the day and declare his position on Iraq. This is a matter of both leadership and democracy, not to mention the primacy and legit<Col N="943" /> imacy of the United Nations. The Taoiseach wants a second resolution and has said as much. He also said he wants to work with the United Nations. We need to hear that again. We also need an answer to one other question. Does the Taoiseach support unilateral action against Iraq in the event of no sanction being given by the United Nations? That question requires an answer of one syllable, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters have moved on a good deal since last week. Our consistent position of support for the United Nations Security Council was extremely useful in yesterday's debate. Kofi Annan's remarks on that yesterday were also clear. We believe, and Deputy Kenny holds the same view, that a united approach within the Security Council is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and, therefore, in achieving what everybody wants, a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</P>
      <P>The members of the European Council took full account of the deep concern of everybody who marched last week. I will report to the House in greater detail later but every EU government is anxious to avoid war. We want the disarmament of Iraq to be achieved through exclusively peaceful means in accordance with Resolution 1441. That is why we are putting so much pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply. In my view, war can still be avoided. Already, Resolution 1441, and the credible threat of force which underpins it, has resulted in progress and perhaps there will be more progress now.</P>
      <P>We will continue to support the Security Council. We have been doing that successfully and determinedly even though we have received criticism for doing so. However, it is the right thing to do and we will continue to do it. We will remain with Kofi Annan and the Security Council on this issue. Let us hope that support gets us what we all want which is full compliance with the 17 resolutions laid before the Security Council and the latest one, which we also support.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Kenny's final point, that matter may arise some day and perhaps it will not. I hope none of these issues arises and that Saddam Hussein is forced into a position where he will comply. I am heartened at this weekend's meeting and statement by Arab leaders and Foreign Ministers. They are due to have another council this week. Last night it was agreed there would be further contact between the European Union and the leadership of the Arab states who will in turn put pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the Taoiseach's line of thought. His reticence in answering is causing confusion regarding the serious consequences referred to in Resolution 1441. If the Taoiseach is opposed to war, in favour of the United Nations and in favour of Saddam Hussein disarming, which we all are, surely it means that if we support the primacy and legitimacy of the <Col N="944" /> United Nations, we should be opposed to unilateral action without UN sanction. This is as much about that legitimacy as it is about anything else. In the event of the United Nations not giving sanction for an invasion of Iraq, what will be the position of the Taoiseach and the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We spent nine hard weeks on the Security Council framing Resolution 1441 &ndash; it was an enormous diplomatic success in which Ireland played a part. In our view, Resolution 1441 means we should do everything we can to avoid conflict and get disarmament and a peaceful resolution, including a military build-up to succeed in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. This man has ignored everything for 12 years. If Resolution 1441 was about trying to put pressure on him, it is working &ndash; Kofi Annan made that clear yesterday &ndash; and that vindicates the position of assisting in that build-up. We will continue to stick with the Security Council.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the largest demonstration of Irish citizens since the PAYE tax marches in 1979 was a spontaneous expression of disappointment at the failure of the Government to represent their views? What did he convey to his fellow European leaders at the summit meeting? What did he say about the French-German initiative for a non-military solution? Does he accept that the remit of the UN mandate is the identification and destruction of weapons of mass destruction and not regime change and that countries which posit regime change as an objective are acting outside the mandate? Will the Taoiseach declare, at a minimum, what Ireland's position is in the event of pre-emptive unilateral action being taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In their contributions yesterday, the French and Germans made it unambiguously clear that their number one position is to see compliance with Resolution 1441 and to see Iraq disarmed. Deputy Rabbitte is correct that Resolution 1441 is not about regime change, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have said several times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remember that Iraq has refused to comply with UN Security Council resolutions for over a decade. In addition to the 17 resolutions tabled to date, Iraq has continued to ignore everything else that has been said. France and Germany said we should call on Iraq to allow the weapons inspectors immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transport, and a strong line was taken on that issue. It was noted <Col N="945" /> by the European Council that six million people marched last weekend and there was a strong desire to seek a peaceful resolution. That will be achieved if Saddam Hussein changes his position, stops ignoring the Security Council, the world order for peace and security, and starts complying in a serious manner. There has been welcome progress but we must see more.</P>
    <P>As Kofi Annan made clear yesterday, if that is not the case, the Security Council will have to face up to its responsibilities. He made that same point on 8 November, 8 December, 20 December 2002 and on various dates in January 2003. This country's strategy is to follow the Security Council and try to force the changes from the Iraqi authorities to comply with Resolution 1441. If they do not, the Security Council will have to face up to its responsibilities and the matter will be discussed then. Ireland is not on the Security Council but Kofi Annan's position is clear. He is not prepared to allow the Iraqi regime ignore what he has been trying to achieve for a dozen years.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has not answered any of my questions. I did not ask him what Kofi Annan's position was. What is the position of the Irish Government in the event of a unilateral strike? Does the Taoiseach accept the UN estimates that there will be 100,000 direct casualties and 400,000 indirect casualties and that 30% of children under five are at risk of death by malnutrition in the event of a strike? Did the Taoiseach tell his EU counterparts the depth of feeling in Dublin last Saturday? Is it not a travesty of the issue that he should send out the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and that the Taoiseach should support him by making outrageously hypocritical and erroneous suggestions to the effect that 100,000 people were on the street in support of Government policy. They were there against Government policy and angry that no policy is being articulated.</P>

We have done our best, including spending time on the Security Council, to support and assist that organisation in bringing a resolution to this matter. We stand totally behind UNSCR <Col N="946" /> 1441 and will give our support to a second resolution although we are not on the Security Council. I will not answer hypothetical questions on matters that may or may not arise.

      <P>On 15 February the world, through every time zone, witnessed an elemental movement of humanity in opposition to the barbarity of what a war on Iraq would mean, and it has obviously left the Taoiseach cold. He came in here today after an historic day, by any barometer in our world, and repeated the same mumbo jumbo he repeated last week and the week before, which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has also dished out to us. Does the Taoiseach agree that a yawning chasm divides the great bulk of the ordinary people of Europe from much of the political elite in Europe? Does he agree that in this State, in particular, a huge chasm divides the views of the ordinary citizens and those of the Taoiseach and his Government? In continuing to afford US military facilities in Shannon, does the Taoiseach agree that he is in opposition to the vehemently stated wishes of the Irish people?</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach, the Government and sections of the media to come clean; the Taoiseach knows perfectly well that the reasons put forward for attacking Iraq are fraudulent from start to finish. He knows that if Saddam Hussein shoots as much as a peashooter outside his border, he will invite obliteration. Therefore, does the Taoiseach agree that this is not at all about alleged weapons of mass destruction, but about the United States wanting to extend imperial hegemony over the Middle East and corral oil resources for the next century?</P>

      <P>As Deputies Rabbitte and Higgins said, I am well aware of the humanitarian position. I am also well aware that a quarter of children under five years of age in Iraq die.

Does he consider that is an outrage and will he withdraw that facility immediately, as Austria has done?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know that, according to the most recent opinion poll, voters in every age category, social group and region oppose his policy of continuing to afford Shannon as a facility?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I address in detail the proceedings of last night's European Council, I wish to say a few words about the general situation regarding Iraq. We are at a defining moment in international relations. Events in coming months will have an important impact on world security for years and possibly decades to come. A united approach by the United Nations which results in the full implementation of UN resolutions on Iraq will be a signal that a multilateral approach to world security is both viable and effective. A result that sees the United Nations marginalised or its resolutions flouted can only <Col N="960" /> signal a move to a more dangerous world environment. As the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, said last night:</P>
      <P>What has happened in Iraq, or what happens in Iraq will not happen in a vacuum. The broader our consensus on Iraq, the better the chance we can come together again as an international community and deal effectively with all the burning conflicts in the world. And that is extremely important because when you look around you, we have many many difficult issues to tackle.</P>
      <P>Ireland's approach from the beginning has been based on the need to respect the role of the United Nations and international law. As a member of the Security Council, we played a key role in building the unanimous support for Resolution 1441. As one of the world's smaller and militarily neutral countries, Ireland has a vital national interest in a world order based on the rule of law and the primacy of the United Nations. We are proud of our tradition of support for the UN and the Government has no intention of departing from that. It is incumbent on all in the House to deal with this issue in a calm and responsible manner. Failure to do so can only have negative repercussions for the national interest.</P>
      <P>I attended the extraordinary meeting of the European Council held in Brussels yesterday evening. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, also attended. The conclusions agreed by the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, addressed the meeting and made forceful and constructive interventions. The European Council meeting was very productive and I congratulate the Greek Presidency for the constructive efforts it made. The meeting demonstrated the broad range of agreement among the members of the European Council, despite the continuance of differences on timing which still have to be resolved. I am happy to say that Ireland made a significant contribution to the shaping of the agreement arrived at last night. I am pleased with the level of consensus reflected in the conclusions of the meeting.</P>
      <P>The clear outcome of this meeting was to state again the European Union objective of full and effective Iraqi disarmament and the desire to achieve this peacefully. The Government's position, set out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Dáil last Tuesday, is that inspections should continue for as long as the inspectors feel they are productive but that they cannot continue indefinitely in the face of Iraqi non-compliance. A united approach in the Security Council and in the European Union is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations. Only full compliance with his obligations can secure the peaceful resolution of this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the European Council in their <Col N="961" /> deliberations yesterday took full account of the deep public concerns about the possibility of conflict. Every European Union Government is anxious to avoid war. This is the reason we want to see the disarmament of Iraq achieved through exclusively peaceful means, in accordance with Resolution 1441. This is also the reason we are putting so much pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply. The build-up of military force is part of that pressure. War can still be avoided. Resolution 1441 and the credible threat of force which underpins it have resulted in progress. The return of UN inspectors to Iraq after four years is a sign of progress. Saddam Hussein still has a chance to comply with the demands of the Security Council. He should do so promptly and unequivocally.</P>
    <P>This is the third occasion in four weeks that the House has considered Iraq. It is right that we should devote considerable time to this issue. There is a great deal at stake, not least the authority and legitimacy of the United Nations. Ireland has worked long and hard to achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis as we have worked for peaceful solutions to other crises over the years. The thrust of the United Nations Charter, which we fully support, is to find peaceful solutions. Force should only be used when all other possible means have been tried and failed.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been to the fore in the United Nations from the outset of our membership in working towards preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This current crisis therefore touches on two fundamental areas of concern to us. At the meeting yesterday, we also agreed on the need to address the increasing dangers posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>Iraq has refused to comply with UN resolutions for more than decade. In addition to the resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council from 1990, Resolution 1284 of 1999 called on Iraq to allow UN inspectors &ldquo;immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transport&rdquo;. Iraq has repeatedly failed to comply with resolutions of the Security Council and to live up to its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1441 of last October was designed to give Iraq another chance. It stated that Iraq should provide the arms inspectors with unconditional access to sites and persons. It directed the heads of the arms inspection teams to report immediately any interference or failure to comply.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers, including Kofi Annan, pointed out yesterday that there was a great degree of pessimism in the run-up to the adoption of Resolution 1441. Nonetheless, persistence, co-operation and a spirit of compromise enabled the Security Council to agree that resolution unanimously.</P>
    <P>After lengthy and intensive debate, in which Ireland as a member of the Security Council took an active and constructive part, agreement was <Col N="962" /> reached on Resolution 1441 on 8 November. This left the issue firmly within the framework of the United Nations Security Council. This is where Ireland wants to see the issue dealt with and where further decisions should be taken. We continue to believe that Resolution 1441 offers the best prospect of achieving our three principal objectives. These objectives are to obtain Iraq's voluntary compliance with its disarmament obligations, to avoid a military conflict and to uphold the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>Above all we must preserve the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Ireland has always been a fully committed supporter of the system of collective security, with the United Nations and the Security Council at its very centre. European Union leaders last night pledged their full support to the Security Council in the discharge of its responsibilities. It is now up to Iraq to discharge its obligation under Article 25 of the Charter whereby all UN members agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>Kofi Annan said last night: </P>
    <P>If the Security Council manages to resolve this crisis successfully and effectively, its credibility and influence will be considerably enhanced. If, on the other hand, the international community fails to agree a common position, and action is taken without the authority of the Council, then the legitimacy of and support for that action will be seriously impaired.</P>
    <P>I agree with that assessment. This is why the Government has consistently spoken out and used its influence at every opportunity, in every forum and in all its meetings, including at yesterday's meetings in Brussels, to urge the need for a peaceful solution. We have insisted that all means short of force must be tried and that force may be used only as a very last resort. We have repeatedly warned of the dangers, which would inevitably result from military conflict, and we have called attention to the threat of large-scale loss of life, casualties and human suffering. We have pointed to the risk that conflict could destabilise a region, which is already volatile. We have pointed out that extremists and terrorists would seek to exploit growing tensions between the Muslim world and Europe and the United States. We have spoken of the possible disruption of economic growth. We have laid particular emphasis on humanitarian concerns, as Ireland always has in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is our strong view that the inspections should continue as long as the inspectors and the Security Council consider they serve a useful purpose. At the same time, like the Secretary General, we recognise that the inspections cannot continue forever. Ireland has repeatedly stated its view that if Iraq continues with non-compliance, the <Col N="963" /> Security Council will have to assume its responsibilities as provided for in Resolution 1441. Any action to be taken to bring about full compliance should be decided in a second Security Council resolution. The arguments as to whether a second resolution is a legal necessity are a distraction from the real point. The compelling political reality is that a second resolution will signal the unity and resolve of the international community and the clear legitimacy of any subsequent military action.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the inspectors' report to the Security Council last Friday, the Government believes that the inspectors should continue their work, but continued and real compliance by Iraq with UN resolutions is essential. The ball is again in the court of the Iraqi leadership. That is and will continue to be Ireland's position.</P>
    <P>The European Council yesterday discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We agreed on the need to invigorate the peace process in the Middle East and to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The road map agreed by the Quartet, consisting of the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia, should be implemented rapidly.</P>
    <P>Last night's meeting was a step in the right direction. It will, I hope, enable the European Union and the international community to unite around our common objective, a peaceful solution based on the primacy of the United Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am both pleased and relieved to note the summit was a success. To achieve cohesion and unity of purpose among 15 member states was necessary and desirable. An achievement, though overdue, is better late than never. That said, as the leader of a party that has always believed passionately in the European project, I regret that such cohesion could not have been reached some time ago. In particular, this should have happened before Europe divided along the political fault line called unilateral action and before the diplomatic fiasco involving eight European countries so that the emergence of the tags &ldquo;Europe old and new&rdquo; could have been avoided.</P>
      <P>To maintain cohesion in this matter, I call on the Greek Presidency to continue to monitor developments closely and to maintain regular contact with the member states as events unfold. Serious consideration should be given to convening further special summit meetings if major developments occur in relation to Iraq. Only through such close co-operation and communication can we maintain a common European voice in this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This party has been working for some time on revising its political proposition, based on principle, not expediency. It is based on new politics, for a new people, for a new time. Our view clearly extends to Europe in this instance. The old order is indeed changing. We must leave NATO politics firmly where it belongs, in the last century. Com<Col N="964" /> mitted Europeans, from the Balkans to the Atlantic, are looking beyond the structures of the Cold War to create a new security architecture, based not on isolation and fear, but on cohesion, trust and hope. Such a security architecture will carry and indeed amplify Europe's voice in world affairs, particularly in international conflict resolution.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is an exasperating politician. No matter how hard he has been pressed in the past three weeks, he has gone close to the wire, but he never gives the final answer. Perhaps this is a hallmark of his politics and style, but in his contribution today he has answered one half of the equation fully. Neither he nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs is a warmonger. He supports peace and has made a vigorous contribution towards that. He supports the primacy and legitimacy of the United Nations. On behalf of Ireland, he pursues a resolution of this conflict through exclusively peaceful means. He agrees with Kofi Annan when he said:</P>
    <P>If the Security Council manages to resolve this crisis successfully and effectively, its credibility and influence will be considerably enhanced. If, on the other hand, the international community fails to agree a common position, and action is taken without the authority of the Council, then the legitimacy of and support for that action will be seriously impaired.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet, he will not go the final step and say that he is opposed to unilateral action against Iraq.</P>
    <P>I understand the pressure of being Taoiseach and a member of Government. The people, including many who marched last week, are deeply opposed to war, but are naturally concerned about the economic consequences of what could happen here. People have expressed to me very directly their views on the effects on economic investment in this country from the United States. This is real and means cheques at weekends, houses, mortgages, families, cars, lifestyles, work and the future.</P>
    <P>We have always been friends with the United States. We have long historical, social, economic, political and other ties with that country. However we are a sovereign people with our own Constitution and laws. Just as we respect the laws and regulations of other countries, so should they too respect ours. Friends sometimes differ. Our traditional stance has always been, as enunciated by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to respect and adhere to the primacy, legitimacy and authority of the United Nations, and the Taoiseach has stated today he has no intention of departing from that tradition. Perhaps when the Minister for Foreign Affairs is answering questions on this later, he will say where Ireland would stand in the context of, for example, a second resolution not conferring a mandate for unilateral action. I know this is a difficult question.</P>
    <P>What the Taoiseach's failure to answer ques<Col N="965" /> tions at the summit exposes is that under his leadership the Fianna Fáil Party has made the politics of the parish pump into an art, but is still joining the dots in respect of the European picture and beyond. <i>The Economist</i> on-line has a map of Europe on which one can click a dot over each country to find out how it is aligned. There is no dot over Ireland, meaning we do not have a position on a war which has the potential to change the world and instead confine ourselves to expressing support for the United Nations, although I accept this is important as in so doing we adhere to our traditional values.</P>

      <P>Given his support for the United Nations and exclusively peaceful means, I would have expected the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, to make a clear statement that we are opposed to unilateral action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to Ms Quinn from UNICEF the other day. As Members will be aware, she has just returned from an eight day visit to Iraq. The humanitarian consequences of a war are frightening. UNICEF has enough food stashed on the Syrian border to feed 600,000 people within 48 <Col N="966" /> hours and has a warehouse in Baghdad with food valued at $1 million.</P>
    <P>The regime in Iraq has been brutal. Layer by layer, the people have been stripped of everything to the point where they are unable to resist or rise up. I share the Government's view that if Saddam Hussein was to comply with the UN resolution, the conflict would be avoided.</P>
    <P>I received an e-mail from San Diego a couple of days ago by a person who has watched from a hillside as aircraft carriers have steamed out of the bay for the past six months. These vessels will not return without having done some damage, which clearly indicates the strength of the commitment of the United States on this issue. Newspaper reports noting that a replacement for Saddam Hussein is ready to take power in Iraq and setting out a catalogue of events which will happen between now and the end of March call into question the value and importance of the Security Council's decision.</P>
    <P>Ireland could take a lead in examining the sanctions committee, which refuses to approve certain parts for medical equipment for importation to Iraq if it deems them to be of dual use. Presuming the mortality rate among young children in hospitals in Iraq is as high as we are informed, a series of Irish and European sponsored humanitarian visits to Iraq should be undertaken to ensure medicines reach hospitals there and can be used to benefit the country's children who are suffering from diarrhoea, malnutrition and other illnesses on a massive scale. Replies to questions I tabled to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the past indicated that the Iraqi Government has not ordered medicines under the food for oil programme.</P>
    <P>We should explain to the Iraqi people that not all western countries are belligerent and that we want them to have the opportunity to live normal lives. Given that the Parc Group trained and worked with doctors and nurses in the Saddam Hussein Hospital in Baghdad prior to the Gulf War, there is already a connection between Ireland and Iraq, about which I understand the Iraqi people are aware. I ask the Taoiseach to take the next available opportunity to examine what medical equipment the sanctions committee has prevented from reaching Iraq.</P>
    <P>Available evidence suggests that if this conflict starts, as many as 16 million people will suffer severely from lack of nutrition and food caused by the ravages of war. As a country which has traditionally taken a neutral stance, it behoves us to be far more vigorous and proactive in terms of our approach to this issue. We should clearly state our views.</P>
    <P>No one in the House supports Saddam Hussein and the people of Iraq do not support his regime, which rules by oppression. The collective will of the international community can and will be brought to bear on what is, possibly, a worsening situation. War is always the option of last resort. The decision facing us is whether it would save <Col N="967" /> lives and reduce suffering. While there is no easy answer, principle can be a useful guide.</P>
    <P>In recent days I have spoken to people in the United States where security has been ratcheted up to close to the top of the scale and people across the country are buying gas masks and stocking up on water and tinned food. One has the distinct impression of a people living under a cloud of fear. Whether it is justified remains to be seen, but the threat of international terrorism is very real.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The attacks on 11 September were very real. That is how Americans see the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>One also has the report on Sellafield commissioned by Greenpeace, which, it appears, will not be published because of the catastrophic consequences of an attack. Perhaps the build-up of military forces in the Gulf will ultimately have a deterrent effect in that Saddam Hussein may decide to comply with UN resolutions. However, the rising weather temperatures in the Gulf make matters uncertain. If, at the end of another period, Mr. Blix is able to report that the Iraqi regime is co-operating and complying with the requirements of the weapons inspectors and inspections should, therefore, continue, it would be too hot for, or, as they say in the United States, not conducive to night fighting in the desert. The question is whether the White House would decide to take unilateral action at that point.</P>
      <P>I want to find out where the Government stands in the event that the United States decides to invade Iraq unilaterally without United Nations sanction. Will the Taoiseach tell the people where he stands and what the Cabinet has decided or will we have to wait until the final moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The 100,000 people who marched through Dublin last Saturday were not marching in support of Saddam Hussein or out of antipathy to America. I was in the march and I spoke to many people. These were people who in many cases had never marched in their lives before and had never felt the overwhelming urge to protest about an international issue. They were members of all political parties and none. They were people of all ages, classes and income groups. They were horrified at a headlong rush to war that could have untold and unforeseen consequences. They were horrified that the rush to war is being led by the most powerful democracy in the world and that our nearest neighbour is apparently seized of the same determination to start a pre-emptive war. These people were intelligent, questioning and thoughtful. There was no knee-jerk impulse among them, but a deep sense that something new was happening in the world. It is stupid and insulting to characterise the people who marched on Saturday as either anti-<Col N="968" /> American or naive. Despite what the propagandists might say, people understand full well that Iraq does not possess the might of the Third Reich. Dictator and tyrant that Hussein undoubtedly is, he rules a country whose people are already broken, physically and in spirit.</P>
      <P> They know that if this war is a huge success in the eyes of the so-called coalition of the willing, a country will lie crushed by the onslaught of the greatest military power the world has ever known. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, will die in the short-term, with many more dying over time, and after Saddam Hussein has been killed or captured, terrorist attacks can still strike unsuspecting parts of the world and kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people.</P>
      <P>They know that if the war goes wrong, the entire region can be destabilised. If Hussein manages to hold out or if he manages to unleash some of the chemical weaponry he is still alleged to control, casualties could be huge on both sides and the legacy of a botched military effort could be many years of regional conflict, with other countries drawn into a war over the future of Islam and incalculable consequences, including catastrophic economic consequences, for the whole world.</P>
      <P>There are no good scenarios here, no possibility in this approach of a clean outcome. Does anyone really believe we can easily foresee a day when the happy people of Iraq, free at last of their hated dictator, will want to share their new-found prosperity with the rest of the world? Does anyone really believe this war, once it is under way, will have no casualties except people who deserve it? This war will not be a Hollywood adventure, it will be bloody, bitter and poisonous. Even if it is over quickly, there will be no winners.</P>
      <P>We should not be under any illusions either about what happened in Brussels last night. There are still palpably clear divisions in Europe between those who want to go to war now and those who want to find a peaceful solution. It is perhaps true to say that the real division now is between those who wish to find a way to disarm Iraq without war and those who are still bent on regime change.</P>
      <P>We need to be very clear on this point. The United Nations has adopted a wide variety of resolutions in relation to Iraq, going back to the first Gulf War. None of them mentions or endorses regime change. Resolution 1441, as we know, deplores and criticises Iraq again and again for its many manifest failures in relation to disarmament. It repeats several times the sense of threat Iraq poses to international peace and security through the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles, but it also reaffirms the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Such a clause cannot be consistent with the entirely new principle that it is okay to go to war to secure a change of regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised our Government, in supporting the European position, has managed to remain so <Col N="969" /> silent on the subject of regime change. The Irish Government is committed, under Article 29 of the Constitution, to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality and to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination. While that commitment does not preclude us from supporting action endorsed by the United Nations, and consistent with the United Nations Charter, it prevents our Government from acquiescing in, supporting or facilitating in any way a war whose purpose is to get rid of a regime we do not like.</P>
    <P>A week ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, addressed this House at length on the subject of Iraq. In a considered and detailed speech, he made no reference to the issue of regime change. If the Government has referred to this issue elsewhere, I have been unable to find it. I hope we will not complete this debate today without hearing the Government's position on this issue. Having regard especially to the fact that the concept of regime change by force is alien to the United Nations Charter, I believe we need to hear the view of the Government on this important issue.</P>
    <P>The Government has been voluble on the subject of disarmament. The Taoiseach is quoted in today's newspapers, for instance, as telling the European Council last night that &ldquo;weapons inspections could not go on forever&rdquo; and warning that the &ldquo;authority of the Security Council was at stake&rdquo;. This is to misunderstand the inspection process.</P>
    <P>The inspection process consists of two parts. The first part is the finding and destruction of any weapons of mass destruction. The second is the continual monitoring of Iraqi activities. It is up to the Security Council, and the Security Council alone, to sanction action that may be required arising from the findings of the inspectors. What will do most damage to the authority of the Security Council is the unilateral unleashing of a war, without the authority or consent of the Council. In any event, it would make one wonder whether the work of the inspectorate is being taken seriously by the leaders who are discussing it. Only four days ago at the Security Council, Dr. Blix stated:</P>
    <P>I said that it seemed from our experience that Iraq had decided in principle to provide cooperation on process, most importantly prompt access to all sites and assistance to UNMOVIC in the establishment of the necessary infrastructure. This impression remains, and we note that access to sites has so far been without problems, including those that had never been declared or inspected, as well as to Presidential sites and private residences.</P>
    <P>In my last updating, I also said that a decision to cooperate on substance was indispensable in order to bring, through inspection, the disarmament task to completion and to set the monitoring system on a firm course. Such <Col N="970" /> cooperation, as I have noted, requires more than the opening of doors. In the words of resolution 1441 &ndash; it requires immediate, unconditional and active efforts by Iraq to resolve existing questions of disarmament &ndash; either by presenting remaining proscribed items and programmes for elimination or by presenting convincing evidence that they have been eliminated.</P>
    <P>In the current situation, one would expect Iraq to be eager to comply. While we were in Baghdad, we met a delegation from the Government of South Africa. It was there to explain how South Africa gained the confidence of the world in its dismantling of the nuclear weapons programme by a wholehearted cooperation over two years with IAEA inspectors. I have just learned that Iraq has accepted an offer by South Africa to send a group of experts for further talks.</P>
    <P>In other parts of his presentation to the Security Council, Dr. Blix is implicitly and explicitly critical of Iraq, but how anyone can interpret this report as a mandate for war baffles me. How our Taoiseach can say, against the background of that report, that weapons inspections cannot go on forever also baffles me. At what point should the weapons inspections stop and what should replace them?</P>
    <P>In our own country, we have some experience of how troubled and complex an issue disarmament can be. We know how it is tied up with issues of sovereignty and surrender, and we know that it is an issue that takes time, although the context is radically different. We have struggled with the issue of disarmament in Ireland since the first IRA ceasefire nearly eight and a half years ago, and we have still not made the progress we would wish, but none of us in this House has argued that we should give up on peace on that account.</P>
    <P>The effort to secure a peaceful resolution to the threatening issue of Iraq must continue. Before this debate ends, I seek an assurance from the Taoiseach that his every effort will be bent in that direction. We cannot and must not support or facilitate a war aimed at regime change, no matter how much we hate the regime involved. We cannot give up on the disarmament issue while the inspectors appointed by the United Nations are making progress.</P>
    <P>Is it not possible for a country like ours to lead the demand for peaceful disarmament through the United Nations? Why are we not insisting that the next step, in line with international law, ought to be Iraq's acceptance of a process that moves beyond inspection to actual disarmament? This is what Dr. Blix told the United Nations a couple of days ago:</P>
    <P>Through the inspections conducted so far, we have obtained a good knowledge of the industrial and scientific landscape of Iraq, as well as of its missile capability but, as before, we do not know every cave and corner. Inspections <Col N="971" /> are effectively helping to bridge the gap in knowledge that arose due to the absence of inspections between December 1998 and November 2002.</P>
    <P>More than 200 chemical and more than 100 biological samples have been collected at different sites. Three quarters of these have been screened using our own laboratory analytical capabilities at the Baghdad Centre. The results to date have been consistent with Iraq's declarations. We have now commenced the process of destroying approximately 50 litres of mustard gas declared by Iraq that was being kept under UNMOVIC seal at the Muthanna site. One third of the quantity has already been destroyed.</P>
    <P>The disarmament of Iraq and removal of the threat can be achieved peaceably. This requires maintaining the maximum possible political and diplomatic pressure on Baghdad but no case has yet been established for a war that would kill hundreds of thousands. The message from Ireland must be the message of the people last weekend: we support peace, we believe the UN's objectives can be achieved through peaceful means and we oppose war.</P>
    <P>The approach of this Government since the crisis escalated has been to keep its head down, say as little as possible and hope that it will go away. Once again the Taoiseach appears to have been largely a spectator at last night's summit in Brussels. One would search the international media in vain to find any account of a proposal or even a contribution made by the Taoiseach at the summit. The moral and political issues raised by the threat of war will not go away. As a people we have a right to expect something better from the Taoiseach than sitting on the fence and sending the hapless Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on to <i>Morning Ireland </i>to suggest that the 100,000 people who marched through Dublin on Saturday were really demonstrating their support for Government policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was a recent visitor to Mexico and I know he is an admirer of the President of Mexico, Vincente Fox. Mexico is a country with a common border with the United States and is hugely dependent on Washington in terms of investment and general political goodwill. Last week President Fox spelled out the position of his country in the following terms: no to unilateralism, no to war, yes to peace and yes to the disarming of Iraq and the strengthening of the United Nations. Would that we had a leader who was prepared to show half the political backbone of President Fox.</P>

    <P>I was proud to march last Saturday and to speak from the platform. I was impressed by those present, who were not hardened political <Col N="972" /> animals but fathers, mothers and children, the kind of people one sees out on a Sunday stroll. In some cases the family pets came along. However, this was no picnic. It was deadly serious. Some marchers had printed placards but many had placards they had made up at home with simple messages calling for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; to war. They shouted &ldquo;no blood for oil&rdquo; as they marched along in an expression of people power.</P>
    <P>There was also an expression of people power in the last election, when I was elected because the Government had not delivered in my constituency. People were fed up then that nobody was listening to them, and they were fed up last Saturday for the same reason. That was the reserved function of those who wanted to be heard. If there had been a general election last Saturday then Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats would not be in power; they are damn lucky there was no poll last Saturday. The people wish to be heard but they have not been heard. They would not march if war was inevitable. It is not inevitable and they know public opinion can change the situation; otherwise there would have been no point in marching.</P>
    <P>The people have spoken loudly and clearly and the Government will be in great peril if it ignores this message, delivered so simply and clearly. The people who marched, like me, are not anti-America, yet they resent the use of Shannon Airport in the build-up to a war nobody wants. They are putting the responsibility to carry out their wishes on the shoulders of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs; they will be held responsible for stopping the use of Shannon. The people have spoken and they should be listened to.</P>

      <P>The Greek Presidency should be congratulated for taking the initiative to organise the emergency summit meeting over the weekend. It took a risk but it was one worth taking, as it is important we have an EU statement or agreed position on Iraq. We need that to act as a counterbalance to the threat of unilateral action by the United States. I was hugely relived by the statement from the Council that war is not inevitable. It seems crazy to have to say that, but until now I and many people like me have had an awful sense that war is inevitable &ndash; that there is a relentless grinding machine moving towards war. The EU statement gives me some hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also marched last Saturday, though in my home town of Sligo and not with the 100,000 people in Dublin. I was heartened to see so many people marching for peace because it sent a strong message to all politicians that the inspectors should be allowed to get on with their work and to proceed with disarming Iraq. The Taoiseach just said that the inspectors should continue as long as they and the Security Council consider they serve a useful purpose but I and many other Irish people want him not just to state that we back the UN but to make a statement on unilateral action by the US. However, if one backs the <Col N="973" /> UN position one cannot support unilateral action by the US. One cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Kofi Annan urged EU Heads of State to concentrate on disarming Iraq. Under current conditions, with constant scrutiny by inspectors, it is unlikely that Iraq represents a substantial threat to world security. The EU statement also said the EU is determined to deal effectively with the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is very important because if the EU is determined to deal effectively with such weapons, then it must turn its attention to many countries, of which Iraq is only one. Perhaps in that context the art of politics may replace the act of war.</P>
    <P>I am no apologist for Saddam Hussein and his evil regime but we must continue to back the UN in its role as guardian of international peace and security. Kofi Annan's statement regarding the credibility of the UN being at stake in this situation gives me hope that a negotiated and peaceful resolution can be found. I also have a little more hope that the EU can play an important role in achieving that resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers have referred to last Saturday's march. It is amazing to hear Government spokespersons claiming that the marchers, including my party, myself and other Deputies from this side of the House, were on that march in support of Government policy. If that was the case, why was there no official representation from the Government? It is clear the Government is being insincere and is insulting people by claiming the march was in support of its policy.</P>
      <P>After the EU summit we now know that Government policy is to follow whatever others say, that it does not rule out the use of force and is prepared to limit the inspections, even though the Taoiseach said there should be as much time as might be needed. According to the official statement there is now a timeframe. That is a way of saying that we will go to war if we have to. If the British Government had taken that position at the height of terrorist attacks in Britain, or if the Good Friday Agreement were to stall, we would be here saying how unjust, unreasonable and aggressive such a position would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the people who marched on Saturday were of the opinion that violence and war will not solve this matter, certainly not the type of bombardment the US is planning. In the absence of any Government policy other than waiting to see what happens and jumping then, the people have been listening to those with credibility on this matter. The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War estimate that there will be between 48,000 and 260,000 civilian casualties in the first three months of a war without the use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. The Bush Administration has threatened to use such weapons so that figure will increase to even more frightening proportions. A report in <i>The Guardian</i> on 20 January stated that <Col N="974" /> a UN special task force estimated 500,000 dead or wounded, with 16 million out of 26 million people in danger of starvation. There were predictions in the European Parliament that there would be three million refugees and displaced people. These figures come from those who are not afraid to say what will happen.</P>
    <P>The Pentagon theatre nuclear planning document is frightening in the cavalier fashion in which it states that nuclear weapons will be used if necessary against bunkers, bunkers to which the weapons inspectors are expected to get access. The threat of nuclear weapons signifies not just a potential catastrophe for humanity but is also in contravention of the Charter of the United Nations. When the Taoiseach says we must respect the UN, we will be known by our actions.</P>
    <P>Kofi Annan has said the sanctions are not working and we should call for them to be lifted. If the British and Americans oppose that we should challenge them. The Government claims that it will go along with the primacy of the UN but is it not going along with the primacy of its charter, which does not allow for regime change. We cannot have it both ways. We are either with the UN or not and in its charter, it makes clear its limitations and its extent. We should respect that rather than deal with the US interpretation of what the UN can do.</P>
    <P>Dennis Halliday has made clear that Article 2.4 of the charter states that all &ldquo;members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations&rdquo;. By going along with the current US-led policy, we are not just threatening global stability but are in flagrant breach of both the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading the statement of the EU leaders to which the Taoiseach put his name, one could be forgiven for thinking that the weapons inspectors did not report to the United Nations last Friday or that millions of people did not march against war in dozens of cities across the globe last Saturday.</P>
      <P>We are meeting in the wake of one of the largest demonstrations of direct democracy the world has ever seen. Here on the streets of Dublin the message could not have been clearer. The Government may try to spin its way out of it but it will do so in vain. Last Saturday, 100,000 people told this Government it does not act in their name when it allows Shannon Airport to be used for the military build-up, when it uses taxpayers' money to facilitate the over-flight of military aircraft through our airspace, when it fails to speak out, when it sits on the fence or, worse, when it aligns the State with the powers leading the drive to war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach told marchers that the demonstration did not change the Government's position but he has now gone even further than that. <Col N="975" /> According to <i>The Irish Times,</i> he has boasted that allowing the use of Shannon is &ldquo;a small contribution to a military build-up&rdquo;. At the same time, Government Deputies have claimed to agree with those marching at the weekend and that the march was somehow in line with Government policy. Those who would offer us such contributions should not insult our intelligence. Better their silence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have nothing to be proud about from the outcome of the Brussels Summit, in fact the opposite is the case. They know that Resolution 1441 does not sanction force or war. They also know that the weapons inspectors reported real progress last week and that Hans Blix rubbished much of the alleged evidence presented to the UN Security Council by the Bush Administration. They know the dossier presented by Tony Blair and the British Government was a concoction and a sham. The Brussels statement had more to do with patching up the shaky relationship between the EU and the US, and relations within the European Union, than it did with resolving this crisis. The reality is that the UN and the EU have been sidelined by the Bush Administration and its British allies.</P>
    <P>In the days ahead we will see attempts to cobble together a second Security Council resolution. If it is done it will be nothing other than a fig leaf to facilitate the war that is all but under way. If a resolution is not cobbled together, it is clear that the US and British Governments are prepared to attack without a second resolution. What has the Irish Government said and done? The Taoiseach cannot bring himself to oppose a US-British attack without a second UN resolution.</P>
    <P>Already the Bush Administration has nominated the people it wishes to run Iraq as military governors after its invasion. For the first time in American history, the US is preparing to impose a direct colonial administration. The Kurds in northern Iraq are outraged that the Bush Administration has told them in talks that it has abandoned plans to introduce democracy in Iraq after the proposed invasion and overthrowing of Saddam.</P>
    <P>The EU statement, which the Taoiseach signed, states that &ldquo;the Iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences&rdquo;. Of course, the Taoiseach knows that the people who will bear the consequences of this war will be the innocent men, women and children of Iraq, the very people who have suffered under Saddam and the appalling sanctions which have killed an estimated one million people.</P>
    <P>I make a final appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, echoing the voices of the 100,000 people who marched on the streets of Dublin last Saturday, not to make this State complicit in an unjust and disastrous war, not just for the people of Iraq and the Gulf region but, indeed, potentially for every citizen of this global village.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the discussions yesterday, has the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach given any indication to our European colleagues as to the likely position of the Irish Government in the event of the US proceeding unilaterally? For example, within the confines of the meeting yesterday, notwithstanding the communiqué issued afterwards, it would have been expected that the various Governments represented there would have intimated to each other, in some degree of confidence, the likely road they would follow in such circumstances.

      <P>The Minister did not? Given those circumstances, may I ask another question? The Taoiseach indicated some time ago that in relation to a letter signed by a number of the applicant countries for membership of the European Union, he would have signed that letter if he had been aware of it at the time. Is that still his position and that of the Government? If presented with that letter now, would the Government still be prepared to sign the letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a predilection in this Parliament to ask hypothetical questions rather than practical ones. The Taoiseach and I have stated that there is no problem in relation to the sentiments expressed in the letters concerned, which referred to the primacy of the United Nations, and the need to resolve this matter peacefully. The business before the House relates to the meeting of the European Union Council last night. If Deputies have questions on that, they should put them. If there are some other questions, I will take them also.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Durkan, the position of the Government is quite clear. It has been systematically misrepresented, for their own political purposes, by some elements of the Opposition. Just as I have to accept the sincerity of Deputies on the other side of the House, perhaps they will reciprocate occasionally, given that we all recognise the seriousness of the present situation. I thank Deputy Kenny for his recognition that there are no warmongers in this House. We are trying to solve this problem peacefully in a very difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's position has been as clear as we can put it. We want this matter resolved peacefully <Col N="977" /> and we recognise that primary responsibility for its resolution lies with the Security Council. We were represented when the resolution was formulated, devised and adopted unanimously. At the time, there was a great deal of pessimism as to whether that could be achieved. We would like to think we played a small part in ensuring that it was achieved. We stood for the principle in that resolution that the question of whether there is further material breach is a matter for the Security Council to decide, not for any one state or group of states. We stood for that principle and it is reflected in the resolution.</P>
    <P>We stood for the principle that whatever further serious consequences were to follow should take place within the UN framework. Since the adoption of that resolution, even if Deputy Sargent does not accept this, the objective evidence confirms that the Irish Government has reflected and upheld, perhaps more accurately than many others, precisely what the UN position is in this regard. Deputy Sargent has stopped quoting the UN Secretary General &ndash; perhaps it no longer suits him to do so. I assure Deputy Durkan that the Government has consistently upheld the UN position in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a few simple, direct and positive questions. Do I understand correctly from the Taoiseach's speech that he is unequivocally of the view that a pre-emptive strike would be illegal, in breach of the UN Charter and, therefore, that it would be illegal to assist any such strike? I have two other questions to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated last week in reply to the Deputy, pre-emptive action is outlawed under the UN Charter, except in two circumstances outlined therein, self-defence or a Security Council decision to take military action in circumstances outlined in the relevant enforcement provisions. The problem in relation to unilateral action, as it has been described, or, more accurately, pre-emptive action, is that if the USA were to act without a further UN resolution, it would claim it was doing so under the already existing 17 resolutions in relation to this matter. The difficulty is that there is no common legal view on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When asked what our position would be in those circumstances, we are saying clearly that we wish to avoid the need for military action in the first instance &ndash; should military action become unavoidable, we would wish to have it endorsed by a further UN resolution and we do not wish to have military action take place without such further resolution. Our position in relation to such action being taken, as I have outlined, would depend on the circumstances. I do not believe it is in our interests to provide for a definitive position in relation to a hypothetical circumstance. What if that circumstance does not materialise? What is the logic of accepting the inevitability of war and proceeding on the basis that unilateral action is the only outcome to all the efforts being <Col N="978" /> made? I do not accept that. The EU Council stated last night, with one voice, that war is not inevitable.</P>
    <P>That was also confirmed by the UN Secretary General last night. He advocated making sure to place the responsibility where it lies for the resolution of this problem and that the European Union should confirm that the Iraqi regime has it in its own hands to resolve this problem peacefully and immediately. UN Resolution 1441 is predicated &ndash; and, in response to Deputy Rabbitte's question, a successful outcome of the inspection regime is predicated, as confirmed by Dr. Blix among others &ndash; on the full co-operation of the Iraqi regime with the weapons inspectors. If there is full, unequivocal co-operation, this matter will be resolved peacefully. Let us take that responsibility.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, we asked our EU partners in the UN Security Council to discuss with their partners, including the US and other members of the Security Council, a means by which we can ensure this can be resolved peacefully. Amid all the pessimism of those who advocate multilateral action and those who, apparently, are saying they know the hour, date and time of the war, would they not be better exercised in providing for an effective multilateral response to those whom they claim have already predetermined a unilateral outcome? That is the challenge to the multilateral system at this time, in my view.</P>
    <P>I intend to work within the European Union and as a member of the United Nations to establish if it is possible for the Security Council to meet its collective responsibility in this matter in a way that will ensure the full and successful implementation of this resolution by peaceful means rather than military action. That is my intention. Those critics, some within this House, who seem to know the date and time of the war, continue to carp about the prospect of unilateral action. We must find an effective multilateral response to those who claim all this is predetermined. That is the challenge for the international community and that is where the Government stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the concept of pre-emption. I asked the question because it is the distinctive character of President Bush's foreign policy, announced as far back as 1997. My question was simple. I can put it differently, although I do not want to provoke a longer answer. I am sure Kofi Annan would agree too that the threat of pre-emption is probably the single greatest threat to the charter and practice of the United Nations. That being the case, will the Minister saw whether he found evidence, in such conversations as the Taoiseach had with the British Prime Minister, that Mr. Blair was inclined to move back from accepting the doctrine of pre-emption, which, with respect, is not a matter of legal doubt? There is a legal doubt about the interpretation of some of the legacy of resolutions, but not about the concept of pre-emption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> The straightforward question about it is this. Is the Minister not concerned about what circumstances and what form of compliance would roll back the military machine? I am not saying this as a pessimist. Where in Resolution 1441 did the Minister find text that suggested that there should be a military build-up of such scale to ensure compliance with the UN resolution?</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach are giving different signals on the question of a second Security Council resolution. I notice in the Taoiseach's speech &ndash; it is a very good point which has already been adverted to &ndash; that the reference is to the United Nations. The United Nations Charter is really what we all are speaking about. We are as committed to the charter as even a bullied Kofi Annan might be. The Minister knows there have been such circumstances in the past. In reply to a question about a resolution, I recall Kofi Annan, for whom I have total respect, describing participation in one decision in which he said, &ldquo;I was not part of the loop.&rdquo;  What matters is the charter, not the UN loop.</P>
    <P>What we really wanted the Minister and the Taoiseach to say &ndash; I do not understand why they will not say it &ndash; is that they do not accept the principle of pre-emption like other countries, that they are totally against unilateral action and that they have committed themselves to a set of active principles in developing diplomatic alternatives. I accept that he will try it to the end, but can he not say that? Why can he not agree that the charter would be damaged by any pre-emptive action and then accept the consequences by not facilitating it?</P>

      <P>Let us be clear. The doctrine of pre-emption, the idea that military force will be taken in the absence of any formal consideration by the Security Council, is not something to which I subscribe. It is not part of the UN Charter and I have stated that clearly.</P>
      <P>On the question of what is determined by people here as unilateral action in relation to these resolutions, I have pointed out &ndash; Deputy Higgins, probably alone, accepts this &ndash; that there is not an international legal consensus on that matter because if the UK and the US were to act under this resolution, they would claim they already have that clearance under the resolutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us make this point clear. The Deputy asks what is the Government's position. Our position is equally clear and I have stated it time and again. We want to see a second resolution, regardless of the legal argument, because we believe it will enhance the political legitimacy of such action were we to have a second resolution and maintain the resolve of the international community in facing down this tyrant <Col N="980" /> who is continuing to defy the United Nations. This brings us to the next question.</P>
      <P>For those who are trying to claim we are sitting on fences, we are being as clear as we can possibly be in this matter. When people ask me why I will not answer a hypothetical question, my answer is that I will not because no responsible Government here to defend our interest will answer a hypothetical question. I will answer every question on the evolving situation as it demands. In the event, with or without UN sanction for military action, we will come to this House, we will outline the position of the Government and there will be a debate in this House. There is not a better test or example of democratic accountability than that. I am not prepared, however, in the interests of trying to make sure we have devised effective multilateral responses in what is a very difficult and dangerous situation, to conduct a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; lesson in this House or anywhere else. If I get into that line of argument, I am allowing for the inevitability of war. There are people in this House &ndash; I do not question their sincerity &ndash; who do not want war who themselves have got into the logic that everything is inevitable and nothing can happen, and ask what is my position when all this happens.</P>
      <P>Other people may have the date of the war, but I do not. As long as I am in this position representing the Government and all its people &ndash; I hope Deputy Cowley is still listening &ndash; I will seek to do everything I can, consistent with the traditions of successive Governments, to ensure the primacy of the United Nations and to work, however difficult the background against which we are operating, to make sure that the Security Council has the primary responsibility in this matter. It is not for the European Union to put down a time-line. We defended the principles and rights of the membership of the Security Council to decide whether there is a further material breach. That will have to come back to the Security Council. We defended the principle that, in the event of military action having to be taken in those circumstances, it would be a matter for the Security Council. That is what we are trying to defend here. Frankly I am tired of those who consistently misrepresent the position of the Government in this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make the point. I do not question Deputy Higgins's sincerity and I know that he does not question mine, but all of us had better stop playing the games of the schoolyard and realise that in the difficult situation we are in, we have to defend our traditions and principles in a way which will be effective. We want effective multilateral responses to this growing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point mentioned by the Secretary General at the UN that if we do not have full co-operation from the Iraqi regime, we are back to the situation where the grim choices have to be <Col N="981" /> faced, where we have to discharge our responsibilities. Otherwise we put at risk the credibility of the collective security system which we have supported consistently since 1955. None of us wants to get to that position, but let us not let a dictator think that we are not prepared to contemplate that position. Were it the case that this regime were prepared to voluntarily co-operate and submit itself to the authority of the Security Council, as any respectable member of the international community should do given the gravity of this situation, we would not be worrying about the military build-up because it would not be necessary and there would not be the threat of force. These are the requirements of the situation.</P>
    <P>All our experience confirms and all our evidence suggests that this regime does not move to acknowledge the authority of the United Nations until there is a credible threat of force against it. That is a fact, and I wish it were otherwise. It is a fact of life that we must internalise and recognise as being the means by which we can help to resolve this problem peacefully. It is up to us, and it is recognised in the European Union, in the Council conclusions last night, that that is an unfortunate fact of life which we must face up to. If we do not do that, all the evidence suggests that this gentleman will not respond as he is required to do.</P>
    <P>I assure this House we will work might and main to seek a resolution of this matter peacefully. I respect and recognise the genuine humanitarian instincts of everybody who walked the streets of Dublin or any other town in Ireland and throughout the world last Saturday because I share their hope that we will get a peaceful solution to this problem. Knowing the character of the person with whom we are dealing and the nature of the regime with which we are confronted, unless we are prepared to let him know that the united resolve of the international community will not be undermined by his consistent defiance of the UN, we will not be serving the UN which we all want to respect and which we hope can win out in this case. That is the position of the Government and I cannot be more clear than that.</P>

Is it the Government's understanding that there would be consequences, given the reports that Mr. Rumsfeld has threatened Germany with such consequences for taking a principled stand? Does the Minister accept that those in charge of American investment decisions are themselves a cross-section of American society, where debate is animated on whether a war in Iraq is a good and just thing? In relation to the concept of the &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; referred to in the EU statement, does the Government agree with the view of the Bush administration that this is a matter of weeks and months, or do we have <Col N="982" /> an open-ended timeframe in which to solve this problem?</P>

Since when has it been Government policy to contribute to this or any build-up to a war?

      <P>I heard all of what the Minister said despite not being in the House for the first ten minutes. President Bush was reported tonight as saying that America does not need a second resolution to launch an attack. Can the Minister be very clear on his view on that? In view of the fact that he seems to be prepared to support a war in Iraq that could cost tens of thousands of lives, what threat, in the Minister's opinion, is posed by the Saddam Hussein dictatorship right now? Weapons inspectors of experience believe that most of his equipment has been destroyed or degraded by now and that he knows that he cannot explode a hand grenade outside his borders without facing possible obliteration. Is it not, therefore, a fiction to continue talking about weapons of mass destruction? Does the Minister believe that the US Government has no interest in securing the oil resources of Iraq for its own economy over the next 50 years? Is he saying that is not at all a factor in this situation?</P>

    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins asked about oil reserves. This situation has arisen as a result of the order to disarm within 90 days given to the Iraqi regime after the Gulf War ceasefire in 1991. Unfortunately, it did not take that opportunity. Everything that has happened since would have been totally avoidable had that regime submitted to the authority of the UN then. The UN is continuing to seek a peaceful solution to the problem of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The inspec<Col N="984" /> tors are not yet satisfied &ndash; serious questions remain unanswered to this day. If these questions were properly answered and full co-operation was provided by Iraq, the real threat of military action and all the uncertainty and dismay being experienced by citizens throughout the world, as well as the poor people of Iraq, could be dissipated overnight. Let us hope that the leader of that regime will for once put his people before his unusual attachment to weapons such as these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF" hpid="Dr. Devins Dr. Devins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It was promised legislation under the programme for Govern<Col N="985" /> ment published prior to the election and it will be beneficial for Irish fishermen. There are two main aspects to the Bill. In the first instance, it establishes a statutory office of appeals officer. The appeals officer has been <i>in situ</i> in an interim capacity since November 2002. Under the Bill it will be a statutory office for five years and will be independent of the Minister, which I warmly welcome.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer's function will be to examine current legislation and to review any appeals of sea fishing licences brought by applicants who believe they have not been treated fairly. I have received a number of representations from people in my constituency who were unhappy with the licences they received and, in one instance, with not getting a licence. This office will lead to openness and transparency, which must be good for all sea fishermen. I also welcome the fact that in the case of third party appeals, they will no longer be allowed to sit on the fence. In other words, they must make their appeal when the original licence is granted. They cannot come along after having sat on the fence and make a contribution to the appeals officer. If there is a point with which the applicant is unhappy, he or she can appeal within three months of the appeals officer's decision to the High Court. These provisions are most welcome and long overdue.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Bill deals at length with the conservation of certain species of fish. Fish is a worthwhile and beneficial food. It is also a cheap food with many health giving properties. Unfortunately, in the recent past, due to technology and bigger boats, the stocks of certain species of fish have diminished rapidly. This is caused by over-fishing and there is a danger that some of the fish species will shortly become extinct. The United Nations established an agreement among member states to conserve certain fish species, particularly those that travel through different seas during their life spans The 14 other EU member states have signed this agreement. It has also been signed by the European Union. Ireland is the only member state that has not signed it. That is another reason to welcome the Bill. It is vital, from the point of view of preserving fish species, that the Government be allowed sign the agreement as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will help protect the interests of Irish fishermen, particularly sea fishermen. Many of our sea fishermen use relatively small boats and in recent times they have had to go further and further out to sea to reach the fish stocks. The other aspect of the Bill which I welcome are the increased powers given to the fisheries protection officers. Members of the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service and the Air Corps can act as fisheries protection officers. They will be able to stop, board, inspect and, perhaps, confiscate not only Irish sea fishing vessels on the high seas but also those of any state that has signed the agreement. Everybody is aware that the boats of certain states have over-fished stocks in the past but our <Col N="986" /> officers could not board or inspect them outside our territorial waters. That aspect of the Bill is most welcome.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that the procedure for granting licences and under which appeals will be made is as open and transparent as possible. The sea fishermen, particularly in Raughley Harbour, Mullaghmore, Rosses Point and towards Enniscrone in my constituency, want this process to be transparent and open and I ask the Minister to ensure that this will be the case. How many licences have been granted to sea fishing boats in the last two years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Devins for sharing his time. I welcome the Bill. I live three miles from Greencastle so I am familiar with the difficult lives fishermen have working out of the Foyle and the Swilly and around the coast. It is also difficult for their spouses who often have to sit at home wondering when the fishermen will return and worrying about the difficult seas they will encounter. Any measure therefore that seeks to ease the process and incorporates supports for fishermen where they believe things are not right with an appeals mechanism is most welcome. The fishing industry is happy with this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to extend and strengthen the sea fisheries legislation. While its primary purpose is to provide for the establishment of the independent statutory appeals process for licensing of sea fishing boats, I am glad it goes beyond that. The Minister pointed out that this process has been in operation in a non-statutory form since 25 November last year. An independent lawyer, Niall Beirne of the Law Library, has filled this position and it is important that people have recourse to such a person. It is important that somebody is available who is independent and is seen by the organisation to be independent when dealing with members' queries.</P>
      <P>My query is whether it will be necessary to license our boats. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, with the rest of the Cabinet to work hard to ensure that the marine remains a focus not only of the Irish Government but at European level. A time might come when we will not need an appeals or licensing system. The way things are going at present there might not be any boats going out to fish. The fight must continue in Brussels to ensure we will have boats to license.</P>
      <P>We worked hard to get a white fish fleet renewal scheme. Of the 32 boats in the scheme, 16 were in Donegal and of that 16, six were in Greencastle. This was an important health and safety issue. In my first year as an Opposition Deputy I regularly tried to impress on the then Minister, former Deputy Barrett, the fact that the age of the fleet was between 35 and 50 years. Progress was made under the last Administration and not only were new boats provided in the fleet but support mechanisms were provided for second-hand boats to be made more modern, better equipped and safer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> Now that we have addressed the safety issue and have safer, more efficient and better boats for fishing, many boats in the fleet are not being allowed to fish. That issue is particularly strong in my constituency and it will become more important in other coastal areas. People will begin to take notice of it next year in other parts of the country. I ask the Minister of State to work with the Minister and to look at what was agreed in Johannesburg. Deputy Ryan spoke earlier about conservation. Most fishermen do not disagree with the thrust towards conservation so long as the measures proposed are in the interests of conservation. I say that in the context of this Bill enabling Ireland to give effect to the 1995 United Nations agreement concerning conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks and those vulnerable to over-fishing. There should be a concerted international effort to protect such stocks.</P>
    <P>In regard to cod stocks, we face a serious situation which needs to be addressed, but it should be called what it is. I do not believe that the most recent decision to close a section of area six is true conservation. We need to invest money in research to examine this carefully because there are parts of area six in which there never was and never will be cod, as well as areas with spawning grounds and juvenile areas. I appeal to the Minister of State to dispatch a research vessel to area six to look at where the spawning grounds and juvenile areas are, put the statistical information together and go back to Europe armed with the results. We must deal with the situation realistically.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are going out not to catch cod because they cannot put a notice on their nets asking cod not to apply. They know from experience that cod will not be caught in certain areas but they are being penalised with days at sea and smaller mesh sizes when the responsible fishermen know where they should and should not be fishing. This cannot be done by Ireland alone &ndash; we cannot expect our fishermen to keep out of closed areas when the rest of the European fleet can fish there. This must be an EU-wide measure which is respected around the coastline. Our fishermen are interested in conservation so we should produce the research and proof to tell fishermen that certain spawning areas or juvenile areas are being closed, thereby putting the onus back on them not to enter them. As fishermen in Greencastle have been saying for years, enough protection is provided by the various detection equipment on vessels so it should be easy to enforce closed-off areas.</P>
    <P>A wind farm has been proposed in the mouth of the River Foyle where there is a strong wild salmon fishery. This is supposedly protected by the EU and under-exploited by ourselves, yet the wind farm developers extol the virtues of the sanctuary effect that will be created by the wind farms. This means that when the smolts arrive at the wind farm, they will not go any further but <Col N="988" /> swim around only to be eaten by bigger fish. Salmon are tagged in the river in my area and it has been proven that they come back to within 100 yards of where they were born. If they go past an electro-magnetic field like the wind farm, is there proof it will not distort their ability to find their way back and will the salmon fishery survive? I ask the Minister of State, the Minister for Communication, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach to rally together to ensure it is clearly made known that we find this unacceptable, that we need more information and that we need to know what the effect will be on our salmon stocks. We have done research and we have plans to develop our salmon fisheries. The locks agency is working hard to ensure we have a fishery.</P>
    <P>Just before Christmas I stood in the Reelin River with water up to my knees at the salmon spawning location. This should not be allowed to disappear because of 85 30-storey wind turbines that could have been located somewhere else. Furthermore, these are of no ecological or other advantage to the Republic.</P>
    <P>I do not mind sea-fishery enforcement being strengthened if we have done our best to give the fishermen a level playing field. I ask the Minister of State to look at the situation on Lough Swilly &ndash; there is a great deal of activity, including commercial and leisure, but there is no overall plan. There is also some activity on the River Foyle and, in that context, I ask the Minister of State to progress the updating of the Foyle fishery legislation so the activity can take place in a planned and progressive manner. I ask that the Swilly be examined in the same context. There are oyster beds and mussel beds, commercial fishermen and anglers, people involved in the RNLI and the whitefish fleet, yachting, jet-skiing and swimming. These cannot co-exist in a safe manner unless we develop a coherent plan. We should look at what is happening in the likes of Lough Swilly, decide whether it is acceptable and develop an overall plan of how we can work as best we can.</P>
    <P>The Foyle supports the car ferry, has potential for cruise liners and features various forms of aquaculture. Aquaculture is currently unlicensed because we waited for two Governments to progress the legislation, then because of the Good Friday Agreement it was left to the Northern Executive to bring this forward. The Executive is not operational at present. I have asked the Secretary of State, Mr. Paul Murphy, to advance the legislation in the absence of the Executive but that is not the best way to advance legislation &ndash; the best way is through people working locally. At least when the Executive was working, one could have a discussion with the Minister &ndash; in this case, Bríd Rogers &ndash; about the solutions. This cannot continue indefinitely. If the legislation can be expedited by the Secretary of State it should be.</P>
    <P>Fishermen have a difficult life. I would like to see our fishing industry expand but we have problems because of decisions taken before Christmas <Col N="989" /> on the sea and land. I ask that the Minister of State works with his senior colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Couglan, and the Taoiseach to examine the on-shore effects of these decisions. The Minister has been good in facilitating interested parties to put their case and they have had meetings with numerous other Ministers. However, their issues are only an example of what the rest of the country might face in years to come unless these problems are addressed now. We must believe we can provide solutions to many of the problems we will have in the future. That will come down to research and to being able to progress on the basis of facts and statistics.</P>
    <P>Fishermen, statisticians and legislators should work together and the European Union should work with us. It is not in the best interests of anyone that some people would try to conserve stocks while others would do what is best politically for themselves, which is what I consider is the current position.</P>
    <P>Many good points were made in Johannesburg about conservation and sustainable development up to 2015 and beyond. However, when it comes to working together in Brussels to a deadline, which is usually around Christmas, people consider what they need themselves and real conservation is not taken into account. It is a case of every one for himself or herself, and that is wrong. People should consider the bigger picture. The Common Fisheries Policy needs to be properly reviewed to take account of conservation because we want fishing for life, not only for the next five to ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá lúcháir orm an deis seo a bheith agam cupla focal a rá faoin mBille tábhachtach seo. Tá sé tábhachtach chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le iarthar na hÉireann agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an gcondae arb as mé féin agus Deputy Keaveney.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill, which provides for the introduction of two major measures. It provides for the establishment of an independent appeals process for sea fishing boat licensing and a conservation measure or giving effect to the 1982 UN agreement concerning the preservation of fish populations. Both measures are long overdue. It is a great disservice to our fishing industry, a great natural resource we have had for many generations, that these measures were not introduced before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly delighted that at long last transparency, fairness and a sense of matters being above board has been introduced in approving and granting licences for fishing boats. I have been a member of this House for 20 years and I am aware of a scandal that has been going on for that period and for 20 years before that. <Col N="990" /> When honest members of coastal communities applied for licences for small fishing boats, it is scandalous that their securing a licence was pot luck in that sometimes their applications were approved and sometimes they were not, in which case they were not given an adequate explanation as to why they were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>I know of many people who had to emigrate from coastal communities, such as the one in which I live, simply because they did not have the connections to get the required fishing licence that would allow them to earn a livelihood. I am sure the Minister of State and Deputy O'Donovan are aware that fishing licences are a valuable commodity on the open market. The way fishing licences were granted in the past was scandalous. I welcome the establishment of the appeals process, which will result in procedures being above board.</P>
    <P>I am old enough to remember a time when if one was unsuccessful in securing planning permission from the local authority, one contacted the Minister who had the power, the authority and the gall to grant or refuse such planning permission. When one observes the planning permissions that were granted in some parts of the country, it makes one wonder. An Bord Pleanála was then established. I do not agree 100% with all its decisions, but at least I do not believe that all its decisions are politically motivated, which is good.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, I recall the Minister for Justice of the day had a major say in prosecutions, in which, as Deputy O'Donovan who is a legal person would know, solicitors, barristers and senior counsel got the briefs. We have departed from that, thank God. This is the last bastion of political patronage. It is about time it was ended and for that reason I welcome this measure.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations last December, with which I will deal later, when a great deal was sold out and many restrictions introduced, a concession was given to the Minister in Brussels that all fishing craft under 12 metres would be given a licence and a quota. I understand that is the position and that application forms in this respect are being issued to members of fishing communities. When the owners of these small craft were obliged to register their craft, we thought it was ridiculous that small boats &ndash; 20 to 30 foot boats &ndash; had to be registered. It was all right to register them, but the cost of doing so was astronomical. There is sometimes no point in registering in that one will not get a licence unless one has tonnage, and the cost is &euro;4,000 to &euro;5,000 per tonne. Since this regulation was implemented, people in my constituency and other coastal communities last year and the year before thought they had better comply <Col N="991" /> with the law and abide by the regulations, and they borrowed £30,000 to £50,000 to register a small craft. I could name those involved.</P>
    <P>I contacted the Department only last week on behalf of a poor fisherman in my constituency. He has a small boat and it cost him &euro;50,000 to get the required tonnage in order that he could earn a livelihood. If that man had decided to hold out until after the negotiations in Brussels last December, he would be entitled to get that tonnage free gratis today. Being the law abiding man he is &ndash; there are many more like him &ndash; he decided to make the investment. Will that man be refunded his &euro;50,000 investment, given that those who did not invest in the required tonnage will now get it free gratis? It will be unfair if my constituent and others who bought tonnage do not get a refund on their investment. I welcome the establishment of the independent appeals process.</P>
    <P>The other measure introduced in the Bill relates to conservation. We all know that fish is a renewal asset and is one of our most valuable natural resources. Coming from a fishing community, I believe that fishermen are more concerned and aware of the needs of conservation and preservation than many others, including some of those who write the rules and regulations in Brussels. They know that their livelihoods and those of their children and future generations depend on adequate fish stocks. We must allow fish species to spawn. Fishermen are adherents to, supporters of and firm believers in conservation.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the EU fisheries meeting at the end of last year were a major disappointment. They have been potentially devastating for small fishing communities along our western seaboard, from Donegal to Kerry. This measure is being introduced in the interests of conservation but as Deputy Keaveney said, it is a blunt instrument to address this necessary requirement. Fishermen in the north-west who have been fishing for generations will now be restricted to nine days fishing per month in the interests of conservation. In what other profession or walk of life could one survive on the equivalent of nine days fishing per month? This measure is crazy. I do not know how the Minister accepted this terrible restriction. I agree with Deputy Keaveney that our scientists and fishermen should be allowed to carry out their own measures of conservation. This conservation measure is a blunt instrument. There is consternation about this throughout Donegal. For the first time ever the entire fishing organisation in the county went to the Council last week and put its case on record.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I intend to share time with Deputies Seán Crowe, Paudge Connolly, Joe Higgins, Jerry Cowley and John Gormley. I have ten minutes. In April 2001, I moved a neutrality Bill in the Dáil, and I pledged that when we had sufficient strength in the House we would progress it to Second Stage. I am glad to do so now, and the very strength in numbers of those progressive parties and Independent Deputies here today who support Irish neutrality is itself a testament to the growing demand of the Irish people for truly independent Irish foreign policy.</P>
      <P>The Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2003 could not be more timely. Last weekend witnessed the largest political demonstrations in Ireland and around the world in our lifetimes. None of us will ever forget the sight of 100,000 people transforming the streets of our capital city and demanding that the Irish Government oppose the threatened US-British war on Iraq. These were not people marching for material gain or sectoral interests. This was a demonstration of selflessness and idealism and a declaration that the policy and actions of the Irish Government should be, in the words of Article 29.1 of the Constitution, &ldquo;founded on international justice and morality&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Government has strayed very far from the principles set out in Article 29. Throughout its two terms of office since 1997, it has steadily eroded Irish neutrality and independent foreign policy. This was done by joining NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace without the referendum promised by the Taoiseach, by signing the treaties of Amsterdam and Nice and, most recently and most shamefully, by the Government's conduct in the current international crisis. Irish neutrality is in tatters after the Government's mishandling of international affairs and this Bill is designed to re-establish our neutrality on a solid foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to mollify public opinion when it entered NATO's PFP in 1999, the Department of Foreign Affairs issued an explanatory guide which makes interesting reading today. It stated that Ireland had never been &ldquo;morally indifferent <Col N="993" /> to the major international and security challenges of the day&rdquo;. Yet what can we call the attitude of this Government now but &ldquo;morally indifferent&rdquo;? There is no basis of principle for its policy and it acts not only as if it were already a member of NATO but a member of the US-British faction of that now divided camp.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has stated: &ldquo;Irish military neutrality is a policy to which this Government is deeply attached. It is a policy espoused by successive Irish Governments and its core defining characteristic is non-membership of military alliances.&rdquo;  Very well, then. If that is the case, let the Minister of State's Government support and, indeed, adopt this Bill. I would be happy to hand it to him.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Bill's provisions. Article 28 of the Constitution currently reads: &ldquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  We seek to amend Article 28 to read: &ldquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war or other armed conflict, nor aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for war or other armed conflict, or conduct of war or other armed conflict, save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  It has been argued that the Government is already in breach of Article 28 as it stands by facilitating US troops and military material at Shannon. The Hague Convention in Chapter 1 on the rights and duties of neutral powers, Article 5, states that a neutral power must not allow belligerents to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across its territory. The Government is in clear breach of the Hague Convention. It may claim that war has not commenced, but the US and Britain are already carrying out bombing raids on Iraq. If a full-scale attack commences and the Government continues to allow the use of Shannon, it will definitely be in breach of the Hague Convention.</P>
    <P>It is felt necessary to include the words &ldquo;or other armed conflict&rdquo; because the definition of war in international law may be too narrow. I cite the example of Vietnam, where the US was never technically at war with the north Vietnamese. This matter has been considered by the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution in discussions on its draft report on Government, which is covered by Article 28. It has been proposed that the words &ldquo;other armed conflict&rdquo; be added to 28.3.1º.</P>
    <P>Our proposed amendment seeks to put the responsibility of Government beyond doubt. It would prevent a Government acting as this one has done without a vote of the Dáil. The kind of underhand and dishonest approach we have seen would be precluded because the Government would be accountable to this House. Taken together with our proposed amendment to Article 29, the new Article 28.1 would ensure that Governments in future adhere to neutrality in policy and in practice.</P>
    <P>Article 29.1 of the Constitution reads: &ldquo;Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and <Col N="994" /> friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.&rdquo;  Article 29.2 reads: &ldquo;Ireland affirms its adherence to the principles of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.&rdquo;  We seek to insert a new Article 29.3 as follows: &ldquo;Ireland affirms that it is a neutral State. To this end the State shall, in particular, maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances.&rdquo;  This is the key provision of the Bill and would write neutrality into the Constitution for the first time. It is straightforward, as constitutional provisions should be. It is also in line with what the Government claims is its policy &ndash; non-membership of military alliances.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that while the Government claims to follow a policy of non-membership of military alliances, it does not set out the case for non-membership. Why does it not join NATO? It is not sufficient simply to say that it will not join. It must give reasons, or else its failure to do so will be interpreted as preparation for eventual entry. NATO is a nuclear-armed military alliance of the wealthiest states in the world which are using economic and military might to maintain their dominance on this planet. It is an engine of injustice which produces poverty and inequality on a vast scale as military budgets devour the resources that should be used for a war on poverty and hunger. The military budget of the United States now stands at almost $400 billion dollars and Britain's is currently $38 billion dollars.</P>
    <P>The end of the Cold War should also have marked the end of NATO and a renewal of the United Nations in its role of providing collective security. Instead, we have seen the authority of the UN further eroded as the dominant powers on the Security Council assert their privileged position, and never more so than in the present crisis. Ireland should lead the way in working for a reformed and strengthened United Nations. That would be positive neutrality and independent foreign policy in action. Some argue that what is needed is common defence among the EU states to counterbalance the US, and successive EU treaties have been bringing us in that direction. The last thing we need, however, is more military alliances and power blocs, and that is what the EU is sadly becoming.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides a foundation stone for what could be a new Irish approach to international relations. So how do we build the new structure? We propose that neutrality should be written into the Constitution as provided for in this Bill. We should implement it with Government policy and legislation. The legislation would, for example, prevent the transport of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons through our territory and airspace and allow for inspection of aircraft and ships. We should withdraw from NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace and from the EU's Rapid Reaction Force. We should campaign for a reformed and strengthened United Nations as the real guarantor of collective security. The UN <Col N="995" /> should be the site of our engagement on international security and peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom an Bille seo a mholadh don Dáil agus iarraim ar gach Teachta tacú leis. Is féidir linn, faoi dheireadh, an neodracht a chur sa Bhunreacht.

Beidh an Bunreacht mar bunús do pholasaí an Rialtais amach anseo. Is féidir linn é sin a dhéanamh leis an mBille agus molaim é don Dáil.</P>
    <P>Such is the importance of this issue that Sinn Féin has chosen its first opportunity of Private Members' time to promote and encourage all-party support for this proposal. I appeal to the Minister not to amend or challenge this Bill but to adopt it instead. We should stand together on this important issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment to the Constitution we put before the House tonight will allow us to stop &ndash; indeed reverse &ndash; the trend towards the elimination of Irish neutrality. The concept of establishing a free, independent militarily neutral state long predates the Second World War and is deeply ingrained in Irish history, particularly, I am proud to say, in the republican socialist tradition. The father of Irish Republicanism, Wolfe Tone, called for Irish neutrality in the face of an impending war between Britain and Spain in the 1790s. The commitment to Irish neutrality and independence was maintained in the 19th century by the Young Irelanders and was built on by the Irish Republican Brotherhood.</P>
      <P>Arthur Griffith, who went on to found Sinn Féin, co-founded the Irish Neutrality Association to make the case that the war between Britain and the Boers should not involve the use of Irish soldiers as cannon fodder. James Connolly argued against involvement in the First World War and did everything he could to keep Irish people out of it. The maxim of the Irish Citizen Army, &ldquo;We serve neither King nor Kaiser but Ireland&rdquo; summed up the feeling at the time. In August 1916 Roger Casement spoke of &ldquo;These artificial and unnatural wars, prompted by greed of power, are the source of all misery now destroying mankind.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Neutrality continued after the war. It is only by looking back over the years that we can see how clearly our neutrality has deteriorated. Our neutrality has been taken away, not as a result of any one decision or following public debate, but bit by bit until we reached the stage where we were told by politicians and so-called intellectuals that our neutrality no longer makes sense. Politicians have stolen Irish neutrality from the people. Successive Governments have sold Irish neutrality piece by piece against the wishes of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> More than 100,000 men and women marched past Leinster House last Saturday and I congratulate everyone who took an active part in that demonstration and the organisers for making the day such a success. Was the Taoiseach listening? Were those others, who have long claimed our neutrality was an anachronism, watching the television reports that night? Men and women who have never taken part in a protest in their lives flocked to Dublin in the hope that the Government would finally listen to the people on neutrality. They know we are assisting in a war which can have nothing but disastrous consequences for the Iraqi people and others living in the region. The World Health Organisation has estimated there may be as many as 500,000 casualties. The Government tells us that playing our part in the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent people does not, and will not, affect Irish neutrality. The Government is, not for the first time, lying to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>As if part-paying for America's build-up to war was not bad enough, we now have the surreal situation where Irish troops, whose first responsibility is supposed to be to protect the Irish people from foreign threats, are being deployed to protect foreign troops against the Irish people, more than 100,000 of whom marched in Dublin and Belfast last Saturday.</P>
    <P>Oil is fuelling the drive to war on Iraq. It is a war of aggression and domination. It is in the purest sense what Jacques Delors referred to in 1991 as a 'resource war'. I ask Members on all sides of the House who are concerned about this matter to speak out on it. I know there are Members who would have gone on the March on Saturday if they were allowed. They have a responsibility to speak out and they will have an opportunity to do so tomorrow and to vote to accept this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that things have changed since 11 September 2001. I welcome this debate because our neutrality has been taken for granted. In eight days last month 19 aircraft carrying weapons or munitions of war sought, and were granted, permission to land at Shannon Airport. In all of last year only 30 aircraft were given permission to carry weapons or munitions. It is known that 532 other military aircraft, mainly American, used Shannon Airport last year. I am concerned about this support in the build-up to war and the assistance offered by refuelling facilities at Shannon. Turning a blind eye to the transport of weapons and munitions is at odds with Ireland's neutrality. Is Ireland really neutral?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people should have an opportunity to vote on this issue. Ireland is supposed to be neutral, yet all this is happening at Shannon Airport. We have had no say on this matter. Those at the peace camp are there because they believe this interferes with our neutrality. While I do not condone damaging an aeroplane, these people feel strongly opposed to the build-up to war. I know we have responsibilities arising from our membership of the international community but <Col N="997" /> people feel we have gone further than we should. As elected representatives of the people, Members should have had a say in this matter but we have not had that.</P>
    <P>The Hague Convention grounds our neutrality and neutrality is underlined in the Constitution. What is happening at Shannon demonstrates our neutrality is not straightforward. It is time for us to look at the issue of Irish neutrality. I hope that in the future Ireland will be known as a country that abhors war and does nothing to help in the build-up to it. I am not anti-American. The people who marched in Dublin at the weekend felt that what is happening at Shannon is wrong and wanted the Government to listen to them. Perhaps this debate will initiate a process that ensures our neutrality is maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as an announcement of the will of the people to enshrine the policy of military neutrality in our Constitution as evidenced by the massive display of their distaste for war in the march in Dublin on Saturday, conservatively estimated to have been attended by 100,000 people.</P>
      <P>During the Nice referendum campaign, speakers on the Government side went to extraordinary lengths to reassure us that our traditional neutrality was not at risk and that we were voting to copperfasten it. We now know how hollow that declaration was, given the continuous and surreptitious collusion by the Government in the massive United States war build-up in the past four months. It permitted the unfettered use of Shannon Airport by US airforce planes which continued to carry armed military personnel and munitions until the force of public opinion caused it to use long-established application procedures.</P>
      <P>One of the earliest known advocates of the neutrality policy was a President of the USA. He signed a neutrality declaration stating that the USA would sincerely and with good faith adopt and pursue a strict code of conduct of being friendly and impartial towards belligerent powers. He cautioned all US citizens to avoid acts which contravened such a disposition and to observe their conduct towards the belligerent powers respectfully. He stated that penalties, punishment or forfeiture would follow breaches of his declaration and that such breaches included aiding and abetting hostilities or carrying contraband between the belligerent powers. The US President in question was no bible-thumping, hell-raising, draft-dodging oil man from Texas but was none other than General George Washington whose motives were the purest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Washington was so punch drunk from the American War of Independence that he resolved that armed conflict would be a thing of the past. He issued his neutrality declaration in 1793 when France was at war with the combined forces of Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Were his decree to be in force in Ireland, it would result in the Taoiseach appearing in the dock accompanied by <Col N="998" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence, the Ministers of State at their Departments and a number of close advisers. No doubt the appropriate penalties would apply for aiding and abetting the belligerent power. Would that George Washington were around today to restore a modicum of sanity to a situation that could culminate in Armageddon, such is the massive build-up of US military might.</P>
    <P>Our duty as a neutral nation is to refrain from participation in a war between other states and to maintain an impartial attitude towards the belligerents. Under international law, neutrality is not to be confused with non-alignment. When hostilities commence, a non-belligerent state issues a proclamation of neutrality. It is then the duty of the neutral nation to observe strict impartiality in its relations with the warring nations. That is not to say that neutrality can be switched on or off like an electric light bulb. One looks at Switzerland as an example of a perpetually neutral state.</P>
    <P>At the Second Hague Conference on Neutrality in 1907, neutral rights and obligations were defined in two conventions. The general neutrality convention, after declaring neutral territory inviolable, laid down regulations for neutral states and listed acts that should not be regarded as favouring one of the belligerents. The second, fuller convention elaborated on the duties of neutrals in naval war. It is ironic that the United States, which was not a member of the League of Nations, asserted its intentions to remain aloof from all wars. In 1935, the US adopted the Neutrality Act.</P>
    <P>I favour presenting to the mature judgment of the people the option of inserting neutrality in Bunreacht na hÉireann to enshrine in it the principle of non-partisanship and impartial mediation in military conflicts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this discussion. I will vote for the Bill because I agree with the spirit of it, although in the case of the Socialist Party, I would require much stiffer tests than the assent of Dáil Éireann as to what might constitute a war that could be supported.</P>
      <P>It is outrageous that the Government facilitates the build-up to a war on Iraq by assisting the United States war machine in Shannon Airport in conflict with the stated views of the people. We cannot, even in the case of the imminent war in Iraq, trust the majority in Dáil Éireann, held by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. I have no doubt that they would vote in favour of the United States launching a war on Iraq, especially if the United Nations Security Council gave it a rubber stamp, but even perhaps without it. The Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Parties are ideologically aligned with the United States economic system and, therefore, the administrations that dominate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the wake of the historic mobilisation of the people and similar protests worldwide on Saturday, strenuous efforts have been made by the <Col N="999" /> main Government party to cover its tracks in the blatant violation of any concept of neutrality that a person could understand. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, was sent out a few days ago to go on radio to respond to the situation. He cooed like a turtle dove.</P>

      <P>I waited to hear the flutter of wings as he tried to identify himself with the masses who marched, while at the same time doing the impossible and defending Government policy. We cannot trust the majority comprising the two Government parties.</P>
      <P>We have had the spectacle of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government making up the rules as it went along in the past six to seven months, or, more correctly, flagrantly flouting and breaking them with abandon as it allowed aeroplanes with armed US military personnel on board to go through Shannon Airport in contravention of the applicable regulations and countless other aeroplanes to go through with unknown cargoes, unknown because the Government did not send in a single inspector to see whether regulations were being breached. The policy of the Government is to actively facilitate the United States war machine in its build-up for an attack on Iraq. I hope we will hear a great deal more in the next few days about the issue revealed today of the overflights, for which the Government is paying the costs, and that taxpayers make their anger clearly known regarding that.</P>
      <P>The Government employs all types of double standards in the present crisis, parrots the United States line and does not take an independent position, covers over the glaring anomalies in the situation, places the disarmament of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship as the priority because of his allegedly having weapons of mass destruction, turns a blind eye to the more heavily and dangerously armed Israeli state which routinely goes outside its borders to crush innocent people striving for their independence and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the issue of Irish neutrality could not be more timely, given the build-up to a full scale war on Iraq and the Government's assistance to the American war effort. This has led to increasing opposition to the war, which culminated last Saturday in the biggest peace demonstration this country has ever seen. The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government has managed in its own peculiar way to put a spin on this march. The Minister for State, Deputy Kitt, told us the march was in line with Government policy. Yesterday and again today the Taoiseach informed us that the march was for peace, he was for peace and the Government was for peace, therefore those on the march and the Government were all singing from the same hymn sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not wonderful? Why therefore were Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats not officially represented at the march? I do not want to be too hard on the Taoiseach because I know he has difficulties sometimes telling the difference between fact and fiction. I did not get the impression that those on the march were supportive of the Government. Several speakers last Saturday demanded that the Government get off the fence. They demanded an end to the fudge and called on the Government to stop assisting the US war effort by offering the facilities at Shannon.</P>
      <P>The 100,000 people who marched wanted Ireland to act like a neutral country. They know now, as do the many people who did not attend the march, that the promises made at the time of the Nice treaty referendum to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution were entirely bogus. The Seville declaration meant nothing. The constitutional amendment proposed by the Government does not protect Irish neutrality. It leaves the door open for us to join NATO. The Green Party repeated this many times during the campaign and, I am afraid, we have been proved right.</P>
      <P>Since Christmas, Government rhetoric on neutrality has changed subtly but perceptibly. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has emphasised that we are not neutral but militarily neutral. This phrase is unique to this country and is the sort of Irish solution to an Irish problem that has typified Irish foreign policy for decades. To any impartial or objective observer, it means we are not yet members of a military alliance, but everything else goes. Our neutral and unaligned colleagues in the European Union can only look on with a sense of incredulity and a certain sense of bemusement as we bend over backwards to give every assistance to the United States. Austria, Sweden and Finland could not and would not facilitate the American war effort in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years these countries have conducted an open and honest debate on membership of NATO. Some of their conservative parties have <Col N="1001" /> even advocated joining NATO. No such debate has taken place here, nor is it likely to. Instead we will become part of a military alliance by stealth. We do not require a referendum to join NATO. This Bill will close this loophole. Neutrality is not defined in the Constitution or in law. The lack of definition has given the Government considerable latitude and allows it to conduct foreign policy in a way that seems entirely incompatible with any notion of neutrality.</P>
    <P>How does our present stance comply, for instance, with the Hague convention on neutrality, which has been mentioned by certain speakers? Article 2 of that convention states: &ldquo;Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral power.&rdquo;  However, we see what is going on in Shannon. Article 11 states: &ldquo;A neutral power which receives on its territory troops belonging to the belligerent armies shall intern them, as far as possible, at a distance from the theatre of war.&rdquo;  I look forward to our troops going to Shannon and arresting the American troops and bringing them to the Curragh. I will not hold my breath, but if we were complying with this convention, this would happen.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to stop the pretence and double speak. The Government should let us have clarity and come clean with the people. If it believes neutrality is an outdated concept, it should say so. Although I disagree with it profoundly, that is a view I can respect. The amendments to the Constitution as proposed in the Bill, and in a previous Green Party Bill, give us clarity and by doing so they flush out the secret militarists and warmongers from their burrows. They have been exposed as dissemblers whose duplicity has so annoyed the Irish people. This Bill gives the opportunity for Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats backbenchers to have the courage of their convictions. If any of them truly believe in neutrality, they will support the Bill. Are they happy to go along with the Government, which has done more than any other to dismantle Irish neutrality?</P>
    <P>It signed up to the Amsterdam treaty and the creation of the European Rapid Reaction Force and the Petersberg Tasks. It signed up to NATO's Partnership for Peace, without the referendum it had promised. It signed up to the Nice treaty and I have no doubt it will sign up to the new constitution with its commitment to a European arms agency and the new solidarity clause. Is it not the case that the Government will not and cannot accept the Bill before us because it has made these commitments in the past and is likely to make commitments in the future?</P>
    <P>No doubt the Government will vehemently deny this as it always does, but the present crisis has revealed a level of complicity, particularly with the US military, which even the most committed neutralist could not have foreseen. In answer to a parliamentary question on 26 November, the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me <Col N="1002" /> that no arms were being transported through Shannon. Later he was forced to concede that side arms were being carried. His admission only came after airport personnel had witnessed the weapons. The Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973 and the Defence Act 1954, section 3(1)(7), were only signed in January, despite the fact that troops and munitions had been going through Shannon for months in the build up for this war. This demonstrates a readiness to flout our laws and our constitutional commitment to the peaceful resolution of international disputes. It is an indication that our foreign policy is being dictated by the White House. It is proof once again &ndash; if it were ever required &ndash; that we are closer to Boston than Berlin.</P>
    <P>Our response to Berlin and Paris has been mealy-mouthed. The Taoiseach even went as far as to state that he would have had no difficulty signing a letter by &ldquo;new Europe&rdquo;, to quote Donald Rumsfeld, in support of the American position. The letter was divisive for Europe. The prime movers were the British who did not even have the courtesy to inform the Greek Presidency.</P>
    <P>I have been greatly encouraged by the commitment to peace displayed by Germany and, in particular, by its Green Party Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Joschka Fischer. I have disagreed with him in the past on some issues, but in relation to the Iraqi crisis, he has been the embodiment of political courage and vision. He is the one statesman who has stood up to the small-minded and bullying Mr. Donald Rumsfeld. Where was neutral Ireland all this time? It was hiding. There was an opportunity for Ireland to be strong, display our neutral credentials and be an advocate for &ldquo;old Europe&rdquo;, but it did not happen.</P>
    <P>The split between &ldquo;new Europe&rdquo; and &ldquo;old Europe&rdquo; is not simply a split between pro or anti-war factions; it is more accurately a split between the NATOists, if I can call them that, and those who advocate an independent European common defence. From the most recent events it is clear that NATO is in the ascendancy despite what is perceived as the recalcitrance of France. More significantly the statement of Mr. Gustav Haglund, chairman of the EU military committee, that NATO and the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, would be merged within a decade shows that a common European defence will be under the auspices of NATO. The cost implications of either option are enormous.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on those who support greater military spending to state clearly the areas in which they would cut expenditure. The 100,000 people who marched on Saturday are proud to be neutral and do not want money to be spent on weapons which will blow up Iraqi women and children. They are men and women who are committed to a better quality of life for their children and future generations. They are committed to <Col N="1003" /> neutrality and want the House and the Government to be so committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand by the comments I made about those who marched on Saturday during a radio debate with Deputy Gormley and reiterate that the Government fully shares the wishes of the people to avoid war. This is an important debate and I thank Deputies for tabling this legislation as their first Private Members' Bill.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to the reasons the Government opposes the legislation. I hope I will receive the same hearing I gave Deputies during this debate which has been very useful so far. Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality, as followed by successive Governments, is fully respected, protected and upheld by the amendment to the Constitution approved by the electorate only last autumn. This confirmed the central and defining characteristic of policy in this area, that is, our non-participation in military alliances. A commitment was made not to enter into a common defence arrangement in the European Union unless the people decide otherwise in a referendum.</P>
      <P>Ireland's policy of military neutrality, embodied by non-membership of military alliances, remains viable in the post-Cold War environment in which the emerging defence and security challenges have moved away from traditional defence towards crisis management. That does not mean we need to give this policy constitutional backing. Such a step has not been considered since the 1937 Constitution came into effect. This has been for good reason and I see no basis to alter the approach taken in this regard by successive Governments through several decades.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin and his party are well aware that the State's commitment to keep outside of military alliances has never been more secure. If this was in doubt &ndash; I do not believe it was &ndash; the position was reinforced by the constitutional amendment passed at the same time as the people approved the Nice treaty last October. I remind the Deputy that Ireland may not join an EU common defence and this will not change unless approved by the people. Why then has the Bill been introduced in this format at this stage? It is a blatant attempt to confuse the public, spread doubt and misinformation and portray the Government as somehow soft on the question of neutrality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an effort should not be permitted to succeed for several reasons. To name but one, the Government has done more than any <Col N="1004" /> other to uphold our policy of military neutrality over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>What about Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>In doing so, it has been conscious of the complexities in the international security environment stemming from the end of the Cold War and of the need to move on from static certainties which no longer hold true. No practical purpose is served by the proposals put forward by Deputy Ó Caoláin other than, as I will seek to explain, that they would see Ireland adopt an inward looking and narrow interpretation of our international responsibilities. This runs contrary to all that is positive in Ireland's outlook and engagement on international issues.</P>
      <P>Post-independence neutrality originated as an important expression of our sovereignty. Neutrality became practically possible with the return by Britain of the treaty ports in 1938. It is notable, however, that in presenting this to the Dáil, Eamon de Valera emphasised sovereignty rather than neutrality. The history of Europe from 1935 to 1945 showed clearly that military neutrality on its own is not sufficient to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally. It is necessary to work actively for international peace and security, taking account of the prevailing circumstances. In advocating to the Dáil in 1946 that Ireland seek membership of the United Nations, for instance, Eamon de Valera emphasised this reality and stated that &ldquo;small nations have a particular reason for wishing to have security maintained by combined or collective effort&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since then, our commitment to collective security has been traditionally pursued though the United Nations. We regard the United Nations as the centre of this system of collective security. We attach particular importance to the role of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. In carrying out its duties under this responsibility, the council is acting on behalf of the entire membership of the United Nations. This is a clear obligation on all states.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position in this regard has many points of reference with that of the other European neutral and non-aligned states. Like Ireland, Sweden pursues a policy of non-participation in military alliances and its security policy is described as &ldquo;non-aligned in peacetime, neutral in war&rdquo;. This makes it possible for Sweden to remain neutral in the event of conflicts in this vicinity. This is entirely an autonomous Swedish policy with no constitutional underpinning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor does Finland rely on a constitutional basis for its approach in this area. The Finns describe themselves as non-aligned rather than neutral and maintain that a cornerstone of their security policy is a credible defence capability. Austria's position is somewhat different in that it became a neutralised state in 1955 upon Soviet withdrawal from the country. It was essentially for this reason and at the behest of the Soviet Union that <Col N="1005" /> Austria adopted a constitutional statute proclaiming its neutrality in return for which the withdrawal of Soviet troops was secured. Switzerland's neutrality, on the other hand, is entirely the result of Swiss sovereign decisions. It also has a constitutional base making the country, in effect, a permanent neutral.</P>
    <P>Ireland is neither a permanent neutral nor a neutralised state, that is, Irish neutrality is not guaranteed by international treaty, nor has it a domestic constitutional or legal basis. Essentially, neutrality is a policy adopted by successive Governments. Its core defining characteristic is non-membership of military alliances. However, there is already a constitutional provision precluding the State from entering an EU common defence without a further referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply to NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Governments have also made clear that Ireland is not ideologically neutral, nor was it politically or ideologically neutral between western democracy and Soviet communism during the Cold War. For example, in 1981 the then Fianna Fáil Government, in supporting military neutrality opposed a proposal to follow a sweeping policy of neutrality in international affairs, the effect of which would have been to distance Ireland from European and North American countries.</P>
      <P>Neutrality policy has also been informed by the view that military neutrality on its own is not sufficient to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally and that it is also desirable to be a constructive international citizen. Ireland, notably through the UN, and now also through regional organisations such as the European Union, has sought to play a proactive role in preventing and managing conflicts and keeping peace.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to position our traditional policy of military neutrality in the context of the many changes which have taken place since the policy first evolved. It is possible to identify three such major developments. First, the Good Friday Agreement which provides an agreed framework for reconciling relations on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, which has been approved by the Irish people. Second, the Cold War has ended. The space which exists for neutral states to position themselves between two military power blocks has disappeared. Threats to international peace and security are increasingly random and varied events involving non-state actors such as al-Qaeda. In some instances &ndash; Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan spring to mind &ndash; the international community failed to intervene effectively at an early stage, resulting in considerable cost in terms of human life and political instability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third major change is the development of the European Union. The Union has become an increasingly coherent economic, financial and social entity based upon common values. Com<Col N="1006" /> mon citizenship has brought an increasing sense of shared identity and solidarity between the peoples of Europe.</P>
    <P>What is the significance of all these changes? Do they represent a threat to our policy of military neutrality? The short and clear answer is they do not. Rather, they serve to reinforce the fact that our neutrality policy has also been informed by the view that military neutrality on its own is not enough to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally. It is not enough, especially in the context of the fundamental challenges to global peace and security the world currently faces.</P>
    <P>Political neutrality in international affairs has never been part of Ireland's foreign policy tradition. Rather, we need to continue what we have been doing for decades and continue to play a proactive role in preventing and managing conflicts and keeping peace. I have found that our position as a militarily neutral nation has given us additional credibility in our promotion of human rights and in promoting the interests of the developing world.</P>
    <P>This is even more the case with regard to the new threats we all now face. The asymmetric threats posed by international terrorism do not lend themselves to the more clear-cut postures and responses that have so often been adopted in the past. Instead, they require a much more imaginative and creative approach. In the EU context, thought is currently being given as to how the Union should organise itself to respond to the threat from terrorism and from non-state entities. The challenge here is not only a military one. It is a matter of finding an effective means to bring together the various instruments available to the Union, both civilian and military, and harnessing them to respond to new realities. This does not mean a step towards participation in a military alliance. It is simply a common sense reaction to a potential threat that is random and varied.</P>
    <P>Moreover, our participation in the European security and defence policy is entirely consistent with this country's long record of contributing to UN peacekeeping missions. The challenges raised by the situation in the Balkans brought into sharp relief the outmoded Cold War approaches to security and defence. This was accompanied by a growing realisation that inclusive strategies of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management are a key to ensuring stability and security in Europe. Despite the best efforts of elements in the Deputy's party that would have the electorate believe otherwise, European security and defence policy has been recognised as the next logical step in the evolution of peacekeeping and crisis management operations.</P>
    <P>Following the failures on the part of the international community during the 1990s and the resulting genocides of Srebrenica and Rwanda, the UN sought to review its operations and the manner in which it approaches such situations. A clear and ongoing outcome has been greater UN <Col N="1007" /> reliance upon the capabilities and resources, both civilian and military, of organisations like the EU. Should Ireland withdraw from involvement in such operations on grounds that the requests are made of us through the EU rather than the UN? We should clearly not do so. Neutrality has never meant that we sit on our hands and tell everybody else what to do. There is no merit in seeking a higher moral ground while at the same time absolving ourselves of responsibility to maintain peace and security in the world. That has never been the policy in Ireland and it should not be part of Ireland's approach.</P>
    <P>Let us examine, however, some of the implications of putting the proposed 27th amendment into the Constitution. What would it mean in practice? Let us begin with the statement &ldquo;Ireland is a neutral state.&rdquo;  This immediately begs the question as to what is meant by the word &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;, and in the context of the Constitution, a degree of precision is required in the context of a document that is subject to judicial interpretation in the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court. A consultation with Chambers Dictionary quickly reveals some of the difficulties involved. The first reference illustrates the problem. A lengthy entry on the word &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; begins with the description &ldquo;indifferent&rdquo;. Does this sum up the position that Ireland would like to adopt in international affairs? Are we indifferent to inequality and injustice in the Third World and elsewhere? Are we indifferent to the threat posed to the world by international terrorism? Were we ideologically indifferent during the Cold War? I hope the answer to these questions is clear. None of the responses to these questions demonstrates where we would wish to see ourselves in the world, yet as a dictionary definition of neutrality, this is a potential interpretation that could be taken and everyone in this House appreciates the importance of interpretations when it comes to legislation.</P>
    <P>Reading further on, the entry includes references to &ldquo;of not decided character&rdquo;, &ldquo;having no decided colour&rdquo; and &ldquo;indistinct in sound&rdquo;. Is this the way we would wish to meet the challenges of the 20th century? If we go down the road suggested by Deputy Ó Caoláin, that is the perception and reality of the position with which we might have to cope.</P>
    <P>The incorporation of a specific reference to neutrality in the Constitution could have a serious impact on the capacity of the Government to deal with foreign policy issues. Do we consider it more desirable to have foreign policy issues settled in the Supreme Court than by the duly elected Government which, under Article 29.4.1º of the Constitution, is charged with the conduct of the external relations of the State? Do we question the trust placed in successive Governments to chart the course of Ireland's international relations to the extent that we believe the discretion in these matters should be circumscribed by the courts? In essence, we would be taking the <Col N="1008" /> highly sensitive area of foreign policy into the purview of the courts. In regard to our obligations under the UN, for instance, how would a constitutional amendment relate to the enforcement provisions of the UN Charter and our obligations under the charter should these be invoked?</P>
    <P>Our view has consistently been that the use of military force against another state, other than in self-defence, should be authorised by the UN Security Council. It is the entire membership of the United Nations, comprising almost 200 states, that has vested this authority in the council. However, it should not be forgotten that this entails acceptance of the coercive and far-reaching provisions contained in the UN Charter. If a state continues to defy the authority of the UN, there are provisions in the charter where, as a matter of last resort, military action can be authorised by the Security Council. It is with this support that the UN maintains its primacy in terms of international collective security.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is in the interests of small states that there is such a collective security concept based on international law. That is what the UN is all about. Indeed, while the common strand linking the four European Union neutral and non-aligned states is non-membership of military alliances, Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria have opted for a proactive approach to solidarity and peace by joining the UN.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of how a constitutional reference to neutrality, with all its implications of political neutrality, would square with our participation in the EU's common foreign and security policy. In parallel to the military capabilities for humanitarian and crisis management tasks which the EU is developing, the Union is also developing its capabilities for civilian crisis management and for conflict prevention. This presents an opportunity for Ireland to play a constructive role in international efforts for peace and security. If we have learned anything from the horrific events of 11 September, it is the critical importance of co-operating to enhance the prospects for peace and stability. This is a key challenge for all of us and I do not believe the Irish people would wish to shirk their responsibilities in this area. Participation does not entail any mutual defence commitments.</P>
    <P>The Deputy and others would perhaps also point to the current Iraqi crisis and to the Government's decision to allow the use of facilities at Shannon by the US. The Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined the Government's position on the use of Shannon in a detailed statement to the House on 29 January.</P>
    <P>Critics of the Government's approach have again sought to create confusion regarding the distinctions between war and provision for enforcement of international peace and stability as set out in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. As the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and other Government representatives have made clear, the UN is not a pacifist organisation. It is disingenuous that <Col N="1009" /> those who point to this fact should be branded as hawks and somehow supportive of war as the only option to resolve the continuing crisis.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to use all its influence in favour of a peaceful solution. While Ireland is no longer a member of the Security Council, we will continue our efforts through the UN, the EU and bilateral contacts with the US and others, including the countries of the region. We will draw attention to the risks involved in military action, the loss of life and material destruction, the danger of further destabilising an already volatile region, the deepening misunderstanding between the people of Islam and the rest of the world and the possible negative consequences for the struggle against terrorism.</P>
    <P>It remains the view of the Government that military action against Iraq must be undertaken only as an absolutely last resort, to be contemplated only when all other means of pressure have been exhausted. If, however, the Iraqi authorities spurn this last opportunity to meet the demands of the international community, the Security Council must, in the words of Kofi Annan, face up to its responsibilities by deciding on whatever is necessary to secure compliance. We have not yet reached that point.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's meeting of the European Council in Brussels demonstrated the broad range of agreement among our EU partners. This was reflected in the statement adopted at the end of the meeting, which Ireland made a significant contribution to shaping. Ireland's approach to the issue is very much in line with the overwhelming consensus in the Union on the issue. A united approach by the Security Council is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and therefore secure the peaceful resolution to the crisis which we all want to see. Moreover, the European Council took full account of the deep public concerns about the issue. Let me be clear that the Government fully shares the desire to avoid war.</P>
    <P>We regard the use of force as a matter of last resort as provided for in the UN Charter. War can still be avoided. Already, Resolution 1441 and the credible threat of force which underpins it has resulted in progress through the return of UN inspectors to Iraq after four years. Saddam still has a chance to comply with the demands of the Security Council, and he should do so promptly and unequivocally.</P>
    <P>It must be made clear to Saddam Hussein and to the Iraqi authorities that there is no room for further prevarication. The option to remove the threat against the ordinary Iraqi people lies with Saddam. The option to have sanctions lifted and the option for peace lies with them.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to the specific question of neutrality. In the course of this statement I have reaffirmed, on behalf of the Government, our attachment to a policy of military neutrality. That is what we subscribe to and what we will continue to advocate. This does not mean, however, that we need to insert in the Constitution a nebulous <Col N="1010" /> reference to neutrality that will only be the subject of endless misinterpretation and confusion.</P>
    <P>The Government sees no reason for a constitutional amendment as proposed by the Deputy, but I thank the Deputies for giving those of us on this side of the House the opportunity to outline our position as clearly as possible.</P>

      <P>It is depressing that we debate this motion against the background of a total derogation of the Government's duty regarding Ireland's position on the world stage. In the face of a mass military build-up in the Middle East, 100,000 people marching on the streets of Dublin and everyone glued to their televisions to find out if war has broken out, the Government has said and done absolutely nothing. It has failed to articulate a policy because it has none and it has given the distinct impression that whatever America wants, America will get.</P>
      <P>We also debate this motion against the background of an attempt by the Independent Deputies to jump on the neutrality bandwagon and portray themselves as the doves who would save Ireland's soul from the horrors of war. Fine Gael's line on neutrality, the possibility of war with Iraq and this Bill is perfectly clear. Our position is that times have changed. Threats have become more dangerous than ever and it is time to move on.</P>
      <P>Traditionally Ireland has reacted to EU issues involving security rather than staking out a position proactively. Domestic political debate on these issues has rarely got beyond either accusations of betraying Irish neutrality or safeguarding it in an ever more integrated European Union. No attempt has been made to debate the basis of Irish neutrality, perhaps because it has been associated with so many different values. Even as other political taboos have been breached, neutrality has remained the one political issue we dare not discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago, my party published its Beyond <Col N="1011" /> Neutrality document, calling for a full and frank debate on the issue of neutrality and defence. Since then we have had the events of 11 September and we in Europe have seen the Convention on Europe discuss moves towards a united approach to this issue by EU member states. Those were three wasted years, as Fianna Fáil acted as it always has on foreign policy &ndash; it waited for things to happen instead of shaping events. As the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;Let's wait and see.&rdquo;  Whether people favour it, the reality is that European defence co-operation is now up for discussion. The only question is whether Ireland chooses to help shape the nature of that co-operation or just waits for others to design the structure and then faces a take it or leave it decision. It is surely time to stop paying lip service to neutrality and to our military commitments as a member of the EU. We must get real.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has always been the party of Europe. We have always believed in Europe as a principle, whether it was popular, and Europe has been good for Ireland. We must now play our part in strengthening the European Union, particularly at this crucial time in world history. Ireland should participate fully in the development of a common EU defence and security policy.</P>
    <P>At present Ireland is the least defended state in the European Union while we also have massive levels of American investment. Were Dublin, Shannon or anywhere else in Ireland to be the target of aI-Qaeda or any other terrorist organisation we could not hope to defend ourselves and we have no prospect of fighting off an invasion of our airspace from anybody. However, one can be sure the Government and the Deputies on this side of the House who support the motion would be the first to turn to Britain, France and our other European allies, crying &ldquo;Help&rdquo;&ndash; as it stands, that cry could fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>Ireland's active participation in the development of a common EU defence and security policy gives the House and the Government a say in what Europe does on the world stage. We are all familiar with the concept of the pooling of sovereignty &ndash; EMU is the greatest example of this, and the greatest success. Common European defence means Ireland and other non-aligned countries being empowered to call the big guns of European politics to account.</P>
    <P>The current crisis in Iraq has inevitably led to a great deal of speculation about the future of Europe's defence role and a common defence policy is firmly on the agenda. Yet listening to many contributions here it is as if that has never even been thought of. What would be the outcome of such a policy were it in place today? Germany and France, which have resolutely led the call against war in Iraq, could have called Tony Blair to account for his actions in blindly supporting George W Bush. Britain would have had to meet its European allies and I do not doubt that America's strongest supporter would have pulled back from its unilateral approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> The Irish Government would have played a part in this, though not if it were the same one I face now. The people will have to wait some years more until they have a Government that leads. Fine Gael does not propose the signing of a blank cheque by Ireland &ndash; any common defence policy would see Ireland decide on a case by case basis whether we would offer members of our armed forces in a conflict. Of course, if a common defence policy were agreed that did not meet with the approval of the majority of Members of the Dáil and the people, we would not have to become members. However, we have a duty to play a part in forming the best common defence policy that we can. We are all members of the European Union. Our political opponents on both sides may like to portray our position differently but I am stating the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>Regarding the current military build-up, we have for months outlined the core elements of what should be the Irish approach to this crisis: opposition to unilateral attacks against Iraq; only multilateral action supported by the UN to be considered; prior Dáil approval for Irish refuelling or overflight facilities to be sought if multilateral action is authorised by the UN; independent verification to be sought in relation to American and British reports, as distinct from inspectors' reports, on Iraqi weapon stocks; every proactive step possible to be taken to show that we stand with civilised, democratic states and against demagogues and dictators; Ireland's security and defence needs to be reassessed; the General Affairs and External Relations Council of the EU to be asked to consider what contribution the EU will make to stability and prosperity in Iraq post-Saddam Hussein; that the alarming concerns expressed by UN inspector, Dr. Hans Blix, be raised in relation to unanswered questions concerning the possession by Iraq of weapons of mass destruction; and that Ireland unequivocally condemns the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.</P>
    <P>In expressing this approach, we stand by the vast majority of Irish people, eager to see war averted but eager too to ensure Saddam Hussein is removed from the Middle East, if not for our sake, for the sake of the Iraqi people.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Bill, the Green Party has clearly expressed support for neutrality and Fine Gael respects that position. However, when it comes to inserting a clause in the Constitution that would muzzle this House, tie the hands of the Minister and allow Ireland to stand idly by while innocent people suffer at the hands of despots and dictators, Fine Gael says &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Both within the Dáil and outside, the Green Party and Sinn Féin preyed on the fears of people during last year's Nice referendum, saying a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote would mean Irish men and women dying on battlefields. Look at what has happened &ndash; the Nice treaty was passed, enlargement has been approved and the dire predictions of the opponents of the treaty have amounted to nothing.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the next step. It is meaningless and <Col N="1013" /> pointless, yet it tries to serve its main purpose, to portray its sponsors as committed to peace and its opponents as committed to war. Fine Gael cannot and will not allow such an untruth to be put to the Irish people. My party has always believed passionately in this House, the people of Ireland, the European Union and the United Nations. These provide a framework for defence, not short-sighted amendments to the Constitution that are bad in theory and unworkable in practice.</P>

      <P>This is possibly the worst time to have a debate of this nature. If a debate on neutrality is to take place, it should be along the lines suggested by Deputy McGinley, at a time when we can calmly and coolly assess the situation and recognise that we are making a decision for present and future generations. We should not do it against a backdrop of pressure, or the threat of war or violence, but in the clear knowledge that we are meeting the requirements as we see them at a particular time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell has done a tremendous amount of work to focus attention on neutrality and its meaning. I heard my colleagues mention Arthur Griffith, one of the founder members of the organisation now known as Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>Griffith correctly assessed the situation as he saw it at that time. He did not want to see Irish people lose their lives in the Boer War when they would have been better off at home. My granduncle joined the Australian army in 1915 and landed in Gallipoli. He survived Gallipoli but unfortunately died in Ypres. My grandfather, on the other hand, was involved with the Irish Volunteers, a contradiction in terms. All of our history is a contradiction. There are circumstances where we should be able to sit down and calmly assess our situation in the knowledge that what we are doing is for the good of the people and the future of the State and not just to meet requirements as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell has set out many times the vulnerability of this country. There are those who are suggesting that this Bill should be written <Col N="1014" /> into the Constitution. What would happen if we were under attack? Who is to say that a neutral country will not be attacked in the future? What happened in the run up to the last war? Were neutral countries not sacrificed on both sides with colossal loss of life? The fact they were neutral had no bearing on the outcome of the situation. The aggressors had no mercy for them because they were neutral &ndash; they walked right over them. There are countless examples of this.</P>
    <P>We should not allow ourselves to end up in a situation like those unfortunate countries. We can say that we are on the periphery of Europe, not in its cockpit, and that we will not be caught in crossfire so readily. That was true in the past but it is not necessarily the case now. With modern technology a neutral country can quickly become a victim of terrorism. What should we do? Should we say that we are neutral and we cannot be touched? If a group hijacked a nuclear missile and dropped it on a neutral country, where would it select? It would not select a country that would strike back. Modern terrorism relies on selecting innocent targets that cannot retaliate. Terrorists believe in the legitimacy of such strikes to illustrate the legitimacy of their cause. That is a serious breach of international convention and we must be mindful of it.</P>
    <P>What if the man who was going to hijack a plane in Sweden recently had decided to plunge it into the centre of this city? Under legislation arising from the Nice treaty restricting our ability to respond to a greater extent than before, we would have to have a referendum before we could call on other people to assist us in our defence. If we did not do that, we would be in breach of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has always advised against writing things into the Constitution. The Minister of State opposite knows why we have done that and knows the wisdom of our advice.</P>

      <P>That army was not neutral. Other Irish people have displayed their valour on battlefields far from their native shores, in places like Landen and Fontenoy, and not necessarily in the <Col N="1015" /> interest of their country but in a military interest. The definition of neutrality as developed around the Second World War is not a true reflection of the meaning of neutrality. We have brought upon ourselves a one size fits all neutrality, where we can be on both sides as the situation demands. Life is not like that and that will never work.</P>
      <P>We have played a major and formative role in the emerging Europe. The degree to which we are committed to all aspects of European evolution will, in some way, determine the respect Europeans will have for us. If we wish to be like Tadhg an dá thaoibh, they will quickly recognise us as such. We must have some commitment to that European concept, which also means some involvement at some future stage in our responsibilities in relation to defence and security. It is comparable to a person who says: &ldquo;Will you carry my umbrella as it is raining very heavily?&rdquo; and the other person replies: &ldquo;I am very sorry but, while it is raining, I cannot carry your umbrella.&rdquo;  It is not much good to one at any other time. Similarly, we will be expected to carry some responsibility.</P>
      <P>That has nothing whatsoever to do with the Nice treaty but it will be a requirement at some stage in future. If we decide to opt out on the basis that we are neutral or non-aligned, or stand aloof from defence and security in Europe, we will be vulnerable and open to attack from some quarter. That need not be from a major power. It can be from somebody with a brief case filled with lethal material &ndash; it is as simple as that. We had better recognise that situation.</P>
      <P>Whatever happens in relation to neutrality, we should have a long and open debate on this matter at a time when we are not under pressure, without being press-ganged into any decision to meet a particular situation. We should conduct our business in a cool, calm, unpressurised manner. I believe that is the way to proceed, as Fine Gael has advocated over the past several years through our spokesman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is unavoidably absent tonight due to other parliamentary business. He has very adroitly focused public opinion on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for sharing time with me and for accommodating a totally different view. I warmly welcome this Bill, which I strongly support. I call on Deputies from all sides of the House, from different parties and groups, to collectively support this Bill. This Bill concerns our country, our foreign policy and putting Ireland forward among the nations of the world as a broker for peace, equality and justice. Above all, this Bill is about taking an international stand on peace and world security. It shows a clear vision for the future and puts down a marker for the rest of the world. It is entirely appropriate to consider such legislation at this time in world history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate also provides an opportunity to confront the knockers of Irish neutrality and the <Col N="1016" /> super powers' supporters within this House who have not the courage or honesty to tell the Irish people why they support the foreign policies of countries that dropped bombs on Hiroshima or place bombs in Dublin to force legislation through the Dáil. Phoney, two-faced legislators must be challenged. They got their answer in last Saturday's march in Dublin, with more than 100,000 people demonstrating against war, demanding an end to weapons of mass destruction in all countries and demanding that the present massive waste of public money should be spent, instead, on the starving millions in Africa, Iraq and other countries. Last Saturday's march was not about sitting on the fence. It was about equality and justice.</P>
    <P>In this debate on the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2003, we should take on those who say that neutrality is sitting on the fence or looking the other way while somebody is being mugged. That angle, which is being presented lately in <i>The Irish Times,</i> is absolute nonsense. It is an insult to those who gave their lives in the course of UN peacekeeping missions and the thousands of Irish people who have risked their lives on Third World projects and famine relief missions. To take a recent example, people like Caoimhe Butterly are certainly not sitting on the fence in the context of peace and justice in Palestine.</P>
    <P>Those who use the example of someone being mugged totally misrepresent the real situation. Instead of trying to stop the mugging, they appear to want to jump in to support the aggressor. Being neutral means being active in conflict prevention, retaining our independence and going out into the world as peace brokers. The NATO fan club in this country lacks the decency or honesty to admit openly that they wish to end our neutrality and support NATO. They should tell the Irish people where they stand and end their policy of fudge.</P>
    <P>I will make it clear where I stand on the question of neutrality. It is within the OSCE and a reformed United Nations, not the European Union, that Ireland should pursue its security concerns. Ireland should pursue a positive neutrality and an independent foreign policy, not joining or forming an association with any military alliance such as the Western European Union or NATO. Ireland should seek to promote European and international security through a policy of disarmament and demilitarisation. We should, therefore, oppose the militarisation of the EU. Ireland should refuse to co-operate with or condone in any way policies or military groupings which maintain nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>Many powers in the EU already have weapons of mass destruction. Although there is constant emphasis on breach of UN resolutions by Iraq, another country in that region, Israel, has already breached 68 UN resolutions. In this regard, we need to be honest with the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Irish troops should only serve abroad as peace<Col N="1017" /> keepers under the auspices of the United Nations. That is my position on Irish neutrality. It is not a policy of burying our heads in the sand. It is a positive view which is in the interests of the Irish people and the vast majority of people in the world. That view was represented by those who marched last Saturday.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the way forward for our country. It is the policy expressed by 100,000 people last Saturday and it is up to all of us to deliver on their wishes. There is massive anger with regard to the use of Shannon Airport as a US military base. This Bill is also about spending on food programmes and health care projects the money now being spent on arms. It sets out to show the world that Ireland wishes to appear on the world stage as a peace broker and a country with a humanitarian vision, working towards a policy of accommodating difference with respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>That is the type of new Ireland in which I wish to live. That is the type of country which will emerge if we support this progressive Bill. I urge all Members and all parties to unite in support of this Bill and to vote in favour of it, as I will do. It represents a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for peace, justice and equality and, above all, a vote for a new Ireland, looking to the future and respecting our past. When we speak of the future, we should also recognise those who gave their lives for independence and the right to have a foreign policy. Sadly, I believe that this Government, under whatever influence, is turning its back on the long, historic support for Irish neutrality and a principled stand on foreign policy which can command the respect of Third World countries.</P>
    <P>In economic terms, this approach is also good for Ireland and its industries. If we open our hearts and go forward as a peace broker in the world, that will bring economic benefits. We should not ignore markets in the Middle East and throughout South America. Many countries do not wish to see Ireland &ldquo;tipping its cap&rdquo; to the USA or Britain. I urge all Members to support this progressive, top quality Bill which shows the way forward. It presents the view of young people in the Ireland which is now emerging. We have gone through 30 years of conflict in our own country. We have worked hard to get all sides to the conflict together under the Good Friday Agreement. Paragraph 4 of that Agreement talks about settling conflict peacefully and without the use of force. Therefore, I would urge people, in line with that progressive Agreement, to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>As the first two items selected relating to the closure of the <Col N="1018" /> Graham &amp; Heslip factory in Ennis are being taken together, each Deputy has five minutes and the Minister of State has ten minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen" hpid="Mr. J. Breen Mr. J. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of Graham &amp; Heslip is a major blow to the town of Ennis and the surrounding area. Graham &amp; Heslip purchased a family run business in Ennis two years ago and now it has gone without as much as a day's notice to the loyal employees it inherited with the takeover of the company. Some of these employees have been in the business for the past 18 years. The company employed a large proportion of local young people, had a highly trained and qualified staff and produced a high quality product.</P>
      <P>What are these employees to do? They have been left without their pay, their P45s, their holiday entitlements and an alternative employer. They find themselves unemployed after receiving only a few minutes' notice and to add insult to injury, the owners of this company tried to take the machinery and tangible assets from the plant the following day. What type of treatment is that for any employee? Is this to be a precedent for other companies to follow? Is this what the Irish workforce has to put up with, a company coming from only up the road in Belfast to strip them of their assets, take their customer base, their machinery and their business portfolio? Did this company have any intention of making a go of it in Clare? How are companies like this to be made accountable? What happens when it is a company from outside this island? How are employees to know in the worse case scenario, like we now have in Clare, that they will receive their pay and notice of unemployment? What are the safeguards to protect against this happening?</P>
      <P>Many families, both young and old, have been affected by this closure. To bring it home to the Minister of State, I personally know two young people who, when they left on their honeymoon two weeks ago, had a livelihood and now have to return to unemployment and face the prospects of not being able to pay their mortgage and other everyday bills. Is that what is in store for young couples trying to make their way in this country?</P>
      <P>This is the third factory closure in Ennis over the past three years. Clare is turning out to be a blackspot for job losses and there is no action from the Government. Following the closure of Tellabs in Shannon, with the loss of 400 jobs, there is little or no industry in west or north Clare.</P>
      <P>When I was elected to the council 18 years ago, Milltown Malbay was a thriving industrial town. Since then all the industries in this town have closed down. Shannon Development and the Western Development Commission are in charge of encouraging industry to Clare. Not one major factory has been set up in the county within the last ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deepest water in the Shannon Estuary is on the Clare side. Although successive Governments commissioned reports on the development <Col N="1019" /> of the estuary, these are now gathering dust in the Minister's office and now we are led to believe that the present Minister is preparing another report on the estuary. It is about time the Government woke up, listened to the people of Clare and did something positive about job losses.</P>
    <P>I alerted the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to the crisis in Clare in a parliamentary question on Tuesday, 5 November. I asked her to visit Clare. In her reply she stated she would be in the county at the end of that month. She came but did not address the job crisis. She also stated that Shannon Development was developing a 35 acre information age park which will provide a new focus for industrial development in County Clare, and particularly for Ennis. The park will offer a potential investor world class accommodation and infrastructure. This is a major initiative for Ennis and County Clare and will be a key focus for Shannon Development's promotional activities in the area.</P>
    <P>I say, live horse and you will get grass. I ask the Minister of State to do whatever is within the law to ensure that these workers get their entitlements. I also ask the Minister to visit Clare and set up a task force to tackle the unemployment situation in the county.</P>
    <P>I congratulate our neighbours in Roscrea on the announcement of 300 new jobs. I would ask the Minister to follow with a similar announcement for County Clare because at this point we are desperate. There are many people unemployed in Clare who will never work again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see that three Oireachtas Members from Clare, including Deputy Killeen, are supporting the motion. I am sure he will brief the Minister of State on the closure.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, Deputy James Breen, stated, the people of Roscrea are celebrating tonight with the excellent news that Taro Pharmaceuticals Limited is to set up as a new major industry to replace the Miza facility which closed recently, and I welcome this good news.</P>
      <P>This is a far cry from the position of the 42 workers of Graham &amp; Heslip in Ennis who, on Friday, 7 February at 2 p.m., were told that they no longer had jobs with the company and were given 50 minutes to gather their personal belongings and leave the premises.</P>
      <P>The print company was established in 1984 and many of the workers have given long loyal service over the years. Thermofoil Printing, as it was then known, was taken over some years ago by the present owners, Graham &amp; Heslip, who I understand were given considerable financial assistance by Shannon Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the premises on Monday morning, 10 February, to speak to the workers and heard today that they still have not received their P45s, P60s or RPIs. This is a disgrace. Every effort must be made by the Minister, Deputy Harney, to deal <Col N="1020" /> with this unacceptable situation, to make sure the employees are given their full statutory redundancies and that the terms of the employment legislation are complied with.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister made contact with the owners of the company? Has a liquidator been appointed? Has a creditors' meeting been arranged? I understand that the matter was raised in the Upper House last week and at that time no contact had been made with the directors.</P>
    <P>This is a devastating blow for the town of Ennis. The disgraceful manner in which these workers lost their jobs is another milestone in the industrial decline of Ennis. The number of jobs lost in County Clare over the last two years is well over 600. The alarming statistics of job losses have been backed up by recent live register figures for Ennis. The numbers on the live register have increased by 12% from 1,813 in 2001 to 2,034 in 2002. In October 2000, the figure was 1,448. This means that unemployment figures in Ennis have grown by about 40% in two years, and that does not include the latest redundancy figures. Companies that have shut their doors in Ennis in recent times include Overland Bowling, Studio Eyewear and Pacific Scientific, as well as a number of smaller companies whose closures were never reported on the media because of the small job losses.</P>
    <P>Last October, I asked the Minister to visit County Clare when the Tellabs facility in Shannon announced its closure with the loss of over 400 jobs. I also asked her to give priority to County Clare for job creation and to establish a task force. Unfortunately at the time she said she had a heavy schedule of official commitments and would not be in a position to visit Clare.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that she was encouraged by job creation in the mid-west. The facts I mentioned earlier do not tally for the town of Ennis, where every day there are young people, many of whom have mortgages, coming into my office with their CVs seeking jobs to replace the ones they have lost. It is most humiliating for them. A jobs task force must be set up to focus on re-engaging the hundreds of workers who have lost their jobs and to attract new inward investments. Deputy James Breen and I have highlighted the serious situation.</P>
    <P>To add to these difficulties, the Ennis by-pass is not getting the go-ahead in 2003 and, therefore, there will be no jobs for road building workers, Shannon Airport is under constant threat with many services lost in recent weeks &ndash; 50 jobs were lost at Cable &amp; Wireless in Shannon two weeks ago. The Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Fahey, has offered to come to Ennis, but this is not good enough. We want the Minister to see for herself the situation in the town named as a hub for job creation in the national spatial strategy programme. A hub for job losses might be a better title because no major industries have come to Ennis in many years, despite the fact that it was the first information town in the country. There is <Col N="1021" /> no prospect of immediate broadband technology. Positive action must be taken by the Government to find jobs for the unfortunate people such as those who lost their jobs at Graham &amp; Heslip last week.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising these matters on the Adjournment and I also thank Deputy Killeen, who has advised me on the matter. I am indeed aware of the sudden closure of the company in question. The closure came about without prior notice. Shannon Development, the industrial development agency with responsibility for the company in the mid-west region, immediately advised the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>This is a long-established company in Ennis. Originally, it was established as Thermofoil Print Limited in 1984. In early 2001 it was acquired by its present owners when a subsidiary company took a 75% shareholding in the original company while one of the founders of the original company retained the other 25%. It has received considerable financial assistance from Shannon Development over the years. The company designs and produces specialised products for the domestic market. Its main product areas are greeting cards, packaging, annual reports and promotional colour printing. I understand it had a good reputation as a specialist in a range of printing options, including full colour printing, embossing, watermarking and carton manufacture.</P>
      <P>A substantial number of the employees have been with the company for a number of years. Traditionally, the company has been regarded as being a stable source of employment in Ennis. Shannon Development had a review meeting with the company last summer and at that stage the feedback from the company was very positive. Therefore, the news of the closure is surprising, although it is of course a greater shock to the employees of the company.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development has been trying to contact the company to discuss what is happening. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has written by registered letter to the company reminding it of its obligations in respect of collective redundancies, minimum notice and statutory redundancy generally as a collective redundancy notification had not been received in respect of the company. However, direct contact has been established with the company by my Department. In correspondence to my Department the company says that the decision to cease trading was only taken after all other avenues had been investigated and exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain provisions in employment legislation which must be complied with. Under the terms of sections 9 and 12 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, an employer who proposes to undertake collective redundancy is obliged to consult the employees' representatives <Col N="1022" /> and give the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment written notice of his proposals at the earliest opportunity and, in any event, at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes effect. The Act provides for significant penalties in the event of non-compliance by an employer with the relevant provisions. Furthermore, there are provisions whereby employees can refer to a rights commissioner complaints regarding non-compliance with information and consultation provisions. In addition, there are statutory provisions relating to minimum notice and redundancy payments which have to be complied with.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns expressed here about this most unfortunate situation. Every effort is being made to unravel the problems. The further job losses in the second company in Shannon arise from a corporate restructuring of worldwide business in the company. The job losses will take place over the next nine months, with one third taking place in June, a further one third in September and the final one third in November 2003. I understand local management in the company is currently in negotiation with staff representatives regarding redundancy terms.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of raising this important issue on the Adjournment. There is extreme disappointment in County Cavan at the decision of Teradyne Incorporated to close its manufacturing facility in Cavan town and move its assembly operations to Blanchardstown. It is a great source of disappointment to the 37 permanent employees and 25 temporary employees. The expected closing date of 28 March will be etched on the minds of those employees.</P>
      <P>In 1997 I enlisted the support of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to try to bring inward investment to County Cavan and I appreciate their efforts and wholehearted commitment to the creation of jobs in the county. In November 2000, the excellent news was confirmed for us that the American company Teradyne Incorporated was to invest &euro;62 million in a major new industrial campus near Cavan town. The development was to create 740 jobs over a five-year period. It was a great achievement to bring Teradyne, a major world leader in interconnection systems manufacture, to Cavan. The announcement represented the first significant IDA Ireland supported investment in the county in more than 22 years. With efficiency, Cavan County Council processed and approved the planning application. An appeal was lodged to An Bord Pleanála and, unfortunately, a delay of almost seven months occurred. However, basically the same decision was made by the board after this time as had been made by the local authority originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That delay caused considerable problems. At the end of October 2001, we heard the extremely disappointing news that Teradyne had deferred the construction of the industrial campus and was to continue instead its operations in a temporary base in the IDA Ireland advance factory near the <Col N="1023" /> town. Since then, 60 people have been employed at that location, who are now to lose their jobs. In securing this inward investment in the first place, there was a wholehearted, co-operative effort by the executive of Cavan County Council, local public representatives, the IDA Ireland regional manager and staff and the county enterprise board. Indeed, Teradyne has acknowledged that it received at all times the wholehearted co-operation of the statutory agencies in County Cavan and the support of the public at large.</P>
    <P>County Cavan and the Border region in general suffered immensely as a result of the 30 years of troubles in the northern part of our province of Ulster. Our natural economic hinterland was cut off. We did not get adequate Government investment or inward investment. The decision of Teradyne to locate in Cavan clearly demonstrated that major companies recognised that things had dramatically changed in the Border region and that a centre such as Cavan is now an attractive location for foreign direct investment. The county has a good workforce, a diligent people with a commitment to work. Huge numbers of our people, particularly our young people, who are highly qualified and skilled, are working in the technology industries outside the county. We need modern, knowledge-based industry to attract these people back to the county and to retain the emerging workforce, who are currently attending second or third level colleges.</P>
    <P>County Cavan has been heavily dependent on local entrepreneurship to meet its employment needs. I compliment those companies which, through the most difficult of times, have provided worthwhile employment opportunities in our county. In more recent times, those companies have traded in a better economic climate. Overseas firms represent 27.7% of all manufacturing and internationally traded financial services employment in the county, compared to a national average of 52%. I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the industrial promotion agencies for a focused and targeted campaign to secure a major new industry for Cavan. The ingredients that made the county attractive for inward investment two years ago are all still in place.</P>
    <P>The development of the peace process has brought many benefits to the whole island, particularly to our province of Ulster. Over the years, I, with Deputy Crawford and other public representatives, have consistently raised in this House the need for counties such as Cavan and Monaghan to gain a new economic dividend, particularly in the area of job creation. If Departments and State agencies are serious about tackling the imbalance in economic development, areas such as Cavan and Monaghan have to be given priority when it comes to the push that is needed to attract necessary and additional job opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the Department and the industrial promotion agencies can promote Cavan's <Col N="1024" /> case easily and credibly. The county has a well educated, computer literate, highly motivated and flexible workforce. Its people share our sentiments that we need those jobs.</P>

      <P>The attraction of new foreign direct investment to Ireland is statutorily charged to IDA Ireland. Despite the global economic downturn, the level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world. Ireland today competes with many other countries for new projects and, indeed, the relative attractiveness of one regional location in Ireland to another is often the decider for a company as to where it will locate. This makes the challenge in Cavan even greater.</P>
      <P>The designation of Cavan town as a hub in the national spatial strategy confers on it a strategic position in the overall development plans for Ireland, acknowledging that it can support development in both the gateways and rural areas which surround it. Cavan town, with Dundalk, Monaghan and Drogheda, is one of the four towns of emphasis in the north-east region for the IDA Ireland and is strongly marketed for new investment. IDA Ireland is currently investing &euro;1 million in Cavan in enhancing the 35 acre business park at Killygarry. This will bring the park up to flagship standard and will greatly enhance its attractiveness for new inward investment. The work is already under way involving the extension of internal roads, services and extensive landscaping. IDA Ireland has also sought and received planning permission for two 2,500 sq. meter advanced technology units from Cavan County Council, which will be constructed on a roll-over basis by the private sector.</P>
      <P>The announcement on Friday, 14 February 2003 by Teradyne Incorporated that it will close its manufacturing facility in Cavan town presents a challenge to try to secure a replacement industry. When we announced just three years ago that Teradyne was to establish a major facility in the town, it represented the culmination of many years of work by IDA Ireland and others in promoting Cavan for new inward investment. The decision by the company to locate in Cavan highlighted the fact that the smaller regional locations can support significant industry. Nothing since then suggests that there is any need to review this thinking because the Cavan location did not impact on the decision to consolidate the company's operations in Dublin, but rather the general downturn in the worldwide telecommunications industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teradyne acknowledges that the decision to close the Cavan operation is in response to a continuing worldwide electronics manufacturing downturn. This initially caused the company to abandon its plans for the major manufacturing facility in Cavan. It now sees consolidation as the <Col N="1025" /> best way of cutting costs and contributing to the viability of its operations in Ireland. In response to the closure of Teradyne, IDA Ireland has already begun an intensive campaign across a broad range of sectors to identify an alternative industry. This involves briefing all its overseas offices on the Cavan facility and appraising them of the skills of the Teradyne workforce. While IDA Ireland is concerned that the current economic downturn, particularly in the telecommunications sector, will increase the difficulty of getting an early positive result, it is determined to work closely with FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and the other local stakeholders to minimise the effect of the closure and to find an alternative industry as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for the development of indigenous enterprise, continues to work with companies in County Cavan to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets. In terms of job creation, activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through support of entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions. Enterprise Ireland is continuing to concentrate on maximising job gains in its client companies.</P>
    <P>In County Cavan, Enterprise Ireland has focused on building and construction materials as a targeted sector and is endeavouring to build on the existing cluster of companies in the county. Enterprise Ireland is currently working with Foamalite Limited in Lough Gowna, County Cavan, to further develop its sales, exports and innovation. This company, which began in 1998, is an excellent example of a new company in this cluster. In November last, an &euro;88 million investment by Abbott Laboratories, the Chicago based health care company, at its nutritional manufacturing plant Cootehill, County Cavan, was announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. This company's expansion was supported by Enterprise Ireland and will lead to the creation of 100 new jobs over the next three years. Enterprise Ireland provides preferential funding for companies with detailed export plans, which are expanding or establishing a business in the county as part of the BMW region. In 2002 funding amounting to &euro;1,205,914 was approved to Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>The community enterprise programme is also an important part of Enterprise Ireland's support for community based projects. Under the programme, the agency has helped fund the establishment of six enterprise centres in County Cavan since 1989. These are located in Cavan, phases one and two, Kingscourt, Bailieboro, Cootehill and Killeshandra.</P>
    <P>I am confident the initiatives adopted by IDA <Col N="1026" /> Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with other local organisations, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bring positive results to Cavan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was on my feet in the Chamber for some time last week highlighting the plight of people with disabilities as a result of Government cutbacks. Tonight, I must highlight the difficulties of another group of people who face extreme difficulty, those who depend on home help. I do not know if the Minister is aware of the dire situation in the Southern Health Board region but people in my constituency of Kerry South have been in contact with me about this issue and they are in a dreadful state. The home help service is essential in assisting families who are caring for elderly or ill people. Many families who are trying to keep their lives together while keeping a parent or sibling at home need the home help service. I will not be political about this issue but I appeal to the Minister to use his office to see if anything can be done in the Southern Health Board area for the home help service.</P>
      <P>An open letter to the Minister for Health and Children was published in <i>The Examiner</i> today. The correspondent, a woman, said her home help service ceased on 13 November last year. The woman has secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or chronic multiple sclerosis. Her home help was restored on 9 January. She has a husband and two children and her daughter helps her mother with her bodily functions and everything she needs to do. Her daughter has said she doubts that she will ever have children herself because she could not put anybody else through what her mother is enduring.</P>
      <P>A family contacted me recently about this matter. Their mother is in the final stages of senile dementia. It is a small family and the members have juggled their lives to keep their mother at home. She had 21 hours of home help but the family received a phone call last week to notify them that this was being reduced by three hours. This might seem small but three hours to this family means they must juggle their lives again, get more hours off work and get their children to mind their mother. I plead with the Minister to ensure that emergency funding is made available for these dire cases so people can keep members of their family at home. If another hour is cut from the home help service for the woman with senile dementia, it will mean she will finish her life in a hospital. The family does not want to put their mother in hospital, they want to keep her at home. The Minister will understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the local staff of the health board. They are genuine people who work at the coalface. They hear people's grievances. The district nurse recommends the hours but the money is not available to provide the service for those <Col N="1027" /> hours. The staff of the health board have to give the bad news. The people giving the bad news are human too and it breaks their hearts to give it. It is unfair of the Minister to put his staff, the patients and their families through such turmoil. The cases I have raised, as well as others, involve people in their final days. I ask that they be given the dignity of staying at home and that their families are assisted in caring for them. I hope I will get a positive response from the Minister of State as to why the Southern Health Board has been instructed to cut home help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health-related services for older people and for those with disabilities in County Kerry is a matter, in the first instance, for the Southern Health Board. Since 1997, my Department has allocated significant levels of funding to services for older people and across the disability sector, resulting in substantial advances in the quality and quantity of the health-related services being provided. Additional funding of &euro;27 million has been allocated to services for persons with disabilities in 2003 to meet the full year costs of 2002 developments and to enhance further the services in the sector.</P>
      <P>This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;288 million, which has been made in these services in recent years and which is built into the ongoing budget base. Approximately &euro;100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include, residential, respite, home support services, which includes personal assistants services, therapy services and day care services. A significant proportion of this funding &ndash; over &euro;20 million &ndash; has been provided specifically for home support services.</P>
      <P>In the case of older people, from and including 2000, approximately &euro;230 million of additional funding has been provided to the health boards for a range of services, including the home help service, community support structures, the support of carers, support for the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and various voluntary groups, improvement in staff ratios and improvements to the nursing home subvention scheme. Government policy in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible and the role played by home helps is vital to the success of this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> Following the publication of the report entitled The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, my Department made available a total of &euro;8 million to the health boards between 1999 and 2002 to expand and develop the home help service and provide appropriate training for home helps as recommended in the report. My Department also made available over &euro;20 million to provide for increased pay rates to home helps. Of the above amounts, the Southern Health Board received over &euro;1 million for expansion of the home help service and over &euro;5 million for the improved pay rates.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has informed me that its strategy for older people entitled Ageing with Confidence, which was launched in October 1999, underlines the importance of the home help as part of the community team and the vital role that they play in realising the expressed wish of older people to remain in their homes for as long as possible. The home help service is delivered within the allocated resources of the board and as provided for in its annual service plan. A sum of &euro;30.8 million has been allocated for the provision of the service in 2003. The moneys allocated will enable the board to provide a home help service to 7,000 clients in 2003</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board points out that the levels of home help service within its region have increased significantly over the past number of years, particularly during 2001 and 2002, when an increase of 25 % in service levels was achieved. It should be noted that there has been an increase of 6.2 % in the overall population in the board's area, of which an estimated 5,000 will be over 65, many of whom will require services. In addition, there was an actual increase of 15 % in the population over 85 in the board's area between 1996 and 2000.</P>
    <P>The board has indicated that the focus of its service in 2003 will be to make the best use of allocated resources which requires careful targeting of the available resources to those most in need. This will be achieved by regular re-assessment of clients' needs. The home help service, by its nature, is a flexible service and, therefore, the level of service being provided may increase or decrease from time to time, depending on the assessed needs of clients. In the Southern Health Board's letter ofdetermination for 2003 there is provision for an additional &euro;1.2 million to support the home help service. The board has assured me that the number of clients availing of the service will not be cut in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 February 2003.</P>

      <P>The WTO declaration agreed at the fourth trade ministerial meeting in Doha in November 2001 provides for a new round of multilateral trade liberalisation negotiations across a broad spectrum of trade-related issues. The declaration, one of the key documents from the meeting, outlines a wide-ranging work programme and is the blueprint for negotiations which are scheduled to conclude by 2005.</P>
      <P>The European Union negotiates as a single entity at the WTO. Such negotiations are carried out by the EU Commission acting in accordance with the mandates and policy guidelines decided by the EU Council of Ministers on the basis of Commission proposals. These proposals are developed by a number of committees, which include the EU Trade Committee, also known as the Article 133 Committee. Ireland participates actively in these forums with a view to ensuring that our interests are promoted in the development and implementation of the common commercial policy.</P>
      <P>The launch of the new round has resulted in substantial consultations with a wide range of interested parties on issues that cross the full spectrum of WTO trade matters. Extensive consultations and dialogue have been undertaken and continues with Departments of State and agencies under their aegis, with business and with wider civil society. For example, in the context of a comprehensive report which has now been finalised by Forfás on recommended negotiating objectives to be pursued by Irish trade negotiators under the new round, there have been extensive consultations with a large cross-section of interested parties, including business. In addition, I and my officials met last year and continue to be available to meet with interested groups and stakeholders on trade matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the current approach of consultation and dialogue with all interested stakeholders, including through contacts with minis<Col N="1030" /> terial colleagues and with trade officials from my Department and other Departments, as appropriate, provides a sufficient means and represents an appropriate forum in which to discuss, consider and report on Ireland's negotiating position in the development of the EU common commercial policy.</P>

      <P>I am assuming this question refers to the ongoing implementation of the preventive strategy of engaging systematically with people at an early stage of unemployment, thus preventing the drift into long-term unemployment. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government in relation to this matter, a national roll-out, on a phased basis, of the preventive strategy to all persons who have been on the live register for more than six months will commence in the Dublin region in April 2003. The launch will be expanded to all regions from May onwards.</P>
      <P>While the funding of the community employment scheme is being reduced to reflect the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience to training, investment in FÁS training programmes in 2003 is being maintained close to 2002 levels. FÁS will decide on the detailed priorities and breakdown of funding between schemes and activities from within these overall allocations.</P>

      <P>Information on the number of jobs in IDA-supported companies created in Counties Offaly and Laois over the past five years is included in the following tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past five years the IDA-supported companies in Laois and Offaly have faced difficulties. Laois and Offaly, as well as much of the midlands, are in a period of transition from dependence on the more cost competitive sectors to the higher value-added activities. Part of this transition has reflected job reductions and losses in long-established employers in the region such as Leoni Ireland in Birr, Lowe Alpine Systems in Tullamore, Avon Arlington in Portarlington and C&amp;M Europe Limited in Portlaoise. These job losses have been disappointing and reinforce the task and objectives of the IDA to build and attract companies in the more modern industrial and higher value-added activities. To achieve this result, a strategic programme is now fully operational and will deliver the results I believe the region deserves, namely: 50% of all new greenfield jobs over the 2000-2006 period to be located in the Objective One region; roll-out of the broadband metro-rings for Portlaoise and Tullamore, which is expected to be in place and fully operational by end of 2003; construction of the Monasterevin bypass, part of the M7, which is <Col N="1032" /> due to commence during 2003 and will extend motorway and dual carriageway from Dublin to the south-west of Portlaoise, considerably improving road access. Completion of the M6 from Dublin to Athlone to Galway will also significantly enhance the marketing of the midlands region. Construction of the Kilcock-Kinnegad section of the M6 is due to commence in spring 2003. The Dublin-Galway gas pipeline is now completed and distribution lines are to be run into Tullamore. Portlaoise is already on the gas pipeline.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland's property programme is also operational. Srah business park, Tullamore, is being upgraded and all infrastructural work will be complete by July 2003. Total investment in the park is approximately &euro;3.5 million. The IDA is marketing the 27,000 sq. ft. facility on the business park, which is planned for upgrade. Portlaoise business park &ndash; developers are on-site to complete landscaping and infrastructural work and to construct a 17,000 sq. ft. office facility. Total investment in the park is approximately &euro;3 million. The results of this are already beginning to flow with the announcement of the GeneMedix European manufacturing centre and Zannini Ireland's pharmaceutical packaging facility for the Srah business park, Tullamore. Other developments in the region are the announcements by Oakley to establish a 100-person prescription eyewear facility in Mullingar, which is now in production, and the expansion of the GMACCM facility, also in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the commitment of the Government to regional development, as evidenced by the combined investments in the NDP, metro-loops and the gas pipeline, together with the marketing initiatives now under way by IDA Ireland, will build on the progress already achieved in this region.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the article referred to by the Deputy and consider that such reports are to be welcomed in the interests of heightening consumer awareness. I am seriously concerned at the variation in prices which the article indicates. The only effective way to positively affect price levels in the interests of ordinary consumers is to facilitate effective competition and to ensure that shoppers have the necessary choice and information so that they can get the best value available in the goods and services they require. The Competition Authority has the resources and the autonomy to investigate the reasons for price levels which do not seem justifiable and to report publicly on its findings. Investigations are currently under way into a range of professional services, including those provided by doctors, dentists, solicitors, barristers and architects.</P>
      <P>In the policy areas for which I have political responsibility, I will act promptly on any recommendations which the Competition Authority makes to me. I have already taken the steps necessary to strengthen the powers of the Competition Authority to investigate price fixing and other anti-competitive practices and my priority is to ensure the removal of unwarranted restrictions on competition in all sectors of the economy. Following a review, I have updated the requirement to indicate product prices regulations. The purpose of these new regulations is to help consumers to be better informed about prices, to make accurate price comparisons between different brands and sizes and, thereby, to get the best available value for money through stimulating more effective competition among retailers and suppliers. I am confident that this clarification and revision of the layout of the previous regulations will make the legislation more transparent and accessible for consumers and traders. The new regulations require that consumers be given a selling price for products and a unit price for goods sold by weight or volume. The regulations come into force on 1 March next and will be enforced rigorously by the Director of Consumer Affairs. In addition, I have increased the penalties to a maximum of &euro;3,000 per offence. The new social partnership agreement includes provision for an anti-inflation initiative and my Department will be represented on the group that is to be specially convened to draw up a detailed action plan in this regard and monitor its progress.</P>

      <P>The decline of the textile industry has not been confined to the north west. The problems facing the textile industry nationwide are primarily related to competitiveness issues. However, Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work closely with clothing and textile companies in the area to support their competitiveness and grow their business in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. Enterprise Ireland support in the region has been substantial during the period 1999-2002 and the agency is committed to investing heavily in the development of new and existing companies in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The response by Enterprise Ireland has focused on four areas of activity: developing existing clients in the region; enhancing the environment for business; identifying and encouraging new high-potential start-up companies in the area; and identifying new opportunities. In addition, the Donegal County Development Board has recently published an integrated strategy for the development of the county. There is a significant focus on inward investment and IDA Ireland is an active participant in this initiative. Indeed, there have been a number of overseas project announcements for the county in recent years. IDA Ireland has also invested in new business parks throughout the county.</P>
      <P>Overall, the response of the industrial development agencies has been positive. According to the Forfás employment survey, 329 net new jobs were created in the north west region from 1999 to 2002 in non-clothing and textile-related employment. Furthermore, the private sector is also being encouraged to invest in new modern buildings to assist in the marketing of the county for potential new foreign direct investment. A focused agency approach, including the County Enterprise Board, together with a locally based approach is being implemented to address the situation and the area will remain a focus of agency activity and investment in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the company in question is that an interim examiner has been appointed to assess the future prospects of the company. It is likely that the company will cease to be a manufacturing company but will continue as a trading company. The company is continuing to trade pending the report of the examiner. There had been a significant decline in the company's business activity. I understand that the company will be discussing proposed redundancies with union and staff representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards job creation, an IDA-assisted company employing 60 people was established in Carrickmacross last year. This company produces dinner trays for the consumer fast foods markets. It is anticipated that employment numbers will increase as the company goes into full production. <Col N="1036" /> In addition, Enterprise Ireland is currently negotiating with and facilitating four new start-up businesses in the prepared consumer foods sector. These would be based in the Food Enterprise Park at Lough Egish. At community level, under the community enterprise centre programme last year, both Emyvale Development Association and Monaghan Chamber of Commerce received support.</P>
    <P>As part of its regional development strategy, the IDA is committed to placing 50% of all new investment into the BMW region. IDA Ireland is pursuing high-quality new investment and also helping existing companies to move up the value chain into higher value products and services. Enterprise Ireland's activity in the county is focused on new high-potential start-up companies and the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies. The work of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland together with the county enterprise board and local initiatives is of paramount importance in saving existing jobs and creating new jobs and opportunities for enterprise in the region. The question of tax incentives is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I have been concerned for some time about the degree of compliance by companies and their officers with the requirements of company and other law. The report of the inspectors into Ansbacher Cayman confirmed that my concerns were justified. However, I did not wait for the completion of the report before taking action to ensure that any regulatory failures coming within my area of responsibility are dealt with. Accordingly, I have introduced the following initiatives: proactive enforcement of the provisions of company law by the establishment and resourcing of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement; increased penalties and additional resources to ensure companies meet their filing obligations with the Companies Registration Office; greater oversight and regulation of the accounting and auditing profession by the proposed establishment of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority; establishment of the company law review group on a statutory footing to ensure that the provisions of our company law are appropriate to the needs of Irish society.</P>

    <P>Following the commencement of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, it is now the statutory responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to pursue the possible breaches of <Col N="1037" /> the Companies Acts identified in the report.

    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> Procedures to resolve industrial disputes in situations where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place were considered by a high-level group, comprising representatives from IBEC, ICTU, and various Government Departments and agencies and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which was established under Partnership 2000. This group recommended a voluntary set of procedures and an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act 1946 to provide a new dispute settling power for the Labour Court. These recommendations were implemented through SI No. 145 of 2000, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2000, and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>During the recent negotiations between the Government and the social partners on the new partnership programme, Sustaining Progress, the need to enhance the effectiveness of these procedures was agreed. A number of measures which will result in significant improvements to the existing procedures will be put in place. These measures include the introduction of an overall time frame of 26 weeks for processing cases under the code and the Act with provision for a maximum of 34 weeks. Effect will be given to these measures through amendments to the code and to the Act.</P>

      <P>The Annual Competitiveness Report 2002 surveys the competitive position of the Irish economy on the international stage. The report examines a range of competitiveness issues, presenting a picture of the unfolding competitive position across the economy. It establishes that Ireland has improved its ranking in 24 indicators, disimproved in 29 and remained constant in a further 14. The report confirms many of Ireland's strengths while the Challenge document highlights the key challenges we face as well as recommendations for addressing them. The National Competitiveness Council highlighted, in particular, three broad areas of concern to national competitiveness. These are the rapid rise in non-employment costs and consumer prices; employment costs, productivity and social partnership &ndash; the rapid rise in wage costs in recent years; and the infrastructure deficit across the country and the costs resulting from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Competitiveness Council believes that both the domestic Irish economy and the glo<Col N="1039" /> bal economy face difficult times ahead. Given that Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world, it is important that steps are taken to position the economy to maximise the benefits and growth potential from any upturn in the global economy. Renewing competitiveness both within the domestic economy and on the international stage has also been identified as being critical for our economic well-being by the National Economic and Social Council and has been factored into the recent social partner discussions. The Government is determined that the conditions for enterprise operating in Ireland should be as favourable as possible. This encompasses the costs that business face, the skills level in the population, the physical infrastructure, the regulatory environment and other factors. These reports and the comprehensive list of policy actions designed to enhance Ireland's competitive position will continue to be to the forefront in our policy formulation.</P>

      <P>The objective of the new European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 is to help consumers to be better informed about prices, to make accurate price comparisons between different brands and sizes and, thereby, to get the best available value for money through stimulating more effective competition among retailers and suppliers. The new pricing regulations, which will come into force on 1 March next, have as their main features the following provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traders must indicate the selling price of items for sale. The only exceptions are products supplied in the course of the provision of a service, sales by auction or sales of works of art and antiques. Traders, excluding itinerant traders and those who do not make use of equipment for printing shelf edge labels or equipment for point of sale scanning, selling items other than in bulk, must also indicate the unit price of items for sale. A unit price is required when products are sold by weight or volume, i.e. by reference to the base metric units of one kilogram, one litre, one kilogram, one metre, one square metre or one cubic metre. There are some obvious exclusions from the unit pricing requirements, for example, goods in pre-packs of less than 50 g or 50 ml, goods at a reduced selling price due to damage or because of danger of deterioration, goods for which the selling price is the same as the unit price, products comprising an assortment of different items, for example, for example, Christmas hampers, goods <Col N="1040" /> sold from vending machines that sell more than one type of product, and where the selling price does not relate to the quantity being sold.</P>
    <P>The legislation applies to goods sold in retail outlets, by mail order and via the Internet. Wholesalers and distributors are not affected by this legislation. The regulations will be enforced by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. Failure to comply with these regulations will result in fines of up to a maximum of &euro;3,000 per offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest Central Statistics Office quarterly industrial employment release gives preliminary estimates of industrial employment for September 2002. These estimates point to a decrease of 18,100 in industrial employment from 271,400 in September 2001 to 253,300 in September 2002. Most of this decline is accounted for by the electronics sector, where employment fell by 11,000. This reflects the global slowdown in the information and communications technology sector and Ireland's decline in manufacturing employment is not unique.</P>
      <P>Key to employment creation in Ireland, and in particular employment supported by the agencies including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, is the gradual move away from more traditional manufacturing activity towards internationally-traded services activities. This shift in the employment base is reflected by the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey and the latest survey, for the quarter ended August 2002, shows that total persons in employment in all sectors increased by some 320,000 since late 1998, an increase of around 22% over four years. Given the fluctuating world economic climate, and continuing uncertainty in this regard, it is not possible for the industrial development agencies or the CSO to provide definitive forecasts of numbers employed. However, indications from both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are that there should be a substantial flow of foreign direct investment and indigenous projects over the coming months. This will of course depend to a considerable extent on a global economic recovery. The timing and pace of such a recovery is, however, uncertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pipeline for foreign direct investment in 2003 gives some grounds for optimism, and indigenous projects, both start-up and expansion, with a strong research bias also look encouraging for the coming year. It is these investments that <Col N="1041" /> will provide the flow of new products and services and form the basis for sustainable competitive advantage, and sustained employment going forward.</P>

      <P>The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Depart<Col N="1042" /> ment and is one in which I have no direct function. As far as the agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Donegal County Enterprise Board, are concerned these agencies are committed to ensuring an equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions, in particular the BMW region. Under the regional industrial grant aid rates, approved by the EU Commission on 26 October 1999, the grant aid levels for new industrial development projects in the region are set at 40% plus a further 15% allowable for small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, for the period 2000-2006. This compares with an aid level of just 17.5%, plus a further 10% for SMEs, in the Dublin area. Additional aid for training and research and development may also be approved.</P>
      <P>Of the jobs created in 2000, 2001 and 2002, the tabular statement, which is included in the official reply, shows that almost 20% were located in the BMW region and 80% in the rest of the country. This is broadly in line with the share of population and labour force in the BMW region.</P>

    <P>IDA Ireland is the agency charged with the responsibility for attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The IDA targets 50% of all new greenfield jobs for the BMW region, and this target was achieved in 2001 and 2002. While there has been an economic slowdown in both regions, IDA Ireland is fully committed to achieving this target over the 2000-2006 period. This is consistent with the regional policy objectives set out in the current national development plan and is substantially higher than was the case prior to the current NDP, when the figure was 25%. IDA Ireland's focused strategy on the BMW region has attracted a significant range of projects, such as Prudential and Prumerica in Donegal, MBNA in Carrick-on-Shannon, the Abbott developments in Sligo and Donegal and GeneMedix in Tullamore.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is the agency under my Department's aegis with responsibility for developing indigenous industry. Its regional development strategy, Driving growth in Regional Enterprise, outlines that the overall approach adopted by the agency is to: develop and sustain existing businesses in each region; identify and encourage new start-up enterprises with strong growth potential; and enhance the environment for business in each region, incorporating both physical infrastructure and the development of strong linkages between the third-level institutions and business.</P>
    <P>Between 2000 and 2002 Enterprise Ireland directly invested just under &euro;80 million in 685 businesses in the BMW area. Much of this support was directed at enhancing the capability of companies both in terms of developing innovating products and processes and in increasing the skills of management and staff. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has facilitated access to seed and venture capital funding through the seed and venture programme, a primary focus of which is on new regional funds. Enterprise Ireland has been involved in the establishment of nineteen community enterprise centres and six third-level campus-based innovation centres in the BMW region. In addition to providing a valued support to new start-up companies, the location of the incubators at institutes of technology and universities is intended to encourage entrepreneurship and the translation of intellectual property from within the colleges into commercial reality.</P>
    <P>Planning is at an advanced stage for the development of phase 1 of Webworks facilities in four locations around the country, to include Galway and Sligo. Webworks will provide high-class office facilities for technology-based companies and a nurturing environment that is conducive to networking among the companies, thus promoting mutual learning and sharing. Finally, at the micro-enterprise level, the city and county enterprise boards are actively co-operating with the BMW Regional Assembly in developing indigenous micro-enterprise in the region. I am <Col N="1043" /> confident that, given the commitment of the industrial development agencies, the BMW region can withstand the present downturn and remain an attractive location for both foreign direct investment and indigenous firms.</P>

The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which implemented EU Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, provides for an annual leave entitlement of four working weeks per annum for full-time employees and pro rata entitlements for part-time employees as well as an average hourly working week of 48 hours averaged generally over a four month period. The Act also provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum. Notwithstanding these provisions, it is possible for employers and employees to negotiate a longer annual leave entitlement or a lower hourly working week between themselves if they so wish.</P>

The revised procedures are also intended to ensure that persons available locally or in the wider EEA area are given first preference, as required by our status as an EU member state. On a local labour market basis, FÁS, in consultation with my Department, will look at the occupational categories and skills profiles of persons registered with FÁS and compare these with the profile of vacancies being registered by employers. Where it is clear there is a significant pool of suitable labour available locally, my Department, on the recommendation of FÁS, will not consider an application for a work permit in that category and FÁS will assist employers in filling vacancies. The local labour market assessment, by occupational category, will be revised on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>In cases where it is not clear that a suitable pool of labour is available locally and where the employer has made a genuine attempt to recruit an EEA national, the employer will be able to apply for a work permit. The new procedures should help to provide a better service in assisting employers to find suitable staff and to enable them to do so more efficiently when specific skills are agreed to be in short supply. In such cases the present four week advertising period may not be necessary.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the operation of the new procedures will be pragmatic and that the particular characteristics and needs of horticulture and similar sectors will be taken into account. Officials of my Department will shortly meet representatives of the horticultural sector to discuss the issues arising.</P>

      <Quest>the strategy she intends to put in place to help maintain traditional manufacturing jobs within Ireland; if her Department has an estimate as to the number of manufacturing jobs which may be lost over the next five years due to the transfer of companies to lower cost locations; and the way in which Ireland will compete against new entrants to the European Union which can offer similar or lower corporate tax rates to our own while also having a cost base which is a fraction of Irish manufacturing costs.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate the potential number of manufacturing jobs that may be lost over the next five years due to the transfer of companies to lower cost locations, as such moves depend on a range of factors and company decisions to which Government agencies are not always party. However, given the open nature of the Irish economy, maintaining our competitiveness will be critical to sustaining and developing the manufacturing sector, both traditional and innovative, in Ireland over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The strategy being pursued to maintain Irish industry's position is focused on ensuring that the enterprise sector can continue to compete fully with firms in competitor countries. For Irish firms to compete, the development agencies are working the enterprise base to increase labour productivity in existing firms; encourage innovation in all companies; accelerate the shift towards high growth, high tech, high productivity activities; promote continuous upgrading of the educational and skills profile of the workforce and to promote a deepening of the base of Research and Development performing firms. A number of initiatives to sustain the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in Ireland are currently being pursued. IDA Ireland, for example, is working to increase the embeddedness and competitive position of existing foreign companies in Ireland by attracting additional functions to the Irish subsidiary across the full value chain, but with a particular emphasis on research and development, and also by increasing the competence of existing functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is working closely with existing clients in the traditional business sectors and is assisting them by providing advice and referrals, operating a dedicated competitiveness fund, developing exports through trade promotions and provision of incubator space and through a range of new initiatives such as market mentors, training workshops and market visits, which are geared towards clients developing export markets for the first time. In addition, Enterprise Ireland and the other development agencies continue to be active participants in a range of task forces and other working groups established to ameliorate the effects on local <Col N="1047" /> communities of downsizing and company closures by identifying new opportunities for enterprise development and working with new promoters to build viable projects.</P>
    <P>While the enterprise sector has performed well over the past decade, many of the factors that have contributed to its strong performance can no longer be relied upon to fuel future growth. To compete successfully going forward, Ireland requires a business environment that is as conducive to enterprise development as that found in leading competitor counties. In this context the Government is working to strengthen Ireland's business environment by: promoting greater competition in the non-traded sectors of the economy; developing a public administration system that is responsive to the needs of industry; investing in world class physical infrastructure; developing our research and development capability through heavy investment in Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is only through continuous upgrading of our products, processes and people that we can in the long-term secure our industrial production base and ensure that the fickle attraction of low cost production is not the key reason for firms locating in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 167 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent announcements by Technicolor of its intention to close its plant and by Artesyn to reduce the number of people employed at its facility in Youghal are a major disappointment and I recognise the impact on the local community. I am regularly in contact with the development agencies regarding the importance of securing replacement industries for towns affected by job losses. IDA and Enterprise Ireland are working with Artesyn to prepare a profile of its building and it is intended, with the approval of Technicolor, to undertake similar profile work of its building. This will prove useful <Col N="1048" /> in the future marketing of the properties to potential investors.</P>
    <P>These agencies have met the Youghal Chamber of Commerce and are currently working on a profile of the area which will become an intrinsic part of the marketing material for the region. FÁS, the national training authority, has contacted both companies to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment. FÁS will make available its full range of support services including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses.</P>
    <P>While east Cork has suffered job losses in recent times, it has also been extremely successful in terms of attracting new overseas investments to the area, with nearly half of all job announcements in the Cork and Kerry region in 2002 being located in east Cork. This is expected to lead to more than 600 new jobs in the years ahead at Schlumberger, Fournier, RF Integration, Dow Corning and Amersham Health. East Cork has proved to be a particularly attractive location for the health care, pharmaceutical and internationally traded services sectors and IDA Ireland hopes this will result in further investments in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed on the development agencies the importance of making even greater efforts in this field. I make every effort to visit different regional centres and meet a wide range of interested parties on a regular basis. As regards visiting the east Cork area, my colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce, met the Youghal Chamber of Commerce and the Youghal Town Council on 17 January, to discuss the issues arising from the recent announcements. The meeting was attended by the director of the southern region of IDA Ireland and the director of Enterprise Ireland's south west region. A further meeting to discuss the situation took place last Friday, 14 February, between the Minister, Deputy Ahern, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and Cobh and Harbour Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    <P>The State agencies under the auspices of my Department will continue to strongly promote east Cork in the attraction of inward investment and the development and expansion of indigenous industry, including small industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputies' concerns about the job losses over recent months in Ballinasloe and Athlone and I recognise the impact on the lives of workers, their families and the local community.</P>
      <P>In an effort to lessen the impact of the Square D closure in Ballinasloe, the North American division of the parent company, Schneider Electric, has stated that it is committed to working with IDA Ireland to find potential clients for the Ballinasloe plant, to assist employees to obtain new jobs and to provide outplacement assistance and job search training. The agencies under the remit of my Department are also working assiduously to lessen the impact of the closure. IDA has already brought two clients to view the plant and will continue to explore other possibilities as well as seeking out other potential clients. Enterprise Ireland has also begun discussions with the company to offer support for any possible start ups by local senior management. FÁS, the national training authority, has been in contact with the company and will provide a range of training courses which will be designed to meet the skill needs of individuals to enhance their employability, while providing the area with a skilled work force.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is committed to the development of Ballinasloe and is actively promoting the town for new foreign investment. The IDA acquired 35 acres of land at Creagh on the east side of Ballinasloe for development as a new business park. Development work has been completed on the park and the IDA co-operated with local developers to construct a 27,000 sq. ft. advance unit on the park. The IDA has been successful in attracting Valois, a French engineering company, to establish a manufacturing operation in this new unit. Planning permission has been lodged for a second advance building on the park. Construction will commence immediately on receipt of same and the IDA has already begun marketing this facility. Enterprise Ireland, EI, has approved funding of &euro;120,000 for the work in progress at the community owned enterprise centre in Ballinasloe and it is understood that there is still some space available for potential projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Galway county and city enterprise board has been actively involved in industrial-community development in Ballinasloe. During 2002, considerable progress was made with the area community development group which now houses four start up businesses. In relation to Athlone, IDA Ireland is fully committed to the development of the BMW region and has put in <Col N="1050" /> place a strategy to attract greenfield investment into the region, including Athlone. This strategy included the transfer of IDA divisions to Athlone. IDA Ireland has established its health care division in Athlone, together with part of the property and regions divisions and is now fully operational.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is actively working with the support of Athlone Institute of Technology in enhancing the attractiveness of the town and region for inward investment. The objective of this is to establish Athlone as a key location for such investors. In addition, a comprehensive property programme is in place on the Garrycastle business and technology park, Athlone. Two new technology buildings of approximately 25,000 sq. ft. and an office unit of 14,000 sq. ft. are being actively marketed by the IDA. The IDA has obtained planning permission for a third technology building and construction will commence as soon as a tenant has been secured for one of the other two technology buildings on the estate.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is in partnership with Athlone Institute of Technology in setting up the midland enterprise programme which will commence in March 2003. This programme affords the opportunity to develop business plans and to carry out market research for ideas before actually starting a business. All of the State agencies under the auspices of my Department will continue to work closely in the interests of promoting Ballinasloe and Athlone for additional investment and job creation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for enforcing certain aspects of employment rights legislation, including the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. All inspectors carry out night work as part of their normal conditions of service and that element of their duties is almost exclusively related to their role in enforcement of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. Targeted inspections are often by way of out of normal office hours inspection activity, throughout various employment sectors, including fast food outlets, restaurants, licensed premises and hotels. Breaches of the Act come to the attention of my Department by way of complaint by an <Col N="1051" /> individual employee or other concerned person or by the targeted inspections carried out by my Department's inspectors.</P>
      <P>Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the provisions of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996, the matter is referred to my Department's legal advisers for consideration as to the initiation of legal proceedings. During the years 2001 to date some 2,613 inspections under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 were undertaken. Of these, 1,705 inspections were undertaken during regular day time inspection activity while 908 inspections were undertaken as part of night time inspection activity. In addition, the employment rights information unit of my Department concluded a pro-active awareness campaign during 2002 whereby all secondary schools were circulated with information on all aspects of employment law, including details of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. Work has already commenced on a similar campaign this year. Staff of that unit also visit secondary schools, citizen information centres and other organisations to disseminate information on general labour law, including the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I am satisfied there are sufficient procedures in place and an appropriate level of inspection activity to ensure that the provisions of Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 are being complied with. If there is evidence that employers are breaking the law, I ask that the relevant details be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.</P>
      <P>The Government authorised an increase in the number of labour inspectors to seventeen inspectors, which equated to an almost 100% increase in personnel, in conjunction with the introduction of a national minimum wage in 2000. While the number of serving inspectors has fluctuated in the interim, the inspectorate is now operating to almost full strength. There are no plans at this stage to increase the number of inspectors further.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced in line with reduced levels of long-term unemployment and a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports. There were 24,991 participants on CE at the beginning of January and the projected year end participation rate is 20,000. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,000.</P>
      <P>The Government is very much aware of the important contribution that CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years and the difficulties which now arise for sponsor organisations in the voluntary and community sector due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. In this context a cross departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which should be finalised shortly.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and am concerned about the difficulties this is causing generally, including for those involved in the haulage business. I am in favour of a more open market for insurance cover and I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market to help bring this about.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. I expect the study to provide important pointers to the reasons there are not more foreign insurers willing to underwrite insurance in Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to Government action to address the difficulties being faced by companies, on 25 October last I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target time frame; establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter. However, there is an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers.</P>

      <P>On 6 December 2002, my office was advised by IDA Ireland that Wilo Pumps Limited would be reducing its manufacturing operation by 85 jobs at its plant in Limerick and that the announcement would be made on 9 December 2002. IDA Ireland had been working closely with local management of the company in order to maintain the operation's sustainability within the group and I regret the decision by Wilo Pumps Limited to downsize its Irish operation. I understand the company decided that it was necessary to reduce production capacity to achieve required cost efficiencies, logistic advantages and improved economies of scale for the group overall. However, I also understand that the company will retain its existing assembly operation in Limerick, which employs 12 people.</P>
      <P>In reaction to the closure announcement, FÁS representatives visited the plant on 13 and 17 December 2002, with presentations and registrations being offered to all employees. Eighty employees have since registered with FÁS. A total of 44 staff expressed interest in training, 24 of whom requested the introduction to computers course. Subsequently, 11 staff took up a place on a specially arranged introduction to computers course, which commenced on 10 February, 2003.</P>
      <P>There is a strong base of existing IDA supported companies in County Limerick employing approximately 10,000 people. The IDA actively works with these companies to increase their strategic importance to the parent operation, thereby further embedding them in the region. IDA Ireland continuously monitors the position of firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors, to identify both opportunities and threats to employment. The reasons for such relocation are many, varied and complex and, on balance, Ireland continues to benefit from such movement due to the underlying strength of our economy despite the recent world downturn. The IDA cannot be competitive in all types of industrial activity and the agency continues to seek to secure worthwhile employment for our people in areas where Ireland has a competitive advantage.</P>

      <P>The live register figures for both counties increased by 316 over the past year. The live register is not an accurate measure of unemployment. It includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers who are entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Unemployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey, QNHS. Laois and Offaly form part of the midlands for statistical purposes, along with Longford and Westmeath. The following table from the latest quarterly national household survey shows the main labour market data for the region.</P>

      <P>The issue of job creation is a day to day issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and is one in which I have no direct function. In the 12 month period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002 a total of 44,394 job losses were recorded by all the enterprise development agencies. The number of jobs created by the agencies during this period was 35,263.</P>
      <P>The strategies of the enterprise development agencies, the two main ones being IDA Ireland for foreign direct investment and Enterprise Ireland for indigenous industry, are firmly fixed on building and providing the infrastructure for high value added and knowledge intensive industries. In regard to foreign direct investment, the number of new investments secured by IDA Ireland in 2002 was up by two thirds on 2001, with 55 new projects in manufacturing and international services negotiated by the IDA during 2002 compared with 33 in 2001. These projects are committed to creating 8,700 new jobs as they come on stream over the next few years. In addition, the IDA Ireland strategy of delivering 50% of all new greenfield jobs approved to the objective one regions was more than achieved in 2002.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland has identified a number of key factors which impact on the employment levels within its indigenous client companies namely, the weak international trading environment, the weakening competitiveness of companies due to pressure on wage bills, packaging costs, insurance premiums and oil prices and the strengthening euro against both the US dollar and UK sterling. Enterprise Ireland will continue to work closely with clients to seek to minimise the negative impact of these factors by encouraging and supporting new high potential start up companies, developing exports, increasing innovation and improving competitiveness with existing clients and by the development of incubator space through webworks, IT incubation centres and community enterprise centres.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland's commitment to regional development is stronger than ever and, with the national spatial strategy now in place, both agencies are determined to see the emergence of strong magnets of attraction in each region and are working in strong partnership with other organisations at national and local level to influence the delivery of projects to the regions.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing generally, including for various types of community and sporting facilities.</P>
      <P>On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target time frame; establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter. However, there is an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers. I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market. My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace.</P>

The European competitiveness summit provides Ireland with a unique opportunity to host this prestigious event bringing together EU and US leaders in politics, business and academia. The <Col N="1058" /> summit will bring a welcome focus to the competitiveness agenda in advance of our EU Presidency in 2004.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 156 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and is one in which I <Col N="1059" /> have no direct function. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and the county enterprise boards are the agencies under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for industrial development in the north west region.</P>
    <P>In 2002, employment in Enterprise Ireland companies in the north west decreased by 368 people. This was a net decline of 5.57% in employment compared to the national average for Enterprise Ireland-assisted companies, of 3.27%. Enterprise Ireland is proactively adopting a structured approach to driving growth in the north west region through a number of specific measures which help to build the environment for business across the region. These include; making a significant investment in contributing to the development of 20 community enterprise centres across Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo; providing preferential funding for companies with, detailed export plans, expanding or establishing a business in the north west; working closely with existing clients in the north west region to grow and to increase sales, exports and employment through a range of supports and supporting new high potential start up companies.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently in discussion with a number of promoters with a view to establishing new operations in the north west, and is also seeking out new opportunities such as expansions of East coast companies to the region. The recent designation of Letterkenny and Sligo as gateways under the national spatial strategy will assist in promoting the north west region further.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is committed to playing its part in the development of the north west region by maintaining the maximum number of existing jobs in overseas industry and by attracting new foreign direct investment into the region. Over the past two years, IDA Ireland has radically changed its policy with a commitment to delivering half of all new Greenfield jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. A number of positive initiatives have resulted, including: a major project recently announced by Abbott Ireland for the north west region which involves the development of a new pharma project in Sligo with the creation of 190 new jobs; PacifiCare Health Systems Ireland continues to actively recruit as a result of the expansion announced in May 2001, and will bring total employment in the company to over 300 people; ongoing investment at Prumerica Systems Ireland Limited resulting in a current staffing level of approximately 400 people, and MBNA which is currently developing a second building at Carrick-on-Shannon which will increase capacity to allow for a workforce of 1,000 persons in its call centre.</P>
    <P>A number of other companies are continuing to recruit in the region, including Kirchhoff Ireland, Boston Scientific Interventional Technologies and Keith Prowse in Buncrana. In addition, the Letterkenny Business Park has been completed and plans are well advanced to extend this <Col N="1060" /> park. Work has now been completed on the provision of a second 25,000 sqare foot advance factory at the park and planning permission has been sought for a third advance facility. The Finisklin Business Park has been extended and plans are well advanced also for new lands in Sligo. The IDA is currently marketing three vacant facilities in Sligo, together with a vacant advance building in Carrick on Shannon.</P>
    <P>At the micro-enterprise level, the county enterprise boards in Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim continue to work actively with local people to set up, grow and develop micro-enterprises. The boards, whose work results in dispersed economic development throughout the region provide a comprehensive system of capital and employment grants, and support, mentoring, advice, training and development for new and existing micro-enterprises.</P>
    <P>The agencies' commitment to regional development is stronger than ever and with the national spatial strategy now in place, both agencies are determined to see the emergence of strong magnets of attraction in each region and are working in strong partnership with other organisations at national and local level to influence the delivery of projects to the regions.</P>

      <P>The WTO declaration agreed at the fourth trade ministerial meeting in Doha, in November 2001, provides for a new round of multilateral trade liberalisation negotiations across a broad spectrum of trade related issues. The declaration, one of the key documents from the ministerial meeting, outlines a wide-ranging work programme and is the blueprint for negotiations which are scheduled to conclude by 2005.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have already commenced in earnest across a broad range of issues. A substantial WTO negotiating structure is now in place including, at its pinnacle, the trade negotiation committee TNC designed to drive the Doha development agenda. Over coming months, preparations will commence for the next trade ministerial in Mexico in September 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The multilateral trade round is a priority for Ireland, as it is for other member states of the European Union. The conclusion of a successful round of negotiations in the areas of agriculture, services, market access and strengthening the position of developing countries in the multilat<Col N="1061" /> eral trading environment, remain key issues of importance for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming WTO trade ministerial meeting in Cancun will be an important milestone on the road to the successful conclusion of the current trade round. It will be a mid-term ministerial meeting which will take stock of progress and give an overview of what has been accomplished at that stage in areas where negotiations have been launched. On the specific question of bringing trade and investment, trade and competition, public procurement and trade facilitation issues within the negotiations under the current trade round, Ireland supports the European Community approach which is to have these issues included in negotiations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 197 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>While the introduction of a general carbon tax from the end of 2004 was signalled by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech last December, the tax framework has not yet been developed. The Minister made it clear that given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consultation with interested parties on the design of the tax. This commitment to consultation is reiterated in the draft social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which states that in keeping with Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the announcement in the budget regarding the development of a general carbon tax, there will be full consultation with the social partners having regard to the potential implications for jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion; I expect that the Minister for Finance will initiate consultations to develop a framework for the tax shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will be fully involved in the development process, where important issues with implications for industry are likely to <Col N="1062" /> include, the level at which the tax will be set, the question of exemptions or reductions for companies engaged in other greenhouse gas reduction measures such as emissions trading and negotiated agreements and the question of recycling the tax. In developing the tax framework, a crucial consideration will be minimisation of any impact on competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The proposed introduction of carbon tax is in response to our international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Taxation is one of a number of measures included in the national climate change strategy, which sets out a framework of mechanisms to help Ireland to meet this international commitment. In regard to the Deputy's question on a study of the impact on industry of the introduction of carbon tax, Forfás, in conjunction with my Department, commissioned studies to asses how best to achieve the reduction targets specified for the enterprise sector in a way that would minimise the effects on competitiveness. These studies focused on taxation, negotiated agreements, emissions trading and investment in international greenhouse gas reduction projects. Industry representatives participated in the steering group for these studies. This work has been contributing to the development of policy for emission reductions in the enterprise sector and will be useful source of information in developing a framework for carbon taxation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of increases in energy costs to industry already signalled by the CER, the position is that the CER is responsible for electricity prices and comes within the remit of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, I understand that the CER has not made any announcement regarding increases in electricity prices for 2004.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the council on bio-ethics was recommended by the report of the inter-departmental group on modern biotechnology, which reported in October 2000. My Department invited the Royal Irish Academy to establish the council and it is funded by an enabling grant from Forfás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Critically, the council is independent and autonomous and has established its own terms of reference and work programme. The council's terms of reference are: to identify and interpret the ethical questions raised by biological and medical research in order to respond to, and anticipate questions of substantive concern; to investigate and report on such questions in the interests of promoting public understanding, <Col N="1063" /> informed discussion and education and; in the light of the outcome of its work, to stimulate discussion through conferences, workshops, lectures, published reports and where appropriate suggest guidelines.</P>
    <P>The council has recently appointed a scientific director and has established a number of working groups. Full details may be obtained at www.bioethics.ie.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome and value the role which the council can play in clarifying and reporting on the ethical issues which increasingly arise with the advance of medical and biological technology. I expect the outputs of the council will be extremely valuable to policy makers, physicians, scientists and society in dealing with these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of health and safety standards in the construction sector, as in all sectors of employment, requires the fulfilment of their respective responsibilities and duties by all parties concerned. There is in existence a strong occupational health and safety legislative code, including detailed regulations dealing specifically with the construction sector that place legal obligations on a wide range of people including clients, designers, contractors and employers.</P>
      <P>The sub-contracting of specialist work by main contractors to sub-contractors is an established practice, both in Ireland and other European countries. The primary purpose of sub-contracting is to allow the main contractor to take on a larger volume, and a wider range, of work than would be possible if limited to the labour force directly employed by the main contractor.</P>
      <P>As regards the direct impact of sub-contracting on health and safety standards, notwithstanding the economic or business considerations behind the practice of sub-contracting, it should not lead to a lessening of on-site health and safety standards. The operation of a sub-contracting system should not, of its own accord, preclude or prevent the development of good on-site health and safety standards in accordance with statutory requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and the 2001 construction regulations provide a solid legislative guide by which effective health and safety procedures can be managed in all forms of employment. All construction sites, regardless of the work practices employed, are <Col N="1064" /> subject to the provisions of occupational health and safety legislation.</P>
    <P>The principal legislation relating to safety, health and welfare in construction work includes the specific provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2001, general duties in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and supplementary provisions in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 1993. Under the Construction Regulations 2001, a contractor means any employer whose employees carry out construction work and the definition includes both main contractors and sub-contractors. Contractors may also include a self-employed person where such a person supplies materials and labour, or labour only. In addition, the definition of contractor includes a body, for example a local authority, where the construction work is carried out directly by employees of that body.</P>
    <P>The 2001 construction regulations place very clear and specific duties on contractors. Contractors are responsible for the safety and health of their own employees. Contractors also have responsibility for other persons under their control. Contractor's duties include co-operation with the project supervisor construction stage and other contractors so that they all can comply with their statutory duties, identification of the hazards associated with their work activities, assessment of the risks that result from this work and consultation with the project supervisor construction stage, the appointment of a safety officer on any site in which he normally has more than 20 persons the appointment of a safety officer on any site in which he normally has more than 20 persons under his direct control, ensuring that any plant or equipment, including scaffolding, lifting appliances, trench supports, mixers and safety equipment, which is erected, installed or used on site complies with the Regulation and ensuring that their employees and-or safety representative are informed of the measures being put in place on the site concerning their safety and health.</P>
    <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and the General Application Regulations 1993, contractors, as in the case of all other employers or self-employed, are also required to comply with the various general duties of care which are specified in relation to hazard identification, risk assessment, implementation of prevention measures, safety consultation etc.</P>
    <P>The Construction Safety Partnership, CSP, is a tripartite forum with a specific remit to improve health and safety standards in the construction sector. There has been good progress to date in the implementation and advancement of the recommendations contained in the construction safety plan, especially in relation to the development of the legislative amendments and the introduction of mandatory safety training and mandatory safety representation. However, while <Col N="1065" /> progress has been made in recent years, the challenge now is to maintain and improve upon this progress. The construction related fatalities in 2002 are testament to the fact that health and safety in the construction sector can still be literally a life and death issue. There remains an ongoing need for action at all levels whether this is action by the State, the social partners or by individuals at site level. In this regard, ways in which to continue and build upon the work of the partnership are being explored.</P>

    <P>The increased level of job losses experienced over recent months are a reflection of slower economic activity experienced in Ireland in line with deteriorating global economic conditions. They are not due to any underlying weakness in the Irish economy. Domestic economic conditions remained robust throughout 2002, and while GNP figures for 2002 represented a slowdown from 2001, growth was still running at more than twice the EU average.</P>
    <P>Where job losses occur, or where we become aware that particular companies are experiencing competitive difficulties, the agencies of my Department are available to work, together with other local bodies and interests, to address with the companies involved the difficulties arising, and to provide any assistance possible to the workers affected.</P>
    <P>These agencies are also continuing to have considerable success, in the current difficult international environment, both in the creation of new jobs and in assisting companies to move to higher value activities or otherwise develop their operations. Based on figures supplied through Forfás, gross job gains in 2002 in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development, and enterprise boards amounted to 35,623.</P>
    <P>The international economic environment is likely to remain challenging in the near term due to a number of factors, including continuing weaker than expected global demand, volatile <Col N="1066" /> stock markets and, not least, rising international geo-political risks. Against this background, issues which threaten to erode Ireland's competitiveness on the international stage will continue to be the focus of Government attention. In particular it is crucial that we prevent high levels of inflation becoming embedded in the economy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>Sixteen investigations into company law related matters have been initiated by me since I came into office in my previous term as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In respect of three of these, the High Court appointed, on an application by me, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The High Court Inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on Monday 10 June 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited section 8 inquiries are continuing. A further interim report was presented to the High Court on 24 July 2002. It is now anticipated the final report will be submitted to the High Court towards the end of 2003. As in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the question of whether the reports are published is entirely a matter for the High Court. The High Court ordered the publication of the Ansbacher Report. One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Eleven investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Five of these have been concluded. Of the five investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. The file in one case was returned and a number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and has been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. My Depart<Col N="1068" /> ment is considering whether this report should be referred to other authorities. Four investigations under section 19 are ongoing. Reports in respect of two of these four investigations are at a very advanced stage of completion.</P>
    <P>Two investigations were held up in legal appeals, on which a judgment was delivered on 5 June 2002. The High Court ruled on certain constitutional issues which had been referred back to the High Court by the Supreme Court. It is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to decide how to proceed on these latter investigations. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. This report has been completed and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company. The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to &euro;9.73 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of civil service staff working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations is being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this &euro;9.73 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 &ndash; National Irish Bank &euro;4.88 million and Ansbacher &euro;3.5 million.</P>
    <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. In respect of the Ansbacher investigation, the Minister for Justice presented a motion to the High Court in July 2002 seeking to have Ansbacher and seven other companies dealt with in the inspectors' report made liable for the costs of the investigation. Consideration of this motion is ongoing before the High Court.</P>

      <P>The insurance annual report &ndash; the Blue Book &ndash; presents detailed information on the Irish insurance industry in 2001. The information is sourced primarily from the regulatory financial returns which insurance companies are required to provide to the insurance division of my Department. The report also provides more general information both on regulatory developments and significant issues which affected the sector during 2001. I am happy to report that due to my Department's continued policy of stringent and prudential supervision of all insurance companies, we had no insurance failures this year.</P>
      <P>During 2001 there was 150 insurance undertakings supervised by my Department. In addition, we were notified of three new branches of insurance companies from other jurisdictions wishing to establish in Ireland and 12 additional companies wishing to write into Ireland on a freedom of services basis from other EU jurisdictions. At the end of 2001 there was 12,168 people employed by insurance companies in Ireland. Total premium income received by Irish insurance companies during 2001 amounted to &euro;18.9 billion.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, 2001 was a difficult year for the insurance sector worldwide, particularly the non-life sector, with hardening insurance markets, and of course the tragic events of 11 September. The returns submitted by the Irish non-life companies indicated that they had suffered a loss on their underwriting business. However, when the strong investments returns attributable to the underwriting account were factored in, there was an overall profit on the technical account of &euro;278 million. This represented a significant improvement on the prior year returns.</P>
      <P>As I announced last year, the current format of the insurance annual report will be revised to make the document more user-friendly for the general consumer. This is in keeping with the recommendation made by the Motor Insurance Advisory Bureau. At present the blue book which is available to the public both from the Government's publication office and from my Department's website, is primarily used as an industry resource.</P>

      <P>Employment rights legislation has grown in volume, scope and complexity since the 1970s and that complexity extends also to the mechanisms for inspection, enforcement and the resolution of conflict. The current system of rights and responsibilities has developed, very often, in response to EU initiatives and has been grafted on to existing institutions. The Government is committed to reviewing the employment rights bodies and my Department will initiate this review towards the end of the year. It is envisaged that the review will consider the current employment rights legislation and the legislation governing the Labour Court, the LRC, the rights commissioner service and the employment appeals <Col N="1071" /> tribunal. The aim of the review will be to make recommendations on the services of the employment rights bodies to ensure that these are clear, coherent and user-friendly.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the activities of an employment agency (details supplied) which has been inviting Irish meat companies to recruit butchers from Nepal on the basis that they are shy and do not cause trouble and will be thrilled to earn the national minimum wage; her plans to control or regulate the activities of such agencies, especially in view of the concerns expressed by the trade union movement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of the employment agency referred to in the question are currently being investigated within my Department. There is a policy in place in my Department whereby the processing of work permit applications for any employer is suspended when the Department becomes aware of any concerns regarding that employer's compliance with the obligations set out in the various employment rights enactments. If there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting foreign workers employed under the work permit system, I would ask that it be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.</P>
      <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including foreign workers employed under the work permit system. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment for all the various categories of workers employed in Ireland and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspectorate seek redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. The Inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to foreign workers employed under the work permit system in exactly the same manner as it does to native Irish or EU workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment agency sector is currently subject to the licensing provisions of the Employment Agency Act 1971. A review, in consultation with the social partners and others, of the need to adapt the above Act, or the necessity for new legislation, will be initiated before this summer. This review will consider the most appropriate <Col N="1072" /> approach to the regulation of agencies and their activities.</P>
    <P>However, in order to effect an early update of penalties under the above Act, the opportunity is being availed of in the drafting of the fixed term contracts Bill &ndash; which is expected to be published by mid-April 2003 &ndash; to provide that the level of fines for operating without an employment agency licence will be increased to &euro;2,000 and a further amount of &euro;1,000 per day for continuing offences.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 170, 189, 194 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The ministerial committee established to oversee implementation of insurance reform, which I chair also includes the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Transport and the chairperson of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.</P>
      <P>To date, the ministerial committee has met once. That meeting was attended by the Ministers as stated above and senior officials from the respective Departments. As a follow-up to that meeting four other bilateral meetings have taken place involving the various Departments and the Irish Insurance Federation. These meetings were attended by senior officials. Another ministerial meeting has been scheduled to take place within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made on the majority of the MIAB recommendations and, to date, ten have been implemented. EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the pricing or underwriting of insurance. However, I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken as outlined in my reform programme will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers. I expect such benefits to accrue when more of the reforms are in place.</P>

      <P>A calendar of meetings in relation to the trade negotiations will be drawn up closer to the time when Ireland assumes the Presidency of the European Union. I will obviously consult with my Government colleagues, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in drawing up a calendar of meetings at Council and working group levels. This will also be prepared in consultation with the EU Council and Commission.</P>
      <P>The Trade Agenda for Ireland's Presidency will be determined to a large extent on the stage of progress of the trade negotiations at WTO and EU fora, the priorities attached to specific issues as well as the milestones to be achieved and the outputs to be delivered under the Doha development agenda. Currently, and prior to the lead-in to the Irish Presidency, there is a substantial and diverse range of trade negotiation issues being considered at European Union level with substantive EU inputs being submitted for consideration at relevant WTO fora in Geneva across the whole spectrum of trade issues, including in the areas of agriculture, services and market access.</P>

It should be noted that: the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit, statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the Quarterly National Household Survey; and the exact area covered by each local office is not limited to the immediate locality of the particular office. For instance, in the Tallaght local office persons from the Blessington area may be registered.</P>
    <P>The live register figures for the local offices of Cobh, Midleton and Youghal from January 2001 to January 2003 are set out in the following table:</P>

Consideration of how best to do this, particularly in the context of the commitment in the programme for Government to examine ways of maximising both the efficiency of the process and the contribution of the diverse and vibrant community and voluntary sectors, has been taking place in parallel with the sustaining progress negotiations.

FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programmes and the outcome of this process will feed into the deliberations of the standing committee.

      <P>The general financial measures put forwarded by the Estimates Review Committee were adopted by my Department with some alterations to meet operational requirements. These adjustments were incorporated in my Department's Abridged Estimates Volume for 2003 in a manner which ensured that the net Exchequer requirement for my Department did not increase beyond that envisaged by the review committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the specific recommendations made by the committee in its commentary, the current position in each case is outlined below. The committee strongly recommends that a strategic review of the various expenditures feeding into the sup<Col N="1089" /> port of the long-term unemployed be undertaken as soon as possible. A cross-departmental group of senior officials is undertaking a review of the community employment scheme and other such schemes across Departments both from the perspective of the labour market and the provision of community services. The review will inform the Government's consideration of the options for the future of CE and other related programmes.</P>
    <P>The Committee recommends that FÁS should be required to provide an administrative efficiency dividend equivalent to 2% of its administrative spending. A reduction of 2% was applied to the projected administration costs of FÁS in the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2003. FÁS has agreed to operate within its reduced allocation.</P>
    <P>The National Training Fund, NTF, was set up to generate resources for skills training among those in, or seeking, employment and is likely to have generated a surplus of approximately &euro;100 million by the end of 2002. The committee considers it would be more appropriate to use a proportion of this existing surplus in place of voted expenditure to support the level of training envisaged for 2003 and beyond. It recommends, therefore, that consideration be given to using the fund in this way and that corresponding reductions on voted expenditure be taken as savings. A figure of &euro;50 million is suggested for 2003.</P>
    <P>My Department accepted the proposal of the committee and also secured Department of Finance approval to draw down a further &euro;12.049 million from the NTF to fund some of the adjustments referred to above.</P>

The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain recent high increases in premiums, including low investment returns, the 11 September attacks in the US, high levels of compensation and the cost of settling claims.</P>
      <P>On 25 October 2002, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the Implementation Group on the PIAB.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premiums to consumers. I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market. My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace.</P>

      <P>I appointed the chairperson and ordinary members of the interim board of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on 27 November 2002. The chairperson has engaged in an intensive round of bilateral contacts with members of the interim board. These bilateral meetings have covered matters relating to the future work of the board, for example, the compilation of a database of court awards. In this regard, a considerable amount of information on court awards has been obtained from the Courts Service for study. Discussions have also commenced in relation to the future ongoing monitoring of delivery costs of compensation in the PIAB system. This preparatory work has allowed the members to familiarise themselves with the work to be done and with each other and will enable the Board to &lsquo;hit the ground running' immediately.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently being made for the holding of the inaugural meeting of the board later this month. One of the tasks of the interim board is to contribute to the preparation of the requisite legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory basis. It is difficult to give a precise indication of when the legislation will be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas, but the preparation of the legislation is being given priority.</P>

The purpose of the Shannon stopover by US military aircraft was for refuelling purposes only and did not involve any customs procedures either in relation to the US army personnel or goods carried on the aircraft. In these circumstances, the 1983 Act does not apply.</P>

      <P>The management of the industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function. I have not received any requests for funding from the IDA in relation to the remedial works for the sewer and services at Ballybrit. I understand that the services in question were constructed by IDA Ireland in the mid 1970s and involved bringing foul sewer-surface sewer and water services from the then existing services at IDA Ireland's Ballybrit industrial estate to service new lands acquired by the agency at Parkmore, located to the west of Galway City.</P>
      <P>These services are owned by IDA Ireland and are the sole means of providing these services to the Galway Business and Technology Park, Parkmore East and West. At the time of construction, all costs attributed to the development of these services were borne by IDA Ireland. While IDA Ireland has indicated it has no objection in principle to the taking-in-charge of these services by Galway County Council, it must be noted that this would represent no strategic benefit to the agency in its industrial development remit. Thus, it is the view of the IDA that, in any such transfer, a proportion of the remaining capacity in both the foul sewer and the water supply must be available to industry locating on the Galway Business and Technology Park, Parkmore East and West. This remaining capacity is vital for the future marketing and development of the Galway Business and Technology Park, which is dependent on having a water supply and foul disposal capability that meets with the potential needs of IDA client companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway City Council has informed IDA Ireland that it requires the agency to undertake approximately &euro;391,000 of remedial works to the services infrastructure prior to Galway City Council taking the services in charge. The works <Col N="1093" /> in question relate to parts of the infrastructure which may need future replacement in the short to medium term due to its age. It is the view of IDA Ireland that this level of expenditure is not warranted at the present time and that the services infrastructure does not require remedial work of the magnitude envisaged by Galway City Council. IDA has no plans to fund the costs of any remedial works over and above the level of works that they envisage. In the event of agreement being reached between IDA and Galway City Council regarding the scale of remedial works necessary in order to have the services taken in charge, funding for the works could be provided from within the IDA property budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate the potential number of manufacturing jobs that may be lost over the next five years due to the transfer of companies to lower cost locations, as such moves depend on a range of factors and company decisions to which Government agencies are not always party. However, that having been said, and given the open nature of the Irish economy, maintaining our competitiveness will be critical to sustaining and developing the manufacturing sector, both traditional and innovative, in Ireland over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The strategy being pursued to maintain Irish industry's position is focused on ensuring that the enterprise sector can continue to compete fully with firms in competitor countries. For Irish firms to compete, the development agencies are working the enterprise base to increase labour productivity in existing firms; encourage innovation in all companies; accelerate the shift towards high-growth, high-tech, high-productivity activities; promote continuous upgrading of the educational and skills profile of the workforce; and promote a deepening of the base of R&amp;D performing firms.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives to sustain the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in Ireland are currently being pursued. For example, IDA Ireland is working to increase the embeddedness and competitive position of existing foreign companies in Ireland by attracting additional functions to the Irish subsidiary across the full value chain, but with a particular emphasis on research and development, and also by increasing the competence of existing functions.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is working closely with existing clients in the traditional business sectors and is assisting them by providing advice and referrals, operating a dedicated competitiveness fund, developing exports through trade promotions and provision of incubator space, and through a range of new initiatives such as market mentors, training workshops and market visits, which are geared towards clients developing export markets for the first time. In addition, Enterprise Ireland and the other development agencies continue to be active participants in a range of task forces and other working groups established to ameliorate the effects on local communities of downsizing and company closures by identifying new opportunities for enterprise development and working with new promoters to build viable projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the enterprise sector has performed well over the last decade, many of the factors that have contributed to its strong performance can no longer be relied upon to fuel future growth. In order to compete successfully going forward, Ireland requires a business environment that is as conducive to enterprise development as that found in leading and competitor counties. In this context the Government is working to strengthen Ireland's business environment by promoting <Col N="1096" /> greater competition in the non-traded sectors of the economy; developing a public administration system that is responsive to the needs of industry; investing in world class physical infrastructure and developing our research and development capability through heavy investment in Science Foundation Ireland. It is only through continuous upgrading of our products, processes and people that we can in the long-term secure our industrial production base and ensure that the fickle attraction of low cost production is not the key reason for firms locating in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Given the importance of the IT sector to the economy, the Government keeps under regular review the situation with regard to supply and demand for IT skills. In response to the considerable growth in recent years in the demand for persons with IT skills, State investment in relevant education and training was considerably expanded and the current provision is broadly adequate to meet the foreseeable demands for IT skills in the economy. The challenge for the future is to continue to provide for the range of skills, and particularly the higher level skills, which are increasingly in demand in the sector. For this reason, investment in IT training continues to be of importance in developing the Irish workforce and supporting future economic growth in the sector.</P>
      <P>In the last few years, when it was obvious that the supply of skills, having regard to the output from Irish colleges and training institutions, was inadequate to meet the skill needs of the economy, I was happy to support the attraction to Ireland of skilled IT professionals through the operation of the working visa-work authorisation scheme. The downturn in the global economy and particularly the IT sector now suggests that it would be timely to look again at the sector specific forecast of the likely demand and supply for ICT skills into the medium term which was set out in the third report of the expert group on future skills needs. The EGFSN has planned to undertake a new study of the IT sector this year. I look forward to their report as an important input to the development of Government policy in this area.</P>

      <P>In the past 18 months, exporters have faced a difficult trading environment as the global economy has slowed down. As it is not clear that a significant recovery will occur in the short-term, the Government, through Enterprise Ireland, has been assisting exporters by focusing on actions with near to market impact.</P>
      <P>This approach is focused on internationalisation and seeking new markets by making a sustained effort to help Irish companies gain access to potential export market opportunities and raise their level of innovation both in product and process terms. A number of new initiatives are being introduced in 2003, such as the introduction of an in-market mentor panel in the UK and in key European markets.</P>
      <P>The following lists the current activities being undertaken by Enterprise Ireland to assist companies in internationalisation and in finding new markets: running workshops, seminars and exploratory market visits to familiarise companies with the requirements of successful export market penetration; providing access to international market reports and undertaking research on behalf of clients, or groups of clients, to identify specific opportunities; identifying, recruiting or upskilling key marketing personnel and specialist consultants; providing access to potential buyers-partners-distributors through individual itineraries, trade missions, participation at trade fairs or through introductions to buyers on inward missions; and providing incubator space in overseas markets for early stage market entrants and supporting these incubators with back-up services.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is also seeking to raise the level of innovation in client companies, both in products and process terms, by supporting individual company applied research programmes through the RTI initiative and supporting the applied research programmes in the research institutes &ndash; including third level colleges &ndash; and developing mechanisms for the transfer of technologies from the research institutes into commercial projects.</P>

This is consistent with the Government's decision to restructure CE with levels being reduced gradually to reflect the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training. Overall investment in FÁS training programmes in 2003 is being maintained close to 2002 levels with funding of &euro;295.573 million being made available compared to &euro;301.018 million in 2002. FÁS, taking into account policy guidelines, will decide on the priorities between schemes and activities from within this allocation. In this context FÁS will be required to maximise the benefits to its client base of the available funding through greater efficiencies.</P>

      <P>It is not possible for the industrial development agencies to determine the number of jobs which have been relocated to low wage economies in any particular period, as statistics are not maintained in this form. However, the reasons behind specific relocations are closely examined by my Department and its agencies in the context of maintaining Ireland as an attractive and competitive location for investment. Factors contributing to a decision to relocate all or part of an enterprise may include consolidation, merger or acquisition, or changes in product or market focus, in addition to relative wage rates and other costs and available incentives. Ireland both gains and loses from such decisions, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years with losses being counteracted by firms choosing this country as a location for certain higher value added business functions. To facilitate enterprise development, the focus is on strengthening Ireland's research capacity, enhancing our skills base, implementing infrastructural improvements, and shaping the regulatory environment. Competitiveness in world markets is also a key factor in negotiations on post-PPF arrangements and control of public spending.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which she has identified further foreign investors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The identification of foreign investors is an operational matter for IDA Ireland, the agency charged with responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment. IDA seeks to find new investment opportunities on a continuous basis both from new and existing clients. Part of this effort is spearheaded by its overseas offices, which are located in the countries that are the major sources for foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>The IDA feels there is a brighter future ahead in 2003 for inward investment than there has been for the past two years. Despite the turbulent global conditions in 2002 the results for the year exceeded expectations, with a last quarter boost in new projects secured by IDA and a strengthening pipeline of investments in negotiation for the first quarter 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA supported companies created 11,700 during 2002. Job loss trends have slowed, with 14,700 jobs lost in 2002 compared with 17,800 in the previous year. Total employment in IDA-backed companies fell by 2.2% during the year. The number of new investments secured in 2002 was up by two thirds on 2001: 55 new projects in manu<Col N="1100" /> facturing and international services were negotiated by IDA during 2002, compared with 33 in 2001. These projects are committed to creating 8,700 new jobs as they come on stream over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The message is also getting through that more high value activities need to be added to overseas companies in Ireland. During 2002, 30 companies undertook to invest nearly &euro;120 million in research and development activities in their Irish operations and IDA committed nearly &euro;30 million to these projects. This indicates a very strong commitment to adding higher value activity to existing operations in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Based on data now finalised for year ending 2001, IDA backed companies increased their sales and exports by around 10% and their value in the economy has increased to nearly &euro;16 billion per annum through their local expenditures. Sales from IDA supported companies now total over &euro;65 billion, with exports valued at &euro;60 billion. IDA Ireland's commitment to regional development is stronger than ever and now with the national spatial strategy in place IDA is determined to see the emergence of strong magnets of attraction in each region. For their successful development each region needs to develop clear competitive reasons why companies would wish to locate there, rather than elsewhere. Much of the work needed to achieve such competitive advantage is outside the scope of IDA but through working in strong partnership with other organisations at national and local level IDA can support and influence the delivery of some of the required solutions. The IDA strategy to deliver 50% of all new greenfield jobs approved to the objective one regions was more than achieved in 2002.</P>
    <P>The day to day work of promoting Ireland as an investment location continues apace. IDA's focus continues to be on the business sectors which have given us success in the past decade; information and communications technologies pharmaceuticals and health care engineering and international services &ndash; such as software, financial services and others. These are the cornerstones of IDA's development polices and any change in direction or activity is to drive investment projects higher up the value chain to match the new needs of businesses and of the economy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 212 together.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter. Therefore, I do not have specific information on insurance premium increases. However, I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing generally, including in the business area.</P>
      <P>On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing and; publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market. My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken <Col N="1104" /> into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. While the 11 September attacks in the US are said to have impacted on the insurance market here, many other factors are also involved in putting upward pressure on premiums &ndash; reduction in investment returns, level of compensation awards and cost of settling claims, are examples. It is difficult to indicate the impact of any one factor on Irish premiums.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 to 217, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Gulfstream IV was leased initially for a period of ten years from December 1991 to December 2001 for use as a ministerial air transport aircraft. The lease contained a purchase option which was exercised at the termination of the lease period. The ministerial air transport service is being reviewed at present in the light of this country's presidency of the European Union in 2004 and requirements in the longer term. The retention or disposal of the Gulfstream IV will be considered in the context of this review and a decision in this matter is expected shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the aircraft was acquired in December 1991 it has flown a total of approximately 8,400 hours. The aircraft completes an annual maintenance inspection at a manufacturers approved maintenance facility. A 72 month maintenance inspection is scheduled to take place this summer. This is routine maintenance in accordance with the manufacturer's maintenance schedule. I am <Col N="1105" /> informed by the Air Corps authorities that the Gulfstream IV is fully airworthy and that there is no corrosion present on the aircraft.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the military authorities that an applicant for enlistment with the reserve must be ordinarily resident within the State for the purposes of joining the Reserve Defence Force. The relevant Defence Force regulation states that a person ordinarily resident outside the State is ineligible for FCA enlistment. There is a specific provision that a person who is residing temporarily within the State, for the purpose of attending a course of education, and who is ordinarily resident in Ireland, may however be enlisted. I will have these particular provisions examined by the relevant military authorities with a view to an evaluation of their contemporary relevance as regards policy and practical administration. The general residence criterion within the relevant regulations has existed since before World War II.</P>

      <P>The gross provision for Defence in the abridged version of the Estimates for 2003 is in line with the amount recommended by the Estimates review committee. It had recommended, among other things, that the second phase of the armoured personnel carrier programme be postponed, that the proposed spend on trainer aircraft be reduced by 50% and that expenditure on the capital building programme be reduced by &euro;6 million. However, by re-allocating moneys within the overall provision in 2002 and 2003, it has been possible to proceed with the acquisition of eight trainer air<Col N="1106" /> craft and an additional 25 armoured personnel carriers. The amount provided for the capital building programme in 2003 was reduced by only &euro;2 million instead of the &euro;6 million recommended by the committee.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proceeds from the sale of surplus property, the committee recommended that, with effect from 2003, estimated receipts should be included under appropriations-in-aid in the Defence Vote.

      <P>As I stated previously in reply to Questions Nos. 155, 156 and 157 on 12 November 2002, my Department has accepted an offer from Florence Properties Limited for the sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin. The Department is in the process of effecting first registration on the title to this property in the Land Registry and the contract of sale is expected to be finalised shortly.</P>
      <P>Florence Properties issued a press release in November last indicating that it had agreed to purchase the property in question. The press release said that &ldquo;Florence Properties (Ireland) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Florence Properties (Jersey) which is owned by a trust company, the beneficiaries of which are the family of Irish-born property developer David Kennedy&rdquo;.</P>

Subject to the provisions of the scheme, my Department pays the farmer the difference between this valuation and the salvage value of the carcass which is paid directly to the farmer by the meat factory. The reactor animal remains at all times the property of the farmer.</P>

      <P>Further to the introduction of EEC Council and Commission regulations in the early 1980s, beef carcass classification became a requirement in each member state. Its main function is to provide a standardised method for reporting the price paid for slaughtered animals. The weekly price data from each member state, when collated and analysed by the European Commission, provides a basis for market management decisions under the common organisation of the market. In addition, carcass classification facilitates an equitable basis for payment to the producer because it provides an effective predictor of meat yield. The cost to operate the beef carcass classification scheme and other related duties is of the order of &euro;4.25 million per annum.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to cases where details of bovine animals sold through marts, including a record of the new herdowners, have not been notified to the animal identification and tracing database, CMMS.</P>
      <P>There is on going monitoring of the accuracy and comprehensive nature of all information notified to the CMMS database, including data received from marts. Where gaps are identified in data, additional procedures are applied to ensure the accuracy and comprehensive nature of the information provided. Discussions are continuing with the representative trade organisations of all groups providing data, including marts, to address these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marts are required to notify details of movements through their premises within three working days of the event. This means that the database will not have been updated in respect of any animals, which move either directly from the mart to the meat plant or within a day or two thereafter. Accordingly, the procedures for accepting animals at meat plants provide that, in such cases, <Col N="1109" /> the mart stamp and the record of the sale on the passport can be accepted as evidence of new ownership and the slaughter of the animal may proceed. Where the movement through the mart occurred outside the previous four working days, Department staff at the meat plant are also required to notify the details to the relevant division for follow-up with the mart concerned.</P>
    <P>In this context, animals would generally only be rejected at meat plants where the passport details are not up to date or there are other reasons that the ownership is called into question.</P>

      <P>In this case one application was lodged for special beef premium dated 12 March 2002. The application was processed and an 80% advance was paid on nine animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person involved applied for premium for 22 animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme. A producer inspection was carried out on 5 December 2002 at which it was found that <Col N="1113" /> the movement into the herd of one unclaimed animal, tag number 291212330014, was not recorded on the CMMS as is required under clause 32C of the terms and conditions of the scheme. Correspondence issued to the herdowner on 17 January 2003 advising him of the implications of this matter and allowing him 21 days to seek a review. He replied stating that he does not wish to have the decision reviewed. The application has been processed and payment of the 80% advance instalment under the suckler cow scheme will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>The herdowner has 21 animals eligible under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme, 20 of which are also eligible under the national envelope top-up. Advance payment in respect of two animals under the slaughter premium amounting to &euro;128 and one animal under the national envelope amounting to &euro;18.28 issued on 16 October 2002. Advance slaughter premium and national envelope payments will issue on the remaining animals shortly.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms and conditions governing the premium schemes in 2002, a small monetary penalty will be applied when all balancing payments are being made as a result of the failure by the person named to record one unclaimed animal on the CMMS.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an area aid application, which included land that was also claimed by another herdowner. My Department contacted both herdowners to clarify the matter. Both herdowners responded indicating that they did have the right to claim the area in question. In order to resolve this issue an inspection of the land parcel in question will take place shortly. Until this matter is resolved the area aid application of the person named cannot be fully processed and no further area related payments can issue.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid &euro;1,172.33 on 20 September 2002 under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 13.19 hectares of more severely handicapped land at &euro;88.88 per hectare. This payment may need to be reviewed depending on the outcome of inquiries relative to the parcel for which there is a duplicate claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named submitted three applications in respect of four animals under the 2002 special beef premium scheme. Advance payment issued on the first application in respect of two animals on 16 October 2002. The second and third applications were submitted in November and December and will be eligible for payment <Col N="1114" /> following the completion of the retention period, subject to compliance with scheme requirements. However, no further payments may issue to the person named until the outstanding area aid issues are resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the announcement of the changes to the 1994 scheme of early retirement, my Department has identified about 130 cases where payment of pension may have been affected by the application of the rules on enlargement and farming as a main occupation after the first five years participation in the scheme had been completed.</P>
      <P>The changes agreed by the European Commission mean that the obligations on the transferee &ndash; the person who took over the farm &ndash; to have enlargement land and to engage in farming as a main occupation are now confined to the first five years of participation in the scheme. Once the transferee has satisfied these conditions for five years, those conditions cease to apply though the transferee must continue to farm the pension lands, the lands transferred by the retiring farmer, for the full period of the pension.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently contacting people who may benefit from the changes, with a view to establishing their eligibility for further payment of pension. Until these inquiries are complete it is not possible to confirm the number of pensions that are likely to be reinstated. In a number of cases, eligibility for further payment of the early retirement pension may be affected by whether the participant, or his or her spouse or partner in a joint management application, is receiving a national retirement pension. Under the governing EU regulation, the early retirement pension is payable only as a supplement to a national retirement pension.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the implementation of the commonage framework plans were finalised after a series of meetings between my officials and the farming organisations stretching over several months and covering a wide range of issues. I am fully aware of the concerns of farmers and the arrangements that I have now put in place afford farmers the maximum flexibility compatible with the 1998 agreement on commonages between my Department and the European Commission. That agreement formed the basis on which I have been able since 1999 to make generous payments of up to &euro;242 per hectare on commonage land to farmers in REPS. I am satisfied there is no scope for further concessions.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are required to destock under the commonage framework plans may either join REPS and accept the generous payment rates negotiated in 1998, or alternatively they may apply for compensation under a national scheme to be operated by Dúchas. I understand that discussions on this scheme between Dúchas and the European Commission are at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the arrangements to enable farmers to appeal the destocking levels recommended in commonage framework plans. The appeals process will consist of a reassessment of the plan by a second approved framework planning team, and a contribution of up to &euro;1,300 will be available towards the cost of each appeal.</P>

      <P>The 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming and the current scheme introduced in November 2000 are both governed by EU Council regulations. It is a requirement of these regulations that the early retirement pension may be paid only as a supplement to any national retirement pension payable. This means that any national retirement pension payable to a participant in the scheme, or to his or her spouse or partner in a joint management application, must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The overpayment for the person named, amounting to &euro;1,465.89, arose because he was getting the full amount of an early retirement pension and was also receiving the national non-contributory old age pension at the same time. My Department is obliged to recover all such overpayments under the scheme. However, my officials will consider sympathetically any proposals the person named may wish to make to repay the full amount over a period of time.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations governing the 2001 special beef premium scheme, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each producer's reckonable livestock units are obtained in respect of the calendar year as follows: for male cattle up to and including 24 months old on which the producer applies for 2001 special beef premium and bull premium, 0.6 livestock unit each; for male cattle over 24 months old on which the producer applies for 2001 special beef premium, one livestock unit each; ewes on which the producer applies for <Col N="1117" /> 2001 ewe premium, 0.15 livestock unit each; suckler cows, one livestock unit each; milk quota of 876 gallons, if not in milk recording, one livestock unit each.</P>
    <P>Milk quota livestock unit equivalents are obtained by dividing a producer's milk quota in respect of a given calendar year by the national average yield per cow for that year, or by the recorded average milk yield per cow where the producer is in an official milk recording scheme.</P>
    <P>The forage area of 68.14 hectares results in an entitlement of 136.28 reckonable livestock units. The milk quota of 85,198 gallons utilises 97.25 livestock units. This figure is calculated by dividing 85,198 by the national average yield of 876. This leaves a balance of 39.03 available livestock units on which premium could be paid.</P>
    <P>Six applications for 2001 special beef premium were submitted either by or on behalf of the person named in respect of 105 animals. Payment will be restricted to 64.38 premium rights &ndash; one animal at one livestock unit and 63.38 at 0.6 livestock units. The EU regulations governing these schemes specifically provide that animals applied on in excess of the individual's permitted stocking rate of two livestock units per hectare are deemed to be paid under the instalment applied for.</P>
    <P>The decision not to pay premium on the remaining 40.58 animals was appealed to the Agriculture Appeals Office. Following the review of the matter the original decision not to pay premium on the animals submitted for premium in excess of the two livestock unit per forage hectare threshold was upheld.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations governing the 1996 special beef premium scheme a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application. Each producer's reckonable livestock units are obtained in respect of the calendar year as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each producer's reckonable livestock units are obtained in respect of the calendar year as follows: for male cattle up to and including 24 months old on which the producer applies for 1996 special beef premium and bull premium, 0.6 <Col N="1118" /> livestock unit each; for male cattle over 24 months old on which the producer applies for 1996 special beef premium, one livestock unit each; ewes on which the producer applies for 1996 ewe premium, 0.15 livestock unit each; suckler cows, one livestock unit each; milk quota of 897 gallons (if not in milk recording), one livestock unit each.</P>
    <P>Milk Quota livestock equivalent units are obtained by dividing a producer's milk quota in respect of a given calendar year by the national average yield per cow for that year, or by the recorded average milk yield per cow where the producer is in an official milk recording scheme.</P>
    <P>The named herdowner's forage area of 67 hectares entitled him to 134 reckonable livestock units. His milk quota of 71,691 gallons utilises 79.92 livestock units, which is 71,691 divided by the national average yield of 897, leaving a balance of 54.08 available livestock units on which premium could be paid.</P>
    <P>As already stated the person named submitted four applications for 1996 special beef premium in respect of 155 animals. Payment to the person named was restricted to 90.13 animals &ndash; 90.13 at 0.6 livestock units.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall Government policy on the information society was initially set out in the report &ldquo;Implementing the Information Society in Ireland: An Action Plan&rdquo; published by the Department of the Taoiseach in January 1999. A new Action Plan <Col N="1122" /> entitled &ldquo;New Connections&rdquo; was approved by Government in March 2002 covering the three-year period from 2003 to 2005. In addition to e-government and e-business, the new action plan identifies opportunities in the areas of lifelong learning and e-inclusion, which strives to bridge the digital divide in addressing issues of disadvantage and exclusion.</P>
      <P>In response to the first action plan, my Department established a dedicated funding mechanism in 2000, the Information Society Fund, designed to support the implementation of e-government and e-business flagship projects identified in the action plan and to encourage Departments and bodies under their aegis, to respond to the information society agenda. An overall amount of &euro;138.7 million was allocated under the fund over the period from 2000 to 2002. While consideration is currently being given to the size and distribution of funding over the period of the new action plan from 2003 to 2005, an overall amount of &euro;42.9 million has been included in the Abridged Estimates Volume 2003 for information society projects.</P>
      <P>An evaluation team chaired by my Department and including representatives from the information society policy development unit of the Department of the Taoiseach approves projects under the fund. A total of 135 programmes and projects at an overall cost of &euro;118.6 million have been approved for funding since the introduction of the fund in 2000.</P>
      <P>The majority of projects approved under the fund relate to e-government services some of which are already available to the general public and to businesses on the Internet. Examples of these services include: the Revenue on-line service, ROS, providing for the electronic filing of tax returns; on-line driving test application system; the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission's on-line recruitment service; the Land Registry on-line electronic search service for property folios; on-line access to public library catalogues; an e-procurement website advertising all public contracts and providing for the downloading of tender documents; OASIS, providing information for citizens based on life-events; BASIS, providing information for businesses based on business-episodes.</P>
      <P>The e-government projects under development include: e-cabinet, designed to support the Government process; e-legislation, providing a collaborative environment for bill drafting; on-line driving licence application; on-line motor tax renewal; on-line services for farmers coordinated by Teagasc; on-line exploration and mining licence application.</P>
      <P>The introduction of e-government services will accelerate with the introduction of the public services broker planned for mid-2003 and which is also being supported by the information society fund. The public services broker is being implemented by the Reach agency and will provide a single electronic gateway to Government services and public information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The following major e-business initiatives are supported by the information society fund: Enterprise Ireland's accelerator programme, a mentoring scheme for e-business targeting SMEs; city and county enterprise boards' empower programme promoting e-business in micro-enterprises; and, chambers of commerce in Ireland e-business training initiative.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of on-line services and information on the Internet, a number of important initiatives have been implemented under the information society fund at local and community level including: the provision of public Internet access points at more than 300 local libraries throughout the country; and, community based projects under the CAIT, community access to information technology, initiative co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Rural, and Gaeltacht Affairs. Funding of &euro;7.4 million has been committed to a total of 121 projects throughout the country since the launch of CAIT in December 2000.</P>
    <P>Funding beyond that provided by the information society fund has been made available for many other significant IT initiatives, for example, electronic voting, a range of new systems in the Department of Agriculture, new systems for the Garda Síochána, etc.</P>
    <P>The investments made to date are already making a significant contribution to the development of the information society in Ireland and in positioning Ireland as a global leader in this area. Our progress has been recognised internationally in a number of studies and under the European Commission's e-Europe benchmarking report on e-government services published in February 2002, Ireland achieved first place in Europe reflecting the success of our strategy and the solid foundation available for further enhancing services to citizens and businesses. An update to this report published in February 2003 shows Ireland along with Sweden having the highest level of on-line sophistication in relation to e-government services throughout Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1997 Finance Act made provision for a scheme of tax relief for areas adjacent to regional airports along the same lines as the relief then available under the enterprise areas scheme. The scheme provided for accelerated capital allowances and double rent relief for lessees of qualified buildings. The scheme was queried by the European Commission under state aid rules and the approval granted by the Commission in 1998 imposed certain specific conditions. The qualifying period was required to end on 31 December 1999 in order to conform with the end of the existing general regional aid framework throughout the European Union. The Commission ruled out the awarding of double rent relief in respect of any of the proposed enterprise areas adjacent to the regional airports. The Commission also requested the Irish authorities to submit details of individual airport projects to the Commission for separate approval by it. The proposal in relation to a cargo handling operation at Knock Airport was approved by the Commission on 26 October 1999 shortly before the expiry date for the scheme of 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>New designation of a business park at Knock Airport could not take place in isolation but would need to be undertaken as part of a general scheme of designation for regional business parks and would have to be made available in other areas of need apart from Knock. Such a scheme would have to be undertaken in the context of objective criteria, which would justify the selectivity of any areas designated. Apart from this, the scheme would need to be submitted to the European Commission for approval under state aid rules. Recent experience of a much more rigorous examination of fiscal state aids by the Commission indicates that approval for any such scheme could not be guaranteed. In the recent budget, I confirmed the termination dates for a range of incentive schemes including the urban renewal, rural renewal and park and ride schemes. This announcement was made in the context of the general policy of broadening the tax base in an effort to keep the current low rates of income and personal taxation. For all of these reasons, I have no plans at present for the introduction of such a scheme of designation for regional business parks.</P>

The actual rates of allowances payable from time to time are determined in accordance with agreed recommendations made by the general council under the scheme for conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 257 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>A claim for special leave for Special Olympics' volunteers was recently finalised at the general council of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service. It was agreed with the Civil Service unions that Special Olympics' volunteers may accumulate a maximum of five days flexi-leave. This arrangement will allow civil servants to volunteer for the event without losing any pay. This arrangement is a once off concession in recognition of this unique event. In addition, officers may avail of the ability to take additional special leave without pay if they wish to give more time to the event.</P>
      <P>My Department receives many applications for special leave from civil servants for numerous praiseworthy and meritorious non-official purposes. Generally, because of the potential cost to the Exchequer and the potential impact on service provision, special leave without pay is given. As Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the conditions of service of civil servants only. Arrangements for public servants are matters for the organisations in which they work.</P>

      <P>I announced in my budget speech of 4 December 2002 that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after that date. The date of disposal is normally the date when the contract is made. However, where the contract is conditional, it is the date on which the condition is satisfied. I have also made provision in the Finance Bill 2003 so that even when the disposal took place on or after 4 December 2002, the gain can still be deferred where the reinvestment in certain linked assets took place before 4 December 2002, but within the timeframe allowed by the existing legislation. Therefore, the eligibility to rollover relief of landowners in the areas referred to by the Deputy will depend on the facts of the individual cases, which will be decided upon by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the report of the independent Estimates review committee. The report noted that my Department had already identified the savings necessary to reach the pre-budget 2003 target for my Department's Vote. The report's only proposal in relation to my Department's Vote was that the allocation in it for the change management fund be reduced by &euro;2 million. This proposal was implemented.</P>
      <P>In its summary of conclusions, the report recommended that my Department should undertake a medium term review of expenditure and should, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, formulate proposals for better control of numbers and administrative costs. A medium term review of expenditure will be conducted this year by my Department, while the Deputy will be aware that in budget 2003, I announced that the Government had decided that numbers employed across all sectors of the public service were to be capped with immediate effect and there would be a reduction of 5,000 in those numbers over the next three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1995, following representations from Kilkenny County Council and Kilkenny Corporation, the Office of Public works commissioned a study of the flooding in the urban area of Kilkenny City. After much investigation and consideration of a number of schemes, a preferred option was chosen in conjunction with the council and the corporation and the proposed scheme was brought to public exhibition in July 1999, as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts, based on outline design only and prior to detailed design and tenders being sought.</P>
      <P>It was estimated at outline design that the scheme would cost &euro;13.8 million. Following detailed design, there were some changes to the design of the riverside walls and this, as well as increased construction costs and a major increase in archaeological costs, reflecting the importance of Kilkenny as a major medieval city, meant that the cost of the project, sanctioned in June 2001 by the Department of Finance, was &euro;34.8 million. Approximately &euro;17 million has been spent on the scheme to date and it is expected that the full budget for the project will be spent.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is currently meeting the Environmental Protection Agency to agree the scope of testing of spoil removed from the river. It is hoped to have agreement very shortly, after which an estimate of costs will be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the start of the works in August 2001, a major effort has been made to ensure there would be a good line of communication between Office of Public Works and the local authorities. A steering committee, consisting of members of Office <Col N="1129" /> of Public Works, Mott McDonald EPO Limited (Consulting Engineers), Kilkenny City Council, Kilkenny County Council, the Central Fisheries Board, Margaret Gowen &amp; Co. Limited, archaeological firm on site, and Dúchas, was put in place once construction commenced. The committee first met on 20 September 2001 and meets on a regular basis since, at least once a month and sometimes more often. At each meeting the parties present are updated on progress and areas of concern.</P>
    <P>Both Kilkenny County Council and Kilkenny City Council are represented on the steering committee by their respective senior engineers and the minutes of each meeting are circulated to both local authorities. The steering committee provides an effective methodology for exchange of information and reporting on the progress of the scheme. The steering committee provides a two-way communication channel whereby the local authority representatives on the steering committee can keep their respective councils up to date with progress and developments on the scheme, as discussed at the steering committee, and can raise at the steering committee any concerns, information requests, queries, etc. which the councils may have.</P>
    <P>However, as the local authorities felt they needed additional knowledge of current issues and upcoming schedules, it was agreed that a progress report would be provided to the councils with an information update on the progress of the works associated with the scheme. It is also intended that activities scheduled for the coming months would be included. The report will continue to be produced on a regular basis for the duration of the works until completion in 2004. The report may also be published on the Office of Public Works website. The initial report is due to be presented to the county manager and city mayor in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I met with members of Kilkenny City Council and Kilkenny County Council and the county manager and his officials yesterday in Kilkenny to hear their concerns in relation to the scheme. I am committed to improving communications and exchange of information and my officials will be putting systems in place immediately to do so. I know the county manager is equally committed to improving communications about the scheme and will be working with Office of Public Works to do so.</P>

      <P>The reduced rate of VAT increased from 12.5% to 13.5% with effect from 1 January 2003. As regards the impact of the change in the rate on new housing, generally the purchase of a house involves two stages, namely, the payment of a deposit at the time of signing the contract, with the possibility of staged payments as the house is being constructed and payment of the balance on completion. Where a payment is received from a private individual and any other person not registered for VAT, the rate of VAT applicable is the rate in force at the time the payment is received. Therefore, any payment made during 2002 was liable at the 12.5% rate, and payments made during 2003 are liable at the 13.5% rate.</P>
      <P>Thus, in cases where deposits and-or staged payments were made prior to 1 January 2003, it is on the remaining balance that the increased rate is applied. In cases where contracts are signed, but no payments made prior to 1 January 2003, the total cost of construction of the house is subject to VAT at 13.5%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether the increased cost is passed to the purchaser or remains the responsibility of the builder-contractor, this matter is determined by the relevant building or other contractual arrangement made between the builder and the purchaser. The Deputy will appreciate that it <Col N="1131" /> would be inappropriate for me to comment on the legal status of any such agreements.</P>

      <P>Ireland has worked, notably during our term on the Security Council, to ensure UN sanctions are administered in such a way as to ensure the humanitarian and long-term economic interests of the people of Iraq are secured, while also ensuring the necessary controls are in place to prevent Iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction. It is a matter of profound regret that the people of Iraq continue to suffer considerable hardship as a result of their Government's deliberate and persistent violation of successive UN Security Council resolutions aimed at preserving international peace and security. This has been and remains our consistent position. As I stated to the Dáil on 29 January:</P>
      <P>The people of Iraq have suffered as a consequence of UN sanctions. Some countries, including Ireland have striven with limited success to reduce the impact of these sanctions on the most vulnerable elements of society. The Iraqi authorities could have ensured the lifting of sanctions by co-operating with the inspectors. Instead, they sought to use the sanctions as a propaganda tool, disrupting revenue flows to the oil for food programme and failing to concentrate contracts on areas of greatest humanitarian need.</P>
      <P>UN Security Council Resolution 1409, which was adopted in May 2002, places the operation of sanctions on a new basis. It seeks to target sanctions against the Iraqi regime while minimising the impact of those sanctions on the civilian population. In particular, the provisions of Resolution 1409 were intended to ensure continuing availability of medical supplies for the most vulnerable sectors of the Iraqi population, including mothers and children. Ireland played an active role in the development of this resolution.</P>
      <P>The Government wants to see circumstances brought about which would permit the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq altogether. Those circumstances do not currently exist. Until such time as those circumstances arise, the application of a targeted sanctions regime, as set out in Resolution 1409, is the best means of ensuring that the primacy of the Security Council Resolutions is respected and humanitarian concerns are addressed.</P>
      <P>The fact remains, however, that the most effective way of easing the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people and avoiding any escalation in the current situation would be for the Iraqi Government to act immediately to meet its obligations under the UN Charter by complying fully with the demands placed upon it by the Security Council.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration. Generally, eligible students are those who are first-time undergraduates, are EU nationals or hold official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved course.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the local authorities and the vocational education committees. Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or post-graduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality. Candidates who hold European Union nationality, official refugee status or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State are eligible under the nationality requirement of the schemes.</P>
      <P>Maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. The adjacent rate of grant is payable where the grant holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of grant is payable in all other cases. The full rate of adjacent and non-adjacent grant for the current academic year is &euro;2,510 and &euro;1,004 respectively.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 271 and 281 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 2000, my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the pur<Col N="1135" /> chase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the current year.</P>
    <P>In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools received a grant of &euro;1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of &euro;635. Approximately &euro;2.4 million was allocated to schools in 2002 under this scheme. In the light of the current budgetary constraints, I decided to withdraw payment of the grant for 2003. I will keep the position under review for future years.</P>

      <Quest>when the recommendations of the report on dyslexia will be implemented.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the task force on dyslexia contains more than 60 individual recommendations, ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for service providers, to issues relating to structural reforms. Since the task force reported, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include the introduction of the first ever on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia, the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme, specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia and a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for children with dyslexia.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above measures, a key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and deliverance of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the national council for special education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements for the establishment of the council are well advanced. A chief executive officer designate has been appointed and an Order to establish the council will shortly be <Col N="1136" /> brought before the Oireachtas. I will also be bringing forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, aimed at establishing the rights and entitlements of persons with special needs, including dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and providing the necessary framework for effective service delivery. My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring specifically to post-primary level, where the concept of a catchment area has particular relevance in the determination of long-term accommodation requirements and school transport arrangements. The precise configuration of a catchment area is determined following a review of existing provision and consultation with current providers of post-primary education in the area concerned. I am not aware of any schools having been built where a catchment area was not defined.</P>

Twenty six students out of the 30 responded to the survey. Of those who responded, 11 indicated they were in further study or training, two were seeking employment, three were unavailable for employment and ten were employed. Of the ten in employment, four were employed as teachers, four in the sports area and two in administration.  </P>

In order to ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey has been placed on the geographic information system, GIS, database. My Department is currently undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase <Col N="1140" /> of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of a nationwide survey having regard to available resources.</P>
    <P>The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects that could not be included in this year's programme.</P>

      <P>There is a project to provide a dual purpose PE hall at Firhouse community college and this project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning &ndash; stage 4/5 is completed. However, in view of the scale of the 2003 capital programme as now published, and available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position to authorise any additional large scale projects to proceed to construction in 2003, other than those listed in section 4 of the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 295 and 296 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in December 1999, the Government approved the establishment of an academy for the performing arts which was to incorporate a headquarters at Dublin City University, a Limerick campus incorporating the Irish World Music Centre at the University of Limerick and an undergraduate professional dance facility based at the Institute for Choreography and Dance at Firkin Crane, Cork. An interim governing authority was established to oversee the development of the academy in April 2002.</P>
      <P>In light of a lack of available capital funding in 2003 to progress the capital elements of the project, the Government has reconsidered its approach to the development of an Irish academy for the performing arts. The Government has now decided to transfer responsibility for the project to the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism and has agreed that other options for the development of an Irish academy for the performing arts in tandem with projects of a similar nature will now be considered. In the circumstances, the members of the interim governing authority have been requested to stand down. The authority met on four occasions in April, July, October and December 2002. Some &euro;68,475 was spent on the project from the establishment of the authority to date. No formal published reports were issued by the authority during its lifetime. The activities undertaken included: an ongoing process of fact finding and research towards the development of the academy's future direction which saw: presentations from representatives of the three proposed nodes (music, drama and dance) of the academy and on-site visits to each nodal centre were also being planned; a presentation by Dr. Danny O'Hare who chaired the planning and steering group for the academy; and a presentation from the rector of the Sibelius Academy in Finland as an example of best practice abroad. Other similar presentations were planned for future meetings, for example from the heads of the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts and the Juilliard School in the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-committees were established to progress work in the following areas: the recruitment pro<Col N="1147" /> cess for the president of the academy and the future development of the academy.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for <Col N="1148" /> the operation of a number of measures covered by two of the operational programmes under the national development plant. These programmes are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme. My Department is also responsible for a number of measures under the regional operational programmes for the border, midlands and western region (BMW) and the southern and eastern region (S&amp;E).</P>
      <P>Expenditure under the operational and regional programmes is monitored by monitoring committees that have been established for each of the programmes. This expenditure is reported at NUTS II level (that is, BMW and S&amp;E basis) and it is available at county level. Expenditure under the four programmes for the full year 2002 will be reviewed at the spring monitoring committee meetings that will be held in April 2003.</P>
      <P>Regarding the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the Waterford constituency, due to the wide range of programmes under the NDP in the education sector, it would require an inordinate amount of official time to answer the question in the detail requested. However, if the Deputy has any queries regarding a specific measure, I will be happy to seek to obtain the information for him.</P>

      <P>In view of the scale of the 2003 capital programme as now published, and available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, the Department does not envisage that it will be in a position during this year to authorise any additional large scale projects to proceed to construction in 2003 including the project at meanscoil an Leith-Triúigh, Cloghane, County Kerry, other than those listed in section four of the programme.</P>
      <P>In light of this approach to the schools capital programme, it would be unfair to other schools for me to become involved in discussions on individual projects or to receive a deputation from a particular school as this might create the impression that decisions were going to be taken on building projects on the basis of criteria other than the objective criteria outlined by my Department.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to change the status of Waterford Institute of Technology. My Department, however, continues to work with Waterford Institute of Technology in developing and upgrading the Institute.</P>
      <P>In July 1996, the Government approved in principle, the recommendations in the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The steering committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional College, now Waterford Institute of Technology, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the southeast region. The committee's report also recommended an increase in student places, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. It was recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation rate in degree programmes.</P>
      <P>The Government accepted these recommendations. The provision, in both the total number of places and in degree level courses, in Waterford Institute of Technology, has been expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. In this regard, figures supplied to my Department by Waterford Institute of Technology indicate that in the region of 40% of students enrolled on full-time certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate courses are enrolled on courses at degree and postgraduate levels. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college provide the necessary status and capacity for the Institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this approach, WIT is among the first institutes of technology to be given authority to make its own educational awards under the terms of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.</P>

      <P>In June 1999, the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This initiative was extended by a further 59 schools in June 2000. The selection of schools was based on an objective analysis of their retention rates. Accordingly schools with the most significant difficulties were invited to participate in the initiative. This allowed resources to be targeted at schools through which they would reach the greatest number of young people at risk.</P>
      <P>In 2002, my Department introduced the school completion programme or SCP, which is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving incorporating the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and will assimilate the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and stay-in-school retention initiative at second level or SSRI.</P>
      <P>The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>Sites for participation in the programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. Based on this analysis and having regard to the funding available, 82 project sites were selected. The projects selected to participate in the school completion programme comprised 65 new projects, which included 64 SSRI schools in addition to the 17 existing ESLI projects. The remaining 53 SSRI schools, which were not selected to participate in this project strand, will continue to be funded under the SSRI strand of this programme up to 31 August 2005.</P>

      <P>In 2000 my Department engaged consultants to carry out an assessment of the capability of the existing infrastructure and on-shore facilities at Rossaveal Fishery Harbour Centre to service safely and efficiently the existing and future requirements of the fishing industry and other potential sources of commercial traffic. The report recommended two separate but complimentary developments at the harbour, namely the provision of a dedicated ferry berth and the provision of a deep water berth, with facilities for vessels up to eight metres draught. The overall cost of such developments was estimated at &euro;30 million.</P>
      <P>In 2001 and 2002, a total of &euro;2.7 million was spent on works in relation to the Rossaveal Fishery Harbour Centre development. The Exchequer funding available to my Department in 2003 does not provide for further funding of the Rossaveal development at this time. As the Deputy will appreciate, there are a considerable number of pressing proposals for fishery harbour developments which require ongoing consideration. The question of advancing either of the Rossaveal developments will therefore have to be considered in the light of the Exchequer funding available going forward and the national priorities to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Member states are legally obliged under the Common Fisheries Policy to put in place effective measures to respect and manage their respective fish quota entitlements. In particular, it is a requirement that such measures are capable of depriving those responsible of the economic benefit of infringements, produce results proportionate to the seriousness of such infringements and also discourage further infringements of the same kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current quota management system operating in Ireland, involving the use of statutory instruments fulfils these requirements. The existing system is also designed to ensure the best possible spread between fishermen, in terms of take up of quota during the year, having regard to fishing pat<Col N="1158" /> terns and market conditions. A key objective is the avoidance of very early closure of fisheries through rapid exhaustion of quota. To date Ireland's fish quotas have been regarded as national assets. Accordingly, the system of quota management ensures that quotas are treated as a public resource that is available to all fishing vessels who are licensed to fish the particular stock. In some member states the allocation of quotas to producer organisation has lead to the privatisation of quotas which have become a commodity and are purchased by vessel owners. Under the current arrangements the fishing industry representatives are invited each month to an advisory committee on whitefish quota management and their views are taken into account in the determination of monthly regimes for particular stocks.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining the issues relating to quota management generally and will be reporting to me shortly. Any future quota management system must be consistent with the need to fulfil the legal requirements on member states and also must be capable of ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of quota amongst Irish fishermen.</P>

      <P>Under national fleet policy which derives from legal EU obligations, fishing vessels with refrigerated seawater (RSW) tanks have been confined to the dedicated pelagic segment of the fishing fleet. The introduction of new RSW tank boats to the pelagic segment requires 100% replacement capacity.</P>
      <P>Applications were received in 1999 and 2000 to introduce RSW tank boats into the multi-purpose whitefish segment in order to fish for herring and mackerel. Given fundamental policy and technical implications, the conditions of licences granted to these applicants required the prior de-commissioning of the RSW tanks. The applicants accepted licences with the precondition.</P>
      <P>Pending a review of licensing policy and all other relevant considerations, a moratorium on the introduction of vessels with tanks (either functioning or non functioning) into the whitefish fleet was put in place in February 2001. The review of licensing policy is under way and a report of the review group is expected in June.</P>
      <P>Grant aid under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for fleet renewal has been focused on enhancing the operational efficiency, competitiveness and safety of the whitefish fleet and has not been made available towards the introduction of capacity into the fleet primarily targeting pelagic species. As most of the available funding for fleet renewal has already been committed and as current EU policy links future funding of fleet renewal with fleet cuts and ceases altogether at the end of 2004, it is not anticipated that grant aid will be made available for fleet renewal in the future.</P>

      <P>I met with the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers (IFSA) on Tuesday 3rd December 2002 to discuss the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Boat) Regulations which came into force on 1 January 2003. This meeting was attended by a member of the Belmullet Sea Angling Club representing the Connacht Provincial Council of the IFSA.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns of the Belmullet Sea Angling Club regarding the possible effects the new regulations may have on sea angling festivals and competitions, particularly where there may be difficulties in bringing old fishing vessels up to the required safety standard. However, as Minister, my primary concern is to enhance safety at sea and on inland waterways. While sea angling festivals are of importance in tourism terms we cannot build our tourism industry on poor safety regime. There is a long-term benefit to the tourism industry in being able to demonstrate that the highest safety standards are adhered to in sea angling and I would urge sea angling clubs and festival organisers to avail of the boats that are already licensed.</P>
      <P>To facilitate boat owners affected by the new regulations my Department held five information seminars at different locations around the country last October. Furthermore, in response to a request from the Connacht provincial council of the IFSA, an additional seminar will be held in Mayo next month and officials of the maritime safety directorate of my Department will be in contact with the IFSA shortly to finalise arrangements.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government includes a commitment to complete a national audit of local sports facilities and to put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of such necessary facilities throughout the country. The first stage of the process will be a review of the existing sports capital programme under the Department's expenditure review programme, the results of which will feed into the formulation of a long-term strategy for the development of sporting facilities by an inter-agency steering group to be set up in the near future.</P>
      <P>One of the first tasks of this inter-agency steering group will be to oversee the national audit of local sports facilities. This will entail establishing the parameters of such an audit in relation to the standard, size and type of facilities to be recorded and to decide upon the best way to gather this information. It will also need to consider how this information on existing facilities can be most effectively used in the assessment of applications for national lottery grants in conjunction with other factors such as current and future population demographics and the diverse needs of a wide range of sports. Carrying out an effective and comprehensive national audit of local facilities is a major and complex undertaking and is likely to take a substantial amount of time and resources to complete.</P>

      <P>The report of the independent Estimates review committee recommended cuts in my Department's Estimate totalling almost &euro;23 million, spread across all three main areas of my Department's remit. In the case of tourism, the recommendation of a cut of &euro;5 million &ndash; effectively in tourism marketing funding &ndash; was not implemented by my Department due to the Government's commitment to support this most valuable sector of our economy at this difficult time, as reaffirmed by the Government's decision to increase the 2003 budget for tourism marketing to &euro;30.4 million. Furthermore, any consideration of the committee's suggested changes for increased industry contributions to the activities of the marketing and development bodies, and greater cooperation between the various tourism agencies will have to await the outcome of the tourism policy review and the establishment of the new National Tourism Development Authority.</P>

I consider the Irish Film Board to be the critical driver in the support and development of the Irish film industry and the promotion of film-<Col N="1165" /> making in Ireland into the future. While reductions were applied to the level of funding across my Department's arts and culture remit these were made in a way that seeks to minimise the negative effect and best position the sector to take advantage of increased funding when it again becomes available.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance I attach to the work of the Irish Sports Council, I did not effect the proposed reduction in the council's budget in 2003. With regard to the sports capital programme, the committee recommended that priority be given to honouring existing commitments before announcing a new round of grants to local clubs and organisations. I am satisfied the allocation provided for this programme in 2003 is adequate to cover outstanding commitments and allow for commitments to be made in 2003. While I was not prepared to accept some of the specific measures proposed by the Estimates review committee, the savings identified for my Department were realised through adjustments across many areas of expenditure in my Department's Vote.</P>

      <P>Funding for national development plan purposes under the auspices of my Department is channelled through four different operational programmes. The productive sector OP provides funding to Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Ltd. in respect of tourism marketing and funding to Bord Scannán na hÉireann in respect of capital grants. Funding in respect of tourism training is provided to CERT and to Bord Scannán na hÉireann for film training, through the employment and human resources OP. Because of the nature of these two programmes, it is not possible to apportion funding on a county basis.

      <P>National development plan funding for tourism product development purposes is channelled through the tourism measures of the local enterprise development priority of the BMW and S&amp;E regional operational programmes. The commencement of these measures was delayed because of the need to obtain state aids approval from the EU and, as a result, no expenditure took place under this measure in either OP in 2002. National development plan funding in respect of sports facilities falls under the culture, recreation and sports measures of the local infrastructure priority of the BMW and S&amp;E regional OPs. Implementation of these measures could not commence until the national spatial strategy was published. Publication of the strategy occurred in December 2002 and, therefore, no expenditure under the sports facilities programme was incurred in 2002.</P>

      <P>Health boards have an obligation to comply with all statutory and local authority regulations regarding the disposing of waste from hospitals and other institutions and I would expect them to meet their obligations in this regard. In 1994, my Department issued a health services waste policy to all health boards and acute voluntary hospitals. The policy advocated good environmental and health and safety practices in the management, handling and disposal of all wastes generated in hospitals. Central to this policy were the segre<Col N="1168" /> gation of health care waste into risk waste and non-risk waste and the initiation of a national contract to deal with the health care risk waste.</P>
      <P>A national contract has been in operation for the past three years for the collection and treatment of health care risk waste by alternative technology. The facilities used are licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency. All acute hospitals now have their healthcare risk waste treated and disposed of in this manner. These arrangements are working satisfactorily. The non-risk hospital waste, which is largely domestic in nature, is disposed of by the municipal or commercial waste disposal route. A detailed guidance document was issued in 1999 on the segregation, packaging and storage of health care risk waste. This latter document has been up-dated and issued recently in the light of recent regulatory changes relating to the transportation and carriage of such materials.</P>
      <P>In the wake of recent reports of alleged instances of illegal dumping of waste, some of which was stated to be hospital waste, my Department wrote to the health agencies, drawing attention to the guidelines and stressing the importance of ensuring that reputable waste contractors are employed and that proof of disposal to licensed landfill site is obtained for each load of non-risk waste. The contractors operate under permits issued by the local waste authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The <Col N="1169" /> target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To end November 2002, 106,585 women had been called for screening and 79,906 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 75%.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck. Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50-64 age bracket in Counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Approximately 9,500 per annum will be invited once the programme is fully operational in these counties. It is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually. In relation to the further expansion of the programme, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the south, west, mid west and north west. A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will be meeting with BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated cost of the most recent national anti-smoking campaign is approximately &euro;2 million per year.</P>
      <P>Smoking has been the largest single issue focused upon by the health promotion unit of my Department. The national Break the Habit campaign was developed in partnership with my Department, the Irish Cancer Society and the regional health boards. This campaign targets the whole population to encourage smokers to stop smoking and non-smokers not to start by emphasising the positive effects quitting smoking can have on the individual. In response to a national survey indicating the increased prevalence of smoking among teenagers, a special component of the Break the Habit campaign was developed during 2000 to target teenagers. This campaign called NICO concentrates on the simple message that smokers are less attractive than non-smokers.</P>
      <P>In addition to the anti-smoking campaign my Department has funded, through the cardiovascular health strategy, a number of initiatives to reduce the incidence of smoking. An additional 26 smoking cessation officers have been recruited by the health boards. This enables the boards to increase support to individuals to quit smoking and to provide advice regarding smoking policies and legislation.</P>
      <P>In April 2001 nicotine replacement therapy was made available to all medical cardholders who smoke. From the launch of nicotine replacement therapy in April 2001 to October 2002, 115,355 prescriptions have been issued to medical cardholders at a total cost of about &euro;4.2 million.</P>
      <P>Following the signature by the President of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 on 27 March 2002, I established the Office of Tobacco Control on a statutory basis. This indicates my commitment to a range of anti-smoking measures. In this regard, I announced, on 30 January last, my intention to ban smoking in all workplaces from 1 January 2004. This ban will include the hospitality industry where many workers are exposed to passive smoking.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health and Children I see it as a major priority for me to put in place innovative and effective smoking cessation interventions at national and regional level in order to reduce the incidence of smoking related diseases in this country.</P>

      <P>Between 1999 and 2002 additional revenue funding of &euro;10.476 million and &euro;27.4 million capital was allocated to the programme to provide more appropriate care settings for: persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals; those accommodated in de-designated units, which were formerly designated as part of the psychiatric services; and others who moved some years ago from psychiatric hospitals to alternative accommodations which is now unsuitable for their needs.</P>

      <P>The home help scheme was introduced in 1972 under a provision of the 1970 Health Act. At that time, the chief executive officers of the health boards took a collective decision not to engage family members and relatives as paid home helps. This was in recognition of the fact that the initiative was not intended to replace the existing informal arrangements whereby family members and relatives provided assistance in the tasks of daily living to many old people living at home. Legally, family members are not debarred from acting as home helps but the practice has been that they provided support to older relatives, without payment. There have, I understand, been some instances where a distant relative, for example, a cousin, has been employed as a home help but these have been in exceptional circumstances. I again emphasise that the operation of the home help scheme is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>

      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with a physical disability.</P>

    <P>Significant additional funding in the region of &euro;180 million has been provided by this Government since 1997 for physical and sensory disability services.

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30 January 2003 I launched the Report on the Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke &ndash; ETS &ndash; in the Workplace, which was commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority. One of the issues dealt with in the report is the effectiveness of ventilation and the expert advice is that current ventilation technologies are inadequate to give workers full protection from the hazards of tobacco smoke and that exposure can best be controlled by banning smoking in places of work. <Col N="1175" /> Acting on this advice I published draft regulations to provide for a prohibition on the smoking of tobacco products in all places of work, including licensed premises, which will come into operation on 1 January 2004.</P>
    <P>Regulations on environmental tobacco smoke in other jurisdictions are a matter for the appropriate health and safety authorities there. Finally, I have no functions in relation to life insurance premia.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services at Mayo General Hospital is the responsibility of the Western Health Board. The board has informed my Department that there is a consultant rheumatology service based at Merlin Park Regional Hospital. Services for patients from all parts of the region, including Mayo, are provided by a consultant led team of medical, nursing, allied health professionals and support staff.</P>
      <P>The board has prepared a strategic plan for the development of rheumatology services in the region which proposes the appointment of a rheumatologist at Mayo General Hospital. As the Deputy will be aware, there has been significant investment in acute hospital services in the Western Health Board, including Mayo General Hospital, in recent years. The Western Health Board's service plan for 2003 does not provide for the appointment of a rheumatologist at Mayo General Hospital in 2003.</P>

      <P>The number of persons with an intellectual disability or autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in October 2002 was 452, down from 490 in April 2002. The figure in 1996 was 970.</P>
      <P>Between 1999 and 2002 additional revenue funding of &euro;10.476 million and &euro;27.4 million capital funding was allocated to the programme to provide more appropriate care settings for: persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals; those accommodated in de-designated units, which were formerly designated as part of the psychiatric services; and others who moved some years ago from psychiatric hospitals to alternative accommodation which is now unsuitable for their needs.</P>
      <P>Examples of recent developments include: the transfer of more than 60 persons in the Mid-Western Health Board from St. Joseph's Hospital, Limerick, and Our Lady's, Ennis; 29 persons from St. Finnan's, Killarney; 21 persons from St. Canice's, Kilkenny; and 30 persons from St. Joseph's Service, St. Ita's, Portrane.</P>
      <P>Other centres, apart from psychiatric hospitals, which have received revenue and capital funding include St. Raphael's, Youghal, St. John of God House, Enniscorthy, Alvernia Centre, Portlaoise, St. Peter's, Castlepollard, Lough Sheever, Mullingar, Sean O'Hare, Stranorlar, Cloonmahon, Sligo and Áras Attracta, Swinford.</P>
      <P>This programme not only encompasses a capital investment in new or refurbished facilities, but also aims to enhance the staff numbers and skill mix working with this group and the quality of services available to them.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of my Department for 15 years that persons with an intellectual disability or autism should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be appropriately treated elsewhere. In the case of St. Ita's Hospital, persons with an intellectual disability or autism are admitted to St. Joseph's Intellectual Disability Service, which, while it is based on the St. Ita's campus, is a specific and dedicated intellectual disability service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department understands from the Midland Health Board that it is the board's current policy to provide in-patient psychiatric services for adult persons with mild intellectual disability and-or autism within the general adult psychiatric service. Residential treatment, when required, would be provided in the board's psychiatric in-<Col N="1178" /> patient facilities while treatment is being given. For adults with moderate, severe or profound intellectual disability and-or autism who require residential psychiatric treatment the board will, in the first instance, endeavour to treat the individual in their current residential setting. Where this proves to be inappropriate the board utilises the existing psychiatric in-patient facilities.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the board has been developing psychiatric services for both children and adults with intellectual disability and/or autism. At present, a psychiatric consultant led team provides services for children up to the age of 18. The board advertised for a consultant psychiatrist specialising in adult intellectual disability and autism in November 2002.</P>
    <P>The psychiatric and disability services have been working closely in seeking to secure appropriate accommodation for the small number of people currently resident in the board's psychiatric hospitals requiring specialised accommodation.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that its psychiatric service, in line with best practice, does not engage in the use of strait-jackets. I also understand that the utilisation of seclusion rooms is highly regulated and their use is monitored by both hospital management and the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. They are only used in exceptional circumstances. Where an individual is placed in seclusion it is at the request of the treating consultant, and individuals are kept under constant clinical observation for the period of seclusion.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness in the case of persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. Persons who suffer from any of these illnesses may apply to their local health board for admission to the long-term illness scheme. There is no <Col N="1179" /> appeal system in place for persons whose illness is not included in the list of illnesses covered by the long-term illness scheme.</P>
      <P>Myasthenia Gravis is not one of the illnesses covered by the terms of the long-term illness scheme.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. An applicant who is refused a medical card may appeal the decision to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The main financial measures recommended for the Department of Health and Children in the Review of Estimates Report were: savings of &euro;100 million on capital expenditure; administrative budget efficiency dividend of &euro;0.7 million; increase bed charges by 10%, in order to generate savings of &euro;15 million; health boards to identify efficiency savings of &euro;30 million; increase threshold for the drugs payment scheme from &euro;65 to &euro;80, in order to generate savings of &euro;29 million; and savings of &euro;10 million on developmental, consultative, supervisory and advisory bodies. These measures were incorporated into the provision for the Department of Health and Children as published in the 2003 Abridged Estimates Volume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has implemented the measures for capital expenditure, administrative budget and increased bed charges as set out above. The remaining recommendations were implemented in the following manner: health boards' efficiency savings were increased to &euro;35 million and the <Col N="1180" /> required savings for developmental, consultative, supervisory and advisory bodies were reduced to &euro;5 million.</P>
    <P>The drugs payment scheme threshold has been increased from &euro;65 to &euro;70 with effect from 1 January 2003 and, together with approximately &euro;2 million savings to be generated by the substitution of generic drugs for proprietary drugs, will result in overall savings of &euro;9.2 million. </P>
    <P>The balance of the recommended savings is being generated by the following measures: some &euro;2 million to be generated as a result of the introduction of a more rigorous regime leading to the elimination-minimising of invalid-illegible claims paid to community pharmacy contractors; &euro;5 million to be generated by discontinuing advance payments to community pharmacy contractors in respect of stock purchased from suppliers; &euro;5 million to be generated by further increasing private bed charges by 5%; and &euro;7.8 million generated from within the overall 2003 Estimate for the Department of Health and Children. In addition, the committee commented on two areas: Control of Health Service Employment &ndash; my Department has strengthened employment control measures in line with the review committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Fundamental Structural Changes &ndash; the committee made reference in its report to the need for fundamental structural changes to promote greater efficiency in delivering services; in particular it indicated that it had serious doubts about the efficacy of the existing health board structures. The committee referred to the work of the Commission on Financial Management and Control, established by the Minister for Finance, the national task force on medical structures, and the audit of structures and functions. It considered that this work needed to be brought to a conclusion and implemented. I understand that these reports are nearing completion and should be submitted to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>There are three main forms of treatment for cancer, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which can be used separately or in combination. These may be followed up by, or provided in conjunction with rehabilitation and palliative care. The treatment of cancer, including prostate cancer often takes place over a period of time and may involve a combination of treatments.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, approximately &euro;400 million has been specifically targeted for the development of cancer services under the national cancer strategy. An additional sum of &euro;29 million was allocated in 2003 for cancer services. Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, general surgery, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the <Col N="1183" /> National Breast Screening Programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To end November 2002, 106,585 women had been called for screening and 79,906 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 75%.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck.</P>
      <P>Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50 to 64 age bracket in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Approximately 9,500 per annum will be invited once the programme is fully operational in these counties. It is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually.</P>
      <P>In relation to the further expansion of the programme, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the south, west, mid-west and north west.</P>
      <P>A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will be meeting with BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 and 372 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons lies with the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis, including those services provided in the Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. <Col N="1184" /> This year, my Department and the health boards are funding thirteen dentists from various health boards &ndash; including two from the Western Health Board &ndash; for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The additional funding of &euro;628,000 allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services, includes &euro;533,000 for an orthodontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that under the initiative, the board has, <i>inter alia,</i> recruited an additional specialist in orthodontics. Furthermore, two specialists in orthodontics who completed their training last year, have since taken up duty with the board. This brings the boards complement of specialists in orthodontics to three, with a further part time specialist employed by the board one day per week. In addition, the orthodontic department has one specialist trainee working in the department two days per week.</P>
    <P>Last year, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Under the scheme, the Western Health Board received &euro;465, 000 for the treatment of patients in this way.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the number of cases awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment, as at 30 September 2002, were 599 and 1,066 respectively. This is a reduction of 539 on the treatment waiting list in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the December 2001 quarter. The chief executive officer has also informed me that the average waiting time for orthodontic assessment in the Western Health Board area at the end of September 2002 was nine months and that there were 1,403 patients receiving orthodontic treatment at that time.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to secondary care orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The <Col N="1185" /> orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them.</P>
    <P>For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, the initiatives and structural changes that I have set out above will bring about an improvement in waiting times for treatment and positively impact on the future delivery of orthodontic services in the longer term.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for administration of the health services in the Dublin area rests, in the first instance, with the ERHA. The authority informs me that not all of the beds available in private nursing homes are suitable for patients being discharged from acute hospitals because of their location or because of their inability to meet the nursing and care needs of such patients.</P>
      <P>At present the three area health boards in the Eastern Region are fully or partially subventing a total of 3,001 beds in private nursing homes. Of these there are 1,589 beds partially subvented and 1,412 beds fully subvented.</P>
      <P>For example, this year the Eastern Regional Health Authority is spending approximately &euro;45 million on subvented private nursing homes beds.</P>
      <P>Extended care is provided in long-stay units and welfare homes throughout the Eastern Region. There are over 2,200 beds in public and voluntary hospitals and homes across the region.</P>
      <P>The ERHA, in conjunction with their three area health boards and the voluntary hospitals in the region, has introduced a scheme whereby 24 hour packages of care are put in place to enable people who would otherwise have to go to nursing homes to return home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the authority's research shows that older people wish to continue to live at home where this is at all possible and this new initiative together with a scheme which the authority is <Col N="1187" /> piloting in assistive technology is aimed at meeting this need. Assistive technology uses the latest technology to enable older people at home to open and close curtains, answer the door and do various other household tasks.</P>

      <P>Assisted human reproduction, including <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, raises sensitive and complex issues with legal and ethical implications. It is not currently subject to statutory control in this country. Medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council which state as follows:</P>
      <P>In this rapidly evolving and complicated area the council reminds doctors of their obligations to preserve life and to promote health. The creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct.</P>
      <P>In relation to IVF, the guidelines also provide as follows: &ldquo;Any fertilised ovum must be used for normal implantation and must not be deliberately destroyed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to addressing concerns about the absence of statutory control in the area, and fol<Col N="1189" /> lowing a Government decision on the matter, I established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in 2000 to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in the area. The commission, chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly, includes expertise from relevant backgrounds, notably science, medicine, law and social science. Its deliberations have been informed by an inter-disciplinary approach to its work involving highly specialised working groups. Additionally, in line with my instructions at the outset of the process, the commission has engaged in wide consultation with relevant bodies including the seeking of submissions from the public.</P>
    <P>Given the difficult nature of the issues to be examined, it is not possible to be definitive about the length of time it will take the commission to complete its work, but I am satisfied that it is making significant progress and will continue to work as quickly as is possible. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

    <P>The development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit disorder-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD-ADHD, was considered by the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services estab<Col N="1190" /> lished by the Department of Health and Children in June 2000. In its report, presented in March 2001, the working group stated that the prevalence of ADD-ADHD in Ireland can be estimated at somewhere between 1% and 5% of school age children, that is, aged five to 15 years, which is in line with the research findings in other European countries. The group recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with this condition.</P>
    <P>All aspects of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and management of children suffering from ADD-ADHD were considered by the working group in the course of its deliberations. In its report, the different components of treatment required were set out and the importance of adequate linkages with other services, such as the education services and the community health services, were emphasised. The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team.</P>

      <P>As the Public Health (Tobacco) Act, 2002 is a public health measure it was considered that it was not notifiable to the Commission as a technical regulation. It was also considered that the requirement to introduce commencement orders in the case of the Act would allow for notification of the commencement order in draft form thereby meeting the requirements of the transparency directives. However, following correspondence and discussions with EU Commission officials on this matter and having obtained legal advice from the Attorney General it became clear that any attempt to commence the affected sections would result in considerable uncertainty as to the enforceability of sections in question.</P>
      <P>The challenge to the Act in the courts by the tobacco industry comprised three sets of proceedings. In one of these cases no order for costs was made. In the other two cases an order for the State defendants to pay the legal costs was made. The precise amount of legal costs payable will be determined by the Taxing Master of the High Court upon a claim being made by the plaintiffs. In addition, the State will be responsible for its own legal costs.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Independent Estimates Review Committee made a number of comments in respect of my Department in its report to the Minister for Finance. Following this report, my Department has implemented various measures which address the committee's proposals.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Regional Airports</i>An expenditure review of the public service obligations, PSO, air service programme will be carried out by my Department to evaluate the effectiveness of current PSO arrangements and to examine the scope for alternative policy approaches to achieving the objectives on a more efficient and effective basis. </P>
      <P>Tenders for the carrying out of this assignment are currently being evaluated and it is hoped to award the relevant contract by the end of the month. This review is expected to be completed during the month of April.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Taxi Hardship Payments</i>The Government is committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government. On 17 December 2002 the Government approved the publication of the report of the taxi hardship panel and the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the panel by the National Taxi Regulator. On 14 February 2003, I announced the appointment of Mr. Jimmy Farrelly as interim chairman of the Commission for Taxi Regulation pending the introduction later this year of a Commission for Taxi Regulation on a full statutory basis. I have asked Mr. Farrelly to examine how best the findings of the taxi hardship panel can be implemented.</P>
      <P>
        <i>CIE</i>I approved an increase of an average of 9% in CIE fares with effect from 2 December 2002. I have also made provision for the Railway Safety Commission from within the overall 2003 allocations thus continuing to maintain the Government's commitment to rail safety.</P>
      <P>The measures outlined in the Review of Estimates Report will, of course, require ongoing consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act, 2000).</P>
      <P>Local authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. For example, the relevant agreement to provide and operate the East link toll bridge is between NTR and Dublin City Council. The East link toll bridge, which opened in 1986, is a non-national road and is a matter for the Minister of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The West link toll bridge, which opened in 1990, is operated by NTR. The relevant agreement to operate this toll bridge is between NTR and the NRA and provides for tolls being charged for a period of 30 years from the date of opening of the toll facility.</P>
      <P>An annual licence fee based on a percentage of the gross toll revenue, GTR, is payable to the Minister for Transport in respect of the West link Bridge. The Minister's share of gross toll revenue in respect of 2001 was &euro;9.2 million.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that a significant proportion of the national roads programme will be implemented by means of public-private partnerships, PPPs, which will involve private sector funding and will ensure earlier delivery of vital national road infrastructure. The NRA's current PPP programme comprises 11 high quality projects spread throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The M50 second West link Bridge is under construction and is expected to be completed this year. The funding arrangements are subject to the relevant tolling agreement between the NRA and NTR.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the remaining PPP projects is as follows: the Kilcock-Kinnegad Project is at final negotiation stage; initial tendering has been completed and bidders have been shortlisted to proceed to the best and final offer stage in the case of both the N25 Waterford Bypass and the Dundalk Western Bypass; the N8 Rathcormac-Fermoy Bypass is at tender evaluation stage; the NRA has invited expressions of interest for the M3 Clonee to Kells; and the remaining five schemes are at an advanced design stage which includes the preparation of statutory documentation for publication.</P>
      <P>Funding arrangements for these schemes will not be determined until the relevant negotiations are finalised and tolling agreements entered into by the NRA.</P>

      <P>The national development plan set out a major programme of investment in public transport, amounting to over &euro;2.8 billion in 1999 prices. </P>
      <P>This programme comprised projects related to upgrading and renewing rail tracks and signalling, additional rail and bus capacity, the provision of quality bus corridors and new rail and bus stations.</P>
      <P>To date, over &euro;810 billion has been spent under the programme which is being delivered in the main by CIE, the Railway Procurement Agency and Dublin Transportation Office. The awarding of tenders under the programme is a matter for each of the bodies concerned. In order to assess progress on the public transport programme, Indecon International was retained to carry out an evaluation. In August 2002, Indecon published a report on the financial and physical progress to date under the public transport programme, entitled &ldquo;Evaluation of Public Transport Priority&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 and 411 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of leave to remain arises where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent is afforded three options, viz., to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the deportation order or to make representations in writing within 15 working days of the sending to him or her of the notice of intent.</P>
      <P>Under section 3(6) of the Act the Minister, in determining whether to make a deportation order, shall have regard to eleven specified considerations, one of which is any representation made by or on behalf of the person. The determination as to whether a deportation order is made or whether leave to remain is granted is not dependent on whether the person has made representations for leave to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics are not maintained to distinguish between cases where representations have been made for leave to remain from those where no such representations were made; nor do the statistics distinguish between those who made representations for leave to remain in the State before or after the coming into operation of the Immigration Act, 1999. The information <Col N="1200" /> requested by the Deputy can only be compiled by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</P>

      <P>The function of visiting committees is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee have free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>Qualified catering staff are attached to the various prisons and places of detention. In the course of their inspections of the catering areas, the visiting committees meet these staff.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 the principal function of the Legal Aid Board is, within the available resources, to provide legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy certain conditions. In this context, the board reviewed the operation of its private practitioner scheme and decided that priority should be given to domestic violence cases and that maintenance, custody and access cases would generally in future be referred to law centres, except where an applicant requires one of these remedies at the same time as a domestic violence remedy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the allocation of additional funding and resources to the Legal Aid Board in recent years, up from &euro;10.656 million in 1997 to &euro;17.075 million in 2003, has led to an increase in the services available from the board and to a significant reduction in waiting times.</P>
      <P>I can further inform the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately. Such a system for priorities is necessary to ensure that, for example, persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with speedy service. In 2001, the total number of priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 1,500, or about 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network and where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that it does not keep records of the cost of keeping individual prisoners within the prison system. However, each year, indicative average costs of keeping an offender in the various prisons and places of detention under the aegis of prisons and places of detention are released.</P>
      <P>The individuals referred to by the Deputy were transferred from Portlaoise Prison to Castlerea Prison on 4 May 2000. The cost of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise and Castlerea Prisons for the year 2000 was &euro;157,828 and &euro;63,233 respectively. The cost of a keeping a prisoner in Castlerea Prison in 2001 was &euro;66,700. Figures are not yet available for 2002.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, legal proceedings taken in these cases have not been concluded and the question of costs has therefore not been determined.</P>

      <P>The forum comprises a series of more than 300 events which will take place across the three cities of Kyoto, Osaka and Shiga in Japan over the period 16 to 23 March. It will provide a forum for broad based discussion on water management issues by Government representatives, experts, stakeholders and non-governmental organisations. The WWF is promoted by the World Water Council, representative of academic, professional and environmental bodies and persons with an interest in water management and protection and is hosted by the Government of Japan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the forum's conclusions will not have formal status or binding effect, the forum provides an opportunity to reaffirm political will towards solving outstanding global water issues and identifying concrete actions for expanding co-operation and initiatives on water at various levels. In particular, it presents an opportunity to support a substantial follow-up towards implementation of the water related targets set by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002. These targets include the halving by 2015 of the proportion of the world population currently without access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The WSSD plan of implementation adopted at Johannesburg refers to the need for action to provide safe drinking water in the context of poverty eradication, protection of human health and protection and management of the natural resource base of economic and social development. It acknowl<Col N="1209" /> edges the need to adopt an integrated water basin approach and the need for actions at all levels, including through regulation, monitoring, voluntary measures, market and information based tools, land use management and cost recovery of water services, without cost recovery objectives becoming a barrier to access to safe water by poor people.</P>
    <P>The European Union formally launched its global water initiative in Johannesburg on 3 September 2002. It is aimed at creating strategic partnerships to achieve the WSSD goals on clean water and sanitation. The initiative will be under development until the end of 2003 and a progress report will be presented at the WWF. Its initial focus will be on Africa and the newly independent States of the former Soviet Union. In this context the EU has entered an EU-Africa Water for Life agreement. This will help its partners to develop integrated water resources management plans by 2005 that will support achievement of the WSSD goals.</P>
    <P>The EU's commitment to supporting developing countries under its water initiative and the WSSD targets in that regard is not affected by its objectives in the context of WTO negotiations on trade in services to give improved market access for its service sector suppliers.</P>

      <P>A scheme of capital grant assistance to support investment in waste management infrastructure was launched in 2002. This grant scheme is primarily aimed at high in waste hierarchy recycling infrastructure that is provided for under, or consistent with the objectives of, local and regional waste management plans. Eligible infrastructure includes civic amenity sites and other bring facilities, as well as materials recovery and biological treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>On 7 November I announced an initial allocation of over &euro;14 million in grant assistance in respect of 55 local authority recycling projects. I expect to announce further such grant allocations, to both public and private projects, over the course of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to this capital grants scheme, my Department provides grant assistance towards procurement and planning costs incurred by local authorities in respect of the provision of regional waste facilities through public private partnership arrangements.

      <P>The PwC report on the review of heritage functions was commissioned by the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and completed at a cost of &euro;149,131 in October 1998. The former Department set up a working group to examine the report's recommendations and to implement aspects of the report which were considered appropriate. The group proposed a major reorganisation and restructuring of Dúchas and discussions on the proposals were held with the trade unions. However, agreement had not been reached prior to the transfer of heritage functions to my Department last July.</P>
      <P>Initiatives, such as the SMI process, have also been drivers for organisational developments that have taken place since 1998. Substantial progress had been made on the design of a costing and financial management systems in accordance with PwC's recommendation prior to the transfer of functions to my Department. These systems are now being encompassed in the new management information framework being implemented in my Department. New project management processes have been introduced in the built heritage area.</P>

    <P>A very comprehensive and successful partnership programme was put in place and more resources were devoted to staff training. Major investment has been made in IT and equipment and support services have been improved.</P>
    <P>Since the transfer of heritage functions to my Department last July a major review of the heritage function, in particular, to see how best to integrate it into its new organisational setting, has been carried out and is currently being finalised.</P>

      <P>I have not met BirdWatch Ireland regarding this issue. However, my Department is encouraging and facilitating the active involvement of all interested parties in the implementation of the directive, including public authorities, agricultural, commercial, industrial, recreational and community interests, environmental organisations and interested persons. A broad range of activities is required for this purpose and numerous actions are being pursued by my Department and other agencies at national, regional and local levels.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> At national level information and consultation seminars on the WFD organised jointly by my Department and the Institute of Public Administration were held in Kilkenny on 8 November 2001 and Tullamore on 4 December 2001. The seminars informed delegates of the arrangements being developed for implementation of the WFD. They provided an opportunity for commenting on those arrangements and water management generally. The Kilkenny seminar mainly served public authorities such as local and regional authorities. The Tullamore seminar was aimed at a broader stakeholder audience and included participation by BirdWatch Ireland. A public information website is being developed by my Department, linked to my Department's website, to facilitate public access to information on the implementation of the directive, and will be launched shortly. My Department is funding an initiative by VOICE, which stands for Voice of Irish Concern for the Environment, to assist environmental organisations to work together towards development of a common policy position on the directive. BirdWatch Ireland is participating in this initiative.</P>
    <P>At regional level my Department is promoting and funding the establishment by local authorities of inter authority projects to develop river basin monitoring and management systems and to provide the bulk of the baseline data required for implementation of the directive and for development of river basin management plans. Central to these projects is a requirement for the development and implementation of a full programme of activity for public information and consultation. Two projects have already been established in relation to the south eastern region and the Shannon river basin. A regional seminar on public participation was held on 5 November 2002 in Kilkenny and marked the start of a process to facilitate and support stakeholder involvement in the implementation of the south eastern river basin management project. BirdWatch Ireland participated in this seminar.</P>
    <P>In addition to specific measures being taken in the context of the WFD, the effective participation of interested parties will be facilitated by the range of structures put in place, with necessary support, under the local government reform programme. This scheme has facilitated a greater input by community and local sectoral interests, including the social partners, into public service policy development at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 448 and 449 together.</P>
      <P>Peat extraction for domestic purposes in candidate special areas of conservation does not generally result in significant damage to the conservation value of the sites in the short-term. Arrangements announced in 1998 provided that domestic turf cutting in candidate SACs could be allowed to continue for up to ten years, save in exceptionally sensitive parts of the bogs, in order to give owners of turbary rights time to make new arrangements for alternative sources of supply. Similar arrangements are being considered for additional sites recently proposed for designation.</P>
      <P>Most damage to candidate SACs from peat extraction is caused by commercial and industrial operations. In order to maintain the conservation value of these sites, such damaging operations have stopped or are being phased out over as short a period as possible. Commercial operators must consult my Department's heritage service. Turf cutting is only permitted to continue in the short-term in exceptional circumstances to protect employment. Each case is assessed on an individual basis. If it is found that cutting must cease in order to protect a candidate SAC compensation will be paid for proven actual loss.</P>
      <P>Peat extraction in areas adjoining candidate SACs is not subject to direct control by my Department. It may require to be assessed in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 if liable to have an adverse effect on a candidate SAC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> The above arrangements apply to all bog SACs and I will provide the Deputy with a list of these.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings including the installation of central heating, is in principle, the responsibility of local authorities to be financed from their own resources. Where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for the upgrading of local authority dwellings, the provision of central heating may form part of the work undertaken. To date such funding has been provided to Dublin City Council under the following schemes: the remedial works scheme which assists local authorities in carrying out major essential works to dwellings in designated estates; the special area regeneration programme which consists of a once-off programme of upgrading high density older flat complexes; and the redevelopment of a number of seriously rundown flat complexes involving a mix of new building, refurbishment and, where appropriate, demolition and replacement.</P>
      <P>My Department has provided some &euro;391 million to date for the above schemes including over &euro;160 million for the major programme of regeneration of Ballymun. In addition the council has been undertaking a programme, funded from its own resources, to provide central heating in its older housing stock.</P>
      <P>Local authorities may also seek my Department's approval to use their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing construction and remedial works programmes for the provision of central heating in their rented housing stock.</P>
      <P>Apart from the foregoing, there is no specific funding mechanism available from my Department for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings. The council has been advised to this effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 4 of the Euro<Col N="1219" /> pean Directive on the conservation of wild birds (79/409/EEC) requires member states, including Ireland, to designate special protection areas for wild birds. Under the directive the selection of sites for designation is based on scientific criteria.</P>
      <P>My Department's heritage service is currently examining the suitability of nine upland areas for designation as SPAs in respect of the hen harrier. This is one species for which SPAs must be designated under the directive. Its breeding population is largely concentrated in the south west. The areas being examined include the Mullagherierk mountains, which are partly in west Limerick.</P>
      <P>Preparatory scientific work to assess the suitability of all nine sites and define their boundaries is currently under way. When this work is complete I will decide what sites should be formally proposed for designation. If any sites are formally proposed as SPAs then my Department will notify and consult landowners and land users in the area. A period of three months will be allowed for making objections.</P>
      <P>In general existing farming activities are likely to be fully compatible with the conservation requirements of hen harriers and other bird species for which SPAs are designated. In these circumstances there will be no need to place any restrictions on traditional farming activities. SPAs attract higher levels of payment to farmers who join the rural environment protection scheme which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I am committed to paying fair and reasonable compensation to other landowners for actual loss shown to have been incurred as a result of restrictions that may be imposed on existing activities consequent on designation of their lands.</P>
      <P>In relation to the planning process, planning authorities are required to provide in their development plans for the appropriate protection of nature conservation areas, including SPAs. In particular, they must consider whether a development is likely to have a significant effect on an SPA, and if so, to require an environmental impact assessment to be carried out.</P>

      <P>Directive 2002/49/EC relates to the assessment and management of environmental noise and is due to be transposed into national law by 18 July 2004. By 30 June 2007 it requires, <i>inter alia,</i> the making of strategic noise maps for all agglomerations with more than 250,000 inhabitants, all major roads with more than six million vehicle passages a year, major railways with more than 60,000 train passages per year and major airports with more than 50,000 take-off or landing movements per year. A second phase of maps is required by 2012 for all agglomerations between 100,000 and 250,000 inhabitants, all major roads between 3 million and 6 million vehicle passages a year and major railways with between 30,000 and 60,000 train passages per year.</P>
      <P>My Department is in discussions with the relevant local and transport sector authorities regarding meeting the mapping and other requirements of the directive within these timeframes. These authorities will take funding issues into account in future budgetary plans.</P>
      <P>Dublin City Council has made considerable progress to date in noise mapping. It published noise mapping project Dublin city &ndash; interim report in September 2002. This linked land use, population density and traffic data for the area between the Royal and Grand Canals. The council has advised me that the next phase of the project, which involves mapping the area from the North and South Circular Roads to the city council boundary, is scheduled for publication by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív):</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the <Col N="1225" /> recommendation in the report that the range of schemes in the community and local development areas be re-examined, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 99 and No. 157 of 12 February.</P>
      <P>With regard to the recommendation that the Western Development Commission be abolished, this has not been adopted. Instead my Department is undertaking a review of the purpose, functional area and operation of the WDC. The purpose of this review is to identify and eliminate any unnecessary duplication between State agencies operating in the western region, thus ensuring value for money in all public expenditure in the region.</P>
      <P>The CAIT and student summer jobs scheme have been discontinued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should note that it is the role of my Department, supported by Area Development Management Limited, to co-ordinate the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is a matter for Departments to report on progress in relation to implementing RAPID proposals that fall within the remit of their areas.</P>
      <P>The Government remains committed to the RAPID programme and its implementation. My officials have had a number of bilateral meetings with other relevant Departments in recent months to advance the implementation of the programme. In addition I hope to meet my ministerial colleagues in other Departments in the coming weeks to further advance the plans.</P>
      <P>As regards my own Department, proposals from the RAPID Strand I and II plans fall to be considered under the young peoples facilities and services fund, the community development programme and funding for local drugs task force projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, the position is that the national assessment committee of the fund, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups under round II of the fund. With regard to services projects, the committee is awaiting the completion of the external evaluation of the fund before seeking such proposals under round II. <Col N="1227" /> The first draft of the evaluator's report was received in mid January and is being examined by the NAC at present. Proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in light of the overall funding position for 2003.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals in RAPID plans relate to the community development programme. While there has been no additional allocation of funding in respect of community development projects to date, the Deputy should note that in many cases pre-development work is under way. The full establishment of groups as community development projects in 2003 is subject to available resources but those in RAPID areas will receive due priority.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals from the RAPID plans are also being pursued through the local drugs task forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív):</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 2000 I approved a grant of &euro;1.84 million to Mayo County Council for the provision of a cablecar and associated services between Inishbiggle and the mainland at Bullsmouth. This grant was based on a total estimated construction cost of &euro;2.03 million with the council to provide the balance of &euro;0.19 million.</P>
      <P>It was hoped that construction of the cablecar would have commenced in 2002 and that the service would be fully operational by the spring of this year. A delay has occurred as a result of an objection lodged with An Bord Pleanála last year against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of the land required for the project. While An Bord Pleanála subsequently confirmed the said CPOs, this decision is currently the subject of a judicial review which is listed to be heard in the High Court on 31 March. Efforts to resolve this issue by solicitors representing the local family and the council have proved unsuccessful to date. The Deputy will appreciate that the project cannot be progressed any further pending resolution of this issue.</P>

      <P>Last Tuesday I met a large number of community representatives in Fettercairn, Tallaght. At the meeting &ndash; at which the Deputy was present &ndash; I was made aware of their views of the RAPID programme and the time and commitment they have invested in it to date.</P>
      <P>Under the programme each area implementation team prepared a plan for their area. These plans contained a wide range of proposals with very varied timescales and costs. My Department's role, supported by Area Development Management Limited, is to co-ordinate the implementation of the programme. It is a matter for Departments to report on progress in relation to implementing RAPID proposals that fall within the remit of their areas.</P>
      <P>It is important at this stage to restate that the Government remains committed to the RAPID programme and its implementation. My officials have had a number of bilateral meetings with other relevant Departments in recent months to advance its implementation. I hope to meet my ministerial colleagues in other Departments in the coming weeks to discuss a number of options as to how the plans might be further advanced.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has been refused a retirement pension when this person believes that they have a sufficient amount of stamps and have been signing for social welfare for the past 30 years; and if this person will qualify for an old age contributory pension at the age of 66 years in January 2004.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned applied for retirement pension on 30 October 2002. He does not qualify for this pension as he fails to satisfy the statutory condition requiring him to have at least 260 full rate contributions paid since first entering insurance. According to my Department's records he has a total of 226 full rate contributions paid since he entered insurance in 1955. This condition also needs to be satisfied to qualify for old age contributory pension at age 66.</P>
      <P>In addition to not having the required minimum number of paid contributions, the person concerned also fails to satisfy the qualifying condition requiring him to have a yearly average of at least 24 contributions paid or credited over the period from January 1955 to December 2002. According to my Department's records he has a yearly average of 11 over this period. The person concerned was notified of the decision on his retirement pension claim on 28 January 2003.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned was also insurably employed in England details of his UK insurance record have been requested from the UK social security authorities. On receipt of this information his entitlement to an EU <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension will be examined and he will be notified of the position.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The over 80 allowance is an additional payment of &euro;6.40 per week, payable at age 80, to recipients of social welfare pensions. The allowance is payable as an increase to the personal rate of pension. In order to be entitled to it a person must have an underlying entitlement to a personal rate of pension in their own right.</P>
      <P>Any proposals to change the current arrangements for payment of the allowance would have expenditure implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme, grants are available to a range of locally based organisations and groups including family support and community development groups, women's and men's groups, lone parents support and self-help groups, Travellers' groups and the local co-ordinating organisations that support their work.</P>
      <P>Invitations to apply for funding under the 2003 scheme of grants to community development and family support groups will be advertised by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the national and local newspapers later in the year.</P>
      <P>Under the family and community services resource centre programme my Department provides core funding on a three year basis to local family resource centres throughout the country. At present there are 86 local FRCs included in the programme. This year the Government has provided some &euro;6.8 million for their development.</P>
      <P>The family resource centre programme is one of a number of family programmes and services which will be administered in future by the Family Support Agency.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that in order to be entitled to unemployment assistance a person must satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>In assessing the means, account is taken of the income a person may have, together with the value of any capital or property held. Money provided by family members by way of a private loan, which must be repaid, is assessed and treated as a capital lump sum for assessment purposes.</P>
      <P>In the assessment of capital the first &euro;12,697 is disregarded and only amounts over that figure are assessable. Where part or all of the moneys received by way of a private loan are disposed of the value of that amount is excluded from the capital assessment.</P>
      <P>In a situation where a person receives regular cash contributions from any source as a way of supplementing his or her income the full amount of the contributions is assessed.</P>

      <P>For the past three years the Christmas bonus amount has been set at 100% of the recipient's normal weekly payment. In 2000 and 2001, the minimum amount payable was £20, equivalent to &euro;25.40, and in 2002 the minimum payment was increased to &euro;30.</P>
      <P>The bonus is intended for long-term welfare payment recipients, including recipients of retirement, old age contributory and non-contributory, widow's, widower's and invalidity pensions, one parent family payment, carer's allowance, disability allowance, long-term unemployment assistance, farm assist and employment support payments. Recipients are only entitled to one such bonus.</P>
      <P>In addition to recipients of long-term social welfare payments, the bonus is also paid to persons participating in FÁS, VTOS, Job Initiative and community employment schemes, and to recipients of certain health board payments such as domiciliary care allowance, blind welfare allowance and mobility allowance.</P>
      <P>In general a person cannot receive more than one payment and the question of double payment of bonus would only arise in limited circumstances where a person is in receipt of a social welfare payment and payment also under an employment support scheme.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the Christmas bonus in 2002 was an estimated &euro;103.3 million. It benefited some 792,000 recipients and an estimated 413,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the bonus payment to recipients of non-social welfare employment and income supports as outlined above, is provided for in the Votes of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science, and Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment of the bonus is normally scheduled for the first week in December. Payment arrangements for recipients of social welfare payments <Col N="1233" /> entail production of a special payable order for people in receipt of payment by way of books of payable orders, post-draft payments for recipients paid at post offices and the electronic transfer of payment to the relevant financial institution where the recipient's payment is made directly to his or her bank, post office or building society account.</P>
    <P>Recipients of health board allowances receive their payments from their local health board. FÁS, VTOS and CERT trainees and community employment participants receive the bonus payment as part of their weekly allowance from those agencies.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Christmas bonus payment is effectively targeted. There are no plans to change the current arrangements for payment of the bonus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan) Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee to the Minister for Finance, published in December 2002, made a number of specific recommendations in relation to my Department's proposed 2003 Estimates. They were as follows: a reduction in the amount sought by my Department for administrative expenses; a phasing out of the back to work allowance and a discontinuation of summer payments in respect of the back to education allowance schemes; a speeding up of the implementation of the employment action plan whereby persons on the live register are offered supports to find employment or training; changes to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme; a reduction in the financial allocations sought to fund the money advice and budgeting service and the Family Support Agency; and greater control savings across schemes.</P>
      <P>In the light of the recommendations by the committee on administration expenses, measures have been put in place to reduce expenditure on administration while maintaining the focus on high priority areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the BTWA scheme, it was decided not to share out the scheme but to refocus it on those who were on the live register for five years or more and on other groups who had particular difficulty in accessing the labour market such as those on disability or invalidity payments. Persons who were in receipt of the BTWA prior to January are not affected by the introduction of the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>In line with the committee's recommendation, summer payments under the BTEA scheme will be discontinued this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> The committee also identified savings arising from a speeding up of the employment action plan whereby persons on the live register are offered employment supports by my Department and FÁS. The necessary arrangements are being put in place between FÁS and my Department and the measure will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the SWA scheme, the committee recommended that the individual rent contribution, for rent supplement, should be raised to &euro;12 per week and identified other savings arising in the context of speedier processing of asylum cases. The rent contribution was increased to the figure recommended with effect from the beginning of this year.  </P>
    <P>The committee identified savings from the amounts sought in funding for the MABS and the FSA services. While the recommendations of the committee were partly reflected in the abridged Estimates allocation, the services in question will, following additional allocations in the Budget, have adequate resources to function effectively this year.</P>
    <P>My Department has a comprehensive control programme which includes checks and reviews carried out on a regular and targeted basis. This ensures that social welfare payments are only received by those who are entitled to them and that employers and the self-employed are fulfilling their PRSI obligations. Reorganisation of Department structures and ongoing technology developments have combined to facilitate a more co-ordinated, focused and effective approach to control.</P>
    <P>The committee identified a number of options for consideration if, in the light of a deteriorating budget situation, further substantial savings were needed. These included the question of reviewing the universality of child benefit. The issues arising, both from a policy and administrative perspective, are complex and would require detailed further consideration were this option to be pursued.</P>

      <P>Since the inception of the free travel scheme, there have been peak time restrictions on free travel services on Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann provincial city services in Cork and Limerick. These restrictions arise because of pressure on bus capacity at peak commuter times.</P>
      <P>If a free travel passholder wishes to depart from Dublin, Cork or Limerick on a Bus Éireann long distance service on a Friday in the peak period between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. he or she would be charged a fare for the first 20 miles of the journey. The remainder of the journey is free. Similarly, he or she would be required to pay a fare if they used Dublin Bus services at peak times.    </P>
      <P>The restrictions do not apply in the case of people with learning disabilities, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme was introduced, <i>inter alia,</i> to utilise spare off-peak capacity on public transport services. Any general lifting of the time restrictions for free travel passholders could cause significant extra capacity problems for urban transport operators and for other commuters. This issue is kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for wider access by passholders where circumstances allow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is no specific provision under the social welfare code in respect of child care costs, the one-parent family payment scheme provides income support for lone parents. The person concerned is in receipt of one-parent family payment at the rate of &euro;134.10 per week.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department, also provides assistance to people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. People in full-time education are generally excluded from receiving assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. They may apply under the scheme for exceptional needs payments in respect of certain expenses such as cots, buggies and other child care requisites. Payments under these provisions of the scheme have been made in the case in question.</P>

      <P>The reply to the earlier question to which the Deputy refers indicated that the means of the person concerned were being re-assessed in light of additional information received and that in the meantime he would continue to receive pension of &euro;70.70 a week.</P>
      <P>The necessary inquiries were recently completed and his means were assessed as exceeding the maximum weekly statutory limit of &euro;147.60 for entitlement to a pension. On this basis, his pension had to be revoked and he was notified accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made significant improvements to the social welfare system in recent years resulting in significant falls in the number of persons in consistent poverty and in real improvements in the quality of life of persons dependent on the system. Examples of which are as follows: social welfare spending will have risen by over &euro;4.5 billion in the period between 1997 and 2003 &ndash; well in excess of the rate of inflation; payments rates for both recipients and their families have improved very considerably in real terms; there has been a major increase in the level of resources devoted to child benefit; and significant structural improvements have been made to the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite a less favourable economic environment than in previous years, the Government is committed to further improvement in the system over the coming years. In our programme for Government we have committed to the achievement of a basic pension of at least &euro;200 by 2003 and other improvements in provisions for sur<Col N="1240" /> vivors. We will also complete the programme of substantial increase in child benefit.</P>
    <P>We will implement the revised national anti-poverty strategy including the achievement of a rate of &euro;150 a week in 2002 terms for the lowest rates of social welfare to be met by 2007. In addition significant advances are being made to improve the delivery of schemes and services. This will continue to be the focus of attention over the period ahead.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of &euro;85.80.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the person's entitlement he was assessed with means of &euro;71 per week derived from income from his father's farm. His rate of unemployment assistance was revised to &euro;53.80 with effect from 1 January.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has appealed against this decision and the necessary papers are being prepared. When this is complete the case will be referred to an appeals officer for early consideration.</P>
