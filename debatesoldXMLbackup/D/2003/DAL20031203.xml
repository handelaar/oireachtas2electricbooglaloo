      <P>The last time the House was delayed in the morning was when the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was Whip and the Government collapsed. Is the Taoiseach aware that thousands of students will march on Leinster House today because of cutbacks in third level allocations and facilities? The registration fee has increased by &euro;80 to &euro;750, the fees for junior and leaving certificate examinations have increased to &euro;82 and &euro;86, respectively, and there have been serious cutbacks in the level of facilities available to universities.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that job creation depends on innovation, patenting, design and research and development and that cutbacks in these areas are a blow to the future, particularly where young students are involved? Does he take into account the statement by the vice-president of the students' union in Trinity College that there is no point in attending a university with a substandard library? What does the Taoiseach propose to do about this situation given the outrage now felt in the third level sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Spending on third level education this year is about &euro;1.4 billion and we have continued to put resources into the sector. Nearly every third level institute was a construction site in recent years, with new facilities, libraries, laboratories and auditoria being put up. The figures are there for everyone to see.</P>
      <P>There was an issue regarding research and development. We have recently put an additional &euro;25 million into the PRTLI programme, continuing the resources invested in it over the past three or four years. This programme is not only bringing back Irish researchers from abroad to work in research and development but also a substantial number of non-Irish researchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resources allocated in the Books of Estimates last year and this year are tighter in this area. The Minister has been working with the sector to come to an agreement on its capital programme. I do not think Deputy Kenny would <Col N="322" />argue against the Minister giving priority to first level education in tighter times. The third level sector has done enormously well and is being well looked after. We now have something like 20,000 more people in third level education than in the past.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of fees and rates, there have been small increases in this area. We provide top class third level education at a low cost. The changes made over the past seven or eight years make the system very attractive for students, which is why the numbers are going up every year. I have met some of the groups which protest about different issues in third level. The library and other facilities put into our universities have been top class. Perhaps not every third level college has been done, but we should be proud of the facilities in most of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's stated that most universities and institutes of technology have been like construction sites in recent years. The fact is that capital allocations and building grants are down by 47% for institutes of technology and 45% for universities. It limits what can be done. The Taoiseach referred to small increases. The third level registration fee is now &euro;750, which is not a small amount of money.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach support Science Foundation Ireland's programme to contract a large number of PhD students to become involved in research, development and innovation in this country, which could become a magnet for investment from abroad? Corporations are willing to invest anywhere in the world and they could look at Ireland as a centre where brain power is the magnet to drive the future. The conduct of the Government in increasing charges and cutting back capital grants both in the institutes of technology and university sectors makes a mockery of its stated intention to make the country the leading knowledge-based centre within Europe over the next 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Kenny said. It is not a question of supporting Science Foundation Ireland; we set it up. We have turned it into a dynamic body which organises and maintains research at the highest level. It has brought back a large number of Irish graduates. The Science Foundation Ireland initiative is worth more than &euro;500 million. The research and development programme is worth an additional &euro;500 million. That is from a base of spending nothing for many years. We did not have a body, such as Science Foundation Ireland, and we did not spend anything on research and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Support for third level access programmes has increased from approximately &euro;500,000 when I took over as Taoiseach to &euro;26 million for the year coming to an end. We also have good schemes for people who suffer hardship. We have almost 20,000 additional students in full-time third level education and part-time enrolments have increased by more than 40%. <Col N="323" />The figures speak for themselves. We have had to put a higher proportion into first and second level education in more difficult times, but 44% of students do not have to pay any registration charges. The other charges are not excessive for the top class facilities provided to third level students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I watched the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on the monitor yesterday as she giggled her way through Question Time. It was endearing unless one is a victim of her social welfare cuts. I understand her defence now is that she is making these cuts because there is abuse in the system. There are many abuses in our society. The one she posited of EU nationals coming here for what she called the &ldquo;craic&rdquo; for six months and then going into education at our expense is far fetched.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the question of the budget supplement. It is a payment brokered by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service when repayments to a creditor leave a person with insufficient money for food, fuel or the other essentials of life. The cost is minuscule, but a person in despair because of debts which have accrued due to alcoholism in the home, other dysfunctional reasons or dire poverty was enabled through the services of MABS, which acted as a broker with a credit union or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, to make a payment to the creditor over a period of time and to get them out of poverty. The merits of the budget supplement are listed in a document from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which Deputy Howlin gave me. They include the following: the supplement breaks the cycle of poverty; it is a targeted, short-term payment reviewed and revised regularly and hence it does not become part of the income; it is a planned method of debt payment in partnership with the person who is in debt; and the expenditure is minuscule.</P>
      <P>The effect of what the Minister has done is to drive these people into the arms of money lenders and further into debt and to undermine the Money Advice and Budgeting Service. No amount of shaking of heads will change that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the meanest, lowest and pettiest cut and there is no justification for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I also heard part of what the Minister for Social and Family Affairs said yester<Col N="324" />day. She explained the various issues which arose. Anyone with a fair mind would have heard her identify areas within her Department out of &euro;10.65 billion. Whatever additional funding is announced today in the budget, the social welfare budget will be at least close to &euro;11 billion. That is an enormous amount of resources. The Minister has a responsibility not just to give away money, but to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent, managed and targeted correctly into schemes for which it was originally intended. The Minister has an obligation to do that. Out of the &euro;10.65 billion, the Minister received an additional pre-budget amount of &euro;355 million and she identified four or five areas where the schemes must be better dealt with.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned the MABS supplement. A supplementary welfare allowance is given to recipients who have been supported by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service in brokering a deal with creditors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that she believed parts of that should be discontinued. The supplement has been a subsidy for creditors, mainly banks and lending institutions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The repayment schedule agreed with creditors in the future will be more realistic and not as onerous on the person with insufficient money to pay. It is currently reducted and the normal support services, such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, will not be affected by this measure. The Minister said yesterday that those who have a problem &ndash; the Department can easily identify them &ndash; will get an exceptional needs payment and that all those in receipt of that will not be affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what category Deputy Rabbitte is referring, but there is &euro;9.9 million for the MABS payments this year. I do not know how the Deputy can say the scheme has been abolished when the Minister informed us yesterday that &euro;9.9 million is available for pay<Col N="325" />ments. That seems to be a contradiction, but I believe the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in disbelief that the Taoiseach would try to defend what has happened. It has not been reducted, as the Taoiseach put it. It has been cut. What is the point in saying to a woman who is in despair because she cannot pay the ESB bill, the rent or a utility payment for an essential item in the home that there is &euro;10.65 billion in social welfare? What is the point of using such global figures? The reason the Money Advice and Budgeting Service was established was to act as a broker for people in despair because of poverty or circumstances in the home to allow them to get assistance to arrange the management of their budget and to negotiate with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or the credit union.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Sargent commences, I suggest for the benefit of Members of the House that if all Members obeyed the Standing Order relating to Leaders' Questions we would not have the arguments that we have had on the floor of the House this morning. They should confine themselves to one topic on which the Standing Order is quite specific. It allows a brief question on a matter of topical public importance to the leaders of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the designated leader of the Technical Group. No other topic is allowed and Deputies should not introduce other topics to the question, in which case we might not have the row we have had on the floor of the House this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is of interest to every member of the Cabinet, but I put it to the Taoiseach. It relates to the announcement yesterday by the Fianna Fáil director of elections who informed us that he had set a date for the local and European elections for Friday, 11 June 2004. We acknowledge that there have been some efforts at reform of local government, among which is the ending of the dual mandate, which we welcome, and the formal recognition of local government in the Constitution, for all the good it does.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is one major element of reform that has not taken place, that being the need for a limit on spending for local election candidates? This is already in place for national and European candidates, as we know. Does the Taoiseach not understand that there is huge public outrage and cynicism as a result of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats buying the last general election with taxpayers' money, which is the perception?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil spent &euro;3.5 million in the three months before the election was even called. Is it not obvious that the absence of any limits for the local election gives a <i>carte blanche</i> to speculators to bankroll their chosen candidates in the hope and expectation that once elected they can propose whatever hugely profitable rezoning they wish, regardless of good planning and the burden created on local communities? Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is time to carry out a simple but useful piece of work by putting a limit on local election candidate spending to avoid a repeat of the sort of outrageous spending that has taken place and has resulted in the kind of tri<Col N="330" />bunals that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is so interested in, such as the Mahon tribunal?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I was only following your ruling under Standing Orders. Candidates must document and give a full account of all spending. In the last local elections the average expenditure after full checking was about &euro;2,700.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no evidence whatsoever that local election candidates of any party, anywhere in the country, abused the system. Under the law they must document and give full receipts for all their expenditure. To use the administrative system for local elections, in which there are thousands of candidates, would not be possible, nor is it necessary. Candidates must give full accounts and there are many people watching what they do. That is what happened at the last local elections. The average figure spent was less than &euro;1,000. The required mechanisms are in place. I do not <Col N="331" />believe Deputy Sargent's contention that local election candidates who work hard for their communities for little payment, regardless of what party they represent, are in the business of falling into the hands of developers.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether the Taoiseach has learnt anything from the tribunals, not to mention his career in politics to date. Is it not the case that one Fianna Fáil candidate, whom we can identify, recorded an election expenditure of zero? I am not sure about the requirement to declare the total amount spent. We need to do more work on this.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has the Midas touch of political fundraising. His Waterford constituency, a four-seater, has an election spending limit of &euro;31,743 per candidate, yet he raised &euro;34,722. There is a clear relationship between one's political decision-making ability and fundraising. This took place after the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, increased the limits in the Electoral Act 1997 by 50%. Has the Taoiseach learnt nothing from the tribunals, regardless of what he says and given his laudable faith in human nature? Did Colm McGrath, then of Fianna Fáil, not spend &euro;16,000? What about Liam Lawlor, Ray Burke and the various Mr. Insatiables we have yet to discover? Will the Taoiseach not learn from these lessons and put a limit on local election spending? Currently, people can spend not &euro;31,000 but &euro;310,000 if they wish, or if developer friends want to give them the money in advance for favours to be rendered in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Attorney General is operating well and efficiently and has sufficient staff numbers to manage the day-to-day routine drafting of all primary and secondary legislation. The full complement of staff in the office is 123. Seven full-time vacancies and one job-sharing vacancy have arisen and are in the course of being filled through the usual competitions. There are no unnecessary or insurmountable delays. Only four of these vacancies arise on the drafting side of the office.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year a significant number of EU measures were overdue for transposition. I was anxious that Departments would clear this backlog as soon as possible and before our Presidency on 1 January 2004. When it became apparent that a number of Departments intended to give instructions to draft statutory instruments urgently in the past two to three months of this year, it was clear that this would place an inordinate amount of pressure on the parliamentary counsel. At my request, the Attorney General then wrote to Departments suggesting that under the circumstances, outside barristers might be employed on an exceptional basis to ensure that the highest number of EU directives could be transposed by the January deadline. The letter was accompanied by a list of barristers known to have experience in EU law, but no panel was drawn up. Some Departments availed of this suggestion while others continued to use the services of the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel or internal drafting services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" />A significant backlog of directives has been transposed and we aim to have our transposition deficit for Internal Market measures below the EU target of 1.5% by January 2004. In addition, the drafting of the priority list of primary legislation promised for publication before the resumption of the Dáil in January has proceeded unaffected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an increase in the number of staff employed since the last time I raised this matter. Will the Taoiseach confirm that a new procedure for selecting lawyers for drafting work was posted on the website of the Office of the Attorney General after a freedom of information request application had been made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe? Is a different system now in operation for recruiting lawyers for drafting work from that which applied previously?</P>
      <P>If the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel is adequately staffed and resourced, why has such a backlog of directives arisen? Is the outsourcing of this work a new departure? Does it mean that further drafting work on primary or secondary legislation will be outsourced? How many items of EU secondary legislation remain to be implemented? What pressure has the Taoiseach put on Departments to see that this is done before he takes up office as President of the European Council on 1 January?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny will recall that at the beginning of this year I stated that I wanted to bring the transposition of EU directives up to date as far as possible. The office has received instructions about many directives which have been transposed before December. Drafting is in progress for a number of these apart from legal issues in some cases. A total of 79 EU measures have been received within the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Of these 56 statutory instruments have been made, work is in progress in seven cases, seven more have been stamped and are at the draft stage within Departments, three are the subject of legal query and six have been abandoned. The parliamentary counsel had engaged Department policy issues where it was not necessary because other measures had superseded them or they had been enacted in more current directives or statutory instruments.</P>
      <P>As regards the posting of the advisory counsel of the Attorney General's office, many Departments transpose their own directives where they have the ability to do so. Some Departments have their own legal advisers and others employ qualified solicitors or barristers who can do this work within the Department. Some Departments do not have this facility. To try to get the work up to date, the Attorney General's office produced a list of people in private practice outside the Government system who were experts in European law and could be called on. Some Departments availed of this while others did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" />Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised a question about the legal profession. The answer is the same as always. The legal profession organises itself into two separate and distinct branches with a well-established division of work. The Bar allows familiarity not just with the formal rules under which the courts operate but also the informal practices and understanding that are part of the legal system. Barristers bring to the Attorney General's office a particular understanding of litigation from practising at the Bar and know how judges are likely to treat certain issues. They have inside knowledge of the skills, strengths and weaknesses of practitioners at the Bar. I cannot stress sufficiently that the Bar continues to provide highly qualified candidates with experience of the conduct of litigation as well as the courts and the judges. This is the sort of advice the Attorney General requires from the advisory counsel who work with him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and others asked why solicitors are not allowed to apply for advisory counsel posts when they can apply for parliamentary counsel and assistant parliamentary counsel positions. The point has been made repeatedly over the years by myself and others that there are two different professions. Parliamentary counsel and assistant parliamentary counsel are draftspersons. As regards allowing solicitors to apply for advisory counsel posts, barristers and solicitors have different skills which each profession practises. That is the reason. The rule has been changed over the years to allow solicitors to apply for some of the posts that previously they could not, but the position has not altered for parliamentary counsel and assistant parliamentary counsel.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach say how well he considers the Office of the Attorney General to be equipped with parliamentary draftspersons? The figures I have are different from the Taoiseach's. As I understand it from the schedule as published by the Government, 22 Bills were promised to be published this term. According to my count only three have been produced. Is that due to drafting difficulties in the Attorney General's office or are they political difficulties? Is it easier now to recruit parliamentary draftspersons than formerly? Is the Taoiseach saying some Departments are being encouraged to do their own drafting up to a certain stage? Will he say whether this office contributes to the logjam that appears to have arisen in publishing Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is never easy to hire well-qualified draftspersons. It is a skill which, like many others, comes with time. It is easier to hire staff for the changes and reforms that have been made in the Attorney General's office, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. To hire people with good skills takes time. We have occasionally used people from outside the State <Col N="336" />over the years. Recruitment is ongoing and many are in training, but it takes time.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Bills to be published, the session tends to run in accordance with the Bills as circulated, and this includes the Christmas period. The same is true of the summer period. The position is that four Bills have been published this session. Many amendments were made to Bills which necessitated an extensive advisory drafting input from the Office of the Attorney General. I am reasonably confident that the vast majority of Bills promised for publication this session will be available within the timescale. It is also the case that many Bills only become available towards the end of the parliamentary session.</P>
      <P>The current position of the Bills on the A list of promised legislation is as follows: four have been published; one Bill is not being proceeded with by the Department concerned this session; eight Bills have been stamped draft issued; four Bills are being drafted; three Bills are with Departments; and the memorandum for one Bill will be submitted to Government next week. This does not include the Appropriation Bill. Other Bills have been cleared for drafting. Four Bills were published after the previous session and before the commencement of the current one.</P>
      <P>There is always a delay in legislation for one reason or another. It is not always the fault of the parliamentary counsel's office. It is not perfect and neither can it be until sufficient competency levels are achieved. The Finance Bill alone takes up the entire time of one person between budget day and the time the Bill is enacted. The Social Welfare Bill takes a substantial amount of time, as has the second regulation Bill of the Central Bank. The Disability Bill 2003 has required a huge amount of drafting and redrafting since September. I have already referred to the directives.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's office is working at something equivalent to the high teens during every session, which is a high number of Bills. I was asked some months ago how this compares to alternative parliaments with far greater resources. Our output is high by comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I hear what the Taoiseach says, but the Finance and Social Welfare Bills are annual occurrences. The pattern is well established. The Department of Finance does most of the preparatory work for the Finance Bill. I do not understand how that might hold up the Government's schedule. The Government said it would publish 22 Bills. Presumably that erred on the side of caution. According to the Taoiseach, only four of the 22 have been produced. That is a poor performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that, while a number of parliamentary draftspersons have been recruited, it will take time because it is a highly skilled task. I understand that, but is there still a problem in the office? What did he mean by his reference to Departments? How many Departments have the capacity to produce the scheme of a Bill up to a certain measure of quality? My understanding <Col N="337" />was that the Office of the Attorney General wanted to keep that function broadly within the office for reasons of uniformity and others. Has that changed and which Departments, for example, come forward with their own Bills?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that the Social Welfare and Finance Bills were affecting this session. I outlined the position over a year. Even though the Department of the Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance do a large amount of work, the parliamentary draftspersons spend several weeks on the Finance Bill every year. The Social Welfare Bill is more straightforward because it means changing the amounts in many cases, not the categories. A large amount of work is involved, in the Finance Bill in particular.</P>
      <P>In at least five or six of the large Departments staff are sufficiently competent to do much of the work. The Attorney General's office would say there is still a large amount of work in trying to achieve uniformity, checking, cross-referencing and so on. While the work carried out in the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance, Social and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform is helpful, the office must still do cross-referencing. Approximately six Departments are involved in that work, which is helpful.</P>
      <P>There is just one vacancy at grade one on the advisory side. All other positions are filled. In the parliamentary section there is one vacancy for a parliamentary counsel and there are vacancies for two parliamentary counsels at grade two. There is also a vacancy for the post of consultant drafter because this person has either left or is about to leave. This will mean a vacancy because we have had a consultant drafter for some time. There is also a legal researcher. This is a very small number compared to the number of vacancies in the Attorney General's office for the past four or five years. It takes time for people to become competent and upgrade their skills. Approximately 15 Bills will have been published in this session. The norm appears to be 15 to 18 Bills, which is a fairly large number. It is probably more than enough in terms of what this House can deal with.</P>

      <P>On the Attorney General's office, I note from the Estimates that the general heads indicate a reduction in funding. The figure given is &euro;13,155,000 but overall there are reductions of up to 56% in funding. The main increase relates to salaries. Is this related directly to benchmarking or will more people be hired? It appears more people will be needed as there will have to be a decision on the EU constitution. Has a set number of barristers been allocated to work on the EU constitution and on bringing Ireland up to date with the backlog in transposing EU directives to which the Taoiseach referred? As recently as last April our backlog was growing faster than every other member state bar Italy, and in July of this year there were almost 50 outstanding EU directives. When the Taoiseach <Col N="338" />claims we will catch up and will be behind to an acceptable level, whatever that means, will extra people be hired to bring this about or will the work be done by the people already employed in the Attorney General's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that there are 123 people employed in the overall office. I have referred to the number of outstanding vacancies, which is small. A competition was held recently in respect of the positions to which I referred. The office is currently in contact with the highest placed candidates with a view to agreeing a starting date. It appears that these people will be employed from 1 January or early in the new year. The remaining posts are filled and there should be little or no vacancies by early in the new year.</P>
      <P>I have given the figures on EU directives. We were in a bad position in this regard at the beginning of the year, but a big effort was made this year by the Attorney General's office, the parliamentary counsel, Departments and a list of outside legal people who were made available to deal with the work. Some of these people were taken up by some of the Departments, which dramatically improved the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General's office has people permanently employed. At least one person was employed during the checking of the work. A legal sub-committee, including an official of the Attorney General's office, worked for the past six months on updating all the existing treaties for inclusion in the new constitution, to ensure the legal work was brought up to date and done in a way that was user-friendly. In Ireland's case the work dated back 30 years through all EU law. Additional people were involved in this work and the Attorney General attended some of the meetings in Brussels. That legal work was completed recently and there is no intention of re-opening it in the final discussions. That work has resulted in consolidation of what has happened in the past 30 years. The main volume of work is now completed and will form part of the EU constitution.</P>

      <P>My question is in the context of the Attorney General's office, which is responsible for the drafting of legislation. This is a significant and important aspect of the drafting of legislation in the first language of our country. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the backlog in the translation of English language texts has been addressed? Have all the aspects necessary to move towards simultaneous publication of Irish and English texted legislation been considered in terms of the recruitment of staff to the Attorney General's office?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information for the Deputy but I will try to get it. Following the court case, it was agreed that the Attorney General's office would deal with the issue. It has been working on the backlog but I cannot give the Deputy a definitive answer. For current work it certainly is in position.</P>
      <P>There have been difficulties in recruiting additional staff with the ability to draft legislation. The existing staff are excellent but this involves extra work. The matter was taken into account in the recent recruitment. I assume the posts being offered will help in this regard. The office is endeavouring to deal with simultaneous translation from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in two issues regarding the appointment of external lawyers by the Attorney General. The first issue relates to criteria and the second to cost. On the question of criteria, I imagine there is a certain amount of pork-barrelling by Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats lawyers in the legal pork-barrel. Are there established guidelines or criteria for candidates being considered for appointment as members of legal teams, representatives at tribunals or otherwise, apart from the legal pork-barrelling? Would it not be wise if such criteria were publicly available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point relates to cost. I am concerned about the enormous bills being run up. If the Government, through the Office of Public Works, were building a cow house there would be a tendering procedure and a competitive figure would result. There appears to be no tendering procedure from the point of view of appointing leading counsel to many of these tribunals and otherwise. Would it be wise to have such a tendering procedure because we are talking about people becoming millionaires out of tri<Col N="340" />bunals? Would we get a better result if we had the criteria for appointments and a tendering procedure whereby, having established the criteria, there would be an invitation to tender on the part of leading barristers so we would get top barristers at the best cost so far as the State is concerned?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the broader issue, the Deputy has a point. It is how it is structured. The Deputy is correct in saying how wealthy people become. It is a problem, and unfortunately I have a fair amount of experience of people being appointed to tribunals and how it operates in all the tribunals. There is a group who are not interested in these positions for the obvious reason. There are those who have been directly involved in cases and are out because of it. One moves into a separate category before getting anywhere. There is also the question of how we deal with it in terms of costs.</P>
      <P>Frankly, if I can so say, and I lead the charge in taking the blame, the way in which we in this House provide for terms of references leaves much to be desired. Given that I propose them I will have to take the blame for much of it as we leave it far too open-ended. We do not give timescales or indicate when we want interim reports, and even when we do we do not follow them up. Deputy O'Keeffe's point is fair. If it was in another area &ndash; a cowhouse, an IT unit or a load of chairs &ndash; there would have been far more transparency. Last week I provided the resources. I am not saying all these people are not worth it or are not doing an excellent job and neither is Deputy O'Keeffe or anyone else. However, under the system we operate that is his point and I will not argue against him because it is a valid point.</P>
      <P>This issue was raised last week as well. We have to look at how we deal with this issue because it is not a question of one tribunal or another, we have many of them. The question is where to go in the modules. The House can deal with that issue. Frankly, the Government cannot deal with it. If I tried to do it, the Deputy knows what would be said and I can understand that political point. The House has a view on that issue, otherwise these tribunals will go on and on. In other areas they will go on and on and the cost is enormous. I have to be honest and say to Deputy O'Keeffe that it is normally a case of trying to get suitable people to take the positions and link in and it is not so easy. In most of the recent vacancies it was not easy to get senior people to move from their present positions.</P>

They are looking at a system which would be more open but not so open-ended. Frankly, in regard to all the tribunals, somewhere along the way this House has to say when it wants the final report and on what modules. One cannot say one wants a final report tomorrow and stop a module in the middle. One has to look at how it opens up because it is costly. Irrespective of what we say, and whatever we say in cross-fire across the House, recently a very senior international figure who referred to major cases taking place in the Soviet Union involving gas, oil and other issues of enormous proportions of resources, in the same breadth asked me how the corruption and fraud investigations were going in Ireland.</P>

Somebody looking at this country from the outside would say the tribunals were set up in 1997 and we are now on the eve of 2004. They will have to be structured. Nobody is talking about closing them down but there is a way of dealing with them. Deputy O'Keeffe's point is that we have to look at these issues and a better way of proceeding. They are matters for the House because the House set them up. It is a fair point and I will not argue politically against a fair point. That is what I am saying.</P>

      <P>In the adjoining jurisdiction the Lord Chancellor is head of the Judiciary and sits as chairman of the Lords and is in the Cabinet. That is at one extreme and certainly that would not be welcome here. Our Attorney General is somewhere near the other extreme because he is adviser to the Government and has been given additional responsibilities by the courts. Presumably, therefore, he accounts to the courts for the exercise of those constitutional duties. In the past, when the Attorney General was a Deputy, as in Declan Costello's time, he took questions in the House. There is a precedent for the Attorney General being directly available and the Accounting Officer at that office appears before the Committee of the Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>In the context of all of this, would the Taoiseach consider a halfway house, not in regard to specific cases because that is hived off to the DPP, where the Attorney General would make himself or herself available to discuss these issues with the relevant committee or committees of the House? Given that a reshuffle is on the way perhaps it is time to appoint a Minister of State at the Office of the Attorney General who could report to the House on these matters. I am not suggesting he or she would get involved in individual cases but on the general principles raised in the interesting discussion this morning.</P>

      <P>The e-Cabinet initiative will deploy modern technologies to assist Departments in the preparation of memoranda for Government and related matters. Among the benefits which the system will deliver will be a secure network for electronic transmission of these records, replacing the existing manual distribution, improved support for interdepartmental consultation on proposals for Cabinet and electronic transmission of Cabinet decisions. Ministers will be able to monitor decisions coming before Cabinet, and use of electronic documents at Cabinet meetings will also be facilitated.</P>
      <P>The implementation of this initiative follows the feasibility study commissioned by my Department from the consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, which identified the scope for significant process improvements through such an initiative. The study identified the substantial potential benefits such a system could deliver when it gave an indicative estimate of costs of the order of &euro;4.1 million, including VAT, for the central element of the project, potentially rising to a figure of the order of &euro;6.75 million, including VAT, taking account of other costs such as security of the structure and costs which might accrue to individual Departments.</P>

      <P>Yes. Has the project gone live? It was to have gone live by September last. This was a specific commitment in the programme for Government for the Department of the Taoiseach. If it has not gone live, will that affect the benchmarking payment to the people involved because this would be a verifiable and identifiable productivity outcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not gone live yet. It is a custom-built application tailored to meet specific complex needs and we did not use outside consultants to do the work. The staff in the information technology unit are doing it which is a significant saving of costs. The length of time it is taking reflects the fact that it is a wide-ranging project which affects all Departments. We must have considerable functionality and ensure that <Col N="344" />from day one we can operate it successfully. It is a major system and a great change because it eliminates the manual distribution of all the Cabinet papers throughout the system. There is a much quicker dissemination of documents in a secure electronic environment.</P>
      <P>I am advised that it is fully secure, but probably many experts have thought about this. However, the developers are, and have been from the outset, extremely conscious of security which was also highlighted in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report. It will enable Departments to manage documents more quickly and efficiently in a secure electronic environment to improve cross-departmental co-ordination of policy proposals and will present issues more effectively to the Cabinet and generally through the system. The archive recording of will be much better because it will be easier to retrieve documents as time goes on. It is a major change in the system that has existed since the foundation of the State and brings us into a top class IT system. Only one other country is at this stage of development so great care is being taken. Training is also involved, not least for Ministers but also, more importantly, for the many working within the system.</P>

      <P>Does this mean that Ministers who are abroad or elsewhere in the country will be able to log into the Cabinet proceedings from laptops? Will that extend to the point where, for example, the Minister for Education and Science might be able to contribute to the Cabinet meeting from Donegal because he can log on to the discussion in real time?</P>
      <P>On a separate point, does the Taoiseach intend to continue having Cabinet meetings throughout the country? There are several communities which would welcome the Taoiseach and the Cabinet to discuss not only the Cabinet agenda but also local matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>This will not happen overnight but Deputy Kenny is right that, in effect, a Minister will be able to attend a Cabinet meeting with his or her disc and can log on from any remote location. Business people operate in this way all the time, as no doubt Deputy Kenny has seen at meetings. Some of the best technology-driven companies are in the west where they can log on to board meetings and connect with people around the world. This will take time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying in one move to go from a very antiquated manual system for the distribution of documents to modern technology. The electronic enabling system will provide a foundation on which, in time, it will be possible to develop further applications and efficiencies. I hope this <Col N="345" />will happen in a relatively short time but certainly by the end of this decade it should be possible for people in remote locations to log on. It has taken only two or maybe two and a half years, to bring this system through. It should be live in 2004 and then people can move into further technologies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall a precedent where it was necessary to reintroduce an order because the Government side did not take up the time allotted to it, as happened in the debate last night. It was extraordinary that the Minister could not speak for the full time and sat down, with no Fianna Fáil Deputy offering to speak. This happened against a backdrop of being told that 40 Fianna Fáil Deputies are greatly concerned about the issue in question. The 40 worried Fianna Fáil backbenchers must have taken a vow of silence. Last night they behaved like Trappist monks. They did not come into the House to take up their time and the Government now proposes to use its superior numbers to encroach on the time of other parties in the House because the Fianna Fáil Deputies simply did not know what to say last night and did not want to come into the House.</P>
      <P>I have never heard of such an event taking place, and for that reason I must oppose the proposal.

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Howlin on Tuesday, 2 December 2003:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">noting the success of Community Employment (CE) as recognised by all parties in this House in:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;providing opportunities for the long-term unemployed to re-enter the labour market,</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;providing useful training and upskilling of long-term unemployed people,</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;providing essential support to community and voluntary organisations to undertake vital work in communities throughout Ireland,</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;believing that there is now majority support within this House for the expansion and development of the Community Employment scheme;</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;approve the creation of an additional 5,000 CE places for next year,</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;instruct the Minister for Finance to arrange for the necessary extra funding.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&nbsp;&ldquo;&ndash;&nbsp;reaffirms that the primary role of community employment is that of an active labour market programme which <Col N="351" />through the provision of work experience and training opportunities can progress disadvantaged persons from a position of long-term unemployment into work in the open economy;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;acknowledges the positive impact community employment schemes have had in disadvantaged communities and recognises that the work and commitment of participants in the scheme has played a significant role in community activity and has been essential to the viability and provision of many voluntary, youth, sporting, disability and many other important services in the community;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the decision of the Government in a more uncertain economic climate to maintain combined participation levels on community employment, jobs initiative and social economy programmes at 2003 levels with no further reductions in numbers envisaged in 2004 as a recognition of the invaluable contribution these programmes make to local communities all around the country and that the substantial level of funding provided for next year reflects this;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;commends the policies of the Government that have resulted in a very low level of unemployment and have, in particular, brought about a substantial reduction in long-term unemployment in recent years;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the review of the CE programme takes place not only in the context of a dynamic labour market, with jobs growth and historically low levels of unemployment being maintained, but at a time when Government has given huge priority to implementing a twin-track strategy of trying to prevent market, with jobs growth and historically low levels of unemployment being maintained, but at a time when Government has given huge priority to implementing a twin-track strategy of trying to prevent long-term unemployment while proactively assisting persons who are long-term unemployed to get jobs;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;recognises the substantial allocation of resources the Government is making available in the Estimates for 2004 for the provision of employment programmes, and notes that this will permit a very high level of activity in 2004 in support of local services and local communities;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;notes with satisfaction that the total allocation for employment pro<Col N="352" />grammes has been fixed at &euro;351 million which will support up to 25,000 places across three employment schemes, that is, community employment, jobs initiative and social economy and will ensure that there will be no reduction in overall participation levels in 2004;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the Government is providing, in addition, some &euro;308 million for training and integration supports, within FÁS, in 2004;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the overall FÁS budget has increased from &euro;605 million in 1997 to &euro;837 million in 2004; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the continuing review of the operation of these schemes to maximise the benefit to participants and to the organisations and committees with which they work.&rdquo;</P>

The Minister of State wanted a headline proclaiming that he was completely in support of community employment schemes. He wanted more to be provided and he was unhappy with the cutbacks.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party's motion, which I commend, calls for an expansion of community employment schemes. To defend its position the Government sends in the very same Minister of State who just last week was finger-wagging the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach on this issue. Is this some form of duplicity?</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that it was demonstrated last week. I ask where are the backbenchers who were queuing up to speak to the media in support of the wayward Minister of State? None of them has come into the House yet and I look forward to seeing them coming to the House to vote this afternoon. It is a case of talking the talk but not walking the walk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has adopted this position because he is far more interested in his own career path and his merc and perks than he is in the poor people of Ireland. The Minister of State regards it as more <Col N="353" />important to continue climbing up the ministerial ladder, stepping on the backs of poor people. I regard that as a lack of backbone, a lack of gumption, on the part of the Minister of State, and it is most unfortunate. If this is what poor James Connolly died for, I do not know what this country is coming to.</P>
    <P>The House has been told how many bricks the Minister of State has built in Galway. It seems he has built more bricks in Galway than some other Members of this House. This House does not need bricklayers but rather Members who will deliver for the people of this State, and that is not happening.</P>

      <P>I will give the House an example of the people who work on the CE schemes which the Minister is choosing to ignore. I know a woman in her late 50s who has successfully reared five children.

      <P>It is important that the House is aware of the people who are being marginalised by the Government's action. A woman who reared her family and participated in a CE scheme managed to learn computer skills probably better than most Members. She pursued a course and obtained a degree in horticulture. She is a grandmother but she is probably younger in age than the average age of Members of this House&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in the number of CE schemes will have a disastrous effect on the efforts to revitalise local communities. The CE schemes help people to progress into the open jobs market. Each one of the employees in the local golf club in Monaghan has graduated <Col N="354" />through community employment schemes and that is real progress. The proposal represents a 40% reduction in what was agreed under the PPF. This is an example of the Government promising something in social partnership. It provides further evidence of the Government's callous indifference to the plight of individuals seeking to acquire these new skills. I am aware of examples across rural Ireland where communities have been greatly enhanced by local employment schemes. Football clubs, church grounds and group homes for those with a learning disability benefit from CE schemes. If the Government persists with a reduction of 8,000 CE schemes, areas of the highest unemployment will suffer most.</P>
      <P>The success of these schemes has stemmed from the enrichment of local areas while enabling persons to acquire new skills. Both the CE schemes and the jobs initiative schemes are being drastically curtailed, denying vital services to the elderly, children, people with disabilities and those formerly on the live register. The Government is eliminating valuable community services for which it will have to pay eventually or accept the political backlash. There is a difference of approximately &euro;24 between the cost of keeping a person on a CE scheme and on unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is shameful for the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties who form the Government that they have identified vulnerable groups engaged in community work, sporting organisations and disability groups on which to enforce their economic policy. Such people have a poor voice and are generally seen by the Government as an easy target. The Government can celebrate in the knowledge that those being hit by its cutbacks are in many cases disabled persons, lone parents or unemployed. The Government is unconcerned that many of those laid off community employment schemes are unlikely to be employed in the open labour market. The Government gives no recognition to the fact that the work being carried out by the schemes under threat are of significant value to towns and villages throughout the country. The Government is unconcerned that sporting, disability and community groups will be seriously affected by the cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, asked that figures be quoted. I would have expected the Minister of State to know what was at issue and to be familiar with the figures. For the information of the Minister of State, I can inform that a vulnerable person laid off a community employment scheme will contribute &euro;24.40 towards balancing the books of Government. For every person taken off a community employment scheme and reverting to the dole, the Government saves &euro;24.40. That is a great day's work by the Government. It has taken on the disadvantaged and extracted &euro;24.40 per person from them. These are the actions of a Government with no social conscience, a Govern<Col N="355" />ment unconcerned with equity in society. Is &euro;24.40 too great a price for the Government to spend to give people a sense of worth and dignity? Is it too much to expend so that disadvantaged communities can benefit from the labour of someone who would otherwise be unemployed? Is it too much to expend to enable voluntary organisations to continue their work? Is it too much to spend on an individual so that groups providing services to the disabled and others can continue their work? The Government's actions declare that &euro;24.40 is too much to pay an individual so that he or she has a reason to get up in the morning, to go out to work, contribute to the community and have a sense of worth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard these cuts as a disgrace. I reject any attempts to wind down, cut back or downgrade these schemes, which have had a significant positive input in providing opportunities for the long-term unemployed to re-enter the labour market and to avail of useful training and upskilling. Their success in the community has been recognised by all parties in this House. They have had a significant influence on society. These schemes should not be facing cutback but rather an additional 5,000 CE places should be created. Now is the opportunity for Ministers and backbenchers to support this motion. It is time to stop blowing hot air and to support CE schemes and the development of the jobs initiative scheme. It is time to move on this matter in today's budget by arranging extra funding. Recent figures showing extra revenue coming into the Exchequer demonstrate that this Government has no economic or social excuse to walk away from these schemes.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the disability sector in its efforts to obtain a continuation of community employment schemes for people with disability and for carers. I am also calling for the removal of current impediments for people with disabilities to return to part-time or full-time employment. These are all sensible proposals and I urge the Government to take my views into account.</P>
      <P>We should all take this opportunity to thank and commend the voluntary sector and community organisations for their positive, valuable and vital contribution to society. Their dedication and hard work is appreciated. It is important to recognise the support that exists in this House for CE schemes and for the voluntary and community sector in general. I urge all Members of the House to support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion which is primarily about the 5,000 community employment places &ndash; that is, 5,000 part-time jobs &ndash; that have already been cut by the Government this year. The Government is trying to ignore that fact but it demonstrates that it cares damn all about disadvantaged communities. The motion is also about the 400 full-time jobs that have been cut from the jobs initiative pro<Col N="356" />gramme so far this year. The Government amendment confirms that the 5,000 CE places cut from the programme have gone for good as far as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are concerned. Anyone who votes for the Government amendment is giving his or her individual approval to the loss of those 5,000 part-time jobs and the 400 jobs initiative programme places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Government is doing. I also wish to refer briefly to the blatant dishonesty and hypocrisy of the contradictions contained in the Government's amendment which, &ldquo;acknowledges the positive impact community employment schemes have had in disadvantaged communities&rdquo;. The Government is acknowledging that impact by cutting 5,000 such jobs this year, in addition to 400 places from the jobs initiative programme. The Government is talking about the invaluable contribution these programmes have made to disadvantaged communities. However, a leaked document from the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, which we obtained earlier this year, shows that the committee set up to tackle social inclusion and introduce such schemes, was intent on phasing out the jobs initiative programme and the social economy programme. It is still not clear what precisely the committee's intentions are for next year concerning both programmes. I feel strongly about this matter because I have first-hand knowledge of it in the areas I represent which, ironically, are also represented by the Taoiseach. I know these schemes have played a vital role and have become part of the fabric of inner city communities and other disadvantaged areas around the country.</P>

      <P>We now need to look at focusing the provision towards communities. There is a need to develop a service to provide community services which undoubtedly need to be developed. I have no doubt that meals on wheels services, community centres and sports complexes need to be underpinned, but not with miserly 19.5 hour jobs. They need to be provided as proper jobs and I expect the Government to provide a restructured scheme to ensure those jobs will be created and that our community, unemployment and child care centres and the meals on wheels services can continue. I see no contradiction in members of the Government party coming in here and calling on their colleagues to do that. After all, the northside four or five, whatever they were called, in the Labour Party at the time created a virtue of that and they did not do too badly as a result. I do not mind if we create positive policies for communities in terms of what we are doing currently.</P>

We have heard a good deal of rhetoric about this and that scheme but this measure came in when unemployment levels were very high.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello should check the live register because since he left it has gone down enormously. This scheme has made a tremendous contribution in terms of people in rural Ireland in particular. People who for generations were totally dependent on welfare got back some dignity by having a job to go to, even if it was only a part-time job. That was the first effect of the scheme. People who were classed as unemployable became eligible for work. Another sector that developed was those who saw it as a scheme to keep themselves on CE and other schemes which supplemented the black economy in which they were involved. There was an amount of that going on, and we cannot deny it.</P>

We all support the idea of community employment schemes and the various schemes operated by FÁS, from apprenticeships right up to qualification, but what everyone here is forgetting is that the FÁS budget is not being cut. FÁS is being given the latitude to deal with this area and spend the funding as it wishes. That is the one fact nobody here will admit. Deputy Howlin shakes his head but it is a fact. Can he show me where the FÁS budget has been cut? It has not been cut and the amount of money being provided for CE and all the other schemes will now be left at the discretion of FÁS. That is important because for too long FÁS people have told every public representative that their hands were tied and that they had no latitude to take the common-sense approach.</P>

There was 17.5% unemployment when the scheme was established. This figure has been reduced to 4.5% and I do not see the Labour Party blowing its trumpet on that.

Difficulties of scale are something the Labour Party should become used to.

      <NameTxt>Ms Sexton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly committed to an effective community employment programme that provides an opportunity for disadvantaged people to reintegrate into the labour market while providing a useful service to their local communities. As an active participant at local level from the beginning of my political career and now as party spokesperson on regional affairs, I have worked hand-in-hand with community-based schemes and have seen the benefits they bring to communities. However, an effective community employment programme cannot operate on the same basis today as it operated in the period of mass unemployment in the mid-1980s. We must recognise the changed circumstances that exist and fashion schemes that meet present needs rather than simply going back to the type of schemes we had when there were well over 100,000 long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate if my fellow parliamentarians would afford me the opportunities that, since I came to this House, I have afforded them and allow me to make what I believe to be a legitimate contribution. Labour Party Deputies will have plenty of time for rebuttal should they require it. I would appreciate the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaeSextonPD" hpid="Ms Sexton Ms Sexton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Sexton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they really do not want us to have our time. We must recognise that in a tighter labour market it is more difficult to rec<Col N="365" />oncile the needs of sponsors and participants and that a consultation process is vital. It is therefore important to review the scheme to agree with sponsors the type of project that can operate effectively even as people progress into the labour market.</P>
      <P>This brings me to my second point. As a result of needs not being met in other ways, community employment schemes have been used to provide people for tasks that should be undertaken on a full-time basis. An obvious example is the provision of personal assistants to people with disabilities. These services should be provided independently of community employment schemes. While I know that because of what happened in education people have reservations about mainstreaming, it is essential that some way is found to fund these activities in a way that provides continuity of service to the people involved.</P>
      <P>We must also recognise that there are people who will not obtain jobs in the open labour market no matter how much training and other help is made available. However, these are not as numerous as some would have us believe. Of the 100,000 long-term unemployed in 1997, almost 80,000 are documented as having returned to the workforce. We need to be careful about assuming whether people are or are not capable if given the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, we need to make provision for people over 55, particularly in rural areas, and those with disabilities who would welcome the opportunity to contribute to their communities without the pretence of being in training. I believe these people can and should be catered for by a form of community employment, linked closely to the RAPID, CLÁR and Leader programmes. I will continue vigorously to argue for these changes, and I am supremely confident that the Government is cognisant of this reality and will, in the short, medium and long-term, address the issue. My fears are for the vulnerable in our communities, particularly those in rural Ireland, and I believe the Government is fully committed to supporting these sections of society in a wide-ranging consultation process.</P>
      <P>I wish to correct the record of the House regarding misleading comments made by Deputy Howlin in last night's debate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Grealish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. I listened to the debate on this motion last night with interest. Let us consider why community employment schemes were initially set up at a time when unemployment ran at 17.5%. The schemes were hugely successful and fulfilled their purpose by training people to re-enter the workforce. The job market that exists today is different. The unemployment rate is now extremely low and the schemes have done great work in rural areas. I think of my own area in Galway. If one drives from Turloughmore, through Lackagh and towards Monivea, one will see how the towns have been revitalised by the works carried out in these schemes. Many of the people that worked on the schemes have returned to the job market and that is the huge success of it. I compliment the Minister who initiated the scheme as it has provided a great amount of work.</P>
      <P>While everybody in this House recognises the enormous benefits the community employment schemes have provided in local communities, the labour market has changed. The scheme was introduced more than ten years ago and must be looked at. I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is going to look at this and hope that something can be put in place which, while reflecting what has happened in the labour market, will look after these schemes, particularly with regard to community centres, schools, local churches, people with disabilities, people who live alone and meals on wheels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Deputy or party can claim a monopoly on this. Community employment schemes have provided useful training and opportunities for the long-term unemployed to re-enter the labour market. Several people I know, who never went outside their door into the local area, benefited greatly and secured jobs from community employment schemes, which is the reason they were set up. This is a credit to a scheme which <Col N="367" />provides essential support to community and voluntary organisations in undertaking vital work in communities. I see at first-hand the significant benefits of the scheme in my constituency, particularly rural areas.</P>
    <P>Like my party colleague, Deputy Sexton, I also recognise that the economic environment is significantly different from the time community employment schemes were introduced when there were more than 100,000 long-term unemployed. Thanks to progressive economic policies, this figure is now much lower and the operators of the community employment schemes need to take account of this, which is what is happening. Given the benefit of community employment to local communities, I am confident the Government will take on board the views expressed by Deputies from all parties, the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties and the Opposition. I hope it will be possible to introduce measures to support the schemes in future.</P>

      <P>From listening to the previous speaker, one would imagine that he intended to vote with the Labour Party on the motion on community employment schemes. I have not heard a single speaker from the Government side state that they are a bad idea. The first meeting I had with a Minister following my election to this Dáil was with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey. The meeting, which was held to discuss the issue of community employment schemes, was attended by all the Deputies from Cork, including Deputy Kelleher, on behalf of the centre for the unemployed on North Main Street in Cork. It took place in September last year soon after the Government had been formed. The Minister of State informed us he planned to undertake a review of the operation of the community employment schemes and agreed that they had assumed a different form from what was originally intended in that they were no longer a market initiative but, to all intents and purposes, a service to communities desperately in need of them. We were happy with the outcome of the meeting and the proposal for a review. As usual, however, the review took well over a year to complete, during which community employment places were consistently cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Morgan, I was surprised and bewildered by a report on TV3 News last week in which a group of women in Galway, who were well prepared as they held up printed rather than hand-written placards and banners, protested about cuts in their community employment scheme. One of them stated they would not be able to remain in work or education due to cuts <Col N="368" />in community employment schemes which would force their crèche and the centre offering their course to close. Towards the end of the report, another woman stated the protest was organised in support of the campaign by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to reverse the cuts. A Deputy mentioned Walt Disney earlier, but on that occasion I felt I had tuned into Channel 16 or a different planet.</P>

      <P>I will give a few examples of the effects of cuts in community employment schemes on the communities Deputy Kelleher and I represent. One of the first adult education courses outside University College Cork was held in the Cathedral Family Centre. It is no longer available because no one is available to open the door, despite the area in question being in a RAPID programme area. The Government is a disgrace cutting schemes in such areas. A gang of four would be a different matter but the gang of 40 on the Government benches does not have the courage of its convictions. These Deputies have a cheek to tell the House they will have decided not to stand by a motion they signed last week. When it was put up to them they did not have the courage of their convictions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the motion. It relates principally to those who are dependent on community employment schemes and it is on this that the House should concentrate. The debate is not about bad tempered exchanges, strokes pulled in any part of my constituency, relative work rates or anything else, but about trust and the bad faith shown with regard to community employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will confine my remarks to discussing the people involved in the schemes, including some whom I met last week. I have been meeting the type of person who has participated in or been dependent on community employment schemes in the poorer areas of Galway city and Galway <Col N="369" />West since 1969. As the Minister of State is aware, I have been around for a long time and while he had success in burying the former Deputy, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, he had no success in my case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, as the Minister of State described how he placed brick upon brick in his constituency, I recalled that his erstwhile colleague regarded these bricks as knives. I will stick, however, to the more important issue of community employment schemes. I have listened to Government Deputies argue that the community employment schemes were never intended for many of the people who are on them. If one accepts this argument, one would then ensure mainstreaming took place before any reduction in numbers.</P>
      <P>To return to our meetings last week with those involved in the centres for independent living, a debate is under way as to the nature of personal assistants and the circumstances and form in which they should be provided. The Minister of State and those members of the Fianna Fáil Party who objected to what has been proposed and imposed, as it was described by the Minister for Finance, would have received our support if they had given a commitment that those dependent on community employment schemes would remain in place until the proposed mainstreaming had been implemented. Instead they have been guilty of bad faith and have broken trust by agreeing to let go of the community employment content and stating there will be an adjustment some time in the future, after the review has been completed.</P>
      <P>They have taken a cynical approach to the need they have professed to support and with which, I accept, they are familiar. This is interesting given that one of the characteristics of the Fianna Fáil Party is its ability to listen to local needs. On the other hand, it has a poor record of opposing a version of the economy which is now causing the greatest possible grief and desolation. To an extent, this version of the economy was reflected in the contributions of members of the Progressive Democrats Party which regards those who work in such schemes or provide social care as not being in the real economy.</P>
      <P>Again, let us stick to facts. The three schemes now being bundled together to produce a gross figure and the fiction that there are no cuts have entirely different types of qualification. They are not the same in terms of conditions, entrance, participation or transition on completion. Community employment is different from FÁS and the social economy programme and it is dishonest to suggest one can roll all three together. Those of us who have been listening to needs on the ground in places such as the centres for independent living I have described will know the difference between the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" />It is a debating trick to claim, as Government Deputies did last night, that most of the cuts are not taking place this year. They took place last year. If one takes last year's cuts and the projected cuts which will arise from this, one can see the full impact on people who depend on such work.</P>
    <P>People should discuss politics in this Chamber, not exchange personal insults. There is a difference between the Government and me on this issue and between me and those in my constituency, such as the Progressive Democrats Member, Deputy Grealish. He subscribes to the idea that there are many cheap jobs which should be filled and that we should drive people out of community care jobs into those because, as was stated, we are in new circumstances or the number in need of such jobs has considerably reduced. I oppose that version of the economy and of society. The suggestion that the idea has been thought out and that, like the old Duke of York, the troops can be led up the mountain on a bogus social campaign against the Minister for Finance and then marched back down again is nonsense and disgraceful and shows bad faith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>A succession of Government speakers have make the argument that community employment schemes are not needed as much in an era of higher employment. I would like to hear the Government Deputies who represent my constituency translate that for the people who live in disadvantaged communities in the areas we represent. In October 2001 there were 2,589 people on the live register at Dún Laoghaire labour exchange. Today that figure is 3,174, which is an increase of more than 22%. The figure at Nutgrove employment exchange increased from 1,543 in October 2001 to 2,146 today, which is an increase of 39%. That means there are 5,320 people unemployed in one of the areas which is considered to be one of the wealthiest in the country. In addition, there are more than 6,000 on lone parent payments, 2,200 on disability payments and 6,000 who depend on social welfare payments. In total, there are 45,000 people living in disadvantaged communities in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county area.</P>
      <P>What has happened to community employment schemes over that period of time? Last year the number on community employment schemes was officially cut to 680. However, they were really cut to 653 because of the way in which the approvals were administered and because of the short time given to the sponsors of the schemes to apply for renewals for the people who were on them. That was cut again this year to 470, which was more than 30%. Can someone on the Government side of the House, who is arguing that community employment schemes are no longer needed, explain why, in an area where unemployment has been rising by on average of approximately 30% over the past two years, community employment schemes have been cut by 30%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" />There may be a change nationally in terms of the employment position, but there has also been a change which no one in Fianna Fáil seems to have acknowledged, namely, in the amount of time spent voluntarily by people in community organisations. The running of community organisations, particularly in poorer communities, such as youth clubs and community crèches or centres, are entirely dependent on community employment schemes. When community employment schemes go out of existence, as they have done, the fabric of those communities is ripped apart. Anyone who saw &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; this week on the behavioural problems of young people, particularly in disadvantaged communities, must ask themselves two questions, what will happen in those communities and, where a community employment scheme goes out of existence or where the numbers and services are cut, how much longer will it take to put back together the fabric of that community and the services on which they depend.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Members, the 40 political pygmies who cannot distinguish between a meeting of their parliamentary party and a meeting of the national Parliament, are turning their backs on disadvantaged communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I have failed to figure out the reasons for the cutbacks in the community employment schemes. Everything about it flies in the face of logic. There is a loss to the community, the individuals who have participated in the schemes and many lone parents in the community. There is also a loss of educational opportunities for some of those people. There is no net financial gain, at best, it is penny-pinching. The people who were on those community schemes will now be thrown back on the live register. The overall financial gain will be minimal. It is nothing more than an absolutely miserable attitude of mind to suggest that there should be cutbacks in CE schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give the House an example of one CE scheme in my constituency. There is a crèche called Small Wonders, which is a community playgroup based in Mater Dei primary school in Basin Lane. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most disadvantaged areas in the community and the constituency. At present, it has 40 children divided into classrooms <Col N="372" />and there is a large waiting list. It had nine CE workers. However, since May of this year it has lost four of these positions due to the cutbacks. One of them was for a one-year rather than a two-year term. FÁS is continuing to state that funding is still not available for these schemes. If that continues, Small Wonders will be reduced to two CE workers by December. If that happens, one of the classrooms will have to close and 20 children will be without child care places. If the grant from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the two senior child care workers is not approved, they will lose their positions at the end of March 2004. If there are only two CE positions left in December, with one to finish in February and the other in June, given that this is the final year, it will be a disaster not only for the children but for the area because the playgroup will have to close. Is there any logic or common sense in doing that to a community?</P>
    <P>I am pleased that my constituency colleague, Deputy Mulcahy, is in the House. He knows exactly what I am talking about. He will be able to support me in my request for the constituency of Dublin South-Central. I also speak for community employment schemes in areas such as Rialto, Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Crumlin where the benefits have been enormous and the people have been given a lift by doing something constructive. It has given dignity back to those people who were unemployed for a long time.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute disgrace that the CE scheme is being cut for those people who are most disadvantaged, vulnerable and at risk. We have had many incidents recently, as highlighted on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and referred to by Deputy Gilmore, and such incidents will continue. The CE schemes provided those communities and the people from those areas with some hope. However, that hope is now being destroyed. I ask this miserable Government to reconsider and stop the nonsense of cutting back CE schemes.</P>

      <P>This will be a short contribution. The allocation for employment schemes in 2004 is &euro;351 million, which will support 25,000 places across the three schemes, namely the community employment scheme, the job initiative scheme and the social economy programme. FÁS has been given responsibility for the management of these financial allocations to maximise the progress in the labour market while facilitating support for community schemes.</P>
      <P>The Estimates provision for 2004 ensures that there will be no further reductions in participation levels during the year, which will allow for both FÁS and the scheme sponsors at local level to have greater certainty when planning which of the services is to be supported.</P>
      <P>The commitment to fund a continuing pool of up to 25,000 places amounts to a significant level of activity at a time when some 44,000 work permits have been issued to employers in 2003, to date, in respect of what are generally low-skilled and unskilled personnel from overseas. More than 23,000 of these were renewals of existing permits.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that CE schemes were originally conceived as an active labour market measure intended to assist the long-term unemployed back to work in the labour market. The present situation, with the review of the community employment schemes, is something I welcome. The community employment programme is under review and an overall appraisal of the labour market is being carried out. The report is expected before Christmas this year.</P>
      <P>There is an area on which I would like the Government to focus, namely, those over 55. I hope the review committee will do this. These may be people who have participated in CE schemes for years and still did not find full-time employment. There should be a scheme in place where these people would become part of a long-term community support framework and gain employment in their communities where they would have an active and fulfilling role to play. I hope that section of the community is supported. The Government has already placed 7,000 to 8,000 people in mainstream education.</P>

      <P>I listened to the various contributions <Col N="375" />with interest last night and today. I am disappointed that Opposition speeches in general have confined themselves to the matter of the volume of community employment activity and have not shown concern about the priorities for services provision in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Substantial resources have been allocated in the Estimates for 2004 for employment programmes. The total allocation for employment schemes is &euro;351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places. This allocation is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003. There will be no reduction in the level of provision for the schemes or in the combined participation levels next year.</P>
      <P>The commitment to fund a continuing pool of up to 25,000 places not only brings clarity to the levels of activity which will be supported, it will enable FÁS to give a clear commitment to the support of local community services over an agreed period. Community employment was established as a scheme to help the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups towards gainful employment. It has, for a variety of reasons, broadened its focus to include the development and resourcing of community services. CE has made a valuable contribution in carrying out both these roles, and recommendations for the future must provide for both.</P>
      <P>There will be a warm welcome in local communities for the Government guarantee of funding for up to 25,000 employment places in 2004, of which not less than 20,000 will relate to CE. The Government's decision goes a long way towards meeting the demands from such communities in recent years that there would not be arbitrary cuts in CE and that uncertainty about participation levels and future funding would be removed. The fact that these needs have been met will soon become apparent to the Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>It is undoubtedly true that there has not been the desire to progress from CE to the open market by participants. This has happened at a time of unprecedented demand for labour, including semi-skilled and low-skilled labour, by employers. For example, my Department issued 6,000 work permits in 1999 and, as the Deputies are well aware, this has grown to 47,000 permits by the end of 2003.</P>

Future participants in a restructured CE programme would benefit from a more focused engagement than that provided by the existing part-time engagement which may not be the most conducive to their successful progression to employment in the local labour market.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that people in areas such as the health service and child care, etc. would lose out in this change. As the Minister has said, all health service-related CE projects, including those providing services for persons with disabilities, have been ring-fenced against reductions that have taken place as a result of reducing the CE programme to 20,000 places by the end of 2003. Other services ring-fenced against reductions include drug task force activity and child care service provisions. Services in RAPID areas are given priority.</P>

When the various reviews are completed in coming weeks, there will need to be a greater degree of flexibility at local level, whereby FÁS and local communities can identify and agree on local priorities which might be supported by CE participants. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party motion advocates reversing cuts in the number of community employment places and approving the creation of an additional 5,000 places for next year. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, should take note. I am glad Deputy Kelleher has come to hear me, because the cuts in Cork city mean that Fianna Fáil has taken over the electoral areas of Millstreet, Kanturk and Fermoy in north Cork. That means that the Government has already cut the number of CE places in Cork city and consequently has taken those areas of north Cork.</P>

      <P>As politicians we are well aware of the impact of the cutbacks in the community employment scheme on communities both rural and urban. The reduction in participants in the scheme is having a devastating effect on the work of community-based voluntary organisations which provide child care and cater for the needs of those with disabilities and the elderly. It is also affecting community centres, arts groups and local sporting organisations.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Glennon, will be aware that because of ring-fencing, there has been a 40% reduction in the availability of community employment schemes in our constituency. This year the number of places was reduced by 4,000 to 5,000. Furthermore, a significant change in the criteria for eligibility for the scheme has resulted in many people aged 50 and over, who have no prospect of permanent employment, being left on the scrap heap for the sake of &euro;24 per week. This is discrimination based on age. For the sake of &euro;24 the Government is depriving those people of the dignity to which they are entitled.</P>

They have at long last realised the implications of their actions in voting for these vicious cuts in the House over the past two years. This hypocrisy reached new heights when the Minister himself organised a rent-a-crowd protest, which included <Col N="378" />many of his own cumann members, as a face-saving exercise. He tried to convince people that the cuts were not his fault but that of the Minister for Finance and suggested taking on the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues on this side of the House who supported a motion for decency and fairness which was promoted by Deputy Howlin on behalf of the Labour Party. We must defend the people who do not have the means of defending themselves. I thank Deputies for their contributions and note there is a large measure of agreement. For example, there is agreement on the value and merit of the community employment scheme and the damage being done by the cumulative effect of the cuts to the scheme. There was agreement about the hardship imposed on people such as those in my own constituency who were made redundant this morning. They are being let go less than three weeks from Christmas. Like my colleagues, I would like to have the time to deal with some individual cases. I would like to explain how the hearts have been torn out of some disadvantaged communities by the impact of these cuts, but time does not permit.</P>
      <P>The things that have been said about certain areas being ring-fenced are not true. During Question Time a few weeks ago I was obliged to raise the question of a community drugs treatment project in my own constituency, Jobstown Against Drug Dependency, which lost its CE people. It turned out the sponsor of the scheme was the county council so the scheme was not protected by ring-fencing. Since I raised the matter in the House the Taoiseach has given authorisation for those places to be restored, but the fact is that even ring-fenced areas have been affected by the cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" />I am glad that the self-professed intellectual wing of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Mulcahy, drew my attention to the RAPID programme, because it is important to see this motion in the context of what the modern-day Fianna Fáil is doing to the disadvantaged in our society. The Labour Party has not only been highlighting in the House the &euro;58 million cuts in social welfare but also the RAPID programme. The media still do not understand it, but 18 months before the general election the nice former Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, in whose mouth butter would not melt, came out with the Taoiseach to launch a &euro;2 billion transfer of resources to the most disadvantaged areas in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing has happened since. The one debate I heard on this matter on the radio focused on the assertion of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, whom I can never understand, that &euro;5 million had been spent and the interviewer concentrated on whether that was so. It was a &euro;2 billion programme &ndash; the &euro;5 million was spent on recruiting people before the election to devise plans under the RAPID programme, although since they were devised and submitted none of them has been funded. That is the kind of deception that is going on. That is the kind of treatment and betrayal of these areas that is being perpetrated by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, told us last week that this was a defining issue for Fianna Fáil. He said that if Fianna Fáil was to retain its left-of-centre image it must reverse these cuts. He spent the last 24 hours trying to tell us there are no cuts. What is one supposed to make of a person in ministerial office who says last week that it is a matter that he has to challenge the Minister for Finance on and this week asserts that there are no cuts and never were any? He came into the House last night and we got a little bit of history and self-flagellation, a bit of an attack on the Labour Party&mdash;</P>

These are the rebels in retreat. Before I forget, I must refer to Deputy Sexton, whom I have always taken at face value as a decent Member of the House. I was flabbergasted by her contribution. It is not that Gene McKenna misquoted her as she said. I saw her on television slap down Deputy Fiona O'Malley, who can be excused as she does not know too much about CE schemes. Deputy Sexton does and she said she was utterly opposed to the cuts brought in by Government. She comes in today and says the opposite. More seriously, she says that anyway many of these jobs should not be CE. She instanced personal assistants for people with disabilities. She said she wants mainstreaming.</P>
      <P>What have we got so far? We have got flexibility and mainstreaming. On the Cabinet memorandum referred to by Deputy Howlin, let me draw Deputy Sexton's attention to this conclusion on page 4 which states: &ldquo;In the light of the experience of mainstreaming in the education sector, it has been decided not to pursue mainstreaming in the health related areas of CE.&rdquo; That is the fact of the matter. She is giving an entirely disingenuous impression that people should not worry about the CE schemes, that the Government is going to mainstream and that her &ldquo;personal favourite&rdquo; is people with disabilities who should all have personal assistants. That theme has been running right through the contributions from the Government benches. The story is about 40,000 to 46,000 work permits. What is the connection? The connection is that CEs are not real jobs.</P>

Schemes have been amalgamated and people have lost their jobs despite the immensely valuable work done in communities that otherwise would not possess the vitality they have in terms of organisations to do with women's groups, self-help and artistic circles, the administration of community centres and so on. That is a great pity, because it is an absolute shame at a time when the finances do not merit it that a scheme which has become such a useful tool for various forms of community activity should be undermined in this fashion by a Fianna Fáil Party that has grown far from its roots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have placed a very high priority on improving Ireland's animal identification and traceability systems and I am determined to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control, and remains at the forefront of consumer <Col N="387" />assurance and food safety in this area. In the wake of the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 and against a backdrop of earlier unsuccessful efforts in this regard, I introduced a comprehensive individual sheep identification system known as the national sheep identification system, NSIS, which provides full individual identification and traceability of sheep from farm of origin to carcase and is designed to be multi-functional, facilitating aspects such as flock management, consumer assurance and disease monitoring and control.</P>
      <P>The foot and mouth disease crisis underscored the potential damage to which our economy and the agriculture sector is exposed in the event of serious disease outbreaks where shortcomings exist in animal identification and traceability. Based on monitoring of the sheep identification system and feedback to my Department from various quarters since 2001, I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are now firmly embedded across the sheep sector and working well. I have, however, made it consistently clear that I am always willing to enhance and improve NSIS and to address any operational difficulties which might arise, while maintaining its key components.</P>
      <P>A new harmonised system of sheep identification for the whole of the European Union has been proposed by the European Commission. The current proposals provide that there will be electronic individual identification of sheep from January 2008, together with a central movement database, recording movements on a batch basis. The implementation date is subject to review following a Commission report in 2006. For the interim period it is proposed that all sheep be double-tagged and identified individually, but that all recording would be on a flock basis. It is anticipated that the final form of the proposal, on which the Italian Presidency is working to bring before the December Council of Agriculture Ministers, will afford member states which already have systems in place offering a higher level of traceability than would be the case under the interim period system the option of retaining their own systems until the advent of electronic identification in a few years from now.</P>
      <P>I support the broad principle which underlies these proposals. In particular, it is necessary to have in place a robust, harmonised system of sheep identification backed up with good record-keeping allowing full traceability of animal movements at all times. I have always been in favour of making use of new and efficient technologies to achieve this end, subject of course to practicalities and cost-effectiveness, and I am very anxious that Ireland and other member states are in a position to move at the earliest possible date to an electronic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>In the interim, the system now in place and operating throughout the Irish sheep sector will <Col N="388" />continue to afford Ireland the level of protection and assurance in relation to both identification and traceability which is strategically appropriate to this country having regard in particular to the difficulties encountered during the foot and mouth crisis. I have no plans therefore to dismantle NSIS and roll back the progress which has been made in this area since 2001, which would see Irish sheep farmers, marts, meat processors etc. being asked in a few years from now to once again reinstate and accommodate individual identification and traceability by the 2008 target date for the introduction of electronic systems. However, as I stated earlier, I am willing to examine and address aspects relating to the operation of NSIS in so far as these are addressed within the community system that is put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and will ask him a few questions. In effect he has said that the Government has no proposals to change the current system and will simply go along with what the European Commission has proposed. I understand &ndash; if I am incorrect the Minister of State may let me know &ndash; that we have not outlined our position to the Commission. If we have, and the situation is as the Minister of State has outlined, does he agree that it flies in the face of the commitment given by the Government in Sustaining Progress that it would review the current situation, a commitment given in light of the representations from the many farm groups in touch with the Government, outlining the unnecessary bureaucracy in the current system? Does the Minister of State agree it is of no advantage to traceability to have an individual tag rather than a flock tag? Does he agree this additional work is putting Ireland at a disadvantage relative to other EU and non-EU countries in that this is only an animal disease measure and has no impact whatsoever on consumer confidence? Will the Minister of State confirm that a vote on this issue may take place on 16 December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>On Sustaining Progress, we have regularly been in touch with the farming organisations, even as recently as yesterday. The contents of today's reply to this question were also discussed with the IFA members present yesterday. We have set out our position and they will return with certain proposals as a result of yesterday's meeting.</P>
      <P>An agreement could of course have been made some years ago, but that did not happen because of intransigence on the part of some of the farming organisations. As a result we had an outbreak of foot and mouth disease and the new regime was put in place with an eye to the markets. It is no great source of joy for the Department to have to impose regulations but the export market is very important, which is why the new regime was put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Timmins asked if the Government made this decision on its own. The Government <Col N="389" />was in communication with the European Commission, and I travelled to meet Mr. Byrne some weeks ago when this matter was on the agenda. We outlined our position to him and it is widely accepted, and will be agreed, that countries like ours, whose systems are ahead of the systems now being proposed at European Union level, will be allowed to operate our own schemes.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the regime has not come in under diktat. There was full consultation with the farming organisations. We met them as recently as yesterday &ndash; we meet them on an ongoing basis. They have to report back on the basis of the information given yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that since 2001, the number of farmers engaged in sheep production has decreased by 15% and that ewe numbers have fallen by 14%? While he mentions the importance of the sheep industry, with which I agree, this situation is a clear indication that the system we have at the moment is impacting negatively on our economy in terms of a 15% drop in sheepmeat production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all the more surprising given that the numbers involved have dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>To try to tie the reduction of the numbers of sheep in the country to the single identification system is not correct. The Deputy will be aware of the reconciliation problems of last year and we took care of those problems. No matter which scheme we operate there will be room for improvement. In consultation with our partners, the farming organisations, we intend to improve.</P>
      <P>We can be very proud of the scheme. I would hate to think we would step backwards and have to make a huge jump forward in 2008. It is important that we do so on a phased basis. That is what we are doing with the interest of farmers at heart.</P>

      <Quest>if milk or meat from animals on a farm (details supplied) in County Tipperary were subjected to safety or toxicity testing; if animal feeding trials were carried out; if such tests were requested by his Department; if so, if the tests were carried out; the results which are available for such tests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of public agencies had investigated different aspects of complaints from the Ballydine area of County Tipperary when, on 25 March 1983, the then Government decided that the Minister for Labour should co-ordinate with <Col N="390" />the Ministers for Health, Industry and Energy, Agriculture and the Environment in consideration of certain questions of factory safety and the environment in relation to a pharmaceutical plant at Ballydine. An interdepartmental group was established to this end. This resulted in the submission of a report to the Cabinet by the then Minister for Labour in July 1983.</P>
      <P>The investigation of the problems on the farm in question by the Department of Agriculture encountered reluctance on the part of the farmer to provide either veterinary details of farm animals or full access to the farm animals and samples, even though the Department repeatedly requested this access. The farmer eventually invited the Department and his own experts onto his farm in September 1983 to take samples, jointly with his own experts, from animals that he was slaughtering on his farm on that day. Samples were obtained for biochemical, toxicological, serological and haematological examination. The necropsy findings were common animal diseases, for example, reinfection hoose (parasitism), chronic pericarditis, abscessation and traumatic reticulitis, that is, a piece of swallowed metal had punctured a stomach.</P>
      <P>Examinations of the appropriate sample of serum, fat and other tissues failed to reveal any significant toxic inorganic agent such as mercury, cadmium, fluoride or bromide, or mycotoxins. Organic toxic agents were either absent or at background levels.</P>
      <P>Samples of milk from the farm were analysed for a range of contaminants. Of these compounds only trace amounts, 0.1 parts per millilitre, of &ndash; I will need Dr. Upton's help for this substance &ndash; octachloro dibenzodioxins, a contaminant in a common wood preservative, probably creosote, were detected.</P>
      <P>In the absence of any obvious toxic agents in samples from the farm, it was deemed to be inappropriate for the Department to carry out any animal feeding trials. Furthermore, there was no information to hand suggesting that any produce from this farm was of unacceptable quality or unsafe for human consumption. As the Deputy will be aware, the position in the 1980s was that farm produce was generally subject to food hygiene controls at the processing intake points such as creameries, slaughterhouses and meat processing plants. This remains the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>On occasion I regret being a scientist because I am expected to have wonderful scientific knowledge and I would like to be removed from that role sometimes.</P>
      <P>What criteria would prompt the Department to be concerned about human and animal health? Under what circumstances would it be considered appropriate to take produce to be consumed by humans and investigate it in animal feeding trials by feeding it to experimental animals such as rats or mice, observing the effects of that feeding over a period of generations on those animals and correlating them with the implications for human health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" />I understood the Minister to say that no samples were taken for such testing and that no such tests were required. Can the Minister confirm my understanding?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This episode occurred 20 years ago. Detailed tests were carried out and only very common diseases, such as hoose, were found to exist. Following discussions with local processors the Department concluded that there was no evidence to link emissions from the Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme plant to the reported animal health problems on the farm. There was considerable evidence that other reported problems on the farm arose from ordinary animal husbandry neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court found against Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme in this case. There must, therefore, have been some considerable concerns. It is unlikely that the Supreme Court would have found in favour of the farmer and against the pharmaceutical company unless there was substantial evidence to support that finding.</P>
      <P>Against that background and following recent events in Askeaton, I put my question again. Why were no animal feeding trials carried out on produce? Human health must be a priority and it must first be established whether or not animal produce had a role in causing human illness. The question is not one of hygiene or of whether test results were positive or negative. The question is what tests were not done or not sought. In the case of the Ballydine incident, were the tests sought, were they carried out and are results available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was thoroughly examined under the chairmanship of the then Minister for Labour, who co-ordinated investigations by the Departments of Health, Agriculture, Industry and Energy and the Environment. Over a period of 18 months the Department of Agriculture veterinary research laboratory examined a wide range of specimens from the farm. This was followed by an extensive investigation by the Department's pesticide unit which included an evaluation of the earlier studies commissioned by Tipperary South Riding County Council and carried out by An Foras Forbartha, an Foras Talúntais and Trinity College. Neither the laboratory nor the unit's report of October 1982 found a link with operations at the chemical plant although the possibility of yet unidentified and undetected emissions causing the problem was not ruled out. The possibility was raised that factors internal to the farm, that is, management practices and animal husbandry, might be the major cause of the difficulties.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the plans he has to direct payments in the future through the rural development pillar of the CAP and through national envelopes to farmers that farm in a sustainable manner, deliver biodiversity landscape and other environmental benefits and provide the basis for the sustainable development of rural communities.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29350/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The current CAP rural development plan runs until 2006. The rural environment protection scheme is an integral part of that plan. I have presented proposals to the Commission to significantly revise and simplify this scheme. The proposed changes to the scheme will underpin and enhance its environmental impact and increase its attractiveness to potential participants. The changes will include a standardised plan and more use of the iMAP database so as to reduce planning costs to farmers. I have, in this context, also made provision for substantially increased spending on REPS in the Abridged Estimates for 2004.</P>
      <P>I am also introducing changes to the farm waste management scheme that will enhance its environmental orientation and increase participation. Here again, I am awaiting Commission agreement to changes in the scheme and have provided for increased spending on this scheme in the 2004 Estimates.</P>
      <P>As regards the post-2006 situation, the debate on future EU rural development policy is still at an early stage. It will, however, intensify in the coming months. For example, at a recent EU conference, attended by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the need to ensure that environmentally oriented measures are an integral part of the new policy was stressed. I am confident that this will be the case and that there will continue to be a strong emphasis on biodiversity and other environmental benefits in future rural development policy.</P>
      <P>I should also point out, of course, that the new single farm payment system that I will be introducing in 2005 contains provisions that farmers comply with desirable environmental and other requirements. A main thrust of the mid-term review was the encouragement of sustainable farming practices. We shall also ensure that the &euro;34 million available under modulation will be used to enhance sustainable quality production.</P>
      <P>Arising from the changes that I am proposing to REPS and the farm waste management scheme and following on the introduction of the single farm payment system, Irish farming will have a strong environmentally friendly base on which to enhance our reputation as a high quality consumer oriented food producing country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Many organisations are now agreed that there are benefits in terms of focusing on the market and benefits in terms of decoupling and removing the incentive to bring semi-natural habitats such as wet meadows into intensive production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" />Does the Minister recognise that there are certain types of farming practice that need to be actively encouraged in the interests of the environment? I have in mind mixed farming and cereal production which is vital for certain species such as the yellowhammer and others. Organisations such as BirdWatch Ireland have made the point that it is not just a matter of decoupling and hoping for the best but rather looking out for the best interests of farmers who want to help the environment.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister recognise that the new agreement was somewhat of a disappointment to many with that concern? Much of the payment will come from the rural development pillar. It was envisaged that there would be a payment of 20% in total from CAP whereas only 5% was achieved. Does the Minister agree that there is a need to do more than just decouple and hope for the best in terms of REPS? Whether or not farmers are in the REP scheme, there is a need to encourage some incentivisation of farmers who recognise that certain types of farming are beneficial to different environmental objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that decoupling will be a positive matter for Irish farming and for the Irish countryside. It would be nice to return to the old mixed farming system that I grew up with&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;where the farmyard was a hive of activity. Not only had we yellowhammers but also baby wagtails, robins, thrushes, wrens and a whole range of wildlife. Regrettably that has disappeared to a large extent. Mixed farming has discontinued, by and large, to be replaced by concentrated, specialist farming which has to be the case in a competitive European Union market and against international competitors. I do not see why commercial, professional farming cannot be in harmony with wildlife.</P>
      <P>Under the new REP scheme, there was a degree of hilarity at the idea of bird boxes. Many sensible commercial farmers have no difficulty with the use of bird boxes. It enhances the farmyard and the farmhouse very much. In association with REPS I would like to see wet areas, broadleaf developments and landscaping. There is no reason why such measures cannot exist alongside good commercial farming practice.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether the Minister is preparing to accept the demise of a certain amount of biodiversity or whether he is saying that it is possible to retain biodiversity. He said he liked the idea of having yellowhammers in the past but I do not know if he means in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that the rural development pillar of the CAP has a role in providing incentives which would ensure a certain amount of biodiversity in farming? I am not saying it is possible to do it like it was done in the <Col N="394" />past; I am simply saying that based on modern scientific knowledge and information on biodiversity it should be possible to integrate a level of incentive for biodiversity in farming. As the Minister correctly stated, there are many farmers interested in that matter. Can the Minister envisage the rural development pillar being used for that and not just relying on REPS, which has a limited appeal in the case of many farmers? Margins are too tight in the horticultural area.</P>

      <P>I reiterate that I see no difficulty with commercial farming in the future having and allowing for biodiversity. REPS is greatly enhanced in the future, both in the rates of REPS payments and in the overall allocation. There will be the rural development pillar and the modulated funds which we can earmark for sustainable quality production. Many people are interested in biodiversity and wildlife generally and there is a greater appreciation of the importance of agri-tourism in rural areas. Unfortunately with regard to the yellowhammer and the corncrake and other birds, I hope things have not gone too far in the wrong direction.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>his plans for implementation of the new decoupling payment system; when farmers will be notified of their entitlements; the way in which the appeals system will operate; and the way in which hardship cases will be dealt with.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29352/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have already decided that all direct payments for cattle, sheep, dairying and arable crops will be fully decoupled from production as and from 1 January 2005. I made my decision on full decoupling well ahead of the effective date of 1 January 2005 to enable farmers and the markets to adjust and to plan ahead.</P>
      <P>While the European Commission's detailed rules on decoupling have not yet been agreed I have arranged that my Department should commence the task of establishing entitlements for every individual farmer in the country. In this context I have set up a steering group to oversee the overall implementation of the mid-term review agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has also set up working groups to examine the various aspects of the agreement and the IT and other resources essential for its implementation. It is my intention that the Department shall establish single payment entitlements for each farmer and notify those entitlements to individual farmers during 2004. It will not be possible to finalise this work until such time as the Commission's detailed rules are fully <Col N="395" />agreed and it is unlikely that final agreement on the detailed rules will be reached before April 2004.</P>
    <P>In so far as hardship case are concerned, the single payment will be based on the average number of animals, or the average number of hectares in the case of arable aid, determined under the livestock premia and arable aid schemes in respect of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The Council regulation provides that a farmer whose production was adversely affected during the reference period by a case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances occurring before or during the reference period shall be entitled to request that the reference amount be calculated on the basis of the calendar year or years in the reference period not affected by the case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances. If the whole of the reference period was affected by the case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances, the reference amount shall be calculated on the basis of 1997 to 1999, inclusive.</P>
    <P>An advertisement will be published shortly in the national and provincial newspapers inviting farmers who are of the opinion that their farming enterprise during the reference period was adversely affected by <i>force majeure</i> to make application to my Department to have their case considered. Application forms to facilitate the processing of such cases will be available at all local offices of my Department. Where farmers who apply for <i>force majeure</i> are not satisfied with my Department's decision on their application there will be a facility to allow such farmers to have their case determined by an independent appeals mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information contained in his answer. There are still many questions. There is no issue more important to farmers than those payments. As the Minister stated, they are set for a number of years. The Minister stated that he will place an advertisement in the newpapers asking farmers to submit their queries. When they do not know what entitlements they may have for the different years, I cannot understand how they can submit an appeal. That matter needs to be clarified. It is not good enough to say that they will be told about their entitlements sometime in 2004. Every effort should be made to assist people who are concerned about these sensitive matters upon which their bank repayments and livelihoods will depend. Given the way in which the Department works, it will probably be late next year when we have an answer. Resources should be put in place to provide information for people on their entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the concern expressed by Deputy Hayes on this matter, which is very important. The entitlements that will be set next year will continue for the following decade so they had better be right. We have two choices, wait until the detailed rules are published in April next year and then get to work on it or, alternatively, establish a steering group and an IT group, which is what I am doing now. In addition, we will be placing newspaper advertisements over the next few days asking people to contact the Department if a <i>force majeure</i> arose during the relevant years. That preliminary work is important and it is fairly straightforward. The <i>force majeure</i> definition includes the death of a farmer during the relevant years; long-term professional incapacity of a farmer; a severe natural disaster gravely affecting the holding's agricultural land; the accidental destruction of livestock on the holding; or a disease affecting part of the farm's livestock, such as when we had the foot and mouth outbreak. People who feel they are in such a position can contact the Department.</P>
      <P>If, on a preliminary examination, a basis to the claim is found, due cognisance will be given to it. If agreement cannot be reached an appeals body will be established so that people will receive equitable and fair treatment. We have only one year in which to do this because the scheme will come into effect on 1 January 2005 so we had better start working on it straight away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>Does the Minister envisage that all payments that have been made available in the past, particularly milk quotas, may become tradable, so that one could sell them on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme will not commence until 2005 so we will have to see how matters measure up. We have not yet received the detailed rules so there is some constraint in being absolutely certain about how the matter will pan out. There will be a review after about two years for any teething troubles that may occur. Following widespread consultation in public meetings with farmers, farming organisations, Teagasc and factory examinations, I believe that decoupling, single farm payments and producing for the marketplace will be in the best interests of Irish farming in future.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which his Department's allocation in the Estimates for 2004 will be spent.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29527/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Abridged Book of Estimates for 2004, which was published recently, provides for gross and net allocations of &euro;1.39 billion and &euro;935.1 million, respectively, to the Department of <Col N="397" />Agriculture and Food. The gross Estimate includes a sum of approximately &euro;108 million for forestry, responsibility which will transfer to my Department. The gross allocation for 2004 is &euro;62.2 million, or 5% higher than the corresponding 2003 figure. However, when account is taken of the reduced expenditure requirements related to BSE in 2004 arising from the improved disease situation, the gross expenditure provision for my Department for 2004 is approximately 8% higher than in 2003.</P>
      <P>The increased Exchequer funding, when considered alongside the expenditure of a further &euro;1.6 billion on EU-funded agricultural measures, including direct payments to farmers, will bring total expenditure by my Department to approximately &euro;3 billion in 2004.</P>
      <P>The expenditure provision for my Department will be used principally to promote environmentally friendly and sustainable farming as well as a consumer-oriented food industry, to prevent the spread of disease and to facilitate the transition to the single payment system arising from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The allocation for the REPS next year is &euro;260 million, which is up &euro;70 million, or 37%, on 2003 and provides for a 28% increase in average payments. This will facilitate a significant increase in the number of participants in the scheme in 2004.</P>
      <P>The provision for compensatory payments in the disadvantaged areas, which are linked to compliance with good agriculture practices, is &euro;231.5 million. The allocation for on-farm investments, notably farm waste management, is approximately &euro;52 million or 70% up on this year's levels.</P>
      <P>Funding for forestry next year has been increased by 31% to &euro;108 million. This will fund up to 12,000 hectares of planting next year and provide funding for ancillary activities, such as forest roads and research.</P>
      <P>These allocations reflect the Government's commitment to further enhancing environmentally friendly farming practices as outlined in the partnership agreement Sustaining Progress.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>The provision for food safety, animal health and welfare is approximately &euro;191 million for 2004. This is 26% lower than this year's allocation but this reflects positive developments in the BSE situation and not any diminution in the Department's efforts in these areas. The improvement in the disease situation is most welcome and is important for the future development of the industry.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the 2004 allocation provides appropriate resources for the schemes and programmes operated by my Department to enable it to continue to provide a high quality service to the agriculture, forestry and food sectors in 2004.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response. Would he agree that research consti<Col N="398" />tutes one of the main shortfalls in the 2004 provisions for the Department? This shortfall will ensure that vital facilities, such as the Teagasc centre in Ballinamore, will continue to be lost. We have seen the repercussions from last year's shortfall, which resulted in fewer facilities being provided to the farming community by Teagasc. Will the Minister comment on the loss of the Ballinamore Teagasc office, given the all-Ireland dimension of its geographical position? Would he agree that funding for the Department needs to be radically improved and redirected to meet the challenges presented by current reform of the CAP? I welcome the decoupling elements of the reform package but the Minister should ensure that the necessary funding is made available to shape a new strategy for Irish agriculture. That would allow farmers to make the most of the new regime, as well as contributing towards substantial investment both for marketing and research, as well as programmes to facilitate change in land use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantial increase in the investments for next year over last year across a wide range of areas. That is being done to ensure that Ireland remains competitive in the enlarged EU Single Market and having regard to increased international competition through the World Trade Organisation. Similar funding is being made available for current spending by Teagasc in 2004. However, there will be a carryover to next year of capital from the sale of some of its assets this year, which it will be free to use in line with decisions of the Teagasc authority. Last year, Teagasc had to streamline some of its activities, including the famous centre in Ballinamore, County Leitrim. It is in the best interests of Teagasc, but more particularly farmers, that they should have streamlined research and advice from Teagasc.</P>
      <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland provides substantial funding for in-house research and development in food plants. The universities have a substantial budget for research and development in food, some of which comes from the Science Foundation. A few weeks ago, I visited the food faculty at University College, Cork, when additional funding of &euro;21 million was provided by the Science Foundation into research, together with the university's medical faculty. I accept the Deputy's point that it is essential that Ireland puts the maximum effort into marketing, market research and support for its primary industry going into the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have a direct role in determining the prevailing prices charged for food products on the retail market. In the European Union Single Market, food products are traded freely and Governments do not have the authority to set the levels of mark-up at different stages of processing and sale.</P>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is alluding to the recent report jointly commissioned by RGDATA, IBEC and the grocery wholesalers organisation, IADT, which found that the main influences on increasing food prices, albeit increasing at less than the rate of inflation, were processing and distribution costs and exchange rate fluctuations rather than farm gate prices.</P>
      <P>The food sector has adapted to changing consumer preferences brought about in the main by changes in lifestyle and eating patterns. The product which leaves the farm gate does not simply appear on the retail shelf. Continual change in consumer demands has driven the increase in ready to go meals, prepared foods and a range of end products which are much more extensive than were available 20 years ago. A huge range of choice is available to the consumer in prepared foods, meat and dairy products, farmhouse cheeses, preserves, craft beers and confectionery.</P>
      <P>The report also highlights the importance of the sector as the largest employer in Ireland, accounting for some 135,000 jobs in manufacturing, distribution and retailing. Given the national importance of the food and drinks industry to the producer as well as to the consumer, it is vital that it is well placed to compete effectively in an increasingly global marketplace. The food sector's challenges are those of economic success.</P>
      <P>Significant funding has been and is being provided to the food sector under the national development plan to improve competitiveness, market orientation and innovative capability. These initiatives cover capital investment, marketing, promotion and research measures and are expected to increase sales of food and drink products by &euro;2.5 billion by the end of 2006. One of the main reasons for the existence of these measures is to provide farmers with a ready market for their produce and in many cases, for example, co-operatives, to strengthen the marketing capability of producers.</P>
      <P>The retail channel represents the most important route to market for Irish producers. Our Department, in co-operation with the relevant State agencies, has consistently assisted the food industry to establish new markets for Irish food produce and to consolidate our presence in existing markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A growing area of importance for some producers is that of direct marketing to consumers &ndash; farmers' markets. Farmers' markets continue <Col N="400" />to grow in popularity and now operate under various arrangements in 22 locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i>Such local markets give producers an opportunity to sell directly to local consumers and to test-market varieties of product.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia, under the aegis of our Department, has identified the importance of this as a route to market for small food producers. Its web-based guide, Pioneering Routes to Market, identifies the benefits of farmers' markets to producers, consumers and local economies, lists the location of markets and trading days, offers clear advice on what makes for a successful market and outlines the benefits and expansion opportunities in farmers' markets. While this will cater for some producers, the vast majority will have to rely on the routes to market available via the processor and retailer. It must be remembered that the vast bulk of the food we produce is exported to 130 countries worldwide.</P>
    <P>While the farm gate price is vital for farmers, and this will be increasingly so in future, it cannot be overlooked that prices are only part of the returns to producers. Prices cannot be seen in isolation from the direct support paid to producers under the Common Agricultural Policy. My Department, for example, will pay &euro;1.6 billion under EU funded agricultural measures in 2004. This expenditure mainly consists of direct payments to farmers worth on average &euro;13,000 per farmer.</P>
    <P>The decision to decouple payments, which I have taken recently following extensive consultation with the agricultural stakeholders, will give farmers greater choice in deciding what to produce. They will be freer than before to focus on the demands of the market and the final consumer. Research conducted at my request by FAPRI Ireland shows that the policy of full decoupling will impact positively on farm incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is correct. I was referring in part to the Tansey report commissioned by IBEC and RGDATA which confirmed that farm gate prices do not contribute to food price inflation and that the costs arise beyond the farm. However, that is another day's work and is not a question for the Department of Agriculture and Food <i>per se.</i>Is the Minister of State aware, however, that there is a problem in some quarters with the retail sector, that none other than Mr. Ben Dunne has informed us that there is now a 26% gross margin on food compared with an 11% gross margin he claims was the norm when he ran his family business in the 1990s, and that farmers are paid less than &euro;2.30 per kilo for beef while the shopper pays more than &euro;7.40 for stewing beef?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On milk prices, a farmer I know in west Cork has informed me, and perhaps the Minister of <Col N="401" />State knows this, that there is a 30% mark-up on food in supermarkets where it was once 20%, and that while milk prices to farmers are higher now than they were 15 years ago, farmers' inputs have increased considerably due to inflation. What more can the Minister of State do to help direct sales given that marketing in the global context will not bring further comfort to farmers if the retail price is squeezing them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reports to which the Deputy refers clearly show that consumer prices have increased on average by 15.9% since 1999 and food prices by 13.6%. That is a difference of 2.3%. When we take into account that this is a primary food producing country and that the food industry is worth &euro;13 billion per annum and employs 135,000 people, directly and indirectly, it would be expected that food inflation should be less than the ordinary consumer product inflation because we produce volumes of food and export up to 90% of it to 130 countries worldwide.</P>
      <P>We have discerning consumers who demand greater choice than ever before and a competitive European Union market which will grow from 350 million consumers to more than 405 million when the new members join next May. In addition to that, in the global marketplace we have won major niche markets and An Bord Bia, through the Department's funding, does tremendous work in marketing.</P>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that, in that type of environment and taking into account the competition, the discerning consumer and the fact that we are a major food producer, there must be a difference between primary consumer price increases and food price increases. If that were not the case, there would be something seriously wrong with the industry. How we can increase the markets and get a greater return&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a huge interest in marketing. I spent 14 years in livestock marketing before I entered politics. At that time all the different customers were in the ring but that has changed since. Farmers' co-operatives have changed their policy and, as matters evolve, there is a huge change in the procurement system which has a major impact on the prices paid to farmers. It is <Col N="402" />important that farmers, as the primary producers, receive the maximum return on their product.</P>
      <P>There is some hearsay evidence that the problems to which Deputy Timmins refers exist. We have repeatedly sought written documentary evidence to pursue that. We have yet to receive one documented case but, if we do, we will pursue it. Other State agencies have responsibility in this area. Nothing can be done to ensure equity, fairness and a full return to the primary producer if there is a difficulty, latent or otherwise, within the system. We must have documentary evidence of the problem which we still await. It is not available. When it is, we will pursue it.</P>

      <P>A total of 168 cases of BSE have been confirmed to date in 2003, including one case from a depopulated herd. In addition, depopulation measures were applied in a further three cases where animals tested positive on the screening test but where it was not possible to confirm the result because of the condition of the sample. The number of confirmed cases this year represents a reduction of more than 46% on the corresponding period in 2002 when 313 cases were confirmed. These included four cases from depopulated herds.</P>
      <P>Additional control measures were introduced in 1996 and 1997 in the light of new information relating to BSE. To date this year, all but two cases were in animals born prior to 1997 while nine of all confirmed cases were in animals born after 1996. Fewer than 2% of cases to date in 2003 and in 2002 were identified in animals aged six years or less at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% and 40% in that category in 2001 and 2000 respectively. The overall trend, therefore, provides confidence in the effectiveness of the control measures.</P>
      <P>The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed and the declining numbers of BSE cases are positive indications that the enhanced controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline in 2004 and later as older animals leave the system.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the numbers are declining. Considerable concerns have been expressed in Britain regarding a large number of animals that have tested positive for BSE at a young age. This implies there are glitches in the system that have not been taken account of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister of State have any concerns about the risk or possibility of meat and bone<Col N="403" />meal being imported into Ireland after the ban? Will he consider providing a subsidy for taking older animals out of the population? This would be an obvious and straightforward way to reduce the incidence of BSE. While I do not have figures on it, it would seem to me that the cost of culling entire herds is expensive and it might be worthwhile to invest in removing the older animals while excluding BSE positive tests in the future.</P>

      <P>Pet food was one of the main concerns regarding meat and bonemeal usage and imports into the country. I raised this in my recent meeting with the Commissioner and he indicated that he would look at the issue.</P>
      <P>Ireland operates a different regime to that which operates in Britain and we do not accept that what has happened there has any serious implications for us. Since 1999, there have been only two cases of BSE in animals born here. Evidence suggests that this may have resulted from contaminated older food that was held in silos. We have further evidence to suggest that there may have been illegal disposal of animals, particularly animals that were fed to dogs. There are possible prosecutions pending in those cases and I do not want to say too much about them.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the trends are positive. BSE was a serious concern some years ago and the incidence of it is now steadily declining. The graph has dropped dramatically with each year and we expect it will continue in 2004. It proves that the regime we have put in place has been successful. While we know there may be a sting in the tail to this story, I am confident we are moving in the right direction.</P>

      <P>The second part of my question referred to the selective culling of older animals. Surely it would make commercial sense to selectively cull older animals that are a high risk.

This would eliminate the risk of having to cull entire herds.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decrease in the number of BSE cases in Ireland. We all know the effects BSE has had on our economy and the importance of agriculture to the economy. I compliment the Minister and his officials on the great job they have done in this regard. Does the Minister of State think that we will see circumstances where only the infected animal, and not the entire herd, is slaughtered? This has a severe effect on a farmer unfortunate enough to have an outbreak of BSE in his herd.</P>

The French food safety authority has said there is no scientific evidence that supports the line we have taken. While I understand where the Minister of State is coming from, no scientific evidence supports our current position.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is probably aware of a study being conducted in Britain on 59 cases. Are we liaising with the British authorities on how that study is going?</P>

The Department keeps full depopulation under constant review. Our export markets and domestic consumption are worth more than &euro;2.1 billion for beef and milk.</P>
      <P>Costs are reducing in line with BSE case numbers. The net cost was &euro;28 million in 2002, will be &euro;16 million in 2003 and is expected to be &euro;10 million in 2004. I am not prepared to risk a market worth &euro;2.1 billion for the &euro;10 million cost of anti-BSE measures.</P>

      <P>My Department launched a tender competition for the disposal of meat and bonemeal on 7 October last. The deadline for receipt of tenders was Friday, 28 November, by which time 18 tenders were received. My Department is currently assessing the tenders and hopes to be in a position to place contracts before the end of the year with operational activity likely to start in the new year. This material will be disposed of by incineration abroad and the overall cost can only be determined when successful tenders have been selected.</P>

      <P>How has such an enormous quantity of meat and bonemeal accumulated? I understand that in 1996, the Minister's predecessor, Ivan Yates, drew the line under the meat and bonemeal issue. Has this been accumulating and growing like Topsy since 1996? While I do not want the Minister to disclose the details of the tenders, will he provide a ballpark figure of the cost of dealing with this quantity? Who will pay the cost of disposal in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This country is unusual in many ways. For example, the numbers of livestock, at 7 million, and sheep, at 8 million, are both almost twice the human population. The livestock population generates about 550,000 tonnes of offal annually, which consists of carcasses and various other material. When rendered, this material creates 150,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal. As the House will be aware, while this was once a valuable by-product, it is now waste material which we cannot process because we do not have thermal processing facilities, unlike the United Kingdom and other European countries where this material is used as a source of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meat and bonemeal has a high calorific value but disposal is costly. I cannot be specific on costs because the tenders are still being assessed. It is <Col N="406" />regrettable that we cannot deal with this problem as this domestic issue is being dealt with using European Union solutions, which impose considerable costs on the industry. The answer to the Deputy's final question is that the unfortunate taxpayer pays the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not touch on my question concerning disposal plans for the future. Will he give a broad figure on the costs of disposal? He also stated that this material was a saleable commodity. I assume disposal now incurs a substantial cost per tonne. Will the Minister give us a rough figure of the cost per tonne and what is the overall prospective cost to the taxpayer of disposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what will be the position in future. As I stated, this material is used in other European Union countries, for example, in the cement industry where it is co-incinerated and is of considerable financial benefit and significant energy value. Applications have been made for permission to use this material here but, to date, no such facility has been provided. The Department established an interdepartmental committee to examine this issue and I hope to publish its report in the coming week. The general conclusion of the group, which consisted of representatives from all relevant Departments and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, was that we could beneficially utilise this material in this State as an energy source in some industries, particularly the cement industry, thus reducing the cost to the taxpayer. I assume a fair amount of the cost is incurred by the individual producer or farmer. I cannot, however, be specific about the cost per tonne as this is a public tendering process and the 18 tenders we have received have not yet been fully assessed.</P>

      <P>There are a number of options, which I have discussed on previous occasions with Members, including Deputy Upton. One of these methods, the use of alkaline hydrolysis, is being kept under constant review. The Department is in discussions with the scientific committee of the European Union on this issue, but further evaluation needs to be carried out, especially under field conditions, as to the suitability of dealing with bulk material such as meat and bonemeal. As I stated, the annual amount of this material produced here is 150,000 tonnes. Given that alkaline hydrolysis produces a substantial residue, which must be disposed of, thermal treatment is the only practical, high volume method currently available.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the Minister's responses, particularly with regard to cement kilns. Has the Department included other technologies in the tenders? A court case in Newcastle upon Tyne regarding the placing of ash from such operations into cement does not bode well and could yet emerge as a Trojan horse for a problem.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of 22 November 2003 features a proposal to build an ESB site for alkaline and acid hydrolysis in Ferbane, County Offaly. Is this one of the tenders to which the Minister referred? Does he recognise the energy potential of methane following anaerobic digestion of the residue? Initially, the Minister described this as a problem, but it could be turned into a resource if alkaline hydrolysis was to be followed by anaerobic digestion. In addition, the energy derived from the methane could also be beneficial. Has the Minister given this option consideration, particularly as a European Union steering committee has approved it?</P>

Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient effort is being made to find alternatives? I understand a number of groups have expressed an interest and commitment to utilising this product here. We are playing ducks and drakes in that we are happy to see this material being exported to Germany and elsewhere, but not prepared to deal with it here.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister examined every option for disposal apart from incineration? At a recent meeting with a group involved in this issue, I was informed that this material is disposed of in Northern Ireland in landfill and used in some countries as fertiliser in forestation. Is this true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a problem in that an important natural resource industry, our livestock industry, produces a considerable amount of a certain by-product &ndash; 550,000 tonnes per annum &ndash; which must be disposed of. It is incredibly difficult to do this in normal circumstances. Currently, the offal is rendered into meat and bonemeal for which there is no method of disposal in this State. Many options have been pursued without success to date, including using it in the electricity industry, the cement industry and landfill. To facilitate the utilisation of meat and bonemeal as a source of energy and power, a licence is required from the Environmental Protection Agency and to my knowledge, none of the relevant companies has applied for or been granted one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Landfill is used in the North and some of the material produced here is exported to the North for that purpose. Thermal treatment is facilitated in many EU countries, but it is a cost for the industry. As regards alkaline hydrolysis, that has <Col N="408" />many attractions. The use of methane as a by-product is being actively considered. There is a considerable volume of by-product from alkaline hydrolysis, which causes problems. We will require the approval of the new scientific committee before we embark on any one of those processes. However, in the meantime there is a considerable cost to the taxpayer, the industry and the farmers concerned in disposing of 150,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory requirement to test animals slaughtered under 30 months of age and, therefore, no charge to farmers. Under current EU rules, member states are required to undertake BSE tests on all cattle over 30 months of age intended for human consumption and on all casualty and fallen animals over 24 months of age. In the initial stages, following the introduction of the testing regime, the full cost of testing was borne by the Exchequer and the EU. More than 2 million such tests, most of which have been funded by the taxpayer, have been carried out at slaughter plants and other locations since the programme of active surveillance for BSE began in 2001. Against that background it was considered appropriate to transfer some of the costs to the industry on a progressive basis.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, from February 2003 the State subsidy for testing male animals over 30 months of age and females over 30 months of age born after 1 January 2000 was discontinued. However, my Department continued to pay the sum of &euro;10.50 per test for animals in this category to reflect the amount received by the Exchequer as EU co-funding in respect of each test. In addition, the costs of testing female animals born prior to 1 January 2000 have been carried by my Department, with assistance from the EU throughout 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1 January 2004 the subsidy paid on testing these animals will be reduced from &euro;10.50 to &euro;8 in line with the reduction in EU co-funding for such tests. The full cost of testing cows born prior to 1 January 2000 will continue to be carried by my Department and the EU until the middle of the year when the State contribution will be terminated. EU co-funding of &euro;8 per test for these older animals will continue to be passed on to the industry thereafter. This should also encourage the earlier slaughter of such animals. <Col N="409" />The Exchequer will continue to carry the net cost of testing casualty, fallen and some other categories of cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget comes at a turning point in our economic <Col N="410" />prospects, when international growth is on the mend. As such, it will set the strategic direction which this country will follow for the next few years. Ireland has come through the recent international economic downturn better than most. This is in no small part due to our sound budgetary policies.</P>
      <P>It is easy to forget the progress we have achieved &ndash; the defeat of unemployment as an economic scourge, the doubling of real income in the economy, the massive investment in infrastructure and the substantial enhancement of social benefits for the welfare of all our people. Today many tend to take these achievements for granted.</P>
      <P>Even if we sometimes forget the progress we have made in recent years, other fair-minded and reputable international organisations do not have any difficulty reminding us. The IMF report last August commended the Irish authorities for their &ldquo;exemplary track record of sound economic policies&rdquo;. The IMF referred to our enviable achievements: unemployment reduced from 16% to 4%; huge gains in competitiveness; and public debt reduced from more than 100% of GDP to 33%. The IMF also praised not only our prudent fiscal management and our tax reforms, but it also commended our sensible income policies and our investment in education. All these policies have laid the foundation for a virtuous circle, reinforcing growth and strengthening the resilience of our economy.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Budget and Strategic Objectives</i>This budget has the following basic objectives: to foster employment and growth; to continue a prudent approach to our public finances; to invest more in infrastructure; and to secure competitiveness by keeping inflation low, thereby, giving us the resources to meet our commitments on social inclusion. The strategic elements of delivering on these objectives involve: action to keep public spending within a sustainable growth range; an initiative on capital investment; action to sustain our public service pension capacity; and a balanced growth strategy for all areas of the State, which can be progressed through decentralisation.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Economic Outlook</i>As I have reminded the House before, Ireland is part of a monetary union with a low inflation target. Competition worldwide is exerting downward pressure on prices and incomes. As an open economy, we are more exposed than most and we face intensifying competition for international investment and the jobs that go with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These facts mean that there is an urgency attaching to getting our costs and prices back into balance with the rest of the EU. In doing so, we must keep the rate of increase in public spending in line with how we expect revenues to grow. In 2004, I am providing for Exchequer borrowing of &euro;2.8 billion. That is the appropriate level to set for Exchequer borrowing in the current circum<Col N="411" />stances. This is equivalent to more than 50% of our capital budget for the year.</P>
    <P>This time last year, I pointed to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. My caution was well placed, as the pick-up in the major world economies has been slower than expected.</P>
    <P>The current improvement in the international economy is a welcome development. However, there are still significant risks. For example, Ireland is particularly vulnerable to sharp falls in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro. On balance, the short-term prospects for the international economy have now improved. We need to ensure that we can capitalise on that improvement. Currently, GNP in 2004 is projected to grow at 3% and GDP at 3.3%. We also expect to see GNP growth rates increasing in 2005 and 2006 to about 4% and 4.5% respectively.</P>
    <P>Employment is expected to grow next year by 23,000 with unemployment to average around 5%. Taking account of the changes in this budget, consumer price inflation should average 2.5% in 2004, half the rate we experienced at the start of this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Decentralisation of Government Departments and Agencies</i>Anois, seo é an dea-scéal do bhailte móra ar fud na tíre. It is important that the growth we expect should be regionally balanced. In this regard, I am announcing details of decentralisation of Government Departments and agencies as promised in the budget of 2000. For the first time ever, decentralisation will involve the transfer of complete Departments, including their Ministers and senior management, to provincial locations.</P>

Ministers with headquarters outside Dublin will be provided with a centralised suite of offices, close to the Houses of the Oireachtas, for a small secretariat to allow them to conduct business while in Dublin and when the Dáil is in session.</P>

      <P>The previous decentralisation programme involved the relocation of some 4,000 public service jobs. The programme I am announcing today is far more radical. In total, it will involve the relocation of 10,300 civil and public service jobs to 53 centres in 25 counties.</P>

      <i>Details of Implementation</i>Full details of the decentralisation programme are outlined in the budget summary. The programme will be implemented through the transfer of staff on a voluntary basis. There will be no redundancies and, as on previous occasions, the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons outlined in the summary, decisions on location have yet to be made in respect of over 1,300 of the 10,300 jobs being decentralised. The final total can be closer to 12,000 jobs and I intend to examine options in this regard once the new programme is well under way. The Government has also decided that, save in exceptional circumstances, any new agencies or bodies being established in future should be located in areas compatible with the new programme of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>I am establishing an implementation committee to drive forward implementation of the programme, with the chair reporting to a Cabinet sub-committee. I am also providing an additional &euro;20 million capital in my Department's Vote for 2004 to meet any initial investment required.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Benefits for all</i>Over time, decentralisation will lead to a radical change of culture in terms of policy formation in this country. No longer will policy be made entirely in Dublin on the basis of a Dublin mindset. I am also convinced that decentralisation offers considerable benefits for the Departments involved, the communities to which they will be relocated, the staff who will transfer and the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Government has sought to ensure that the units being transferred are large enough to provide career opportunities for staff, either within their own Department or in another Department, within a reasonable distance. Indeed, the radical nature of this programme means that capable civil servants who are interested in decentralisation can look forward with confidence to good career prospects outside Dublin in the future, something which has been much less a feature of decentralisation in the past.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation can bring very significant benefits for the staff involved. These benefits will include reduced commuting times and lower house prices outside Dublin. Discussions will be held with the public service unions on the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>National Spatial Strategy</i>The locations which have been selected take full account of the national spatial strategy, the existence of good transport links &ndash; by road, rail and air &ndash; and the location of existing decentralised offices. The aim has been to establish viable clusters of work units within a region, either in the form of self-contained locations or <Col N="413" />clusters of sites located geographically close to each other or to existing decentralised locations. This will help to avoid the pitfalls of fragmentation and protect service delivery.</P>
    <P>Although Dublin remains vital to economic development, the Government's national spatial strategy recognises that Ireland also needs a more even spread of development. Unbalanced development is not sustainable in the longer term, economically, socially or environmentally. More balanced regional development will contribute to sustainable long-term economic growth to the benefit of all our citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary Projections</i>The 2004 budgetary targets are as follows: an increase in gross spending on public services of just under 7%, bringing it to a total of &euro;41,117 million; a current budget surplus of &euro;2,989 million; a capital budget deficit of &euro;5,795 million; an Exchequer deficit of &euro;2,806 million; a general Government deficit of &euro;1,635 million or 1.1% of GDP; and a debt ratio of 33% of GDP, the second lowest in the EU.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sustaining Progress</i>One of the provisions agreed in Sustaining Progress was that the report of the independent public service benchmarking body would be implemented. The Government will honour that commitment. If we wish to deliver quality public services we have to pay the salaries necessary for their delivery. The key to this agreement is the fact that there will be gains for both sides.</P>
    <P>We now have a pay determination system which rewards public servants by reference to the market value of their work and does not depend on historical links with other public service groups. Furthermore, payment of the increases is conditional on industrial peace and progress on modernisation across the public service. Failure to deliver on these requirements will mean that payments will not be made.</P>
    <P>A further national pay agreement is due to be negotiated in the first half of 2004. These negotiations will have to take into account the facts that the competitive challenge is more intense than ever; inflation has halved since the present agreement was negotiated; and in the case of the public service, significant increases are being paid under benchmarking. As a consequence, we need a significantly lower outcome in pay terms than was the case the last time.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Spending</i>Public spending is at an all-time high. Since 1997, this Government has dramatically expanded public spending on social welfare, health, education and infrastructure. We were able to do this when very high levels of growth delivered strong revenue flows. Now, lower economic growth means lower revenue growth. Looking to the future, we are locking in the gains we have made, but future growth in public spending must match available revenues. Accordingly, future <Col N="414" />annual public spending increases will have to be kept very close to this year's level. This will mean annual expenditure growth in the range of 5% to 7%, depending on the actual level of economic growth at the time.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Infrastructural Investment</i>I am determined to get more and better value for the funds taxpayers are providing. A more focused and planned approach to spending is required to deliver this extra value. A coherent, strategic and cost-efficient approach to capital spending on infrastructure is key to our future growth potential.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and 2003 we will have spent almost &euro;28 billion in capital spending. In 1997 we spent &euro;2 billion on capital. Next year we will spend &euro;5.6 billion. This is close to 5% of GNP &ndash; double the rest of Europe. As a result, dramatic strides have been made in tackling our infrastructure deficit. The Government will continue the existing high level of capital investment, building on the progress we have made over the last seven years. The future success of our economy depends on investment made now.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Envelopes</i>The overall level of capital spending must be maintained consistently. We need to avoid sudden spurts which drive up contract prices, followed by lulls in activity. The objective should be an even flow of investment projects and obtaining real value for money as they roll out. With this end in view I am announcing today a major change in the financial treatment of capital spending. In recent years I have committed to a rolling investment programme or financial envelope in public transport. This has allowed for a structured approach to spending which has delivered results. I am extending this approach through the introduction of rolling five year multi-annual envelopes for all investment areas.</P>

In implementing the new envelope system I intend to allow Departments to carry over to the following year any unspent Exchequer capital allocations up to a maximum of 10% of each annual capital subhead. This carry-over facility, which will take effect from the 2004 financial year, should significantly assist in the better planning and execution of those projects which span a number of years. The Government will monitor the implementation of this initiative for capital spending with a view to considering its wider application in time. Further details of this initiative and the relevant capital envelopes are set out in the budget summary.</P>

      <i>Public Private Partnerships</i>The inclusion of a significant provision for public private partnerships in the five year envelope will provide a strong incentive to Departments and agencies to pursue the PPP route on a value-for-money basis. The National Development Finance Agency will have an important role to play in advising Departments and agencies in this regard. I want to see an increasing proportion of public investment undertaken by the private sector, increasing from 3% of total spending in 2004 to 15% by 2008.</P>

I also propose to move away from the traditional approach to hiring consultants on construction contracts.</P>

      <P>On public service pensions, anyone who has followed events in Europe will be aware of the major upheavals that have occurred in several member states in addressing the pension crisis. Those states were unwilling in the past to plan for the demographic consequences of ageing. This failure to act in good times leaves them with no option now but to make substantial changes to the pension entitlements of everyone in the public service, not just new entrants. I will build on the initiatives I have already implemented in the pensions area by addressing the issue of public service pensions today.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Principles for Public Service Pensions</i>The issue of public service pensions was considered by Government as early as 1996, when a commission was set up to examine and report on all aspects of the matter. The Government approved the commission's report in principle in September 2001 and its recommendations have been discussed since then in various joint union and management forums. However, the time to act is now.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to implement the bulk of the commission's recommendations in the light of certain guiding principles. The minimum age for receiving a pension should generally be 65.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Measures affecting New-Entrants to the Public Service</i>I will be introducing the following measures for new entrants with effect from 1 April 2004, except in those cases where for legal or technical reasons a later commencement date is required. The minimum pension age will be increased to 65 for most new entrants to the public service; this includes new entrant civil servants and teachers and staff in local government, the health services and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies; the present compulsory retirement age of 65 will be removed, enabling staff to remain longer in work should they wish, subject to suitability and health requirements; the minimum pension age will be increased to 65 for Members of the Oireachtas <Col N="417" />and office holders elected or appointed on or after 1 April 2004; the minimum pension age will be increased to 55 for new entrant gardaí&mdash;</P>

      <P>The public service unions will be fully informed about the implementation of the reforms in advance of their introduction for new entrants on 1 April 2004. These changes do not in any way affect existing staff or pensioners. This is underlined by the fact that the Government has decided not to accept the commission's recommendations on the introduction of an additional 1% pension contribution for all public servants or the use of a new index for determining pension increases.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Pensions of Serving Staff including lower paid</i>I am also proposing changes to the pension terms and conditions of serving staff, including amendment of the formula used for integrating public service and social welfare pensions to make better provision for current and future staff on lower pay levels. Such a change will also be of benefit to some existing pensioners. I will also be proposing a scheme to provide for a new single additional voluntary contribution scheme for the public service as well as the possibility of optional early retirement on the basis of actuarially reduced benefits, as recommended by the commission. The details of these and other proposed pension changes for existing staff are also set out in the budget summary.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Taxation</i>The resources available for tax reductions are limited this year. However, there are a number of issues which need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Indirect Taxation</i>I propose to make only limited changes to indirect taxes in this budget. The goal of keeping inflation low takes precedence on this occasion. In addition, excise revenue has underperformed this year. There is also more uncertainty about the prospects for excise revenue in certain sectors during 2004. Therefore, a prudent approach in this area is warranted. I propose to increase the VAT-inclusive excise duty on cigarettes and other tobacco products by the equivalent of 25 cent per packet of twenty cigarettes.  The VAT-inclusive excise duty rate on petrol and diesel will be increased by 5 cent per litre. These excise duties increases will take effect from midnight <Col N="418" />tonight and will bring in &euro;243 million in extra revenue next year.</P>

      <P>On VAT anti-avoidance, I propose to put beyond doubt the VAT law as it applies to the site element in transactions involving the construction of new houses and apartments. This will deal with an unacceptable interpretation of VAT law being propounded by some tax practitioners and will safeguard the revenues of the State in such transactions. The measure will take effect from midnight tonight.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Income Tax</i>Considerable progress has already been made in reforming our direct tax system in the past six years and adapting it to the changing needs of our society. Lowering the direct tax burden has in particular produced positive results in our increased ability to create and protect employment. Some may think that they can reduce unemployment by high tax-and-spend policies. However, any such reduction would only be temporary and would in any case be reversed as tax increases damage our competitiveness. We, on the other hand, have got unemployment down and kept it at low levels by keeping tax rates low.</P>
      <P>This lesson should be learned by those who mistakenly call for us to increase the tax burden towards the levels of some other states in Europe. Such calls are misplaced and those who make them fail to see that job creation is the appropriate goal if we are to achieve real social inclusion. High direct tax rates destroy jobs sooner or later. The Government has no intention of going down that route now or in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Employee tax credit</i>To keep the income tax burden low, especially for the lower paid, I propose to increase the employee tax credit by &euro;240 to &euro;1,040 per annum. This will continue to ensure that tax is not payable on 90% of the minimum wage and will remove 39,200 taxpayers from the tax net. I also propose to increase the income tax exemption <Col N="419" />limits for those aged 65 and over by &euro;500 single and &euro;1,000 married, bringing them to &euro;15,500 single and &euro;31,000 married. This will remove an additional 2,200 taxpayers aged over 65 from the tax net. The combined cost of these two measures is &euro;287 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>On tax reliefs, last year I announced the termination of a series of major tax reliefs from the end of 2004. Since then, I have been bombarded by demands to revisit that policy, especially in the case of one particular relief. Whatever one's stance on the merit of any particular relief, there are a number of inescapable facts about their impact.</P>
      <P>First, they narrow the tax base and make it harder to pursue the goal of lower tax rates for all. Second, they raise issues of equity since not everyone has the disposable income necessary to avail of them. Finally, tax reliefs reduce the tax bill of those in the higher income brackets. This is equally true whether the tax relief is granted for film relief or for urban or rural renewal. Those who simultaneously decry this fact and at the same time campaign to retain certain reliefs should recognise the inherent contradiction in their position.</P>
      <P>
        <i>BES and seed capital scheme</i>I have always made it clear that I favour targeted reliefs which produce clear economic benefits. One scheme that meets these criteria is the business expansion scheme, which is due to expire on 31 December 2003. Accordingly, I propose to extend that scheme, and the associated seed capital scheme, for a further period until 31 December 2006. I also propose to increase the maximum amount that can be generally raised by a company under these schemes from &euro;750,000 to &euro;1 million.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Film relief</i>I have reviewed the case made to me by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, and I have decided that film relief will be extended for a further period until the end of 2008, and that the ceiling per film will be increased to &euro;15 million from 2005.</P>

      <i>Other tax incentives</i>A number of other reliefs were due to expire at end-2004. I am aware that there is a range of construction projects either in the pipeline or under way which will be seriously affected by this termination date. As the end-2004 deadline approaches, pressure on construction resources will mount to deliver these projects. Accordingly, I propose to extend the termination date for all these area-based schemes until 31 July 2006, as set out in the budget summary. I am also renewing the relief for corporate investment in renewable energy sources until end-2006.</P>
    <P>
      <i>R &amp; D tax credit/stamp duty on patents</i>In line with my approach of favouring targeted reliefs that can produce economic benefits, I propose to introduce a tax credit for incremental research and development expenditure by companies. Under this proposal up to 20% of such expenditure may be set against corporation tax in any given tax year. The scheme will be reviewed after five years. Full details of the scheme, which is subject to clearance by the European Commission, will be set out in the Finance Bill. I also propose to exempt transfers of intellectual property from stamp duty in that Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Headquarters and holding companies</i>I propose to exempt the disposal of subsidiary companies from capital gains tax and to expand the scope of our double taxation relief provisions for dividend income paid to parent companies in certain cases. Details are set out in the budget summary. I am confident that this measure will help Ireland compete internationally for headquarters and holding companies and will create additional high-quality employment in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dental insurance relief</i>I propose amending the relevant provisions in the Finance Bill to provide tax relief at the standard rate for all insurance premia in relation to non-routine dental care.

      <P>I now refer to rural economy measures. Arising from the recent EU decision regarding the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, I am improving the income tax relief for certain farm leases so as to encourage better utilisation of our agricultural land resources. The exempt annual threshold for leases of five to seven years is being increased from &euro;5,079 to &euro;7,500. For leases of seven years or more, the exempt annual threshold is being increased from &euro;7,618 to &euro;10,000. In addition, the <Col N="421" />age limit for qualifying lessors is being reduced from 55 to 40 years.</P>
      <P>The scheme of capital allowances for investment in farm pollution control measures is also being extended for a further three years to end-2006. The farmers flat-rate VAT addition is being increased from 4.3 to 4.4%. I propose to provide an income tax exemption in respect of income received by Gaeltacht households under the summer college student scheme. Such income is already disregarded for social welfare means test purposes. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, will make an announcement later today on animal disease levies.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government proposed the establishment of a rural social programme to provide secure, community-related, employment opportunities for persons in families eligible for the farm assist scheme. I am pleased to announce today that my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is proceeding to establish a rural social scheme to help improve rural services in a more efficient way and at the same time to provide an income for small farmers with a working week compatible with farming.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the net cost of the new scheme would be relatively small given that participants will be in receipt of an existing payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Net new funding of &euro;10 million, to include the additional payments to individuals and the cost of materials, is planned for the scheme and the dormant accounts fund will fund this. It is estimated that this could provide for up to 2,500 places. Details of the scheme are set out in the budget summary.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Social inclusion</i>Since 1997, the Government has substantially reduced consistent poverty and improved living standards for all. In this budget there will be substantial additional funds for those who are most in need.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Persons with disabilities</i>I am providing an additional &euro;25 million current expenditure in 2004 to support persons with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities. This funding will be used to provide additional emergency residential placements and extra day services, especially for school leavers, and to enhance health support services for children. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will be allocating capital funding for these services from within his 2004 allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>The improvements in social welfare payments announced today will amount to an additional <Col N="422" />&euro;630 million in a full year, that is, &euro;100 million greater than last year. Despite all the talk after the publication of the Abridged Estimates volume, the total social welfare expenditure will be &euro;750 million higher than in 2003, an increase of more than 7%.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, explained previously, expenditure on various social welfare payments is evaluated on an ongoing basis. Arising from this process, the Government decided regarding the 2004 Estimates to implement a number of measures to ensure the different schemes will continue to meet their objectives. The Government is prepared not just to evaluate public expenditure but to make the necessary changes. The resources which are freed up as a result can then be used for more effective social welfare spending. This is precisely what I am doing today.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increases well ahead of inflation</i>All the increases in the social welfare adult personal weekly rates I will announce today are well ahead of the rate of inflation. They range from 6% to 8% and in the case of the lowest social welfare payments, are more than three times the expected rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Old age pension</i>Today I am increasing the full rate of old age and related pensions by &euro;10 per week. This will bring the old age contributory pension to &euro;167.30 per week. The new rate for the old age non-contributory pension will be &euro;154 per week.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Widows and widowers</i>I am providing a total increase of &euro;11.50 in the weekly rate of the widows and widowers contributory pension for those aged 66 and over, to bring the rate of payment up to that of the old age contributory pension. For widows and widowers aged 80 or over, the new weekly rate will be &euro;173.70.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child benefit</i>The Government has significantly increased the rates of child benefit in recent years. In 2004, the monthly rate for the first and second child will increase by &euro;6 on the 2003 rate and the rate for third and subsequent children will increase by &euro;8.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other weekly welfare payments and qualified adult allowances</i>All other personal weekly social welfare rates will be increased by &euro;10 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This will bring the lowest full personal social welfare rate to &euro;134.80 per week. The full qualified adult allowance rates will increase by at least &euro;6.60 per week. I am also providing for a special increase of &euro;16.10 per week in the invalidity pension qualified adult rate, where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over, to <Col N="423" />bring it to the old age contributory pension equivalent. Proportionate increases will be paid for all persons in receipt of reduced rate weekly social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Other Social Welfare measures</i>The budget summary contains a range of other social welfare improvements, the full details of which will be announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Among these measures are: an increase of &euro;28 per week in the family income supplement income thresholds and a &euro;7 increase in the minimum payment; an increase in the weekly income disregard for means assessment of the carer's allowance scheme; a further increase in the annual respite care grant provided to carers, bringing it to &euro;835 per annum; and an increase in the widowed parent grant to &euro;2,700. The increase in this grant will come into effect today and the effective payment dates for other increases in 2004 will be the same as this year. The very substantial real increases in social welfare rates which I have just announced are a considerable down payment on the implementation of our commitments under Sustaining Progress.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Concluding Remarks</i>Ireland has survived the economic downturn better than most other countries. This has not been without cost in terms of falling incomes and job losses for some, and disappointed expectations for many. The Government acknowledges this and the pain it has involved. The future, however, is now more hopeful and economic recovery worldwide offers a more optimistic prospect. The Irish public has accepted the need for fiscal restraint. We should all understand the need to avoid excessive borrowing. Borrowing is the real stealth tax. We need to limit our spending to what we can afford. We took decisive action on the public finances which was not without political cost. This is the correct thing to do, even if it is not politically popular. We intend to see this principle through but we will do so with responsibility and concern, as we have shown today.</P>
      <P>We have in this budget protected the weaker sections of the community through substantial real increases in welfare payments. We have improved the tax position of the lower paid and consolidated the gains of low inflation.</P>

      <P>We have introduced measures to foster enterprise and to protect our jobs base for the future. We sought to spread the fruits of growth on a regionally progressive basis, especially through our programme of decentralisation. We have unveiled a scenario for a sustained and prolonged level of significant capital <Col N="424" />spending to bring our infrastructure up to the mark. We have taken decisions on pensions which will help lower paid public service pensioners. We have also taken decisions on pensions for new entrants to the public service, which will safeguard pensions for all in the longer term. All this means that, given no major external shocks, we can look forward to more growth and more jobs in our economy, a better deal for all in society, better public services focused on delivery, a quantum leap in the quality and extent of publicly provided infrastructure and a better jobs balance through decentralisation.</P>
      <P>This budget is a key step in achieving all of this. I commend the budget to the House.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware of the current consumer campaign on radio stations which is advising people to &ldquo;know the price or pay the price&rdquo;. It could have been devised for this budget. The price of the budget is not what we see today. The price of the budget will be found in the continuing stealth taxes people will witness over the coming months. It will be found in the squeeze on services for people at the very bottom of the pile. People who depend on public services for survival will be squeezed as a result of the budget. The cost of benchmarking will amount to &euro;1,000 per household.</P>
      <P>The superficial smiles of many on the Fianna Fáil benches will soon fade away as the reality of the budget strikes home to ordinary families and ordinary businesses who are trying to make a go of living in Ireland, the Ireland the Government has created, the rip-off Ireland which has become the most expensive country in Europe. The Minister said we should expect social welfare recipients to be grateful for &euro;10 a week to keep them going in rip-off Ireland. That will not go very far against the background of the stealth taxes we see day after day from the Government, including increases in bus fares, electricity prices and motor tax. Each day there is something fresh and the budget perpetuates it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has allocated crumbs to the local authorities in an effort to calm the nerves of backbenchers, some &euro;30 million to try to make up for the additional costs this year. This will mean increased bin charges, increased rates and the development charge. The question is who benefits from the budget. Whose quality of life will be markedly improved by the budget? The answer is no one's. One will have to look long and hard to find any section of the community, either the young, those looking to public services for help or those needing care who will benefit from the budget. The budget is not about people, it is about keeping the system going, farming it along and feeding it just to mark time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" />Ministers boast of millions spent. The public does not care about how many millions are spent. They want to see what was received for it. Sadly if one looks at our public institutions, hospitals and schools one will see that little or nothing has been obtained for what was spent. The old saying, &ldquo;Never attribute to evil what can be explained by incompetence,&rdquo; applies in spades to this Government. It was not through malice the Government said it would end the hospital waiting lists in two years and put 2,000 extra gardaí on the streets. Those were laudable ideas but were not thought through. There was no planning and they were not budgeted for and, ultimately, it proved they could not be delivered. This is the sort of approach that has cheapened the currency of political debate. Given that an election is on the sidelines next June, decentralisation is produced like a rabbit out of the hat. Decentralisation is supposed to solve all problems.</P>

      <P>The sad reality is that the budget is the product of a lack of courage. It is the product of soft option politics, the politics that ducks responsibility, that puts off decisions, that sees opportunities but just does not bother to make the extra effort to take them on. This is a Government that has no interest in planning, reform, financial controls or accountability for outcomes and now we are paying the price. At the end of those years of Celtic tiger boom we survey the wreckage of dashed hopes for many who look to the State for leadership, who have lost trust that this system is able to serve us at all.</P>
      <P>The budget was flagged as a strategic budget. This was a Minister who was going to lay down the foundations for the future. What is strategic about a budget that has failed to reform any of the spending systems that have delivered so little, absorbed so much money and delivered nothing in return? What is strategic about an economy that leaves the greatest rewards for the land speculators, not those who roll up their sleeves to employ people in exports and services who struggle to get by under the influence of Government stealth taxes? No, it is not them, but land speculators who are to get the greatest rewards in this new economy where we are building foundations for the future.</P>
      <P>It is not laying any strategic foundations to leave 70,000 children in deprivation. Today &euro;1.30 per week is provided to lift them out of poverty.</P>

      <P>It is a joke, against a background of so many children whose lives are blighted by deprivation and the lack of opportunity to succeed in school. That is not laying a foundation for the future. That is an insult to people and a product of soft option politics. Young families who should have been the seedbed for the future are being asked to fund not only child care out of the &euro;1.30 child benefit, which is costing them out of the pre-tax income &euro;400 per week, which was bad enough, but they are being asked to pay a development levy if they buy a new home. This is a levy to make up for the Government's failure to anticipate infrastructural needs and provide for them. Who are we asking to pay for this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking young families forming their new homes to pay. We are asking small businesses trying to set up something fresh to pay these development levies for the mistakes of many years. Our exporters are struggling in the face of an 8% drop in the prices they are getting this year. What has the Government done? It has increased the price of Government services by an average of 15% across the board and in many cases way above that amount. This is not creating the sort of future we want.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced he would borrow &euro;1,300 million to buy foreign shares on tick and he calls that providing prudently for our future pension needs. There is no prudence in this approach. Essentially the budget is misusing the valuable assets for our future. We should reward real enterprise, give children equal opportunities, help young families through those tough formative years, ensure export businesses can remain competitive, put aside savings to meet future needs and not borrow on tick. This is not the strategic view that the Government takes. The only strategic view it has in mind is the strategic view of electoral politics.</P>
      <P>One will search in vain in the budget or the Estimates for any serious sign of reform. The effect of the funding system is that many hospital managers today trying to stay within budgets are mothballing hospital beds that are needed to treat the thousands on hospital waiting lists. They are put into cold storage. The facilities are not worked more efficiently or made to get more patients treated but are mothballed because of the type of financial provision over which the Minister has presided.</P>

      <P>We will not see any reform or dismantling of bureaucracies or penalties for non-performance in these Estimates but we will per<Col N="427" />sist with the top heavy approach that has characterised the two previous budgets of the Minister. This budget has no answers. It has no answers to rip-off Ireland which has taken a firm grip with the Government as its godfather. It has no answers to our ebbing international competitiveness, dragged down by Government costs, which is destroying jobs. It has no answer to the crisis of caring for many families throughout the country who are trying to cope in a difficult climate created by present policies. We look to the budget but there are few answers.</P>
      <P>After last year, when there was no indexation or increase in the tax credits or in the cut-off income points, we expected the Government would do so this year. Once again there is no increase in the standard rate cut off point or in personal credits. The only change is in the PAYE credit but it has fallen far short of what the Government said it would be. It said it would take all those on the minimum wage out of the income tax code, but that would have required an increase in the PAYE credit of &euro;520. It did not go half the distance to do that. The Minister has marked time in regard to those at the bottom of pile, those on minimum incomes.</P>
      <P>As a result of the budget, instead of 20% paying the top rate of tax, next year one third of the population will be pushed into the top rate of income tax and more families will have to pay at the top rate of income tax, not because they are prosperous or doing well. They still continue to pay the stealth taxes because the Minister will not increase the tax allowances. He wants inflation on his side to take money out of people's pockets which he has not the courage to do directly. They will suffer.</P>
      <P>It was a pathetic effort to give a little over &euro;1 to deal with the many problems children face. For those at the bottom, many expected the child dependant allowance, provided to those on social welfare, and the family income supplement, the support for those on low incomes, would be the object of an increase, that at least he would give to those at the bottom of the pile when money was short. However, they did not get a penny. After ten years there is no addition for the support of children.</P>

      <P>The sad reality is we are experiencing the legacy of the &ldquo;get out and party&rdquo; years. Never did a Government spend so much to achieve so little. It had a golden opportunity to spend. There is a significant figure in the budget. After the Minister made his budget speech in 2000, he was able to look forward to the following three years in the expectation of a surplus of &euro;6 billion. That was a sound financial position in which to be. That was before the general election spending spree began. What do we see now as we look three years ahead? We see a deficit of &euro;9.5 billion. That turnaround of &euro;15.5 billion reveals much about the way this country has been managed and run in the intervening period. This is the legacy of the &ldquo;get out and party&rdquo; years in euros and cents. The public is paying a high price for that. We see the inevitable outcome in the budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children will no doubt boast that, at &euro;2,600 for every person in the country, he has one of the highest levels of expenditure ever.

Bureaucracy was expanded but there was no focus, even on areas where it was felt the impact approaching. No provision was made.</P>

However, someone earning less than the minimum wage will not qualify for a medical card if he or she has a child and an adult to support.

      <P>The Government has had unique opportunities to make an impact on many of the services that matter. The most recent was in benchmarking which is a debacle that has undersold the wonderful talents of many people who work in our public service.  It was to be unique. It was not simply a matter of paying for industrial peace or co-operation with change because those were a feature of all previous agreements. Benchmarking was new and different and involved paying on the basis of hard evidence of gaps between the public and private sectors and a serious agenda of reform that would transform the delivery of public service. This made benchmarking special, a great opportunity that we would have expected our Progressive Democrat friends in Government to welcome as an opportunity to reform or be redundant, to paraphrase the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

No reform agenda was pushed, no hard evidence was released, no union was pushed beyond its established positions in the Sustaining Progress negotiations, and the Minister for Finance knows that. The action plans that emerged were a re-statement of the change and modernisation programme that has always been under way in the public service. The fault does not lie with the trade unions, the performance verification groups or the public services which are trying hard to work within their systems. The fault lies squarely with the Government which had the opportunity and fluffed it.</P>

Some ask if there are great economic principles behind the Minister for Finance and the seventh chapter of his budget. Is he a Keynesian, leaning against the business cycle? Is he a Friedmanite believing in automatic correction and that nothing needs to be done? No, his approach beats to the electoral cycle. His principles are those of the hog cycle: fuel the boom, suck poorly informed people into taking a chance and, when it gets difficult, renege on the promises, pull all the credit lines and let the innocent be crushed.

      <P>Carers have been sold short again in this budget. One of the innovations the Minister introduced in his budget a few years ago was the home carer's tax credit. Maybe he did it grudgingly after a lot of pressure from backbenchers, but it was an innovation, a recognition that people caring in the home deserve some recognition in our tax code. What has happened to that tax credit? It was not increased this year or last year. That helps to show what is happening to carers in our community today. I see the situation every day of the week. Home care and respite care are being cut back. All the services which go to make the life of people trying to care in the home a little easier are being cut back. That <Col N="433" />reality will be exacerbated by today's budget and the Estimates that lie behind them.</P>
      <P>We will also see behind the Estimates many other cuts not yet visible. Scarce hospital beds will be mothballed. Long-stay places will be rationed. As we have seen this year, that will build up into our accident and emergency departments which are in chaos and cannot cope with the strain. It will mean that families who care on a 24-hour, seven-day per week basis will be denied respite care. We have seen that this year and will see it again next year. Do Ministers and backbenchers take us for fools when they set off on their little life rafts, promising to save accident and emergency services? They are mighty mice in the constituencies but church mice trooping into the Dáil lobbies when they come to Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Government has looked on while Ireland has become the most expensive country in Europe. The Government huffed and puffed about protecting people from rip-offs and was then found wanting. In these Estimates we see health charges up by 42% since the general election, an incredible increase. Government utility prices are up by 20% since the general election. Electricity charges are up 21%, gas charges up 10%, railway fares up 15%, bus fares up 17.5%, including the latest increase, postal charges up 17%, and television licence fees up 40%. These are the significant increases the Government is imposing on people while it expects businesses competing in international markets to survive in areas where prices are falling.

In this survey, Ireland ranks 15th among 16 countries for consumer prices, 12th among 13 for broadband, 13th out of 16 for insurance, 16th for research and development spending, 16th for recycling, 15th for infrastructural quality, while for speed of delivery we are the worst capital city in the world, apart from Calcutta, which got in ahead of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is living in a world of its own. It is ordinary people who will carry the cost. We need to focus on competitiveness. The challenge of competitiveness is a key challenge for us today. The Minister will say he has responded to this with his five-year envelope for capital projects. We had these envelopes before. They were called the NDP and they ended in a shambles, being already 60% over cost, and two years behind plan. Providing an envelope and promising spending in that way does not change the reality. We want to see value, to see projects brought in on time and on budget. There is no such commitment or approach forthcoming from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see PPP coming in. Public private partnership is supposed to be the new solution. In 2005 and 2006 the Minister is looking for PPPs to rescue <Col N="435" />him and come up with &euro;1 billion. I would like to see the small print. So far the Minister has refused to release any information about these PPP projects so they would be open to scrutiny by this House. PPP projects may take borrowing off the Government's balance sheet but by God they put it on the consumer's balance sheet, with consumers having to pay exorbitant tolls at a time when the Government can borrow at a rate of 5%. These PPP funders are looking for 15%, three times the rate. This is not a remedy for our infrastructural deficits.</P>

They are the problems for which the Government is ultimately responsible. We have lost our lead in telecommunications and in e-access. We have ceased to be a leading country. I welcome the belated recognition of research and development, but we are now in 38th position for technology in the competitiveness ranking. In technology, we lie behind all the new EU applicants. We hope to build the future of the country on high value-added jobs, but under this Government's watch we have allowed our lead to fall away in those vital areas.</P>

However, four years after the idea was introduced we have produced only 1,450 affordable houses against an estimated 60,000 people per year who are looking for homes in the affordable category. Fewer than 1% of the houses needed have been produced. No serious effort has been made to reform the delivery of housing. The Government seems to be quite satisfied to stick with the unreformed system of zoning and hoarding of land which is pushing up prices and making it more and more difficult for young families to get on to the ladder of home ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today, we are seeing how the basic principles of prudent public spending were allowed to rust over in those heady years between 2000 and 2002 when any project would go. The ESRI tried to point out to the Government the follies of its approach. The institute pointed out poor project selection, poor cost control, vast overruns and expensive facilities funded by the State lying idle in Birr, Mullingar and Blanchardstown. The ESRI pointed out that the Government needed to get its act together in the management and delivery of public spending. The response of the <Col N="437" />Minister for Finance was like that of the old Roman emperors who, when they heard a message they did not like from the war front, decided to kill the messenger. Every effort was made to undermine the honest scout who was trying to tell Ministers that competence was required. If we want to address the needs of this country we must be competent in the management of public money. The ESRI got little thanks for its efforts.</P>
    <P>Let no one imagine that the damage being done by undermining financial controls is trivial. This is the sort of thing which, in an international economy, quickly transfers into international confidence. We depend on low interest rates and on international confidence. The Government's approach has damaged that confidence.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister sat down with his fellow finance Ministers to deal with the issue of the currency and those who would not abide by currency rules. They have been playing fast and loose with serious issues for ordinary householders who need low interest rates if they are to continue to afford their mortgages. When Ireland assumes the Presidency next year the Minister for Finance must ensure that there are workable rules regarding the Stability and Growth Pact and that they are enforced. He has not made a good start in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Punchestown disease has damaged the authority of the Minister to manage the other spending Departments and to insist that they take a sensible approach. He will leave that sad legacy behind.</P>
    <P>Today, we see &euro;1.4 billion put aside for the pension fund. Here was money that I would have expected to see this year going to fund projects. There is no point in borrowing money to buy foreign shares when our infrastructural deficit is crying out. Nor is there any point, as the Minister has done since he introduced the pension fund, of cutting down on public savings. If one wants to provide prudently for the future one must set aside money to save. Instead, the Minister has visibly and rapidly cut the savings rate undertaken by the Government. This undermines the way in which we provide for our future.</P>
    <P>Even in the area of tax, where the Minister might say his record is strongest, we see that his capacity to continue reforming the taxation system has run aground. I take off my hat to the Minister for introducing the tax credits system. That system ensured that reforms in taxation could be made equitable and that everyone would gain fairly. No sooner had he introduced that system to share the benefits fairly than he plunged down the road of the special savings accounts, designing a &euro;3 billion tax giveaway, not to be shared fairly across the board but only by those who could afford to make the savings. That approach meant that his valuable reforms turned to sand. Each year since, there has been no increase in tax credits. The tax credits system was a vehicle for real reform to make our taxation system fairer but it has not been seized. On the contrary, many people have lost faith in the fair<Col N="438" />ness of our tax code and do not see any changes today to make it more fair.</P>
    <P>Many people live overseas for 183 nights of the year and pay no tax in Ireland. Where is the fairness in that? Where is the fairness in a tax system which allows mega-directors to bring home invaluable art belonging to their companies, set it up in their homes and pay no tax but expects an employee who takes out his van in the evening to buy a pint of milk to pay tax on that benefit in kind? There is no fairness in such a tax code and we need to start reforming.</P>
    <P>We need to make sure that those who are availing of tax shelters, and some tax shelters may have valid reasons, at least pay a minimum amount of tax. We should have seen a move in this budget to ensure that people who avail of tax shelters will, at least, pay 20% of their incomes into tax if those incomes are very high.</P>

      <P>There has been no reform to bring a sense of fairness into the tax code. The budget will see one third of small income earners pushed up into the high rate of tax, but it will not address the need to create a fair tax code. This has been a missed opportunity.</P>
      <P>Reform could have been the hallmark of this budget. We could have begun a budgetary process early this year to restore principles of sound finance to the way we manage our funds. We could have gone back to the old virtues of sound evaluation, only paying out money based on principles of cost effectiveness. This would have been the complete opposite of the Punchestown approach adopted by the Minister. That should have been a bedrock issue in this budget. We should have seen a vigorous programme of reform on the back of the benchmarking opportunity. Public service reform could have delivered value. We should have seen a determined effort by the Government to champion the cause of consumers and not to continue to take money out of their pockets to pay for the misspent years. We should have seen a determination to restore fairness and balance to our tax and welfare codes. Instead we have left people at the bottom with precious little to survive on and we have done nothing about the clear inequities at the upper end of our tax code.</P>

      <P>We heard a mercifully short budget speech, as the Minister had predicted. The budget was short on ideas and short-sighted and the public has been short changed. This budget has one item of big news, which the Minister did not mention. This year again, he has implemented the biggest stealth tax of all. By freezing the standard rate tax band he has ensured that tens of thousands of workers will be moved on to the higher rate of tax.</P>
      <P>Last November the Minister answered a question of mine which showed that in 2002 27% of workers were in the top tax rate category, while this year 30.5% pay the top rate. In his Budget Statement the Minister said that last year saw an increase of 53,000 workers paying the top rate of tax while this year 62,000 workers will move on to the top rate. That is the biggest stealth tax of all and the Minister has not even spoken about it. One third of all taxpayers will pay the top rate of tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should go and play with some of the 10,000 houses that are supposed to have been provided. Apart from this it was a budget of silence. It was silent on health care, education, crime, medical card holders and child poverty, with an increase in child benefit of &euro;6 a month that would not buy a packet of Pampers. It was also silent on the savage 16 cuts.</P>
      <P>However, there are goodies for all in the programme of decentralisation. We have heard about it every year since 1999 and twice in an election year. We can expect decentralisation to be talked up as much as possible between now and the local elections and then the great silence will fall again. Is that the best the Minister for Finance can do? There are no indications in the budget that the Government has a grip on our country's economic and social future.</P>
      <P>I hear that all Ministers will receive bright new Mercedes cars. It is a pity that the policies are driven by the same old clapped out Progressive Democrats banger that seems to be driving the Government. This Administration squandered the boom and now seems set on frittering away the chances offered by the international recovery.</P>

They see the infrastructure in eastern European countries and elsewhere &ndash; the trams, trains, roads and public facilities. It is no wonder that they are angry and bemused on their return to this country where two hour traffic jams are routine and there is no sign of them being seriously sorted out.</P>
      <P>In this budget and the previous one the Government engineered a major shift in tax policy. In its first term it reduced personal taxation through lower rates of income tax. Now it has reversed engines and is increasing taxes through indirect and stealth taxes. The coming year will see another round of increases in such taxes. The House was informed about the increase in the price of duty on petrol today.</P>
      <P>I remind the House of the Minister's creations of last year's budget, Duncan and Mary, his own special fictional couple. They featured in last year's budget as the typical couple with two children who would benefit from modest tax changes. This year they are replaced by Joe and Sarah, on page C20 of the Budget Statement&mdash;</P>

      <P>Duncan and Mary have disappeared this year. The Budget Statement is strangely silent on stealth taxes. There is no mention of the cost of in-patient accommodation in hospitals which has risen 25% in 18 months. The cost of a visit to an accident and emergency department has increased by 42%, the drugs payment threshold by 46% and VHI subscriptions by 27% in the same period. So-called college registration fees have increased by 89% and motor tax by 17% since the general election. The list includes gas, ESB, and television licences. Bus fares will be increased by a further 4% to add to last year's 10% increase. There are petrol price rises and other increases in the budget.</P>
      <P>The key points of the Minister's policy shift is that these stealth taxes are regressive. The poor and those on low incomes will spend much more of their income on these. As far as the Minister is concerned, the more one has, the more one receives from the budget and the poorer one is, the more is taken away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to Joe and Sarah and people like them. The percentage of deductions from gross income for 2003 was <Col N="441" />15.5% compared with next year's 14.9%. When stealth taxes are deducted, such people will be considerably worse off and more of them will pay tax at the top rate.</P>
      <P>For five of the six budgets presented by the Minister for Finance, he redistributed income upwards. It was a unique achievement but he did it. Will the Minister consider the families on low incomes and those who work and take home very modest wages? I want a pro-work and a pro-opportunity economy. The Minister has little to offer to people who take home very low wages. Once again he has failed to take those on the minimum wage out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>The Government seems to have little or no interest in working people on low incomes. It has repeatedly made commitments on this issue but failed to deliver. Neither has it explored other avenues for dealing with the problem of low pay within the tax and social welfare code. It was agreed in Sustaining Progress that the national minimum wage would be increased to &euro;7 per hour in February 2004. The value of this welcome increase will be eroded because, in amending the tax code, the Minister did the bare minimum for very low income families with the increase in the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The Minister has increased the ceiling for PRSI from &euro;40,420 up to &euro;42,140, which is a relatively modest increase. It avoids the comprehensive reform of PRSI and the 2% health levy which the Minister promised down the years but never delivered. This will have an impact on low income families. People who will pay the extra PRSI are entitled to ask what they will get for it. Four or five of the savage 16 cuts involve longer contributory periods with fewer benefits. People who at present earn more than &euro;40,000 will pay more PRSI but will get nothing in return.</P>
      <P>The social insurance fund is in considerable surplus. Had the Minister implemented the reform to which he referred, it could be used to fund a decent system of parental leave. Irish parents have some of the worst entitlements in Europe to paid maternity and paternal leave. This affects the young people who buy houses many miles from Dublin, have a two hour commuting journey, spend a fortune on child care and have a lifestyle which is extremely difficult for them and their children. The Minister has offered them nothing in terms of reform. There is nothing of substance for child care in the budget. The child care crisis continues and the Government continues to pay lip-service to addressing it. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, my esteemed colleague in Dublin West, stated that the child care provisions were in last year's budget. Will the Minister deal with child care every second year in future budgets? It is not good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak about those on low incomes. The PRSI exemption limit of &euro;287 was not touched by the Minister. The Taoiseach will understand my point well because many of his constituents, like mine, are unfortunately on very low incomes. When a person earns more than that amount, the PRSI levy kicks in. Why has the Minister done nothing to stop this kind of trap? If the income of those on low levels of PRSI rises above &euro;365 a week, they also have to pay the 2% health levy for which they get almost nothing. This is what economists call a very high effective rate of tax.</P>
      <P>If a carer offering special assistance to the elderly is on this low income and accepts overtime offered by a health board, these levies will kick in rapidly. People will then have to make a choice between taking on extra work or falling into these traps. For working families on low incomes the lack of coherence between taxation and social welfare and the granting of medical cards means that many workers are faced with critical decisions about whether to earn more or risk losing benefits.</P>
      <P>The most blatant example concerns the issue of medical cards and I am sorry the Minister was not able to deal with it today, given that Christmas is coming. The failure to increase the medical card threshold means that when the minimum wage rises in February, more families will be faced with this harsh choice. A lone parent with two children, may be working part-time and be in receipt of the lone parent's allowance, even though with the cuts it is somewhat restricted. Should one or both of her &ndash; and it usually is a she &ndash; children be asthmatic, as an accountant I would seriously advise her to cut back on work so that she would fall back into the medical card eligibility threshold. If someone is just above that medical card threshold and working, he or she will face the cost of visiting a doctor in addition to purchasing medicine for asthma, which is very expensive. The new generation of such drugs can cost &euro;46 per dose.</P>
      <P>We are agreed on a pro-opportunity and pro-work approach but lone parents should not be asked to make that choice. It is regrettable that in the context of a better opening position for the budget than had been indicated previously, the Minister did not find the time or have the interest to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family income supplement is designed to help low income families and I welcome the fact that the applied limits are being increased. Last week, a father phoned me in tears because his wife, who is earning approximately &euro;300, will be subject to the cuts introduced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. I tried to explain to him that he would lose the half rate applying to his two children, which is &euro;16 divided by two. The Minister did not change the child dependant allowance rate today, even though it is designed to help very poor families. I tried to explain to that man the principle of the family income supplement. He is going back and <Col N="443" />forth, while his wife has obtained certificates from her employers, but with the money available to the Minister he could have undertaken a thorough overhaul of the PRSI system, the levy structure and the family income supplement. The Minister could have begun to move towards a refundable child-based tax credit system. On behalf of poor working families, I am sorry he did not choose that option.</P>
    <P>On his recent visit to Africa, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, obviously quoted Tony Blair &ndash; do we not all do so nowadays?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">

      <P>The Deputy should speak for herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>He described his approach to development aid as a hand up rather than a hand out. Deputy Cowen should have a word in the ear of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, because that expresses perfectly the approach he could have adopted in the budget, yet he managed to miss out on doing so. For years there has been an unspoken agreement in the House that social welfare reform should be pro-employment, pro-education and pro-training. It should be a hand up, rather than a hand out. That unspoken agreement has lasted for ten years. The leader of our party, Deputy Rabbitte, correctly said that the only breach in that was the proposal by the Tánaiste before the 1997 general election to take rent allowances away from lone parents. The punitive Progressive Democrats model was off the agenda until the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, was railroaded into accepting the &euro;58 million cutbacks announced in the Estimates. In this new McCreevy-style poor law, social welfare recipients who take up work or a CE place, or return to education, will have their opportunities reduced rather than expanded.</P>
      <P>The thrust of Government policy on welfare is clear, it is no longer concerned with providing avenues through which people can improve their situation, rather they are to be confined to the rolls of the welfare system, which is to become harsher. Nowhere is this more evident than in the savage 16 cuts in social welfare. This is the meanest series of measures implemented in the welfare code since the Minister's &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts. The 16 cuts have been roundly and rightly condemned by a wide spectrum of groups working to alleviate poverty, and they should be withdrawn. We have come to expect little from Fianna Fáil Ministers for Social Welfare but the least we could expect is that the current Minister would have fought her corner in Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the favourable opening position in today's budget, why does the Minister for Finance persist in creating fear in people suffering from diseases, such as coeliac, and those being treated for HIV or AIDS, whose dietary supplement allowance is now under threat? Every Deputy <Col N="444" />knows, particularly those from the greater Dublin area, that the poorest people in failing health qualify for the dietary supplement, the cost of which is minuscule. I urge the Minister to rethink this matter which hardly constitutes a blip in the context of the &euro;40 billion the Government will be spending next year.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, when the Taoiseach performed the ceremony at the present tree for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, he seemed shocked by the figures which showed that 70,000 children are living in consistent poverty. The misery index of living in consistent poverty includes not having warm clothes, not eating decent food four or five days a week and families not being able to pay their bills regularly to avoid falling deeper into debt. The misery index comprises six or seven such items but if a child is affected by two or three of them he or she will be living in poor circumstances. The Minister has made promises with regard to alleviating child poverty, but once the pre-election child benefit payments were made, the commitment to dealing with child poverty was dropped.</P>
    <P>Today's &euro;6 increase in child benefit is modest in the extreme and way below the promises the Minister made, but yet again he has left child dependant allowances frozen. We could afford radical improvements in payments to lower income families but the lack of imagination on the Minister's part is disappointing. For example, he should examine the possibility of introducing refundable tax credits for children. Increasing child benefit is one of the best ways of assisting the reduction of child poverty but it is miserable to give such a small increase in child benefit, while leaving the child dependant allowances untouched.</P>
    <P>Unless it is hidden in the small print, the Government has failed to respond to the call by the Combat Poverty Agency for a hot meals scheme for deprived children in disadvantaged areas. I have visited schools, as I am sure the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern have done, where children get a small hot meal in the morning. Otherwise they would get nothing to eat as they come from very poor homes. The Combat Poverty Agency costed that provision for disadvantaged areas at approximately &euro;11 million. My only reference to Punchestown was that it cost &euro;15 million. I do not understand why one can be a priority but the other does not command an equal level of priority at the very least.</P>
    <P>This year is the 40th anniversary of the death of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. One of the great society moves in the United States 40 years ago was the introduction of what was then called the American head start programme for children under the age of five. Those children have been tracked by American academics for the past 30 to 40 years. We all talk about value for money but for every $1 dollar spent on each child participating in the head start programme in poor communities, the American state saved $8 per head <Col N="445" />in reduced crime and health care costs. As they grew up, more of those children went to college, owned their own homes and, more importantly, became successfully employed. We require a similar consensus among politicians in this House that children who are poor count and that we will put the money towards their needs.</P>
    <P>As the Minister spoke I waited to hear him make announcements of substance on current spending. I wanted to hear some more acknowledgement of the needs of people with disabilities. I welcome the &euro;25 million allocation but having met most of the disability organisations I am aware they were looking for &euro;50 million in terms of a very modest programme. We all know the sacrifices made by parents and siblings where there is a person with a disability in the household. People with disabilities in the centres for independent living made very modest requests also. The &euro;25 million is a very poor response in the context of the &euro;40 billion overall spend.</P>
    <P>The White Paper last week and the opening position show that there is room to tackle crime, for example. We know now that the Government has no intention of recruiting the extra 2,000 gardaí it promised, but it could at least put some additional resources into tackling juvenile crime. The juvenile justice system is in crisis and that has been the case for years. The result of that is obvious. Communities live in fear of teenage gangs and if those gangs are left unchecked, they go on to become adult gangsters. Investment in juvenile justice would be money well spent but there is nothing in this budget to show that this is a Government with a coherent agenda to tackle crime, nor is there anything on hospital waiting lists. It is difficult to believe that the Minister for Finance is a member of a Government which has 155 days remaining to honour its promise to end hospital waiting lists forever. I do not see anything in the budget on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Radio listeners last week might have been somewhat taken aback to hear an urgent message from the health board in the eastern region asking people not to come to any of the Dublin accident and emergency units because of overcrowding. I suggest that might become a regular public information announcement on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and on other programmes. At 7.50 a.m. Emma from AA Roadwatch will tell us about the problems at the Red Cow roundabout and other road blocks and traffic jams, and at 8.10 a.m. the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will bring us &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Trolleywatch&rdquo;, sponsored by the Fianna Fáil-PD.com Government, the broken promises website, because that is what is in this budget for health.</P>

      <P>Today the Minister announced his long-promised multi-annual budget for the road programmes but we have heard a number of multi-annual budgeting promises over the past few years. We had the national development <Col N="446" />plan, and we know the status of that. Several years later we do not even have a tunnel of the right height. We had the Fianna Fáil manifesto which made extravagant and attractive promises, and now we have the promised multi-annual budget. As a technique it is welcome but what about the commitment made by the Taoiseach to deal with price inflation in construction projects? The national development plan was launched in 1999, yet only today are we hearing a commitment to try to deal with the spiralling costs. What happened to the Taoiseach's commitment to change the tendering procedures so that larger contracts would be awarded and major players in the European market attracted to bid? I wonder if today's proposals will go the same route of much talk but relatively little delivered.</P>
      <P>It is close to Christmas and there is plenty of bright, new wrapping paper in the shops. If one reads the small print of the announcements concerning the capital budget, one will note a dozen old programmes still unfulfilled and presented to the public under gleaming new wraps, but when the wrapping is torn, the same old promises are inside. Under the national development plan there is an ambitious agenda for primary schools, a multi-annual programme if ever there was one. My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, will deal with that matter in detail later, but &euro;30 million will go nowhere towards meeting the kinds of ambitions the school programme would require and fulfilling Fianna Fáil's promises.</P>

      <P>Year after year the conditions in substandard schools worsen. In terms of costs, we are unique here in that 30 year old school buildings are being condemned and replaced by new school buildings. That is being done because we cut back on the regular and routine maintenance of those buildings. Our form of economics is crazy. In every other country in the world the lifespan of school buildings can be 100 years, yet many of our schools appear to have only a 30 year life span. That is because the maintenance and heating programmes are so poor that schools are becoming clapped out. They cannot even be repaired and they have to be replaced. That represents bad value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The roads programme has gone through bewildering shifts of policy and announcements by the Minister for Transport, promoted by a bewildering range of publicity, which I am sure his fellow Ministers must envy. A week after last year's budget, the Minister for Finance came into this House and unwrapped the Holy Grail which would transform the capital programme. That was the development of the National Develop<Col N="447" />ment Finance Agency. That was Fianna Fáil's bright idea in budget 2003. If one checks the back of the Budget Statement where the work of the National Development Finance Agency is described, one will note that it is considering 40 projects, which is approximately ten more than was mentioned last year. It has done nothing about them &ndash; it is considering them. If this was Fianna Fáil's bright idea, it has not gone very far.</P>
    <P>On the transport programme and the national spatial strategy, we broadly welcome the notion of decentralisation but we await what will happen in that regard.</P>
    <P>In terms of the share of national wealth, not spending on our national investment programme is bad economics. Instead of a renewed boost to capital investment, the Minister has stood still. When inflation is added, there is nothing fantastic here and that message has not been lost abroad. One well regarded free market international index has pushed Ireland seven points further down on the index for competitive growth. It cites one outstanding reason for Ireland's fall, namely, its glaring deficiency in infrastructure. We can already see the warning signs. The Ernst &amp; Young European investment monitor for 2003 reports that the number of new investment projects into Ireland decreased by 55% in the past two years. The figures reveal just 51 new investment projects attracted into Ireland in 2002. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, commiserated with the workers at Penn in Mullingar where over 100 jobs were axed today. Whether it is creamery jobs in Cork or manufacturing jobs in Mullingar, a daily toll of traditional manufacturing jobs are lost and they are not being adequately replaced.</P>
    <P>By contrast, Portugal managed to boost project share by 23%, as did most of the accession countries. It is small wonder that the Tánaiste wants out of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and into a more comfortable slot in Government. We are losing jobs in industry and the public service and 40% of new jobs are part-time. The jobs haemorrhage has become deadly serious and requires a major switch in policy to complement our existing incentives. What does the budget do to stem this loss?</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of one of our most successful enterprises, Kerry Foods, hit the nail on the head when he urged a rapid move to knowledge-based industry as the safest antidote to the loss of existing manufacturing industries. I doubt he will see much evidence in this budget that the Minister has heard his message. This business leader specifically stressed the part that graduate employment can play in the move to this new type of industry. In response, the Minister has frozen the current budget for universities and institutes of technology. Astonishingly, he has reduced their building programmes by 45%. What does this say to those institutes of higher education that are supposed to be the catalyst that will attract knowledge industries? Investment in this level of education is an integral part <Col N="448" />of economic investment. While we recognise investment in trains as part of the infrastructure programme, investment in brains is no less important. We should invest in both trains and brains and, between them, we will get a knowledge economy. Alas, that economy will not come from this Minister.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I heard the greatest of our public servants, T. K. Whitaker, deliver a lecture that set out in one simple sentence the case for capital taxes. He said that it could not be right or proper that the profits from speculation would be taxed more favourably than income from work. It is as simple as that. One third of our people will now pay tax at the 42% rate if they work overtime. If one makes a profit from shares or land, one will pay 20% tax. I am not surprised that the yield from capital gains tax has increased with this absurdly low rate. If someone has the chance to take income or shift activity into capital gains tax, he or she will do it. It would be mad to opt to pay a higher rate if by using the tax code one can shift one's income. People do this all the time through management companies. There is a quiet conspiracy of silence to pretend that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>In a recent exam, the Institute of Taxation set a question where the examinee was asked to establish a scheme enabling a client to take advantage of the lower tax rate by choosing to take a portion of his or her earnings and profits through an appropriate mechanism of capital gains. I am sorry the Minister is no longer here as we suffered together at these exams a long time ago.</P>
    <P>The current issue of <i>Accountancy Ireland,</i> a magazine I no longer often read, has a how to do it example comparing capital acquisition tax and discretionary trust taxes. I hope the officials from the Revenue Commissioners are taking note of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They probably wrote it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they did not. It sets out an example showing how to avoid capital acquisition tax and use discretionary trusts. By using the discretionary trust, the tax is &euro;273,000, yet if one uses capital acquisition tax, the tax bill is over &euro;1 million. This simple device of tax planning, that even I could do at this stage, presents a saving of &euro;744,000. What excuse does the Minister have for allowing this to continue? It is outrageous that this should be allowed.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a true disciple of the neo-conservative agenda and would be warmly welcomed at any revivalist rally on the lawn of the White House. While President Bush and his acolytes have the same agenda, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was a true believer of that faith long before them. The American billionaire Warren Buffet believes in paying taxes and feels it is good for millionaires to do this as well as everybody else. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" />Giving one class of taxpayer a break requires &ndash; now or down the line &ndash; that an equivalent burden be imposed on other parties. In other words, if I get a break, someone else pays. Government can't deliver a free lunch to the country as a whole. It can, however, determine who pays for lunch.</P>
    <P>Guess who is paying for lunch this year? The extra 62,000 workers who have moved on to the 42% rate courtesy of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that contrary to what the Taoiseach has mentioned a few times, the Government has done nothing about taxes on windfall gains. It has not adopted the sensible suggestion from the National Economic and Social Council that it should claw back, for the public benefit, some of the windfall gains that will come to certain owners and developers directly from the State's investment programme. The national spatial strategy and the roads and rail programmes have the potential to dramatically increase the value of large parcels of land. These added values arise directly from public decisions and public investment. Are we to sit on our hands while huge profits are once again made through rezoning and development? If the community at large is to benefit from these measures, we need some form of tax on windfall gains made from buying and selling land for development purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science had to pay &euro;700,000 an acre for the site of a new primary school in Dublin West. These prices are a king's ransom and arise from the escalation in development land prices from rezoning and public investment. Taxpayers have to pay on the double. We pay to provide roads and services and, from next March, young people buying new houses will have to pay more because of the new levies. Taxpayers must then pay again to buy school lands at inflated prices of development land.</P>
    <P>Last year we heard tough talk from the Minister about eliminating tax breaks and shelters. While he closed some shelters last year he opened others, such as the &euro;63 million granted over a number of years to investors under the private hospital proposal. Many bottles of pink champagne will be opened today, and page B.6 of the budget booklet outlines the schemes that have been extended, many of them significantly. The revenue survey of the top 400 taxpayers, published last year, outlined that those taxpayers shared approximately &euro;70 million in property-based tax breaks. We now see that this is to be extended and the Minister does not even give us a cost for the expenditure forgone. I bet it is more than is being spent on poor children, or the &euro;25 million, welcome as it is, that is being given to disability services.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago an advertisement appeared in Sunday newspapers seeking investors in a proposed new hospital in Galway. While the Minister has talked about closing down tax shelters, he has extended them today and significantly increased their cost to the taxpaying public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" />I congratulate the film industry and I am glad the Minister saw sense on this issue. Recent debate, discussion and examination of this sector at the Committee on Finance and the Public Service helped to expose some of the abuses under the current system. It is excellent that the scheme will be revised and, I hope, no longer the subject of future abuse.</P>
    <P>The final taxation issue I wish to address concerns non-residents and residency requirements. I was disturbed recently by a reply I received from the Minister to a question I tabled on the number of non-residents for tax purposes. Astonishingly, it emerged that the Department does not appear to keep records because he was unable to provide me with figures. The issue of non-residents for tax purposes is fast becoming as great a scandal as the Ansbacher accounts and is causing a loss of tax revenue as significant as the bogus non-resident accounts of yesteryear.</P>
    <P>It is bewildering for ordinary, compliant taxpayers to witness the extraordinary phenomenon of business leaders, who conduct a full commercial and social life in the State, mysteriously becoming non-resident based on their own say-so, with apparently little or no effort by Revenue or the Department to insist on observance of the rules. At a minimum, the budget should have included a commitment to review the residency requirements in our tax code. Currently, it is possible to become a non-resident if an individual spends less than 183 days in the State in one year or 280 days on aggregate over two years. A day only counts if an individual is present in the State at the end of the day, namely, midnight. This is Christmas pantomime stuff.</P>

      <P>Provided Cinderella &ndash; Prince Charming would be more apt considering most of those involved are men &ndash; is out of the State at midnight, the day does not count. I have a mental picture of certain well-known individuals earnestly watching the clock to ensure they are out of the State at the dreaded stroke of midnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our rules in this regard are immensely more generous and relaxed than those operating in other jurisdictions, which is unacceptable in an era of low taxes. I welcome people making money, succeeding in business and showing initiative and enterprise. I am delighted that many of the people with whom I went to college are now millionaires and many of my former students have done very well. I do not agree, however, that having done so well, they can then decide not to contribute their fair share of taxation. This is unacceptable. The kind of crony arrangement which appears to exist between parts of the Government and some of the individuals in question saps the contract between the compliant, honest taxpayer and the State. It needs to be changed. Other states, including the United Kingdom, have longer periods during which one must be out of the country to claim <Col N="451" />non-resident status, while in the United States the issue is linked to citizenship. These are issues we need to explore.</P>
    <P>We are tolerating a breed of stateless people who are paying no contribution anywhere. They are akin to the ill-fated ship, the <i>Prestige,</i> which ran aground on the coast of Galicia &ndash; they sail the seas with no flag to indicate where they are owned and are subject to neither accountability nor responsibility. While I welcome the participation and success of these individuals, a fair taxation system requires that they pay their fair share. These lords of commerce behave with all the arrogance of a feudal aristocracy. It is time they learned the lesson of the Boston tea party, namely, that representation and taxation go together.</P>
    <P>For people who may have been watching this debate on television, the budget means more tax breaks for the very wealthy because it has done nothing to plug the loophole which allows some of them to get away with paying no tax and the Minister even extended a number of schemes. For people who are earning little money, the budget contains virtually nothing. The budget contains little for families with many children. As we approach the festive period, many families are facing pressure to create a happy Christmas for their children. The Minister passed an opportunity to make it a happy occasion for such children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Finance has left the Chamber as I wanted to acknowledge his achievement in introducing his seventh successive budget. It is worth acknowledging as it is unprecedented in modern times. Although one has the impression of a Minister who has been in office permanently, in terms of longevity he is only the fourth longest serving Minister for Finance after Seán McEntee, Ernest Blythe and James Ryan and I suspect he will maintain that position. I note the Taoiseach has also left the Chamber.</P>
      <P>We do not know if the Minister will introduce an eighth budget. If this is his last will and testament as Minister for Finance, it is a deflating document. This is the Minister who, in his first budget in 1997, asked to be judged not on one budget but on the pattern of reforms introduced over time. If this budget is the work of a reforming Minister, he is long past his sell-by date. In my contribution on last year's budget, I stated he had introduced six budgets too many. This is now his seventh. Seven is a significant number, which is open to creative interpretation by sub-editors. Perhaps the Minister is hoping to see a headline stating, &ldquo;McCreevy in Seventh Heaven&rdquo; tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take the Minister at his word and examine not only this budget but the totality of his seven budgets. This is a Minister whose very philosophy should be regarded in terms of seven deadly sins. In his first budget he cut capital <Col N="452" />gains tax from 40% to 20%. He clearly believes in the philosophy that there are only two types of person, those who work for money and those who make money work for them. It has been clear from his subsequent budgets which group of people he favours. In 1998, he followed the reduction in capital gains tax with a cut in capital acquisitions tax from 40% to 20%.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the Minister's statement when introducing his first budget that ruthless cutting of public expenditure in some areas might benefit the economy in the short-term but would have a lethal long-term effect on individuals and families on the margins. On the surface, the Minister seems to be a wise man but from experience we have learned we cannot believe a word he says. While he says one thing, he does exactly the opposite in terms of the effect of his budgetary policies.</P>
    <P>In his second budget, the Minister stated that tax increases on energy and fuels could reduce emissions and bring about more efficient use of these products and that the revenue raised could be used to reduce taxation in other areas such as labour. If he was radical, he would have acted on this statement, yet five years later he failed to even mention the issue in the budget. Last year, he referred to it when he promised to take action by the end of 2004. This is the face value on which we must take the Minister and the reason we must believe that he is on his way out.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced individualisation in his third budget, a change which enhanced his credo as much as any other measure. While it was an excellent initiative for young single workers, it marked a statement of intent for those in partnerships who chose to care for children or incapacitated relatives without remuneration. This remains the position four years later.</P>
    <P>In 2001 the Minister introduced the special savings investment accounts which, as many of us believe, are election bribes. They are due to come to fruition in 2006. They will buy the votes which the Government is unable to win through its inept efforts to implement policies which are not winning favour with the electorate. That money, if effectively used, could have provided the schools, hospitals and community centres for which many in our communities are crying out. They have been told they must wait because the fourth richest country in the world in terms of GDP has chosen not to provide them.</P>
    <P>In 2002 we had the smash and grab budget. The Minister made his books balance by dipping into the social insurance fund to the tune of &euro;600 million. The Minister has constantly reconfigured the figures in every budget he has introduced and today is another example.</P>
    <P>In 2003 we had the decision about first-time home buyers. That grant was added to the price of a house and it was something from which property developers and builders ultimately benefited. However, when it was taken away, the prices remained the same or increased. Where was the <Col N="453" />benefit for first-time house buyers? What measures has the Government put in place since then?</P>
    <P>This is the Minister's seventh budget. While it changes little, its statement of intent is clear. The decision to extend property reliefs in a range of areas has no practical economic benefit for the country. It only benefits those whom we assume are supporters of the Government. Why are we continuing to give tax benefits for building car parks and holiday homes? Why are we giving any tax relief on property when property values are buoyant? We welcome the decision to extend film relief and the business expansion scheme. However, the Bob the Builder type political pay-off, which Fianna Fáil seems unwilling to relinquish, is not a price that should be paid. It sends out all the wrong signals to the electorate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided not to increase tax bands and allowances in line with inflation for the second successive year. That is his revenge for benchmarking. If he cannot justify benchmarking in terms of productivity or link it with the move to the new relocation centres, he will try to push as many workers as possible into the top income tax band and get as much of the benchmarking payments back as possible. It is a cynical use of the tax system and the Minister must be brought to account for it.</P>
    <P>The social welfare increases are at the bottom end of the scale. They are less than what was demanded by non-governmental organisations. They do nothing other than encourage people who are in that position to stand still. We have not heard an apology from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance for the fact that this remains the most unequal country in Europe in terms of how we distribute our income. All we get are invectives against organisations, such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society. There is a lack of acknowledgement that its services have increased by 80% in the past year alone. There is a lack of recognition that homelessness has increased by 247% since the Government came to power in 1997. If the Government believes that is a road we should travel, it will not have many supporters outside this Chamber.</P>
    <P>The budget is a scam in terms of decentralisation &ndash; it is office relocation. The decisions which will be made by the Government will continue to be centralised. It does not matter to the people affected by such decisions whether they are made in Nenagh, Sligo or Dublin. There will a benefit in terms of relieving pressure on Dublin and there will be an economic advantage to the towns where these offices are relocated, but the Government should not insult us by referring to it as decentralisation. We want to see proper decentralisation where the apparatus of Government is dismantled and decisions are made in the areas where the people affected by them live. That is not the inclination of the Government.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed with the Government's reaction to green taxation. We want to reform all taxation. We should pay less tax on labour and <Col N="454" />more on resources. We have told the Government that year after year. The Minister mentioned it five years ago. He has set up many commissions, one of which is still in existence. Yet action has not been taken. Even if the agreement of which that commitment is part is under question, we have an international commitment to reduce our emissions so that they account for only a 13% increase over 1990 levels. The figure is currently at 31% and increasing. I fear that the Minister has once again succumbed to the pillow talk of IBEC on this issue. If we are interested in a balanced and fair taxation system, such initiatives should be put in place.</P>
    <P>I could be wrong and the Minister could present an eighth budget. He might present it as the eight beatitudes budget &ndash; blessed are the horse traders budget. We see the cynicism attached to how Government operates in the decentralisation programme where Ministers seem to have successfully carved out the Departments which will be located in their constituencies. I do not think the national spatial strategy was the criterion used for the location of these Departments. This is a political consideration. It is an attempt to maximise votes for Ministers and backbench Government Deputies. The Progressive Democrats, who are absent from the House, must be taken to account for indulging in such Fianna Fáil chicanery.</P>

      <P>We must also consider how decisions are made about infrastructure. The Minister's words rang hollow when he spoke about providing infrastructure. He introduced the concept of envelopes. I thought the Government had enough envelopes in terms of infrastructural development in this country. We want a political commitment that the overspend, particularly the &euro;250 million overspend by the National Roads Authority every year, will be stopped, that those who benefit from wasteful expenditure on projects which are not required will no longer be able to do so and that infrastructural programmes will be prioritised. We want a public transport system which is not worse than that in many of the EU accession countries, despite having lower standards of living. The Government does not move in those circles. The supporters of the Government do not see the benefits of providing such infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Punchestown mentality has infected the Government. While there are expectations that vital infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals and community facilities, will be provided, the people see how a decision is made instantaneously and without question, that money is added sub<Col N="455" />sequently and that those who benefit are known to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Speaking after the publication of the Estimates a few weeks ago, Father McVerry, a Ballymun-based priest who has dealt with disadvantaged young people for the best part of his adult life, said that the poor in society have been shown the two fingers by the Government. Those are strong words. Any hope that the Government might have had a change of heart between then and now has disappeared in the aftermath of the Minster's Budget Statement. This is the seventh budget in what is a seemingly endless and vicious assault on working people and the working poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance spoke of a better deal for all in society. That is the spin that will be propagated tonight by the various Fianna Fáil and PD Ministers and backbenchers. In the next few days people who are elderly, unemployed, or in hospital, will consult the newspapers to see how the budget provisions will affect them, although it must be borne in mind that the newspapers will put their own spin <Col N="456" />on the budget. Many will conclude that there is nothing in the budget for them. Some may look forward to a &euro;10 per week increase in their incomes, but when they realise the number of stealth tax increases introduced by the Government they will conclude that they will be hardly any better off, despite the assurances and the illusion created in the budget that things would change for them.</P>
    <P>There was much speculation as to whether the budget would seriously tackle disadvantage. It makes little or no attempt in this area. It is a minimalist budget designed to placate Government backbenchers in the approach to the elections to be held next year. It has done nothing to address the gross inequality that exists in society. The Minister's miserly increases in social welfare, that barely stay above the rate of inflation, have been wiped out by other cuts in social welfare payments already announced and by the introduction of numerous stealth taxes during the year.</P>
    <P>On taxation, the Minister has left his big business friends, the high flying executives, untouched. The wealthy can once again rest assured that millions of euro buried in off-shore accounts will not be touched. Unfortunately, the Minister has again failed to take all those on the minimum wage out of the tax net. The Government had the opportunity to do so at little extra cost, yet the Minister once again flunked taking this action.</P>
    <P>The Minister's announcement of an extra &euro;30 million for school buildings is useless as it will go nowhere towards addressing the chronic needs of children, especially when it is estimated that primary schools alone need &euro;300 million a year in extra funding.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin welcomes the decentralisation of Departments in principle, but questions the timing of the announcement given that it has been in the pipeline for over four years. I will reserve judgment until we see the detail because I fear that what is being done now is designed to impact on next year's local elections and allow Fianna Fáil councillors to make grandiose claims about job opportunities in their constituencies. Ultimately, this is yet another failed opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tinkered at the edges of the taxation system when fundamental and real reform is required. He has done nothing to end inequality. Legalised taxation evasion is rife in this State. The Government has created a tax system where the top earners can pay little or no tax. In 2002, a survey of the top 400 earners found that 117 had an effective tax rate of less than 30%, this in a system where over 500,000 PAYE workers are paying income tax at the top rate of 42%. I am one of those who pays income tax at that rate.</P>

The exact cost to the <Col N="457" />State of the lower tax revenue generated by 20 tax relief schemes is not known, nor are we provided with a proper assessment of the benefit to the economy of these reliefs.

      <P>Other tax relief schemes cover private hospitals, deduction of foreign earnings, investments in life assurance undertakings, off-shore life and collective investment products and the rent a room scheme. We do not know how much is being given in tax relief under these schemes.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that Sinn Féin is not calling for the outright abolition of these reliefs, merely that there should be a cost-benefit analysis of all them so that a judgment can be made on their value to society.</P>
      <P>A top income tax rate of 50% for individuals earning over &euro;400,000 per annum and an increase in the capital gains tax rate to 40% would provide the kind of resources we need to invest in health, education and vital infrastructure. Why is it that workers pay tax at 40% but their wealthy bosses have seen their capital gains tax set at 20%? Employers' PRSI could be returned to a rate of 12% as employers' payroll tax is the lowest in the EU. A rate of 12% is still an internationally competitive figure. However, this would mean the Government would have to stand up to IBEC, and for the last six years this Government has served merely as IBEC's front operation in Leinster House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>Corporation tax could be increased to allow the State to have an increased benefit from companies that have been set up in Ireland. However, the Government prefers to invest in tax breaks. Since 1997, the tax breaks introduced by <Col N="458" />this and the previous coalition Government has resulted in the allocation of only 5% of budgetary provisions to the bottom 20% of earners.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed yet again to move towards the stated objective in An Agreed Programme for Government of taking everyone on a minimum wage out of the tax net. Currently, approximately 90% of minimum wage earners are kept out of the net. With the minimum wage set to rise to &euro;7 an hour next year that is likely to decrease, making the Government's ambition all the harder to achieve.</P>
      <P>The Government has persisted in the use of stealth taxes and service charges as a way of making money. This is regressive taxation of the worst kind that hits the low paid and the no paid worst of all. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has again stated that these charges, including the bin tax increases and the increases in hospital and GP, fuel, transport and education charges, are the biggest factor in rising poverty and growing inequality in this State.</P>
      <P>However, the Government maintains this rising inequality is not happening. It maintains those who argue otherwise are imagining things. It believes that poverty does not exist. The Government promised the people that child benefit would rise to &euro;149.50 and &euro;185.40 for the two respective rates by this budget. Under the terms of Sustaining Progress it promised to implement these increases in the budgets of 2004 and 2005. However, the increases announced today amount to less than &euro;1.50 per week and fall short of those figures. They are &euro;16 short for the lower rate, and &euro;20 short for the higher rate. These are the increases the Government must deliver next year in order to make good its promises, albeit two years late. At the current rate of spending, however, it will fall short.</P>
      <P>A paltry &euro;1 million has been allocated to expand the school meals programme. Again we are told that there is no poverty, that children do not go to school hungry, but the Government only gives &euro;1 million to expand this programme, which everybody working in the field feels is the best way to tackle the problem of children going to school hungry. There is no money for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. Of all categories of society, children, particularly the 300,000 living in poverty, have done the worst out of this budget and have been betrayed the most blatantly.</P>
      <P>Means tests for carers have still not been abolished. Carers receive less than half as much as they would if they were foster parents and do as much if not more work. The amount of the carer's allowance is a disgrace considering the amount of money saved by carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the increase in the amount provided for school buildings, I am aware that it is far below what is needed. The move to multiannual funding is welcomed but &euro;200 million per year is &euro;100 million less than the amount the INTO and the Department of Education and Science say is needed over a five-year period. <Col N="459" />That is what is needed to eliminate the school building waiting list and to ensure our children are educated in a safe and secure environment. We also need more supports to encourage children to attend school. The National Educational Welfare Board received little joy in the budget. It can currently only cater for 26% of schools despite the recommendation of an independent consultant that it needs a staff of 363 to fulfil its legal obligation by the end of this year. It is provided with less than a third of that number. The Minister has failed to provide sufficient funding to meet the needs of the NEWB and to meet the demands of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. Children who fall through the cracks every day will pay the price. Young people tend to pay the price for various measures at the hands of this Government. The urgent need for a mere &euro;5 million for funding for youth work as outlined by the National Youth Council of Ireland has also been ignored by the Minister. While the capital investment in primary schools is welcome, it comes at the cost of investment in third level education. In 2002 the Government spent &euro;125 million in capital investment in institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>Increased health charges hit hardest those whose incomes are just above the limits for medical card qualification. The extension of the medical card scheme is one of Fianna Fáil's biggest broken election promises. Even those on the minimum wage will not be eligible for a medical card once the minimum wage is increased to &euro;7 per hour. According to the most recent OECD study on health spending, we still lag behind the EU average in terms of investment in health.</P>
    <P>This budget was a missed opportunity for the Government to tackle poverty and inequality in our society. The Minister has often spoken of how prosperous this State has been over the last five or six years. He talks about the success of the Celtic tiger and he has not been slow in taking credit for it. Such statements show a basic lack of understanding of economic theory. Almost 100 years ago James Connolly spoke of economic growth, saying that purely capitalistic prosperity is &ldquo;prosperity gauged merely by the volume of wealth produced, and entirely ignoring the manner in which the wealth is distributed amongst the workers who produce it.&rdquo;  Talking about the wealth produced without considering how it is distributed is the kind of shallow and childish economic thinking of which the Minister is capable. If the economy is growing but the workers and the poor are not benefiting, we are even worse off. Can the Government truly claim that growth is benefiting the people of our society?</P>
    <P>This budget, like last year's and the one before it, represents the failure of the Government to tackle inequality in our society. This will have long-term implications. The Government has failed the working class, the poor, the disadvantaged, the vulnerable and the voiceless. As long as it remains in power inequality and poverty are <Col N="460" />inevitable, as it pursues the interests of its own class, the business class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On budget day most people will check out the tax bands, the old age pensions, the increases in VAT, VRT and excise duty and so on &ndash; whatever is of immediate concern to them. That is human nature. That is what we all do &ndash; we first look to see how something will affect us as individuals. There will be varying reactions to that immediate scrutiny. However, it is only when we look at the bigger picture, the wider framework of the Estimates and the budget, that the truth begins to dawn. This is a budget of illusions &ndash; now you see it, now you do not. The Minister for Finance is a master at creating illusions. All he is missing is the long black cape, top hat and magic wand &ndash; but perhaps he only uses the magic wand when he wants to quieten Fianna Fáil backbenchers when they growl but do not bite.</P>
      <P>To go back to reality, or should I say illusion, phrases such as &ldquo;I am providing an additional amount&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have decided to allocate&rdquo;, &ldquo;I propose to increase&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am today providing&rdquo; permeate the Minister's speech, as though in some way he is putting his hand in his own pocket and giving us his money. That is just the first illusion &ndash; that it is his money or the Government's money, when it is our money, that of the taxpayer. The Minister's job is to collect that money, spend it wisely and ensure we obtain value for the money we entrust to him.</P>
      <P>The second illusion centres on the amounts spent. I am tired listening to Ministers telling us how much they spend, millions and billions, as though that in itself is supposed to mean something. What matters is how they spend it. Does it deliver the services we need and pay for? Does it deliver the world-class health service we were promised? Not according to those on waiting lists or hospital trolleys or those who marched in Nenagh and Ennis to prevent the closure of their accident and emergency services. Does it mean that carers, those who work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, year after year, are entitled to an adequate carer's allowance? The current miserly allowance is &euro;129.60 per week. Does it mean that if a carer is in receipt of another social welfare benefit he or she will still be eligible for carer's allowance? In other words, if somebody is receiving an old age pension or a one-parent family allowance will he or she qualify for carer's allowance? As of today, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister's allocation of an extra &euro;25 million to those with physical and sensory disabilities &ndash; just &euro;10 million more than he gave to Punchestown &ndash; mean that he will provide the required service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Does the spending of billions on infrastructure ensure that projects are delivered on time with no <Col N="461" />significant cost overruns and that we as taxpayers obtain value for money? Does the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General assure us that our money is being well spent? No &ndash; it tells us that hundreds of millions of euro are being squandered, disappearing into some kind of fiscal black hole. That lack of expertise in the planning, cost control and delivery of major infrastructural projects reveals a gross inadequacy in the systems of the Department of Finance. If the Department was as expert at controlling the cost of major infrastructural projects as it is at conjuring up miserly cutbacks we would have billions to spend where it is badly needed.</P>
      <P>Another illusion constantly being put forward by the Government is that we have a regime of low taxes. I said when I spoke on the Estimates in regard to the advertisement paid for by our tax moneys which we hear everyday, &ldquo;Know the price or pay the price&rdquo;&ndash; if only it was that simple. We are paying the price of electing a Government which taxes us by stealth, which not only cuts back but claws back. Stealth taxes are well named. Like the thief who comes in the night, they are uninvited, unwelcome and unwanted. Stealth taxes aim to create the illusion that there is a low tax regime when in fact indirect taxation is rocketing. For example, the Government takes over 40% of the cost of a new house in taxes. Part of the cost of benchmarking is being passed over to the local authorities so that service charges will increase and huge development levies ranging from &euro;5,000 to up to &euro;18,000 are being put on new houses. Coupled with the abolition of the first time buyer's grant in the last budget, the VAT hike, house prices are now outside the range of the ordinary individual. An increase of 5% per litre in the cost of petrol and diesel will contribute hugely to costs over a wide area and will reduce our competitiveness even further internationally.</P>
      <P>Today the Minister for Finance spoke of public private partnerships. One could say they are a reality, not an illusion, but they help to create the illusion that we are not borrowing to pay for these projects. Somehow the Minister for Finance conjures the money out of the air and the projects simply appear. This is because the initial capital cost, as such, disappears off the public expenditure balance sheet for this year.</P>
      <P>What did the Minister for Finance say today? He said the real stealth tax is borrowing. Using public private partnerships is long-term borrowing. As with all stealth taxes, like the thief in the night it will creep upon us next year and the year after and the year after that. For 20 to 25 years significant payments will have to be made from the public purse to the private companies involved. This Minister is borrowing or stealth taxing by another name. He is remortgaging the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy is not only remortgaging the house, he is making decisions for every Minister for Finance and every budget for the next 20 to 25 years. At the same time he is creating the <Col N="462" />illusion that he is the man who is delivering. There is one good thing about it. He did not manage to pull the wool over the eyes of those in Brussels. The European Commission wants to clarify ESA 95 principles on the national accounting of public private partnerships. In other words, private resources for public projects must show up in our national accounts as public expenditure.</P>
    <P>If Deputy McCreevy wants to use public private partnerships to finance infrastructural projects &ndash; and that is an issue that should be subject to evaluation by the Comptroller and Auditor General as to whether it delivers a cost-effective means of borrowing money &ndash; then the price must be accounted for now so that we are not in the realm of illusion whereby projects come on stream and nobody seems to be paying for them. We could say the Minister for Finance is not just taxing this generation by stealth, he will tax the next generation by stealth. Some 20 years from now the next generation will be paying for Deputy McCreevy's projects. That is the kind of illusion even Houdini would be proud of.</P>
    <P>Not only is he remortgaging our future, he is selling part of our past. The cut in the Estimates for Teagasc ensured that it must sell property just to keep afloat and manage day-to-day spending. There is the illusion that somebody's head is well above the water when they are standing on quicksand. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, said in this House two weeks ago that while no funding for capital development purposes was being directly provided from the Exchequer in 2004, Teagasc would be able to use part of the retained proceeds from the sale of its assets in 2003 and 2004 to fund its capital programme for next year. It is like selling one's house just to fund living expenses. The only problem is that when the house in sold there is no point in going to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, for rent supplement because one simply will not get it.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance said dramatic strides were being made in infrastructural development. Despite this, there is a significant underspend on national roads in the BMW region to the end of 2003. It is 40% behind in spend, while in the south and east are 45% ahead of target. This is another illusion, of balanced regional development. There is a significant underspend in the public transport operational programme in the BMW region. Yet there is no commitment to the western rail corridor. The illusion of balanced regional development was shattered yesterday when the Government voted down a motion at the Joint Committee on Transport to re-open parts of the western rail corridor. One of the reasons given was that the Department of Transport needed to continue discussions with the regional authorities. The Minister for Finance's <Col N="463" />millions will not be used to fund it. Once again we are being fobbed off with the excuse, &ldquo;We need another study&rdquo;, giving the illusion that something might happen, just as it might happen with the community employment schemes, another of the cruel, unnecessary and unjustified cutbacks.</P>
      <P>What did the Government motion state today? It welcomed the continuing review of the operation of these schemes. What a lovely phrase, the &ldquo;continuing review&rdquo;. Maybe something will be done. Maybe it will not. In 2003 some 5,000 jobs were cut nationally. In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, at the beginning of this year 203 people were in community employment in Leitrim and 491 in Sligo. As of today there are 152 in Leitrim and 420 in Sligo. From 693 jobs at the beginning of the year we are down to 572, yet there is still the attempt to create the illusion that there were no cutbacks, planned or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am pleased at the announcement of decentralised jobs to a number of centres, including Sligo and Leitrim. However, two years ago the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, announced that the Central Fisheries Board was to move to Carrick-on-Shannon. Today we had the second announcement, so at least in that matter the Minister for Finance has caught up with the Minister of State. When can we have a date for the movement of these jobs, or will we face into a local election and a general election with the promised job still being dangled as a carrot in front of the electorate?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance referred to a cluster strategy as regards decentralised jobs. In the Sligo-Leitrim constituency the local community in Ballinafad has created a facility costing &euro;750,000. If the jobs are not committed to Ballinafad &ndash; and they are not in today's budget &ndash; it will go into liquidation and be a lasting monument to this Government's lack of commitment to rural areas. The Taoiseach was pleased to open this facility. He can now preside over its closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 9,000 promised decentralised jobs, approximately 850 will go to the province of Connacht, less than 10%. While those jobs are welcome, it is critical to put them in context. A recent survey in the north-west by IBEC showed over 1,500 redundancies in Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal in the past 18 months. Between 1996 and 2002 the number of IDA and Enterprise Ireland-backed jobs increased by approximately 4,000 in the BMW region, while increasing at the same time in the east region of Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow by 35,233. Although all jobs are welcome, they do not even begin to make up for the jobs lost during the lifetime of this and the previous Government. The real test of a Government committed <Col N="464" />to balanced regional development is that it spends on infrastructure. It must spend to attract inward and indigenous investment. That is not happening in the regions.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at a budget that delivers illusion and ignores the reality of unbalanced regional development and the fact that budget after budget gives more to the well-off and less to the poor. The conjuring Minister for Finance is stealth taxing while mismanaging the major projects. Sometimes I think illusion is preferable to reality.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Financial Resolution No. 1 provides for an increase to 4.4% in the level of flat-rate farmers' refunds together with a similar change in the VAT rate on the supply of livestock, live greyhounds and the hire of horses. The flat-rate farmers' refund and the livestock rate were last changed in 2001 when they were both increased from 4.2% to 4.3%. The increase to 4.4% will take effect from 1 January 2004. The Revenue Commissioners have calculated that, on the basis of macro economic data for the last three years, a flat rate of 4.4% is now needed to achieve full <Col N="466" />compensation. This change will cost &euro;3.15 million from 1 January and &euro;3.78 million in a full year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The flat-rate scheme is a simplified and practical method of applying value-added tax to farming, which we use each year. It compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on the purchases of goods and services. This is achieved without applying the normal VAT rules on registration, record keeping and returns. Traditionally, the VAT rate on livestock has been maintained at the same level as the flat-rate refund. This is administered more conveniently to farmers and their customers. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Resolution No. 2 clarifies section 4(6) of the VAT Act 1972 in response to abuse of VAT law by certain developers who are failing to account for VAT on the sale of residential sites. While the sale of a new property is done by means of link contracts &ndash; one for the sale of the site and the other for the supply of the building services &ndash; some developers are claiming they can use section 4(6) in conjunction with other sections of the VAT Act to make the sale of the site VAT exempt. The key to the operation of the scheme is that the developer attempts to put himself in a position where he is not entitled to take a reduction for VAT incurred in the development of the site and, therefore, would not have to charge VAT on the sale of the site itself. As this is an abuse of VAT law, the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously contesting the artificial nature of the transactions involved and the validity of the claims for exemption.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The purpose of this measure is to clarify the law and to ensure that in no circumstances can a developer avail of such abusive mechanisms to pocket VAT that would otherwise accrue to the Exchequer. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome anything that benefits the farming community. As the Fine Gael Party realises how hard hit farmers are, we will not oppose Financial Resolution No. 1 as outlined by the Taoiseach. However, there are issues I wish to raise.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about land leasing. While some farming organisations welcome the increase in the tax exemption limits, it is important to point out that while it increased from &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,500 for a five to seven year period and from &euro;7,600 to &euro;10,000 for leases of seven years or more, it has not been increased since it was implemented in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having come from a farming background, the Taoiseach will be aware that there is a lot of <Col N="467" />movement within family farms, particularly as a result of the mid-term review. I regret it does not apply to fathers and sons or a relative within a family. While the measure might appear adequate initially, in real terms it will cost very little and will be of no benefit to farmers.</P>
    <P>Last January thousands of farmers took part in the &lsquo;tractorcade' because the roll-over relief was abolished and disease levies were doubled. There is nothing in the budget about roll-over relief. During the discussions on Sustaining Progress there was an indication that these levies policy would be reversed. The Minister for Finance allowed the Minister for Agriculture and Food to make the announcement. However, he only reversed the 25% reduction. In effect, he half reversed a bad decision made last year at a cost of just &euro;5 million. Given that in the Estimates he is taking in &euro;9 million for BSE testing, the Government could have been more generous and I ask the Taoiseach to look again at this measure.</P>
    <P>On the question of stamp duty for land swaps, for convenience of operation many farmers would like to swap some of their land with somebody else. It is inappropriate that either of them should have to pay stamp duty.</P>
    <P>This is not a great budget for agriculture. In time it will dawn on the agricultural community where it has been short sold. The leasing proposal is a Trojan horse of sorts. When the agricultural community see what is inside this whole affair it will not be happy.</P>

      <P>In respect of the VAT rebate for farmers, has the Minister for Agriculture and Food looked at how its benefit could be main<Col N="469" />tained for farmers who are moving down in the amount they produce as a result of the decision to decouple? The change is marginal but the VAT rate is 4.4%, which is a significant amount of rebate to farmers. A farmer who is subject to decoupling and who produces more will get a higher rebate. Will the case of those who are being encouraged to phase down productivity, through the decoupling policy, be taken into account in order that the historical benefit of the VAT rebate can be maintained through the cheque in the post and that they do not suffer the full loss as they phase down? It is significant that the rate is now 4.4%.</P>
      <P>On the other issue, will the Taoiseach explain in more detail the loophole he is trying to close? Obviously builders who succeed in not paying VAT on the site pay VAT on the house and get a rebate on the latter, so the Exchequer loses out. Is the Taoiseach thinking of those who build on one-off sites or developers who work in housing estates? I presume it is housing estates where there is no distinction between the site and the house at the point of sale and a false distinction is being made for the purposes of evading VAT on the site. Will he explain if it affects the person who sells a one-off site and where a builder comes in on a contract basis to build subsequently?</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting in Sligo the Taoiseach took an interest in the difficulties in rural areas in regard to planning and so on. He will be aware that it is quite common for parents who have land to give a site to a son or daughter. At present that site is subject to gift tax and capital gains tax. No issue arises in practical terms in regard to gift tax because of a transfer from a father or mother to a son or daughter. While it is aggregated in the totality of gift tax that would apply, the ceiling is high and, in practical terms, it does not create a difficulty. However, the capital gains tax creates a difficulty. In circumstances where a family, a father and a mother, give a site to a son or daughter, and no consideration changes hands, the donor is subject to capital gains tax and as values increase it is quite onerous. The parents, who frequently do not have a large income, give a site and get a bang for capital gains tax when in fact there was no financial transaction.</P>
      <P>I appreciate it is outside the scope of this financial resolution but it could be correctly fairly easily. There are several precedents in tax law where close relatives are treated differently from strangers when property is transferred, gifts given and inheritances received. If that precedent was taken into account it would be helpful and could be corrected in the Finance Bill. Given that I have made the Taoiseach fully aware of the problem and how onerous it has become, perhaps he would nudge the Minister for Finance in the right direction when the Finance Bill is being drafted.</P>

      <P>&mdash;having acted for many developers and for many house purchasers in the Limerick area. It is a thriving industry there. The problem has developed in recent years because VAT has become an enormous impediment to some new development. Developers go to extraordinary lengths to avoid the provisions of the VAT Act 1972 by setting up artificial systems of self-supply. The developer developing the site sets up an actual building company, tries to do a deemed supply to that building company and creates a self-supply. What should be a normal building development is taken out of the VAT net. That is an artificial arrangement and this anti-avoidance mechanism is designed to prevent that sort of arrangement from occurring.</P>
      <P>It does not apply only to residential developments. Some of my colleagues might be aware that this practice has expanded into the commercial sector. VAT on commercial property is perhaps one of the most complex areas of tax law and these developers are spending millions of euro every year entering into a variety of arrangements to take commercial property out of the VAT net. This continues on a year-by-year basis but the Department of Finance and Revenue officials may not be fully aware of some of the schemes or arrangements because of their complexity and secretive nature. Many of these arrangements would not come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, due to the rules of self-assessment and others, so they require a watchful eye at all times. When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he was one of the first Ministers to engage in serious anti-avoidance tax legislation, for which he is to be complimented. The present Minister for Finance has continued on that route.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that in today's debate speakers on all sides of the House accused the Minister of sidling up to the developers, to those who frequent the Galway Races and so on. In Resolution No. 2 we are asked to close one of the most significant tax loopholes, which puts paid to that accusation. I compliment the Minister on closing off this loophole and I ask him to keep a close and watchful eye on its extension into commercial property in the future.</P>

      <P>I do not have any comment to make on Resolution No. 1 but I am curious to know the answer to Deputy Noonan's question about a phase-down of productivity and how it impacts on the new situation in respect of decoupling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" />I am interested in Resolution No. 2 which the Minister described as an &ldquo;anti-avoidance measure&rdquo;. Deputy Perry, chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, and I have discussed this on a few occasions. Does the Taoiseach think it will have any impact on the inflation in the price of houses? As I understand it, or as it has been explained to me, this measure is intended to deal with a phenomenon whereby a house purchase is not a single transaction but conveniently involves two separate transactions, one in respect of the site and one in respect of the house. It is a significant loophole and loss of revenue to the Exchequer. On today's average house it is probably close to &euro;20,000 which in a small development of 50 houses is approximately &euro;1 million. I suppose one cannot describe something that is legal as tax evasion but this amounts to the same thing. Apparently it has been the practice.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners recently announced that were those who engage in aggressive tax planning to behave more responsibly, they might behave more sympathetically. This is yet another example of how those who can employ the best tax advice available can find loopholes that effectively defraud the Exchequer of substantial moneys, as has been happening in a period of unprecedented boom. I would like to hear the Taoiseach say what, if any, impact this will have on price inflation in housing. Is there any mechanism to ensure that the developer pays the piper or to what extent can some of this be passed on to the house purchaser? That is not an argument against the motion. It has to be done and it is correct and proper that it be done. In an environment of dramatically escalating levies and developers being deprived of a boon to which they were never entitled, what is the Department's assessment of its impact on housing price inflation?</P>

I cannot see how it will impact on the price of houses but hopefully it will leverage more compliance and tax revenue. Mine is a twofold question. What is the cost of the avoidance to date? What level of tax receipts are estimated from the closing down of this loophole or avoidance measure?</P>

      <P>Financial Resolutions Nos. 1 and 2 are minor enough but since they go in the right direction it is easy to support them. In the context of Resolution No. 1, there is no doubt, as Deputy Timmins said, that agriculture has been having a difficult time and this will benefit many farmers. <Col N="472" />However, it does not help many of those in my constituency who rely on horticulture, which often seems to be beneath the radar of the Department of Agriculture and Food. Horticulture does not receive the attention it needs, given its potential and our need for more, and it forms a low percentage of overall agricultural activity. I hope the Department's negative attitude to the establishment of farmers' markets around the country might change and that this message reaches the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>It is important that we view this as a national interest and I hope Deputy Brady will make himself more aware of the quite large agricultural sector in Dublin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Brady's point, but it is a surprise to me that he needs to compliment anybody. The point needs to be made that agriculture in Dublin is often overlooked and Deputy Brady is not alone in that regard. We need to make amends for that oversight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We certainly know of another crop in Dublin, namely growing houses which is relevant in the <Col N="473" />context of Resolution No. 2. Because of oversights down the years, many farmers have had little alternative but to put their land up for sale. There are willing buyers for that land, of course. This resolution is an attempt to temper the greed that might be characteristic of some of those buyers who believe they can make a very quick buck by hook or by crook by developing some of the best agricultural land in the country.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government looks a little further than this resolution if it is serious about being fair to those who are in no position whatsoever to be in the developers' league. These are people who find it difficult to get one house, never mind a couple of hundred. The Government should therefore look a little more closely at the Kenny report. I hope this resolution will provoke a little further debate. The Kenny report has been taken up by many people, but unfortunately they do not have the power to do much about it. They include groups like CORI and the Green Party in terms of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2003, in which we put forward a proposal which is complementary to the resolution before us but goes further. It means that if agricultural land will be needed, according to the local development plan, it should be purchased by the local authority. When the land is rezoned, it will not be a matter of going after a developer to ensure that tax is not avoided, but a matter of the local authority having its hand on the tiller and being able to develop that land in the best interests of planning and of the community which will be living out its days there. The need for such a radical measure is indicated by this resolution, but for whatever reason, the Government has to date not got the courage to make the change. Instead we are trying to control the worst excesses of greed among some speculators when it comes to making a profit from building land.</P>
    <P>There are many houses today which could not be bought for &euro;200,000. However, even with a house of that price, surveys again and again indicate substantial clear profit of about &euro;95,000 after taking into account the cost of the building land, stamp duty and other charges. With a clear profit of &euro;95,000 for one house, someone who builds 101 houses suddenly has profits of over &euro;1 million. That is the amount of money that is being salted away into building land by means of the developments of private entrepreneurs, many of whom support the Fianna Fáil Party, as they are free to do.</P>

      <P>With regard to the VAT initiative, it was very distressing that all Deputy Bruton could do was criticise the allotment of &euro;20 million to start the process.

      <P>I cannot commend the Minister for Finance or anyone for an increase in VAT refunds. First, it is a year late. It is exactly a year since VAT was increased by 1%, which obviously changed the situation as far as the farm refund is concerned. The only increase now is &euro;3.2 million.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. He got around the then president of the IFA, now Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and now he has clearly got around the current IFA president, John Dillon, because I heard Mr. Dillon welcoming this supposed major benefit to farmers.</P>

The Taoiseach opened the great equine centre in Cherry Orchard where a number of young men are learning the trade. There is a regular business in the trade of horses in Smithfield. In the Ashgrove area of the Coombe, which is also in Dublin South-Central, there are a number of people who have horses and who operate the carriages around St. Stephen's Green. These carriages may come under the heading of &ldquo;horses for hire&rdquo; within the resolution. They are ambassadors for the country and an excellent part of the tourist trade. These horses should be looked after by the agricultural sector. I would like to see some improvement in the carriages and to have them covered by the taxi regulations.</P>

      <P>With regard to Financial Resolution No. 2, I commend the Minister for Finance on doing everything possible to do away with the type of tax avoidance schemes used by wealthy developers who make considerable profits from property development.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to house prices. The price of houses is largely dictated by supply because demand is fairly level. By 2004 it is expected that 62,000 houses will be built in Ireland, five times higher than the rate of house building in the United Kingdom. That supply will help to keep the price of houses down. Developers will vie with each other to sell houses where there is low demand. This is an opportune time to put this resolution in place. It is also a reprimand to the tax avoidance practitioners whose trade will be diminished to such an extent that they will become an endangered species in the not too distant future.</P>

In discussing a later resolution we will see the contribution made by VAT increases in diesel and petrol to costs in the agricultural trade and other industries.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the age from 55 years to 40 for the purpose of land leasing is welcome. Will the Taoiseach consider further reducing the age to 35 years because installation aid is paid for farmers up to 35 years and there is a small number of years between 35 and 40? This should be considered in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>What measures will be taken to ensure that the average increase of &euro;20,000 to the Revenue Commissioners from developers will not be passed on to the customer? It has always been a problem in the building industry that attempts by the State or local authorities to raise revenue from the house building industry are passed on to the customer. It is important that this problem be taken into account and the necessary measures taken to ensure that this cost is not passed on to <Col N="478" />the customer in the form of higher house prices. I agree with Deputy Conor Lenihan, who asked about income forgone to the Exchequer. Have studies been made by the Revenue Commissioners or by the Department of Finance to establish the extent of that money? I am sure it is substantial. For that purpose this is an important measure, provided it is not passed on to the customer.</P>

The budget has delivered nothing by way of housing other than this measure. There are 48,000 applicants on the social housing waiting list and that number could probably be trebled.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On Resolution No. 1, I will explain to the House how the scheme works. The scheme sets out a percentage amount known as a flat-rate refund or addition. Unregistered farmers add this percentage to their prices when selling to VAT registered businesses, such as co-ops, meat factories or whatever. The VAT registered business treats the flat-rate amount as a normal business input in its periodic VAT returns. A simple example is an unregistered farmer who sells <Col N="481" />goods worth &euro;100 to a meat factory on 1 January. The flat-rate addition of 4.4% means that he can increase his price to &euro;104.40. The factory claims back the &euro;4.40 flat-rate addition as a VAT credit in its normal return, so there is no impact on the price of goods to the final customer due to the flat-rate addition. It is a very simple mechanism and is worked out by formula every year.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Noonan, if the farmer produces less, through decoupling or whatever, he will receive less flat-rate addition. Nothing can be done about that because the VAT system cannot be changed. If a farmer produces less, then he claims less. Deputy Noonan asked a question about the capital gains tax issue which was not relevant but I will reply to his query.</P>
      <P>I presume I am not permitted to discuss the leased land exemption measure. However, I will say that, while it has been stated that it is of no value, the cost of the measure is estimated at &euro;8 million in 2004 and &euro;13 million in a full year. That is a sizeable proportion of the full farmers' tax, so it is clearly of benefit. I merely wish to correct the error rather than deal in detail with the issue.</P>
      <P>On the matter raised concerning disease levies, it was stated that the Minister for Agriculture and Food raised this issue outside the House, so I will mention it within the House. The Minister has announced his intention to seek the agreement of the House to reduce the disease levies by 25%. That will be of considerable benefit and addition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crawford raised the issue of VAT. The flat-rate refund to VAT on registered farms is examined every year in the context of the budget. It is not, however, customary for me to comment on possible changes which may arise. The flat-rate addition is a simple administrative system to compensate farmers not registered for VAT for the VAT they incur as part of their farming activities. I have given an example. The flat-rate figure takes account on a regular basis of changes in the VAT rate.</P>
      <P>Under EU VAT law, the adjustment of the flat rate can only be made on the basis of retrospective macroeconomic data for the previous three years. It is taken in on a three year basis. The flat rate is not intended as an aid or assistance to the agricultural sector. It reflects a fair compensation for VAT incurred by farmers and should not affect their business decisions. The comment on the VAT measure was not a fair one.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Noonan, asked about VAT on property. The VAT property measure does not apply to the building of a one-off house. It is on a site and there are no linked contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will reply in some detail because many Members asked me to explain how it operates. Deputy Rabbitte asked about the impact of the measure on house purchases after budget night. The measure only affects those developers using the avoidance scheme. It is not clear how many <Col N="482" />developers are involved but it does not affect the majority of developers who properly account for VAT on the sale of developed sites. Only purchases of property from developers using the avoidance scheme are affected. The impact on these purchases depends on the contract involved. The change will not affect one-off housing if the house is sold separately without a connective contract for the building of the house.</P>
    <P>On the question of what would be the impact on purchases with different contracts, there are three different scenarios: contracts already concluded, as referred to by Deputy Perry; contracts entered into but not finalised on budget night; and contracts not entered into. The measure has no impact on the purchaser. The change is effective from tonight.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conor Lenihan asked what was the impact on the VAT yield. The scheme, were it allowed to continue, would represent a potentially significant loss of VAT which, instead of accruing to the Exchequer, would accrue to developers. The extent of the use of the scheme is not known. However, in one case, Revenue estimates the potential loss of VAT could amount to &euro;18 million. It is difficult to quantify the yield arising from this measure as Revenue is contesting the validity of the exemption claim of developers. In many cases, people operate outside the VAT system. They are not registered. It depends how people use it.</P>
    <P>It is potentially an important closure. The normal position on the sale of a site is that it is common practice for non-tax reasons to structure the sale of a new house or apartment as a site sale agreement and a building agreement. Solicitors advise clients to contract in this way as the purchaser's rights under a building agreement are stronger than the rights under a straightforward house purchase agreement. In particular, the purchaser is entitled to avail of the house builders' guarantee scheme and that is why people operate that arrangement.</P>
    <P>Under normal circumstances a developer develops a site in the course of his business for disposal to a customer. The building company is entitled to deduct VAT incurred in the development of the site, including any construction costs incurred. It then charges VAT at 13.5% to the final consumer on both the sale and the site of the purchase. The basis of the avoidance scheme that is being closed in a few hours' time is that some developers have been treating sites which were sold together with associated house construction contracts as VAT exempt under a certain  interpretation of section 4(6) of the 1972 Act. In effect they were using this approach to avoid having to account for VAT on the sale of the site.</P>
    <P>If a house developer purchases undeveloped land and contracts with a builder to develop the site &ndash; by, for example, levelling or draining the site &ndash; this then becomes developed land when agricultural land is adapted materially. After it is developed, the developer contracts to let the site <Col N="483" />to the builder on a short-term basis. The short-term letting of property is a VAT exempt activity. The developer presents the short-term letting as its primary purpose and puts forward that case. This is an attempt to avoid the significant amount of VAT on the later sale of the site by opting not to take deductibility on the small amount of VAT charged to him for his initial redevelopment. The short-term letting is the key to the operation of the system. So the site is developed, supposedly for the purpose of an exempt activity, in a short-term letting. This is the basis on which the developer claims that he is not entitled to recover VAT arising on the development of the site, so he never comes into the system. The short-term letting of the site on a short lease to the building company is merely an artificial mechanism which is used in his attempts to remove the developer's entitlements to reclaim VAT. By not claiming what he would be entitled to, which is VAT incurred on the developed site, the developer contends that because of this short-term letting, he can rely on section 46A of the Value-Added Tax Act to claim exemption from VAT on the sale of the site. Obviously, after a period, when he has developed the site, the purchaser is presented with contracts to the effect that he or she buys the site from the developer and building services from the builder. The developer does not account for VAT on the sale of the site to the purchaser, as no VAT has been recovered by him on his input. Therefore, the Revenue strongly, and rightly, opposes that interpretation.</P>

      <P>We are now closing it off in this way for obvious reasons. The financial resolution, which we are asking Members to support, prevents developers claiming exemption from VAT on the sale of a developed site when it is sold in connection with a construction contract. I do not think I need to go into all the issues surrounding that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards contracts entered into but not finalised on budget night, this is a question of what is a contract. If the contract is silent on VAT there should be no new charge arising from the measure. If the contract states that the price agreed includes a reference to vary the amount of VAT, the developer may try to pass on the VAT. The complete answer to the question will depend on the individual contract but I imagine that in these contracts, when the developer follows his own logic, he is trying to stay outside the VAT net altogether. Since the developer's dodge is to keep VAT out, I do not see why he would try to include it; it would not make much sense unless his approach is even more arrogant than trying to defraud the system. That is the position as it stands but if it was to pick up, one scheme alone would be sizeable. I imagine it will not be <Col N="484" />the only one because, clearly, all these matters will become known.</P>

    <P>Financial Resolution No. 3 provides, with effect from midnight tonight, for an increase in mineral oil tax on auto diesel and petrol which, when VAT is included, amounts to 5 cent on a litre of auto diesel and 5 cent on a litre of petrol. The rate for substitute auto fuel is also increased by the same amount to maintain parity with that for auto diesel. The resolution also provides for an increase of 2.5%, inclusive of VAT, on the rate for aviation gasoline for use by aircraft other than commercial aircraft where no excise applies. Following these increases, the Irish rate for petrol will still be below the EU average while the auto diesel rate will be at approximately the average level. The expected yield for these increases is approximately &euro;183.3 million for next year and &euro;185 million a full year. Therefore, the measures will increase the CPI by approximately 0.1845%.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1) increases the rate of excise on certain mineral oils to those set out in the scheduled resolution. Paragraph (2) is a standard declaration included in all financial resolutions, as required by the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927.</P>
    <P>Resolution No. 4 is an amendment to the Act of 1977. It provides for excise duty increases on tobacco products with effect from midnight tonight which, when VAT is included, amounts to an increase of 25 cent on a packet of 20 cigarettes <Col N="486" />with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products. The increase is expected to yield &euro;59.7 million next year, and &euro;60.5 million in a full year. It is expected the increase in price will reduce projected consumption by 1.13% compared to what it would otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>As has been indicated previously, the Government remains very concerned about smoking and its impact on health. The increase should help to discourage smoking, particularly by younger people. The measure will increase the CPI by approximately 0.187%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will be opposing Financial Resolution No. 3 on the basis that it is anti-business, anti-employment and will contribute enormously to the cost base of business and employment, which has already been overstretched by cost increases. I cannot understand why the Government, which was warned by the National Competitiveness Council earlier this week about the major impact cost increases are having on business and employment, will take an additional &euro;94.8 million in diesel costs out of enterprise in order to balance the books for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The cost base of the economy has gone through a difficult time with rises in insurance, energy and fuel costs. The Minister for Finance has not heeded the warnings from the National Competitiveness Council or Forfás to keep our costs as low as possible to promote employment opportunities. The increases will feed into the entire manufacturing sector, which is already under pressure. Some 170 jobs have been lost recently in three firms in the south east, two of which are in my constituency. One of the main reasons for these job losses is the higher cost of energy and insurance. The budget will impose additional costs on the unfortunate businesses that are suffering enough already. The imposition of an additional &euro;88.5 million in excise duty on petrol follows a major increase in road tax in recent years.</P>
      <P>Motorists have been badly hit by the Government in that money that used to come from central Exchequer funds now comes through motor taxation into the local government fund. The increase in the cost of petrol will feed back into the system thus contributing to higher costs and less disposable income for consumers, along with higher wage demands in the next round of pay talks. In addition, allowances in tax rates have not been index linked in the budget, which consequently will contribute to higher levels of personal taxation being extracted from workers. We will be opposing the imposition of an extra &euro;183.3 million on the business and commercial sector and on employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF" hpid="Mr. P. Power Mr. P. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped Financial Resolution No. 4 would meet with universal support in <Col N="487" />the House. I understand the social partners were looking for an even higher increase than the 25 cent the Minister announced in the budget today but this increase must be viewed in the context of the smoking ban which will be introduced in early 2004. The ban is receiving greater acclamation and greater acceptance on the part of the broader public. It is recognised as an innovative and progressive initiative on the part of the Minister for Health and Children. Both these measures should be viewed as an incentive to people to give up smoking. As a former smoker and one who smokes the occasional cigarette, I am waiting to be incentivised into giving them up.</P>
      <P>The dual approach of the smoking ban in the workplace, public houses and entertainment areas and the increases announced in today's budget will incentivise the thousands of people who want to give up smoking. Not only is this a revenue raising exercise but it is also an exercise in good public health. As public representatives we have all visited hospitals and witnessed every year the hundreds of cases of elderly people suffering from pulmonary and cardiac diseases. They will all say that their diseases are directly related to excessive smoking throughout their lives. At the same time we must balance tax increases with people's right to smoke and any adverse increase in the consumer price index. One of the main thrusts of today's budget was to continue the fight against inflation and when we balance all these factors, a reasonable increase of 25 cent will meet with universal acceptance in the House.</P>
      <P>On Financial Resolution No. 3, I take on board Deputy Hogan's point &ndash; he has left the Chamber &ndash; about its impact on competitiveness. Nobody likes increasing taxes, be they direct, indirect or any other type of capital tax, but this increase has to be viewed in the context of the expenditure increases announced in the budget. Hundreds of millions of euro will be provided for additional social welfare increases, the biggest ever increase, and they have to be funded from somewhere. I know Members opposite will shout about stealth taxes, as they did last year and this year, but in my book it is very simple. We can either provide for these increases by direct taxation, income tax and capital gains tax, indirect taxation or by borrowing.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance said today, borrowing is the ultimate stealth tax because we are only passing the hardship on to future generations, as we know to our cost in this House. Engaging in that type of wholescale borrowing to fund those types of social welfare increases creates a massive black hole in the economy which someone has to pay for ultimately. Let us rule out borrowing as we have for the past ten to 13 years and concentrate on the other two elements of taxation, direct and indirect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" />Direct taxation involves capital taxes, which are a separate issue, and income taxes. The Minister for Finance made a cogent and simple argument today as to why we should not go down the road of high tax and high spend, as we did in previous years. That is a blind alley. If we want to pay for the progressive social welfare increases announced today, we have to find that money somewhere. While the increases in the tobacco products can be justified on the grounds of public health, and I take on board the points made by Deputy Hogan, the increases in the mineral oils are reasonable in all circumstances. I commend Financial Resolutions Nos. 3 and 4 to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the arguments advanced by Deputy Hogan and, for the reason of those arguments, the Labour Party will be voting against Resolution No. 3. We have had the debate on Resolution No. 4. There was a time in this House when there was always some grandstanding by Deputies representing the Dundalk constituency, but that is not so prevalent any more. That is not to say that it will not hurt people who can least afford it. I am not in favour of arguing for people to have the right to kill themselves but it will hurt people who are already hurt by this budget.</P>
      <P>On the question of road diesel and petrol, the amount brought into the coffers is virtually the same as the amount provided for in the tax package. The tax package costs approximately &euro;287 million and approximately &euro;243 million is recouped under this measure alone. It shows the paltry nature of the tax package and the fact that for the first time in a number of decades, more than one third of taxpayers are driven into paying the marginal rate of tax. That is against a Government objective of reducing it this year to 20%. Almost 34% are now paying at the top rate.</P>
      <P>If the House was expected to countenance an increase in excise duties that impacts on competitiveness and on the personal burden of motorists, I would have thought it would have happened in the context of some move by the Minister on eco-taxes. The Minister promised us last year that he would address the question of eco-taxes and make a start in terms of our contribution, but I do not see anything in the budget in that area. The fact that he has not adverted to it this year while last year inviting us to anticipate some initiatives by him in this area must mean that the Government has gone off the idea, and that is immensely regrettable. This is simply an old-style raid on the old reliables to raise money that will have an impact on people who need transport to get to work. It will affect the personal motorist who now finds himself or herself paying tax at the marginal rate and business and competitiveness will be affected as a result. For that reason we, too, will not be supporting Financial Resolution No. 3.</P>

      <P>That was a remarkable contribution from Deputy Rabbitte. Churchill once told a researcher who was preparing him for a speech to give him the facts and he will twist them whatever way he wants. Deputy Rabbitte is a master exponent of that particular black art. He talked about a raid on the old reliables but an aspect of the budget to be welcomed is that it has not hit the favourite old reliable of all of us, namely, alcohol, which has not been touched in this budget. That is right, given the potential effects of the smoking ban on public houses and the licensed trade generally. There has been a downturn in that market mirroring the downturn we have seen in the general economy. It is welcome that that reliable was not hit this time. A Minister has to find items on which he can raise taxes and this is one of the items he has chosen.</P>
      <P>The public health argument is fairly clear and I would welcome any figures the Taoiseach may have in the briefing documents accompanying the Budget Statement on the total tax yield from tobacco and the best forecasts in terms of the relationship between price and consumption. In other words, at what level does price effect a downturn in the habit?</P>
      <P>A particular issue which strikes me as important is that while we all want people to give up cigarettes, there is an effect on the Exchequer. Obviously there will be a downturn in revenue. I would be interested to hear predictions and forecasts from both the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners on the downturn in Exchequer yield from the downturn in consumption related to the price increase. I would also like to hear if any assessment has been made of the possible effects on Exchequer revenue arising from the smoking ban.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have seen a huge involvement of organised crime and some subversive movements, which some Members may be able to assist us on, in smuggling tobacco products across borders. I would welcome a strong signal from the Minister that, as he increases the price of tobacco, he will also give the Revenue Commissioners the proper powers and resources to pursue the evil people who trade in the illegal smuggling of cigarettes. There are serious organised crime figures involved in this and subversive movements have funded themselves through smuggling. I hope all concerned will redouble their efforts in fighting this as it is a particularly reprehensible form of fraud against the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>At what point does one turn against further increase in cigarette pricing? I would like to see some forecasts or predictions from the Department on how far the State can go in increasing the price of cigarettes before negative returns are shown in inflation and to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The Green Party will support both resolutions. We support Financial Res<Col N="490" />olution No. 3 as it runs in parallel with our views on how we should improve the environment. The duty on diesel fuel is significantly below that on other unleaded fuels. There is a misconception that diesel fuel should be promoted and because vehicles get greater mileage from it, it is thought to be cleaner and more environmentally sustainable. I am afraid that the latest scientific advice shows this is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pollutants from diesel have a worse effect at both local and global levels. The particulates emitted from diesel have a much worse effect than CO2 and emissions from other fuels. We need to re-examine the level of duty applied to diesel and stop promoting it as a fuel to which people should switch. The level of duty has led to a large switch to diesel and has worsened the pollution effects from our transport system.</P>
      <P>While we welcome the measures, it is remarkable that the Minister for Finance did not once mention a switch away from labour taxes towards environmental taxes. In the last six budgets the Minister for Finance has trotted like a showjumper at Punchestown up to the fence of introducing environmental taxes and refused. Last year he promised that he would start doing this, yet he does not have a word to say on the matter 12 months later. We know that the Cabinet is publicly divided on this issue, as it is on other issues. The Tánaiste has come out as a strong opponent against the introduction of environmental taxes and has cited competitiveness concerns. The World Bank &ndash; I am sure it would agree with the Tánaiste on many matters &ndash; has looked at this in some detail and its analysis shows that 70% of countries that introduced environmental taxes have seen economic employment improvements as well as environmental ones.</P>
      <P>With the level of environmental problems we are facing, Ireland cannot be the last to introduce such a tax. We must be to the forefront. The Minister for Finance missed an incredible opportunity to mention the environment, environmental taxes and what he is contemplating in the area. While the Government may still be split on the matter, it is time it made a decision and made it public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environmental effect of such taxes will never really amount to anything if our capital investment programme is consistently and massively swayed towards building new roads. On the one hand we are encouraging more traffic while on the other hand we are raising taxes to discourage it or gain revenue from it. There is an incredible imbalance in our capital investment programme where we are looking at &euro;1.7 billion being spent on roads each year, with a small frac<Col N="491" />tion of this going on public transport. Our competitive position as a country will depend on what sort of broadband structure we put in place, what kind of research we invest in and how we move people. The most effective way of moving people in our economy is not by road &ndash; this will inevitably lead to congested cities &ndash; it is by public transport.</P>
    <P>Until the Government moves away from this mad road-building programme and starts investing in public transport, we will not receive the environmental benefit of these taxes. The real test for the Government before Christmas will be whether it is willing to invest in the metro project and fund it in part from the five-year capital programme it promised. The real test in the spatial strategy is whether the Government will fund the western rail corridor to link Galway, Limerick, Sligo and other western towns. The real test is whether it will provide suburban rail lines into Cork and make our society sustainable both economically and environmentally.</P>
    <P>While we support this measure, it is a tiny fraction of what is needed if the Government is serious about protecting the environment and creating a sustainable economy.</P>

      <P>I support Financial Resolutions Nos. 3 and 4. I do not think there is any controversy regarding No. 4 and believe that most Members will support an increase of 25 cent per packet of 20 cigarettes. I agree with Deputy Hogan on the issue of competitiveness with regard to Financial Resolution No. 3. When one looks at the increase of 5 cent per litre, it is a small increase in the overall context of the budget. There is to be an extra &euro;30 million for schools, local government is receiving an extra &euro;30 million and &euro;20 million has been allocated to the decentralisation programme.

      <P>The Society of the Irish Motor Industry has already pointed out the extent of the annual contribution of the motoring public to revenue. When one adds to this the figure of &euro;183 million generated by this source alone, one finds that the motoring public makes a significant con<Col N="493" />tribution to the cost of the Exchequer. As my colleague, Deputy Hogan, pointed out, this added cost will have serious implications not only for trade, but also for tourism and services. When one adds the changes to benefits-in-kind proposed in recent times, this amounts to a severe additional penalty on the motoring public.</P>
      <P>I will comply with the request of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle by making a brief comment on Financial Resolution No. 4 regarding excise on tobacco. The Taoiseach gave two figures, namely, that the measure would add 0.187% to the consumer price index and would result in a 1.13% reduction in smoking. A Deputy asked for an explanation of the economic rationale of the figures. I would like the total costs to the Exchequer of smoking to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago, I wrote the second report on smoking for the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. The former Deputy, Alan Shatter, wrote a previous report. The fact is that half of all patients admitted to St. James's Hospital in my constituency are admitted due to smoking-related illnesses, whether hardening of the arteries, heart disease, cancer or other illnesses. When one extrapolates this figure throughout the hospitals in the State, particularly larger hospitals, one finds that smoking generates significant costs for the Exchequer. I would like an economic study to be done to take into account the cost to the Exchequer of the health implications of smoking.</P>
      <P>According to medical evidence, nicotine is more addictive than heroin, although the latter does much more damage more quickly and quickly gets people, the young in particular, into deep trouble. Evidence given to the Committee on Health and Children indicates that the tobacco industry deliberately dresses up nicotine to make it palatable to young people and encourage addiction by removing some of the nastier tastes of tobacco.</P>
      <P>In France, where more young women are smoking, it is now possible to forecast the increase in the death rate from cancer among women. This issue has been grasped already. I would like an economic study, separate from medical studies &ndash; the Committee on Health and Children has already published two reports on the medical implications of smoking &ndash; to be carried out on the cost factors of smoking to the Exchequer. At this time in the cycle of parliamentary business, when we are examining issues from the perspective of the Exchequer, such a study would pay dividends in more ways than one.</P>

      <P>The Sinn Féin Deputies will oppose Financial Resolution No. 3 and support Financial Resolution No. 4. The proposed increase on mineral oils is anti-motorist and anti-transport industry. Only eight days ago, a week ago yesterday, we had a further financial <Col N="494" />resolution in the Chamber targeted at motorists regarding an increase in the cost of motor taxation. On that occasion I asked the Minister whether further bad news was in store for motorists arising out of the budget on 3 December. Of course, the Minister kicked to touch, but he knew well that this was exactly what motorists were about to face.</P>

      <P>There were all sorts of uniforms but let us stick with the issue. Where I come from there is virtually no public transport system, with the exception, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, will note, of express buses transporting people from counties Donegal and Derry to this city. It is important, therefore, to recognise the effect of this measure on those who are dependent on private transport to access their place of work. Like the increase in motor taxation last week, this is a tax on accessing one's employment, a further tax on work. This is the reality for many people in this State.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, those involved in the transport industry, which has faced significant turmoil in recent years, now have a further increase in charges to meet. What will be the net effect of all this? The goods and commodities on which we depend daily are likely to increase in cost due to the domino effect of the increases in the cost of the transportation and delivery of goods. An increase in the cost of fuels will undoubtedly result in a hike in the cost of taxi fares and public transport, greater than that being discussed here. Such measures often spill over into multiples of the original increase. This is what people are facing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite will argue that this 5 cent increase is small, but its effect is anything but small. The motorist has again become an easy <Col N="495" />target for the Government, which has targeted them twice in this jurisdiction in eight days. There will undoubtedly be a serious backlash as motorists will not accept continuously being treated as a soft, easy target.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the price of fuel will go in the coming period. Obviously, events in Iraq, Georgia and the Middle East are driving up the price, while recent events regarding exchange rates are driving it down. The points made by Deputy Hogan and others were well stated. One would expect the strategy of the Government, particularly the Tánaiste, to be to try to control those factors of competitiveness which are within domestic control. Looking ahead, the two main factors on competitiveness, exchange rates and interest rates, are not within the control of the Government.</P>
      <P>The position could become black by late next year. The exchange rate of the euro against the dollar is $1.15. While the value of the euro is heading south now, it was worth $1.20 at one point. When it was heading in the other direction, its value fell to as low as 85 cents, which amounted to a 35% discount or bonus on the position it should have had based on a trade weighting. If it were to follow the same trend in the opposite direction, as the American monetary authority is now trying to cut out the consumption that was sucked in by the high exchange rate, it would flatten out at $1.55. That is frightening, given that it is at $1.20. I do not think it will go to $1.55. However, one of the main factors of competitiveness in Ireland is totally beyond our control now and it could deteriorate rapidly to an extent that would be extremely painful.</P>
      <P>Interest rates reached the bottom of their cycle six months ago. They are on the increase internationally and they will do so gradually. However, the decision of the European Council of Ministers to allow Germany and France to breach the Stability and Growth Pact will add one point or one point and a quarter to whatever the interest rate might have been, if that had not occurred. I was surprised the Minister for Finance, for reasons of interest rate control, did not fight that more strongly. I know the voice of Ireland in the European Council is weak, but it can be symbolic. He should have voted against the breach of the Stability and Growth Pact because as interest rates climb through the summer and into the autumn, I have no doubt that the fact that the French and Germans are not controlled by the Stability and Growth Pact means that the European Central Bank will have to react and, as it reacts, interest rates will increase further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have three questions. Will the Tánaiste give us the yield from both excise measures? The Taoiseach may have already given them, but I <Col N="496" />missed them. Perhaps she will divide the yield between diesel and other fuel commodities. What effect will both motions have on the consumer price index? When excise on tobacco products was increased in the last budget, a strong case was made that this was a health measure, not a revenue raising one. The case was made so strongly that the yield was dedicated to the Department of Health and Children and ring-fenced to be used on health expenditure. There was no mention of that in the Minister's speech today. Do I take it that the yield from this excise increase will go to the Exchequer and not to the Department of Health and Children?</P>
    <P>There is huge ambivalence about increases in excise on tobacco products. With respect to the Deputies opposite, that ambivalence was heard in speeches tonight and sometimes in the same speech. On the one hand, people hope the increase will improve people's health and stop them from smoking, but, on the other hand, they are nervous that it will not yield the anticipated amounts because if that does not happen, the tax must be found elsewhere. The type of schizophrenia which applies to excise increases on tobacco products must be addressed. Excise duty is either being increased as a health measure or as another way of getting revenue. However, it is not possible to ride both horses.</P>

      <P>I am shattered at this increase, which is serious in terms of competitiveness. We discussed the plight of agriculture and other sectors earlier. This will have cost implications in many areas. I am worried about the effect this will have on the Border region. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, knows as well as I do that the area has been boosted in recent years by the number of people coming across the Border to buy fuel and subsequently other products. We, in County Monaghan, have been given the two fingers today as far as decentralisation is concerned.</P>

We are already uncompetitive. I strongly oppose this uncalled for measure which is damaging.</P>
      <P>People are worried about publicans. However, the price of spirits and alcohol has not been increased. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform keeps telling us about the problems associated with the abuse of alcohol. Surely something could have been done to ease the pressure.</P>

      <P>Petrol is not a luxury for many working people, particularly those in rural areas. Those living on awkward routes in urban areas, who are subjected to the excruciatingly deficient public transport system, face the same problem, namely, they must use their cars.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to the increase in taxation on cigarette and tobacco products, particularly in view of the fact that the justification being given for it by the Government is that it is being done for health reasons. That is pious cant, particularly when successive Governments have tolerated the glorification of nicotine in advertising and have allowed it to be sold to get huge revenues over the decades. Unfortunately, when hundreds of thousands of people are addicted to such a terrible drug, the Government decides to increase the taxation, while pretending it is for the good of their health. Effective and honest measures to overcome addiction to nicotine are required, not another increase in tax under a cynical guise.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that &euro;243 million will be raised from these measures. We can see where the Government's loyalties lie when we see that the reduction to the corporate sector as a result of the past two budgets will be &euro;634 million a year from now on. It is a case of continuing to give it to the millionaires, while taking it back from ordinary people.</P>

      <P>No one should give credibility to these tax increases by dignifying them with the term &ldquo;environmental taxes&rdquo;. These taxes penalise ordinary people whose cars are not a luxury, while they mean nothing to the rich. It is wrong to give them the credibility of being environmental taxes about which the Government knows nothing. It also tried to suggest the bin tax was an environmental tax. Justifying them in such terms allows the Government to cover up its complete failure to provide a proper public transport system and a waste management plan.</P>
      <P>While these measures impact on ordinary working people and on poor people because they are indiscriminate across the board, on the plains of Kildare the manicured stallions rest easily in their stalls, while the tens and hundreds of millions of euro they earn every year for their millionaire owners will be untouched by the Minister. From the islands of Bermuda to the shores of Lake Geneva, the billionaire tax exiles will also rest easy because they go on their way without a finger raised against them by this Government of the rich and for the rich, a Government that is hitting ordinary people. It is time it was exposed for that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan made a number of relevant points, especially his reference to foreign exchange rates and the fact that as oil and oil products are normally traded in US dollars, there will be benefits from the current favourable exchange rate. If the exchange rate goes the other way, the checks and balances in the system will mean that while we may lose on one side, the competitiveness of export products may improve. It is, therefore, unfair to view the impact of oil prices in a narrow context. It is necessary to consider the wider context of the impact of oil price changes and exchange rate movements on the global economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a lot better than very good. Nobody wants to justify increases in the price of any product as it is easier to argue against them, but the reality is that the various schemes announced in the budget have to be funded. The method used to raise extra funding does not put us at a competitive disadvantage. The price of fuel, even after the increases announced in the budget, will be well below the European average.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I travel by bus. It is easy to argue against increases and argue they are uncompetitive. However, they must be viewed in the round. The cumulative effect of the increases announced today on the CPI will be modest. The Minister was aware of this when making his decisions in this area. While an increase in fuel prices has a bearing on industry and our competitiveness, Deputy Ó Caoláin should be aware that the impact will be far less than what would happen if the Minister was to implement an increase in employer's PRSI, as recommended by his party's spokesperson, Deputy Crowe. That would have a much more significant impact on employment.</P>
      <P>The proposals in Financial Resolution No. 3 are modest. They keep Ireland well within the range of prices being charged across Europe. Consequently, I commend both of resolutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to stick to the resolutions as best I can. I am in favour of Resolution No. 4 for the obvious reason that I hope it will help in reducing the number of cigarette packets that are purchased next year. I am glad the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present as a significant problem is developing in regard to the black market trading of cigarettes. As prices are increased, the incentive to trade on the black market becomes more tempting. While there is a need to continue increasing prices, there is also a need to take firm measures to try to stop the traffic of cigarettes coming from Spain, Portugal and other European countries. It has become a significant problem, particularly on the south coast and across the Border. I am tempted to elaborate on that latter aspect, but I will refrain from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot agree with Financial Resolution No. 3. Deputy Hogan has outlined the competitiveness <Col N="502" />argument, but I will outline another argument that has not yet been made. I hope the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be able to comment on my questions. It is about the need to promote a biofuels industry in Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has significant potential to copy Germany and a range of Scandinavian countries which have active biofuels industries by incentivising the development of such fuels through excise duty reductions. We have the best climatic conditions for growing energy crops in Europe, yet we are doing nothing about it. This could have a significant impact on the levels of carbon and greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland. The transport sector contributes in a significant way to our problem, but here is a ready-made solution if we have the imagination and ambition to make use of it. Not only will it help to solve the carbon emissions problem but it will also create a whole new industry within agriculture, which has been proven to be viable in other European countries, when we drop the excise levels sufficiently to make it financially viable.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that we have not had the imagination and ambition to use this resolution not only to increase duties on diesel and petrol and, in doing so, discourage their use, but also to encourage the use of alternative fuel sources such as biodiesel as a substitute for diesel and ethanol or other liquid gases as a substitute for petrol.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues, I strongly oppose Financial Resolution No. 3 and give grudging respect to Financial Resolution No. 4. Like others in the House, I am a sinner in that I smoke. It has positive and negative aspects. I will not go into all the agitation generated on the other side of the House by smoke and mirrors and new rules and regulations. I hope this measure, when passed, will ease the tension on the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the views of my colleagues on diesel and petrol. This measure in Resolution No. 3 will seriously damage the competitiveness of the economy. These extra charges are on top of the <Col N="505" />&euro;3.5 billion which motorists contribute to the Exchequer annually. They will increase the amount by another &euro;245 million. That is without taking into account the revenue generated from parking fees, parking fines and clamping, about which I have tried and failed to obtain information by way of parliamentary questions over the past 12 months. There is no question that the sum of money involved is substantial. These figures should be available to the House but are not, despite my best efforts. It is not possible in our economy to impose the penalties that are now appearing on a regular basis on road transport. We cannot shift everything to the rail service, nor can we fly everything. We must have provision for road transport in the economy. I register my protest and that of my colleagues about this resolution.</P>

In recent years cigarette prices have increased dramatically in accordance with the public health policy of the Government and its aim to increase the price of cigarettes to ensure the cost of taking up smoking is prohibitive at an early age. Has a study been done to discover whether there is a concomitant increase in smuggling activity when the price of cigarettes is raised?</P>

      <P>Deputies have been somewhat disingenuous on the issue of excise duty on fuel oils. As has been outlined, this is a revenue generating measure which will fund increases in social welfare and the &euro;25,000 extra for people with disabilities and those with special educational needs. There have been few revenue-raising measures in the budget. Most of its measures have been revenue-decreasing, such as the increases in tax credits and so on. This measure is welcome because it will allow us to fund many of the projects outlined in the budget today.</P>

      <P>On the proposal for excise duties on fuel, we do not accept the arguments about competitiveness on the grounds that our petrol is cheaper than that of our nearest competitor and many of our other competitors. Fuel is certainly more expensive here than in the USA, but that is a different climate. There is also a problem in terms of the cost of fuel in the Border counties, but that is a failure of price control. Petrol prices in the Border regions are 10 cent more per litre than in the rest of the country and they are pegged not to petrol costs in the rest of the country but as near as they can get to petrol costs in Northern Ireland. The Government has failed to ensure there is not widespread profiteering in the Border region on the cost of petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is the State is not getting this money. The retailers and the Border regions are getting this money. The reality is also about environmental taxes. Ireland has fewer environmental taxation measures than any other country in the OECD. There are only six, which puts Ireland in the same class as the United States and Japan. The average in other European countries is 20 to 30. This is something the Government has again shied away from in this budget. On the question of excise duties on cigarettes, anyone would approve of this as a public health measure. It has to be accepted that the Office of Tobacco Control has said that price elasticity as regards cigarettes indicates that not one penny would be lost to the Exchequer if there was a doubling in the current price of a packet of cigarettes. The Government can only be taken seriously in terms of a public health argument when the money being taken in by the Exchequer in a given year is less than what was taken the year before. Otherwise, every increase in terms of this particular excise duty will be just to bring money into the Exchequer. The public health argument is bogus. In terms of the rate of inflation and the cost of living index arguments have been made by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="508" />McCreevy, that this should be taken out of the basket of cost of living measures. I would argue against that. It is an unfortunate fact of life that people on lower income levels tend to smoke more. If there is to be a fair recognition of what the true cost of living is for many families in our State, it must be left within the basket, even though measures such as this will add significantly to the cost of inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to some of the main points raised by Deputies on the resolutions under discussion. Deputy Noonan asked what the effect on the CPI was and what the yield would be. I propose to give him the figures. As regards tobacco the yield in a full year will be &euro;59.7 million and the effect on the CPI will be 0.187%. In the case of auto diesel the yield in a full year is &euro;94.8 million and the effect on the CPI is 0.029%. On petrol the yield in a full year is &euro;88.5 million and the CPI effect is 0.155%. The overall effect on the CPI is 0.371%. We estimate that next year the inflation rate will be no greater, on average, than 2.5% and hopefully substantially lower than that.</P>
      <P>As regards seizures &ndash; the black economy on tobacco &ndash; customs officials have had considerable success in this area. To date, seizures are running at around 40 million cigarettes and 2.5 tonnes of tobacco. The monetary effect of that is substantial: last year it was worth &euro;11.736 million and the excise value of that was &euro;9.331 million. That was on a quantity of 41.108 million. As regards convictions and prosecutions, in 2001 there were 37 convictions, in 2002 there were 57 and 56 to date in 2003. That is in respect of smuggling and the possession of illegal cigarettes.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Ó Caoláin raised the issue of putting up the price of drink.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent announcement from DEFRA in the UK, on suspending the culling of badgers in their reactive areas at an early and incomplete stage in their original experimental design. I cannot comment on the decision until such time as the data leading to the decision is published and has been reviewed from an epidemiological perspective.</P>
      <P>A similar study was undertaken in this country over five years from 1997 to 2002, inclusive. The results of the trial will be published in the new year. Its findings will be taken into account in determining future Irish policy in the area. In the meantime, the removal or badgers under licences will be continued.</P>
      <P>In the medium term one of our key objectives is to develop a vaccine for use in badgers that would lead to a reduction in the level of TB infection in that species. It would reduce the numbers of organisms being shed and subsequently the level of transmission to the cattle population. Work on the objective is progressing.</P>
      <P>As regards the incidence of bovine TB, there has been a steady decline in the numbers of TB reactors here since 1999 when 44,900 reactors were identified compared with less than 29,000 in 2002. Up to 5 November 22,600 reactors had been identified and the year end total is projected to be lower than in 2002.</P>

      <P>My officials are in continuing discussions with the European Commission on the detailed rules for implementing the mid-term review agreement. It may be some time yet before the position is clear. However, my officials have already raised, and will continue to raise, a number of issues relating to farmers that have retired under the early retirement schemes and the implications decoupling and the single payment scheme will have for them.</P>
      <P>A farmer who joined the early retirement scheme has undertaken to give up farming permanently. Therefore, he or she cannot be regarded as a farmer when the time comes to activate single payment entitlements in 2005. The legal position regarding the single payment system, as laid down in the Council Regulation, is that entitlements are not linked to land but to farmers who were active during the reference period and who remain active farmers in 2005.</P>
      <P>Retired farmers cannot themselves activate entitlements that were earned during the reference period. However, the Commission has indicated that it favours arrangements that will allow family members who take over these holdings to have access to the national reserve. This would include cases where the land was leased to a non-family member at the time of retirement because a family member, usually a son or daughter, was not yet ready or eligible as a transferee but subsequently takes over.</P>
      <P>My officials will continue working to secure as favourable an outcome as possible to these and other issues affecting retired farmers, having regard to the legitimate aspirations of the various stakeholders.</P>

      <P>The committee has concluded its deliberations. I expect to present its report to Government in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish meat processing sector produces approximately 550,000 tonnes of animal by-products annually in compliance with EU veterinary rules. It is turned into about 150,000 tonnes of MBM at nine Department of Agriculture and Food approved rendering plants. Prior to the onset of BSE, meat and bonemeal was used mainly for animal feed purposes and made a positive contribution to the livestock and meat processing sectors. An EU imposed ban on the use <Col N="515" />of MBM in feed was introduced at the of 2000. It transformed MBM from a by-product with a significant commercial value to a waste product with a significant disposal cost. There were, and still are, no disposal facilities in Ireland for MBM.</P>
    <P>The Irish livestock sector depends on export markets for 90% of its output. The dependence of that sector on relatively expensive MBM disposal outlets abroad has a negative impact on the competitiveness of the sector. I am also keenly aware of the economic benefits derived by other member states from the use of MBM as an energy source in the production of cement and the generation of power.</P>
    <P>The time is right for our approach to the use of MBM in the industry and energy sectors to be reconsidered. We could extract maximum value from what is seen as a valuable energy source in many countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the level of safety on farms. The number of people killed on farms remains unacceptably high. It is imperative that all farmers acknowledge that farming is a hazardous occupation and one that carries specific risks <Col N="516" />to themselves, their families and workers. All necessary steps to minimise risks must be taken, including the preparation of farm safety statements.</P>
    <P>On-farm accident statistics are published on an annual basis by various bodies. To date in 2003 my Department is aware of 18 on-farm accidents that resulted in death. During the same period in 2002 there were 11 on-farm accidents that resulted in death. Clearly the statistics are a source of disappointment.</P>
    <P>On 7 April the Health and Safety Authority commenced its farm action safety week and launched a booklet entitled Farm Action Safety Plan. It sets out a programme that covers the period 2003 to 2006. Its main objectives are as follows: to reduce on-farm accidents to below 2,000 per annum to reduce on-farm deaths by at least 50% over a five year period; to reduce health problems associated with farming such as back and respiratory problems by at least 50% over a five year period; to introduce health and safety training for farmers, farm workers and students at second and third level; to ensure that all primary schools show and discuss the contents of the Child Safe video and CD-ROM prior to school holidays; that a minimum of 1,000 farm inspections are carried out by HSA inspectors each year; that farm safety promotional campaigns, such as farm safety and child safety weeks, are continued and other appropriate campaigns are undertaken; that research is carried out in order to identify methods of improving attitudes and awareness of farm safety; and that a database on all farm accidents be developed. My Department has been involved in a number of initiatives with a view to reducing the risk and raising awareness of the dangers on farms to farmers, farm workers and their families.</P>
    <P>In January 2002 I accepted the authority's invitation to be associated with the launch of its Guidelines on the Preparation of a Safety Statement for the Farm. They give detailed advice on how to carry out a risk assessment and prepare a safety statement. The Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 requires farmers to prepare a safety statement and to provide appropriate safeguards on an ongoing basis to prevent accidents and ill health on the farm. The guidelines and many other farm safety information leaflets are available from the HSA. I have arranged for a farm safety training module to be included in the mandatory 20 hour training course for all participants of REPS II. Recently my Department assisted in the distribution, by the HSA, of the farm safety self assessment document for family farms. The document has been the subject of an intensive media campaign in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>I fully support the authority's work. My Department, in conjunction with the HSA, is giving farm safety the highest priority and will continue to do so to ensure that the level of farm accidents falls significantly. Farmers must play their part by exercising vigilance on their farms <Col N="517" />at all times. The initiatives I have mentioned will help to make farm safety a priority for farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1996 the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates was issued jointly by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for the Environment. The code is a voluntary one and fulfilled obligations arising under the 1991 Nitrates Directive. It was developed in consultation with the farming organisations and was designed to promote environmentally friendly farming practices while maintaining high water quality status. The code addresses a range of pollution problems with the aim of reducing nitrate losses and restoring water quality. It contains practical advice for farmers on how to avoid the risk of water pollution and how good pollution control practices could be put in place.</P>
      <P>The code is complimentary to the rural environment protection scheme and many of its elements are in REPS. There are 37,000 farmers in REPS and I hope a substantially higher number shall join the amended scheme for which I hope to get early European Commission approval. Many elements of the code are in the Good Farming Practice booklet which was produced in 2001 in consultation with the farm organisations and it contains many of the code's elements. Compliance with good farming practice is compulsory for all farmers claiming direct payments and many other Department schemes. In practice this means that it applies to the vast majority of Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period since the code was published in 1996 my Department has given substantial grant aid for works to improve water quality. A sum of <Col N="518" />&euro;250 million was paid through the control of farm pollution scheme, the national farm pollution scheme and the farm waste management scheme to over 23,800 farmers.</P>
    <P>At present the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and Teagasc, is developing an action programme to provide for further implementation of the Nitrates Directive. Work on the programme is well advanced and a draft will soon be made available. It will be subject to a consultative process with the main farming organisations and other stakeholders. The programme is likely to include the main elements of the 1996 code.</P>

      <P>The animal identification and tracing elements of the national beef assurance scheme have been operational since 1 January 2000. It was envisaged that other elements of the scheme, in particular the inspection and approval of farms, would be undertaken last year in conjunction with the annual round of testing. Detailed discussions took place with the veterinary and farming representative organisations over a long period and a protocol for the conduct of the inspections was agreed. Only a small number of inspections took place because of resistance to the scheme's implementation mainly by veterinarians whose union is seeking a centralised payment system for the costs involved.</P>
      <P>The legislation establishing the scheme clearly provides that the costs of securing a certificate of approval are the responsibility of the applicant. The Exchequer has already invested over &euro;50 million in developing and maintaining the identification and tracing system that underpins the scheme and costs will continue to be incurred under this heading. The scheme is an important element in the drive to maintain and increase marketplace in a difficult sector and I am disappointed with the attitude adopted by Veterinary Ireland on its implementation. Discussions will continue with the its representative body and the farming organisations with a view to resolution at an early date.</P>

      <Quest>the guarantees he has that cattle and sheep infected with BSE are not being sold for human consumption before they develop clinical symptoms.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29337/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures for the control and eradication of BSE in Ireland are among the most comprehensive in the world and are multilayered. Even if one protective layer of control is breached there are several more layers to ensure that consumers are protected.</P>
      <P>The focus of BSE controls is the prevention of infection primarily through a ban and on the use of meat and bonemeal in feed for cattle and sheep. Public health is also protected through the removal and destruction of potentially infective materials, the specified risk materials, from all bovine and ovine carcases intended for the human food chain or the animal feed chain. The rapid testing of cattle at slaughter provides added protection.</P>
      <P>The eradication of BSE from the national herd will provide the best possible protection for consumers. The change in the age profile of animals confirmed with BSE in recent years clearly shows that the enhanced feed and SRM controls, introduced in 1996 and 1997, have had a dramatic effect on the number of infections since that time. Less than 2% of cases diagnosed in 2002 and 2003 were under six years of age at the time of diagnosis compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. In the period from 1 January to 27 November there were 168 cases or 46% less than the 313 cases in the corresponding period in 2002. That trend is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rules requiring the removal of SRMs ensure that the tissues that can potentially harbour BSE infectivity are removed from carcases at slaughterhouses and sent for destruction. Even where animals have passed through the other layers of <Col N="520" />control, indicating that there is no evidence whatever to suggest they have BSE, all such material is removed before the carcase passes into the human food chain. This is the most significant current control measure from a consumer point of view.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 2001 Ireland, in common with other member states, has had a comprehensive system of targeted active surveillance for BSE in place. Under current EU legislation all fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age and all slaughter cattle over 30 months of age are tested for the disease using a rapid test validated by the EU Commission. In 2002 more than 688,000 tests were conducted and the number to date for 2003 is 614,756. The carcases of cattle over 30 months of age are not permitted to enter the human food chain unless the animals have tested negative for BSE.</P>
    <P>Ireland's handling of all aspects of BSE is subject to ongoing scrutiny, from various perspectives, by independent bodies such as the EU's Food and Veterinary Office, the Food and Safety Authority of Ireland and others. Our safety measures have been recognised as comprehensive, rigorous and responsible.</P>

      <P>The disease levies were doubled with effect from 1 January through the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 596 of 2002), which were approved by the Oireachtas. The increases were made against the background of the overall budgetary situation and the high Exchequer costs of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes. It was also done because of a major part of the expenditure related to compensation. The unit cost of reactors increased significantly under the on-farm market valuation scheme that replaced the reactor grant scheme in April.</P>
      <P>The increases were also made in the context of the revised arrangements for the TB and brucellosis schemes that were introduced in April 1996 following agreement with the farming bodies. Under these arrangements it was agreed that the levies would contribute some £10 million a year or 50% of the compensation costs over the 1996 to 1999 period. For a variety of reasons the levies contribution fell short of the 50% target. Compensation payments totalled some £120 million over the four years and le levy receipts reached £45 million for the same period. In the subsequent three years levies accounted for less than 25% of compensation payments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The changes that I intend to make to REPS will require an amendment to the CAP rural development plan. There are procedures laid down in EU Regulations for making such an amendment. I have them in motion by making a formal proposal to the European Commission. The Commission services will determine, to some extent, the length of time it takes for the changes to be considered. However, my officials will do everything in their power to expedite matters. I have proposed to the Commission that the changes should be effective from 1 January 2004 and I will introduce the new scheme without delay following approval.</P>
      <P>The proposals I have now sent to the Commission reflect the outcome of a wide-ranging consultative process on REPS that I launched in October 2002. My Department received over 50 written submissions that covered a wide range of issues. A series of meeting took place with the parties that made submissions. The consultative process culminated with an open forum on 4 June in which the various stakeholders took part, along with officials of my Department and the European Commission. The proposals I have made reflect the outcome of the consultative process and further detailed discussions with farm organisations. They include increased payment rates in line with the Government commitment in Sustaining Progress and provision to make REPS available for the first time to more intensive farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my priorities in the new scheme is to make it simpler and more farmer-friendly. I have asked my officials to do everything possible to simplify REPS from the farmer's point of view and to reduce his or hers operational costs. There are many stakeholders in REPS as the consultative process clearly demonstrated. REPS must <Col N="522" />evolve to reflect the changing circumstances of farming and the changing expectations of society. The proposals I have sent to the Commission are designed to deliver increased biodiversity and tangible environmental benefits while offering a model of sustainable farming that will be accessible over time to the great majority of Irish farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have placed a high priority on improving Ireland's animal identification and traceability systems. I am determined to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control. I want it to remain at the forefront in terms of consumer assurance and food safety.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001, and against a backdrop of earlier unsuccessful efforts in this regard, I introduced a comprehensive sheep identification system. The scheme was called the national sheep identification system. It provides individual identification and traceability of sheep from farm of origin to carcase. It is designed to be multi-functional, facilitating aspects such as flock management, consumer assurance and disease monitoring and control. The foot and mouth disease crisis underscored the potential damage our economy and the agriculture sector is exposed to in the event of serious disease outbreaks if shortcomings in animal identification and traceability were not addressed. Based on NSIS monitoring and feedback to my Department, from various quarters since 2001, I am satisfied that all elements of the system are now imbedded in the sheep sector and working well. I have made it clear consistently that I am always willing to enhance and improve the identification system and will address any operational difficulties that arise, while maintaining its key components.</P>
      <P>A new harmonised system of identification for the European Union has been proposed by the EU Commission. The current proposals provide that there will be electronic identification of sheep from January 2008, together with a central movement database recording movements on a batch basis. The implementation date is subject to review following a Commission report in 2006. For the interim period it is proposed that all sheep be double tagged and identified individually. All recording is on a flock basis in line with a vote by the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Italian Presidency aims to bring the final proposal before the December Council of Agriculture Ministers. The proposal will afford member states that have systems offering a higher <Col N="523" />level of traceability than the interim period system the option of retaining their systems until the advent of electronic identification in a few years from now.</P>
    <P>I support the broad principle that underlies these proposals. It is necessary to have in place a robust, harmonised system of sheep identification backed up with good record keeping allowing full traceability of animal movements at all times. I have always been in favour of making use of new and efficient technologies to achieve this end, subject to practicalities and cost effectiveness. I am anxious that Ireland and other member states move at the earliest possible date to an electronic system. In the interim the current system, that operates throughout the Irish sheep sector, will continue to afford Ireland the level of protection and assurances regarding identification and traceability that is strategically appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to dismantle the sheep identification system and roll back the progress that has been made in the area since 2001. I do not wish to see sheep farmers, marts and meat processors being asked in the future to re-instate and accommodate individual identification and traceability by the 2008 target date for the introduction of electronic systems. I am willing to examine and address aspects of the system's operation in so far as they can be addressed within the community system that is put in place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 88, 96 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>Ring rot is a bacterial disease that only affects potatoes. It is not airborne and does not survive in soil without a host crop. However, it can survive for some time on machinery, handling equipment and stores. The disease is primarily introduced by the planting of infected seed potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Council Directive 93/85/EEC all member states are obliged to carry out annual surveys for the disease. The directive also lays down detailed measures that must be observed for the detection, prevention, spread and eradication of the pathogen. Last year a survey of the potato sector was conducted and 600 samples were taken. It included the national crop of seed and ware and imports from the EU and third countries. The sampling regime is based on risk analy<Col N="525" />sis and to date all samples have proved negative for ring rot.</P>
    <P>A single infection of the disease on one farm in Wales has been confirmed. It triggered a review of our measures that have proven adequate to date. I will continue to monitor the situation in the United Kingdom in consultation with the authorities there.</P>
    <P>Testing for the disease is being reviewed in the context of the risks involved. All commercial growers are being asked to identify their seed source with a view to identifying risk material. Strategies to combat the risk of infection are being formulated between my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland. Some re-orientation of existing controls with an increase in inspection levels, follow-up sampling and testing is also being undertaken.</P>

      <P>In leading the development of Irish agriculture my objectives include the retention of the maximum number of farm families and ensuring that farming is an attractive career option for young people generally. Policies pursued by my Department are geared towards achieving these objectives.</P>
      <P>Regarding the role of women in agriculture, I established an advisory committee, which reported in September 2000. The advisory committee's report contained 36 recommendations in total, covering a broad range of policy and operational areas, relating to 19 Departments and agencies. These areas were the statistical evaluation of women farmers; employment and training; information technology; social inclusion; representation; and personal finance-legal issues.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="526" />While recognising the contribution of women to Irish agriculture, it is clear from an analysis of the recommendations that the report's central concerns related to issues affecting women in rural communities generally.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a national rural development forum, which meets in open session twice a year, provides a forum for continued attention to many of the issues raised in the advisory committee's report. It should also be noted that, subsequent to the publication of the report, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established. In addition elements of the report were incorporated into the National Plan for Women, published in 2002 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Action was taken, in as far as practicable, on the recommendations in the advisory committee's report and my Department is finalising a comprehensive report on progress across all the recommendations.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware I have already decided that all direct payments for cattle, sheep, dairying and arable crops will be fully decoupled from production as and from 1 January 2005. I made my decision on full decoupling well ahead of the effective date of 1 January 2005 to enable farmers and the markets to adjust and to plan ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the European Commission's detailed rules on decoupling have not yet been published my Department has commenced the work of <Col N="527" />establishing entitlements for every individual farmer in the country. In this context, my Department has set up a steering group to oversee the overall implementation of the mid-term review agreement. It has also set up working groups to examine the various aspects of the agreement and the IT and other resources to implement it. My Department intends to establish single payment entitlements for each farmer and notify those entitlements to individual farmers during 2004. It will not be possible however to finalise this work until such time as the Commission's detailed rules are fully agreed. It should be noted that while the Council regulation governing the single payment scheme has now been published, the Commission detailed rules regulation is unlikely to be published until near Christmas. Negotiations on the detailed rules regulation will then get under way at official level and it is unlikely that final agreement will be reached before April 2004.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department is setting up a unit to deal with <i>force majeure</i> or hardship cases. The single payment will be based on the average number of animals, or average number of hectares in the case of arable aid, determined under the livestock premia and arable aid schemes in respect of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002. However, the Council regulation provides that a farmer whose production was adversely affected during the reference period by a case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances occurring before or during the reference period shall be entitled to request that the reference amount be calculated on the basis of the calendar year or years in the reference period not affected by the case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>If the whole of the reference period was affected by the case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances the reference amount shall be calculated on the basis of the 1997 to 1999 period.</P>
    <P>My Department will shortly publish an advertisement in the national and provincial press inviting farmers who feel that during the reference period his or her farming enterprise was adversely affected by <i>force majeure</i> to apply to my Department to have his-her case considered. Application forms to facilitate the processing of such cases will be available at all local offices of my Department. Where a farmer who applies for <i>force majeure</i> is not satisfied with my Department's decision on his or her application there will be a facility to allow such farmers to have his-her case determined by an independent appeals mechanism.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland and Portugal are unique among EU member states as the only countries that exclusively provide and finance an official carcase classification service in meat factories. The decision that the Department should withdraw from providing this service is based on the principle that a departmental permanent presence in meat plants should be confined to areas where regulatory responsibility is vested in it, as the competent authority. The Department's only regulatory responsibility in respect of carcase classification is of a supervisory nature and it will continue to carry out this function.</P>
      <P>Following withdrawal from carcase classification duties the staff concerned will carry out other necessary functions where there is a shortage of staff resources. Agreement has been reached with the IMPACT trade union on redeployment arrangements. In the meantime training of factory operatives, delivered free of charge by my Department, is currently in progress. This will enable factory operatives to be trained to the appropriate standard and enable them to provide continuity of service when the Department classifiers are withdrawn. At that stage my Department will provide intensive supervision of the grading process, in line with the systems operated in 13 other EU member states.</P>
      <P>I have been pressing for the option of introducing mechanical grading for some time at EU level. This was finally agreed by the Commission earlier this year and machines were tested last month in factory conditions. The results of these tests will be available shortly. Given that mechanical grading is something which has been sought by the industry including factories and producers, I anticipate it will become the norm in the industry in the near future.</P>

      <P>In 2000 I put in place a scheme for the <Col N="529" />allocation of 5 million gallons of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to young milk producers who satisfied certain defined criteria. The 3,099 eligible applicants each received an allocation of 1,700 gallons. Furthermore, in 2001 an additional 4.5 million gallons was allocated to young farmers, and 3,442 applicants each received an extra 1,300 gallons under that scheme. There was no specific allocation to young farmers from the national reserve in 2002. The allocation in that year was to certain categories of small and medium scale producers who satisfied certain defined criteria.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has no direct role in determining the prevailing prices charged for food products in the retail market. In the Single Market food products are traded freely, and Governments do not have the authority to set the levels of mark-up at different stages of processing and sale.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent report detailing concerns that retailers have been the main beneficiaries of food price increases and that producers have not benefited proportionately. The factors determining producer returns and retail prices are complex. Retail prices are influenced by a number of factors including processing and distribution costs, overheads and exchange rate fluctuations. The strength of sterling has contributed to food price inflation due to the import content in some categories of food products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The returns to producers only partly consist of market prices and cannot be seen in isolation from the direct support paid to producers under the Common Agriculture Policy. My Department <Col N="530" />will for example pay some &euro;1.6 billion under EU funded agricultural measures in 2004. This expenditure mainly consists of direct payments to farmers worth on average &euro;13,000 per farmer. The decision to decouple payments will allow farmers to focus more clearly on the demands of the market and of the final consumer. FAPRI Ireland's research forecasts some increase in prices and reduced input costs, which will impact positively on farm incomes.</P>

      <P>The organic development committee, in its report published last year, estimated that a target of 3% of land area in organic farming in Ireland by 2006 was feasible.

      <P>While I believe that organic farming offers real opportunities to a proportion of Irish farmers, I see no point in setting targets which do not reflect market realities. Regarding training and education, the organic development committee recommended the establishment of a partnership expert working group to co-ordinate, facilitate and monitor the provision of training, education, advice and research. This group, which is chaired by Teagasc, was set up earlier this year and has made progress on a number of fronts.

In addition compulsory cross-compliance measures for food safety, environmental standards, animal health and welfare, and so on will be required.</P>
      <P>Particular flexibility and commitment will be required from my staff from now to mid-2005 as during this period the schemes must be operated as normal while the same staff will be involved in the advance preparations for new procedures.</P>
      <P>In addition the detailed implementation rules and regulations have yet to be drafted by the European Commission. It is therefore too early to assess the final impact of the changes on the operations of my Department. However, it is clear that the decision will lead to the reallocation of work and staff which will involve the redeployment of officers in the Department as well as the possible transfer of staff to other Departments.</P>

      <P>The number of people employed in agriculture has declined at a rate of about 3% per annum since 1991. During the same period the decline in the number of farms was about 2% per annum. While a decline is likely to continue, analysis of the mid-term review published by FAPRI-Ireland in May 2003 indicated that decoupling was likely to lead to an increase in part-time farming.</P>
      <P>I recently decided to implement the full decoupling option with effect from 1 January 2005. In making this decision I was guided by, among other things, the desirability of allowing farmers the greatest degree of freedom possible in their farming enterprises and to ensure that the sector produces for the consumer.</P>

      <P>The main development in recent months was the WTO ministerial conference in Cancún in September which failed to reach agreement on the way forward in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations.</P>
      <P>In the lead up to Cancún, the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy and the EU-US accord on agriculture had demonstrated the EU's commitment to participating constructively in the negotiations and to seeking a positive outcome. However, due to the complexity of the issues involved and the diversity of positions held, it was not possible to reach agreement.</P>
      <P>I believe the failure at Cancún was a missed opportunity for all of the negotiating parties, but in particular for the developing countries who stand to gain real benefits from a new agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council in October restated the EU's commitment to the multilateral approach and to the early resumption of negotiations. It invited the Commission to reflect on the EU's strategy to explore with key WTO players the possibility of future progress. The Commission's communication entitled Reviving the DDA negotiations &ndash; the EU Perspective was published on 26 November and proposes that the EU should support the early relaunch of the negotiations and <Col N="533" />participate constructively in efforts to this end. The Commission's communication is currently under discussion in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The WTO general council will meet on 15 December in an effort to relaunch the negotiations. I have discussed this issue with fellow EU Agriculture Ministers and Commissioners Fischler and Lamy, both at Council and in pre-presidency bilateral meetings. There is broad agreement that the EU's negotiating position on agriculture should remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>Ireland remains committed to the multilateral framework for international trade and to a successful conclusion of a new broadly based agreement. However, any proposals which would require any further adjustments of the Common Agricultural Policy, beyond those agreed during the mid-term review, would be unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 99 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the multi-agency investigations carried out from 1995 to 1998, samples from products on farms in the area were analysed for a wide range of potentially toxic substances. The results of these analyses are presented in the 1995 interim report on the investigation of animal health problems at Askeaton, County Limerick. <Col N="534" />Neither the analysis of these results nor data from other components of the investigation &ndash; environmental quality, soil, herbage, feed and water &ndash; indicated a pattern of exposure to toxic components.</P>
    <P>Detailed monitoring of animal health was also carried out on a number of farms during a two-year period. Blood, milk and other samples were collected as required to investigate specific animal health or production issues and post-mortem investigations and analyses were also undertaken on any animal carcases from these farms submitted to my Department's regional veterinary laboratory in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The overall conclusion of the Askeaton animal health investigation, as published in the final report in 2001, was that there was no evidence that animal health or production on any of the participating farms were subject to unusual, adverse influences during the periods of observation. I would emphasise the fact that the Askeaton investigation was an entirely science-based exercise and the conclusions contained in the final report were formed on the basis of analysis of the evidence gathered by and available to the various participating agencies during the period of the investigation itself.</P>
    <P>No additional checks on milk or meat products, including feeding trials, were deemed necessary based on the findings of the animal health aspects of the investigation. However, all such products originating from these farms would have been subjected to the normal food hygiene controls at the processing intake points.</P>
    <P>There is no objective evidence available to my Department to suggest that there has been a deterioration in general animal health in the area since the final report was published. On that basis I do not believe that there are grounds which would justify embarking on further animal health investigation in the area or the further commitment of significant human and financial resources which this would imply. Where individual problems occur, as they do from time to time on farms throughout the country, the veterinary laboratory service of my Department is available to support local veterinary practitioners and their clients and this will remain the case. The Limerick regional veterinary office has been authorised to carry out tests free of charge for farmers in the Askeaton area where the farmer's private veterinary practitioner considers such tests warranted.</P>

      <P>During the 2002-03 milk quota year I put in place a scheme for the allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers who satisfied certain defined criteria. A quantity of 32 million litres, 7 million gallons, was made available for allocation under this scheme and almost 27 million litres of this was allocated in November 2002. The remaining 5 million litres was allocated in June 2003, following an appeals procedure. In total, over 6,400 applications were received and of these 1,744 satisfied the conditions of the scheme and received a quota allocation. I am forwarding a schedule of the breakdown by county, based on applicants herd numbers, to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under the mid-term review agreement, the total milk quota on which the dairy premium may be paid is limited to the level of the national quota for the year 1999-2000. No premium is payable in respect of quantities in addition to that, such as those allocated to Ireland under Agenda 2000.</P>

      <P>Article 43(4) of European Council Regulation No. 1782/2003 detailing the outcome of the CAP mid-term review provides that payment entitlements per hectare may not be modified save as otherwise provided. The present position is that entitlements may only be modified in cases where livestock entitlements are already established and the farmers concerned qualify for the decoupled dairy premium in 2005. In such cases the value per hectare of the decoupled dairy premium is added to the value of the livestock entitlements without the necessity of having additional eligible hectares.</P>
      <P>I secured a concession in the context of the Council regulation whereby young farmers who commenced farming during one or two of the reference period years will have their entitlements based on the one or two years average rather than over the three year average as is the general rule. In addition, new entrants to farming who commenced their farming activity after 31 December 2002 will have priority access to the national reserve for entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to the possibility of young farmers stacking entitlements will be raised in the context of the discussions on the Commission's detailed rules. It should be noted <Col N="536" />that while the Council regulation governing the single payment scheme has now been published the Commission detailed rules regulation is unlikely to be published for some weeks. Negotiations on the detailed rules regulation will then get under way at official level and it is unlikely that final agreement will be reached before April 2004.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant progress in the control and eradication of BSE over the past year and the transfer of some costs to the industry have led to a reduction in the budgetary requirements for general disease control in 2004. This provision, at &euro;80.455 million, represents a reduction of &euro;68 million on the 2003 allocation and reflects the results of the proactive application of BSE control measures since the emergence of the disease in Ireland in 1989.</P>
      <P>In particular, enhanced measures in the control and processing of meat and bonemeal and a ban on the use of specified risk material introduced in 1996 and 1997 respectively have had a significant effect on the exposure of cattle to infective material. The result of these efforts is that the number of BSE cases discovered in 2003 to date, 168, is 46% less than the number of cases discovered in the corresponding period last year, 313.</P>
      <P>More importantly, however, there has been a significant shift in the age profile of positive animals. Less than 2% of cases diagnosed in 2003 to date and in 2002 were less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in the year 2000. This clear evidence that the age profile of BSE positive animals is increasing allows us to predict with confidence that the number of BSE cases will continue to decline in 2004 and thereafter, as older animals leave the system. The change in the number of BSE cases will have a beneficial effect not only in terms of the reduced direct burden on public finances but it should also assist in protecting and further developing our beef markets in the EU and elsewhere and in helping to protect farm incomes into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2004 allocation also reflects a decision to end Exchequer funding of meat and bonemeal related costs and for BSE testing at meat plants during 2004. More than 1.7 million such tests, <Col N="537" />almost entirely funded by the taxpayer, have been carried out at slaughter plants since the programme of active surveillance began in 2001. During 2003, costs of testing male animals and younger females were transferred to the industry. The subsidy paid on testing these animals will be reduced from &euro;10.50 to &euro;8 from 1 January 2004, in line with the reduction in EU co-funding for such tests. The full cost of testing older cows will continue to be carried by the Department until mid-year, when the State contribution will be terminated. EU co-funding of &euro;8 per test for these older animals will continue to be passed on to the industry thereafter. Exchequer funding of meat and bonemeal related costs was discontinued from June 2003.</P>

      <P>Based on the most recent figures available, the number of farmers who have stated that farming is their sole occupation has fallen from 98,000 in 1997 to 79,000 in 2000. The main reduction has been in the specialist dairying area.</P>
      <P>This decrease was signalled in some detail in the Agri-Food 2010 report, which I commissioned in 1999. The movement from sole occupation farming to part-time farming or indeed other occupations reflects the changing face of farming and the opportunities that have presented themselves throughout the economy. This is manifest in the number of farmers who currently combine farming with an off-farm job, a trend that is in line with developments in other countries.</P>
      <P>Farming is a challenging sector and will remain so in the future. My aim, especially in opting for full decoupling, is to allow farmers the greatest possible freedom of choice in the options available to them.</P>

      <P>I fully support the European model of agriculture which is based mainly on family farms. Within this system scale can be an issue which causes problems for some farmers and hampers their ability to achieve incomes in line with expectations. However, there are a number of options that can be followed to secure a viable future.</P>
      <P>Increased scale and efficiency, especially in the cost of production, are solutions, though for some these may not be easy or feasible. However, the growth of the economy also allows for part-time farming, meaning that farmers whose scale would not permit them to earn an adequate wage by farming alone can combine their return from farming with an off-farm job to produce a viable income. While this is something which may not suit every farmer, it is to be welcomed in so far as it permits the continuation of a greater number of smaller family farm enterprises than would otherwise be the case.</P>
      <P>It is therefore a matter for each individual to judge for themselves what their best course of action should be. The role for my Department has been to support farm families in whatever choices they may wish to make. To this end, I have actively encouraged changes in training and specialist courses, grant schemes and advice programmes to cater for the needs of all farmers, whether part-time or otherwise, to help such farmers maximize their potential and income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1996, the UK introduced a ban on the feeding of meat and bone to all farmed animals. On this basis, the UK was considered to have an <Col N="539" />effective feed ban from 1 August 1996. It is clear from the incidence of BSE in the UK in recent years that these additional controls have been effective at reducing the exposure of cattle born after this time period to the BSE agent. However, over the course of the last two years a relatively small number of BSE cases, when compared to the overall size of the epidemic in the UK, have been confirmed in cattle which were born after 1 August 1996.</P>
      <P>A study, the results of which are expected to be published in the near future, has been carried out by the UK authorities on the first 59 of these so-called BARB cases &ndash; born after the re-enforced ban. No clear cause of disease in these animals has been identified. However, maternal transmission has been ruled out in the vast majority of these cases. Epidemiologists involved have suggested that imported feed ingredients cross contaminated with infective meat and bonemeal may be responsible but future research will also consider such issues as cattle to cattle transmission and possible environmental contamination.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, measures to reinforce the feed ban were introduced in 1996 and 1997. To date, only two animals born after 1997 &ndash; both born in 1999 &ndash; have been diagnosed with BSE despite the testing of all cattle over 30 months of age slaughtered in meat plants and all animals over 24 months of age delivered to knackeries and/or which died on farms. In excess of 1.9 million tests have been carried out to date. The results of the epidemiological investigations into these two cases have been reported previously. No evidence of deliberate breaches of the additional control measures were uncovered.</P>
      <P>While it has not been possible to determine the exact cause of disease in these cases, evidence of possible contamination with unburied carcase parts and-or access to old stocks of feed which may have been cross-contaminated with meat and bone material was found in both cases.</P>

    <P>I was concerned, in particular, about the difficulty caused for consumers by the multiplicity of Departments and agencies involved in consumer information on labelling and especially in the <Col N="540" />enforcement of the regulations. As a result, and following a recommendation I received from the consumer liaison panel, I set up the food labelling group in July 2002 to examine the issues of concern to consumers with regard to labelling.</P>
    <P>In December last, the labelling group presented its report to me. It contained 21 recommendations covering general labelling rules, policy and enforcement, consumer education and awareness and origin. I accepted the recommendations of the group. As the recommendations covered issues within the responsibility of a number of Departments and Government agencies, I set up an interdepartmental-agency group to progress implementation of the recommendations. Considerable progress has been achieved in implementing the report and especially on the two main issues emanating from the report &ndash; the centralisation of enforcement of food labelling regulations in the Food Safety Authority and the definition of origin of meat.</P>
    <P>On the centralisation of enforcement, responsibility for the general food labelling legislation was transferred from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment to the Department of Health and Children in June of this year, with the enforcement of those regulations coming within the remit of the FSAI. Responsibility for the enforcement of my Department's beef labelling regulations was transferred to the FSAI last January and responsibility for other labelling regulations will be formally transferred shortly.</P>
    <P>There was full agreement within the food labelling group that consumers should have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers' wishes in this area. At my request, the consumer liaison panel drew up a strategy for this research and has commissioned same. At this stage, the research is almost completed and I expect the consumer panel to report to me on the results before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline progress on other recommendations of the food labelling group. The food labelling group recognised the concerns of consumers that there needed to be clearer information on labels about allergens. An EU regulation on allergen labelling in food was adopted by Council and Parliament in September 2003. There are two proposals being progressed at EU level relating to nutritional health and functional claims and nutritional labelling. With regard to education and information, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to incorporate a module on food safety, labelling and consumer issues into the primary and secondary school curricula.</P>
    <P>The group's recommendation on informing the consumer of the price per weight unit was addressed in legislation introduced by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in March this year. The labelling <Col N="541" />group emphasised the responsibility of the food sector to produce safe food and to provide on all food and drink labels information that is clear, accurate and easy to read. In July 2003, I launched an industry guide for clear labelling for food and drinks which was prepared by the food and drink industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made and I intend to pursue this matter to ensure that any deficiencies in food labelling are addressed.</P>

      <P>My Department had discussions with the industry interests on the feasibility of using fuel crops as raw material in alternative energy production in the context of a proposal to develop an ethanol enterprise. The mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy provided a system of aid at the rate of &euro;45 per hectare per year for areas sown under energy crops, which should act as an incentive to farmers to grow these crops. A Commission regulation setting out detailed rules for implementing these procedures will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for transposing the directive of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that further research and development is required on biofuel technologies. Both the Green Paper on sustainable energy and the national climate change strategy call for measures to limit the rate of increase in overall energy consumption and the need to encourage a switch to alternative, cleaner and more CO2 efficient sources of energy. In this con<Col N="543" />text, funding of &euro;16.25 million has been allocated under the national development plan for a research development and demonstration &ndash; RD&amp;D &ndash; programme for renewable energy sources which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland. The key purpose of the programme is to support solutions that enable technical and other barriers to market uptake to be overcome across all the renewable technologies, including biomass and biofuel technologies.</P>

      <P>The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. The Air Corps provides the search and rescue service off the north west coast. Since late September, there has been an unusually high incidence of sick leave among the Air Corps rear-crew, that is, winchmen and winch operators. As service continuity could not be guaranteed with the existing rearcrews, the GOC of the Air Corps posted 13 of the 17 personnel to other duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, all available options to return to a full search and rescue service in the north west have been examined. The Air Corps is endeavoring to return to full service, on a phased basis, as crews become available and there are ongoing consultations with the Coast Guard in this regard. The first full crew is currently engaged in work-up training on the S61 in the north west and, subject to satisfactory review, should go operational shortly. This crew will be able to provide winching capability during daylight hours for part of each week. A number of Air Corps personnel who previously served in search and rescue are <Col N="545" />also being retrained on the S61. In addition, a competition seeking volunteers to be trained as winchcrews in the search and rescue service has been advertised across the Defence Forces. The initial screening process for selection of the personnel to be trained has commenced.</P>
    <P>The current plan envisages that a 12 hour, largely day light, full SAR service will be available from late spring 2004, with the S61 providing a limited service, that is, search, air ambulance, island relief, disaster relief, etc., for the remaining 12 hours. The full 24 hour service on the S61 should commence in the autumn of 2004. In the period up to late spring 2004, the currently available limited S61 service will, of course, continue.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps is making every effort to support the return of a full service to the north west. The phased return to full service will be updated as circumstances permit. However, safety considerations are paramount. As such, it is important that new crews are given the necessary time so as they can receive the required training and secure appropriate experience before deployment to operational duties in what is a difficult operating environment.</P>

      <P>My Department already provides attractive financial supports to help farmers to convert <Col N="548" />from conventional to organic methods. Under the existing rural environmental protection scheme, farmers in conversion can draw payments of up to &euro;13,280 a year. Once they have reached full organic status, and can take advantage of the higher prices commanded by organic produce, they can still draw REPS payments of up to &euro;9,680 a year. I have submitted proposals to the European Commission for amendments to REPS which, if approved, will make the support for organic production even more attractive.</P>
      <P>Organic farmers and farmers in conversion to organic status can also apply for a grant towards the cost of capital investment. These grants can be given for purposes like the modification of animal housing or the purchase of new equipment. The scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector offers 40% grant assistance, up to a maximum of &euro;50,790, for on-farm projects. Off-farm investment projects are also eligible and grant aid is available up to a maximum of &euro;508,000.</P>
      <P>The report of the organic development committee, which was published in April 2002, recommended the establishment of a number of additional structures. The national steering group, the partnership expert working group and the organic market development group have all met on a number of occasions during 2003. Other recommendations have already been implemented or are well advanced. The first national organic production census was published in October. A dedicated organic farming page has been included on my Department's website. I have already accepted a proposal from the partnership expert working group to establish a network of demonstration farms and these will be up and running in the new year. Three priority research projects have also been identified by this group. The market development group has invited design proposals for a national label for organic produce. A review of the REPS organic supplementary measure has been carried out and the proposals form part of the overall amendments submitted for approval to the European Commission, to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>I have secured funding for next year to accelerate the implementation of the recommendations of the organic development committee report.</P>

      <P>Approximately 278,000 animals were removed from the market under the purchase for destruction, PFD, scheme, while the special purchase scheme, SPS, accounted for a further 235,000 animals. All carcasses were rendered into meat and bonemeal, MBM, at approved rendering plants generating a total for both schemes of 55,000 tonnes. Contracts resulting from an EU-wide competitive tender were put in place for the disposal by incineration abroad of this material. Incineration of the MBM was completed recently. The MBM consisted of bulk meal from carcase and offal, bagged blood meal and bagged SRM meal, all of which was retained in secure, approved storage under departmental supervision.</P>

      <P>The labelling of food is governed by EU legislation. The requirements of this legislation vary according to the origin of different products. These can range from the country of origin, the name and address of the manufacturer or the approval number of the manufacturing premises. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for the enforcement of most of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Beef has been the subject of much comment in recent times. The labelling of beef is governed by specific legislation under the remit of my Department. This legislation stipulates that operators involved in the marketing of beef, must label their products with: a reference code to enable beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it is derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is located; the approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is located; and an indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived. For the purposes of these regulations, marketing means all aspects of beef production and marketing up to and including sale through retail outlets.</P>
      <P>On a wider scale, where meat and meat products are imported, the above labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to the marketing of beef within the Community, regardless of whether that beef was produced within the Community or in a third country. Where the beef is imported into the Community from a third country and not all of the above details are available, that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as &ldquo;Origin: non-EC&rdquo; along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" />These beef labelling regulations are currently under review by the European Commission. In this context, I have raised specific concerns with the Commission on the labelling of beef in the food service sector.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the formulation of policy and the implementation of legislation governing the labelling and safety of GM foods in Ireland rests with the Department of Health and Children. My Department has responsibility for ensuring regulatory compliance with regard to seeds and in the area of coexistence between GM crops and conventional crops.</P>
      <P>The rules governing GMOs are set down in EU regulations adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. In the case of the growing of GM crops, member states are allowed to put in place their own arrangements to manage their cultivation. The EU Commission has provided guidelines to assist member states in this regard. All member states are now in the process of drawing up a series of national strategies and best practices to ensure that the co-existence of GM crops with conventional crops can be effectively managed in the context of the particular circumstances and requirements in each country.</P>
      <P>My Department has established an interdepartmental-inter-agency working group which is currently examining all the issues involved with the objective of identifying best practices and procedures for GM crop production in this country.

      <P>Ireland has a dynamic prepared consumer foods sector which has experienced strong growth in recent years in terms of sales and exports and is projected to continue to be the fastest growing sector of the Irish food industry in the immediate future. To assist the sector in <Col N="552" />continuing its sales growth and in keeping pace with market developments, Enterprise Ireland launched its Prepared Consumer Foods Strategy 2003-2006 on 9 October last.</P>
      <P>The strategy sets out a vision for a strong performing sector and outlines the key features driving rapid and radical change in the food industry. The main feature is a continuing market led move away from basic products towards prepared food products, driven by changing consumer buying behaviour, the changing marketplace and technology advances. The strategy focuses on the need to upgrade the capabilities of Irish companies to improve their competitiveness, particularly in crucial areas of increased R&amp;D, human resource development, world class manufacturing and e-business investment. The initiatives to be taken by the State agencies, in partnership with the sector, to achieve the objectives of the strategy are comprehensively set out.</P>
      <P>The initiatives include assisting in-company research, which complements the public good research into the consumer foods and ready meals sectors carried out under the food institutional research measure, FIRM, for which my Department has provided significant funding in recent years. Ireland has a number of large food companies which are at the forefront of international developments in ready meal technology and are active participants in FIRM funded research projects being conducted at the Teagasc National Food Centre and at University College Dublin. This research on ready meal technology includes new product development, food safety, freeze chilling and sous-vide/freezing.</P>
      <P>All ready meal companies, including start up companies, are reached with outcomes from this research via workshops, factory visits, facts sheets and interactive training programmes. Key findings accessed by Irish researchers and technologists participating in European food R&amp;D programmes are also disseminated through the RELAY project which is funded by FIRM.</P>

      <P>Under the general food labelling legislation, which is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children, it is prohibited to make a statement on a label that would mislead the consumer. This legislation is enforced by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain regulations on the labelling of food products that come within the remit of my Department, such as beef, fruit juices and potatoes, set down specific requirements for the <Col N="553" />labelling of these products. These requirements are such that consumers cannot be misled about the authenticity of the products. The beef labelling regulations are currently enforced by the FSAI and the enforcement of the requirements on the other products will be transferred to the FSAI shortly. Beef labelling has been the subject of much comment in recent times and I am determined that the consumer is properly informed. Accordingly, with regard to the beef slaughtering and cutting plants under the control of my Department, I have asked the Department's veterinary inspectorate to examine the procedures in place and ensure full compliance with labelling requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Maintaining Ireland's high status in animal health and welfare is of critical importance given the economic and social importance of agriculture to the country. This country has an excellent record in dealing with animal diseases in the most effective and efficient manner having regard to all relevant national and international legal requirements.</P>
      <P>In the context of a single European market, the framework for preventing, controlling and dealing with animal disease outbreaks is laid down in European law. In Ireland, we are diligent in the application of EU rules and, in many instances, have been proactive in our approach to animal disease prevention, exceeding minimum EU rules where this is considered to be in the best interests of consumers and the agri-food sector. Each year, Ireland submits programmes for bovine brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis which are deemed eligible for funding from the EU veterinary fund. The Commission reviews and assesses such programmes and monitors progress and compliance with the technical provisions of relevant Community veterinary legislation.</P>
      <P>In addition, in 2002 Ireland commenced operating an Aujeszky's disease eradication programme. The number of positive holdings disclosed under the programme is low. A compulsory vaccination programme is imposed and an approved eradication plan applied for each positive herd. The official status of the member states is detailed in Commission Decision 618/2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of BSE, my Department has adopted a proactive approach to disease prevention, introducing controls on the feeding of meat and bonemeal and the use of specified risk materials before they became mandatory at EU level. This approach has helped to keep Ireland out of the high incidence BSE category and has permitted Irish exporters to continue to sell beef <Col N="554" />and live animals on EU and third markets during a time of crisis in which similar exports from the UK and Portugal were banned. We are now reaping the long-term rewards of that approach, with a reduction of 46% in the number of BSE cases to date this year, 168, compared with the corresponding number last year, 313. The reducing number of cases and the increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed is a positive indication that the incidence of the disease will continue to decline next year and thereafter as older animals leave the system.</P>
    <P>In addition, while Ireland is free of many exotic diseases, contingency plans have been prepared for classical swine fever, Newcastle disease, avian influenza and foot and mouth disease. A contingency plan is also being prepared on bluetongue. Decisive action taken during the foot and mouth disease crisis in 2001 resulted in keeping the number of cases to just one, and permitted Ireland to regain its FMD free status in a relatively short space of time.</P>
    <P>The lessons learnt during that time have not been forgotten. Many measures introduced during that time, such as the strong legislative base for disease control introduced in the Disease of Animals (Amendment) Act 2001, new rules on the registration and control of dealers, a national system for the identification and traceability of sheep and the application of full intra community rules on veterinary health certification of live animals imported from Northern Ireland, remain in place today. Further developments since that time include a national pig identification and traceability system and a comprehensive Aujesky's disease programme.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to promote best practice in animal health and welfare in Ireland and in Europe, in a manner which protects consumers in the first instance and Ireland's critically important agri-food sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Single Market, there is free circulation of goods within the EU but there are uniform EU-wide controls on the production and trade in meat and meat products. Under Com<Col N="555" />munity law it is a requirement that the meat has been sourced from an approved establishment, whether that is a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold store. It must also be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document or health certificate that bears the identity of the establishment from which the beef has been despatched.</P>
    <P>Under EU harmonised rules, imports into the European Union from third countries must have been sourced in premises and in countries which are approved by the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, FVO. This office carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. The evaluation of third countries is on the following basis: there are systems in place for the rapid detection, reporting and confirmation of list A diseases of the Office International des Epizooties or OIE; there is access to laboratory facilities that allow detection and confirmation to take place; there are animal disease control systems in place whose operation and outcome must be recorded and demonstrable, for example, registration of holdings, animal identification and movement controls; there are operational contingency plans for the control of and-or the eradication of OIE list diseases; and that the import policy in the country, including its controls, as well as the animal health situation in neighbouring countries have been assessed as acceptable.</P>
    <P>Where the FVO is satisfied that public health requirements are not being met by an approved establishment in a third country, the establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
    <P>Meat being imported into the European Community may only enter through a border inspection post, BIP, that has been approved by the FVO. That office also carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state's BIPs to ensure that the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under harmonised EU legislation, are being correctly applied. In Ireland, the border inspection posts approved for administering checks on direct imports of meat from third countries are Dublin Port, for frozen, chilled and ambient temperature animal products, and Shannon Airport, for chilled and ambient only, and these posts are staffed by officials from my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, importers must be registered with my Department. They must give advance notice of the arrival of meat. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation which shows country and approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate which conforms to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be labelled. All consignments <Col N="556" />undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Where required, sampling for laboratory analysis for the purposes of safeguarding human and animal health is carried out. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the Community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination.</P>
    <P>Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established, they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy that Irish beef should be free to enter any market where <Col N="557" />exporters consider there are commercial possibilities. Every effort will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical level to have all potential markets open to Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>No BSE related restrictions have ever been imposed on Ireland by the EU Commission or by any individual member state of the EU. The UK market, in particular, as a destination for Irish beef has seen huge growth during the past two years and has remained strong this year also. Last year, exports to the UK amounted to 250,000 tonnes and it is likely that that total will be matched again in 2003. Markets for Irish beef in France, Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Sweden also remain strong. In the course of the past year Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary have lifted their restrictions on Irish beef imports.</P>
      <P>With regard to non-EU markets, we are keen to have existing restrictions, where they remain, removed at the earliest possible date. In September of last year, Russia lifted its remaining BSE related restrictions on Irish beef imports with a total of 83,000 tonnes exported there in 2002 and indications that up to 75,000 tonnes will be exported there this year. Egypt has also reopened its market to Ireland and trade is now taking place. In addition, Bahrain lifted its restrictions on Irish beef imports last July. My Department, working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia, is also in contact with the Saudi authorities and other Gulf States' authorities and I believe we are making progress in these markets. Efforts are continuing to have the South African, Indonesian, Philippine and Iranian markets re-opened.</P>
      <P>While there has always been strong competition on international beef markets, I am confident that Irish beef will continue to perform well, provided we produce a high quality product which offers the maximum food safety guarantees to consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland exports a wide range of dairy products to over 100 countries world-wide. The main products exported include cheese, butter, casein, milk powders and baby food. Over 85% of all dairy exports from Ireland are destined for EU member states. The United Kingdom is a very significant market for Irish dairy products, accounting for over 70% of all Irish cheese exports and 20% of butter exports annually. Germany and France are important markets for butter, importing 35% and 16% of Irish butter exports, respectively, in 2002. The Netherlands <Col N="558" />accounts for 25% of milk powder exports and Italy imports large quantities of Irish casein and SMP.</P>
      <P>Approximately 15% of Irish exports are sent to non-EU countries. The United States is a very important market for Irish cheese and casein. More than half the Irish cheese and over 85% of Irish casein exported outside of the EU goes to the United States. Other significant markets for Irish dairy products include Nigeria, the Congo, Egypt, Mexico, Singapore and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The Irish dairy industry is highly dependent on exports and I recognise the need to increase and expand our presence in export markets. The export of dairy products, in both commodity form and in the form of increasingly sophisticated ingredient and value-added products is a matter for the industry. Where appropriate, EU-funded export refunds apply. The industry is aware of the need to increase and strengthen its position on EU and non-EU markets and, where possible, will be assisted by my Department and by An Bord Bia in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prospectus report, which I commissioned in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the dairy industry, examined the structure of the Irish dairy processing sector and made a number of recommendations on actions to improve the efficiency and long-term competitiveness of the industry. This report has contributed to the very necessary debate and analysis within the industry on the steps it must take to move into the next phase of its development.</P>
      <P>The main findings, which are generally accepted by the industry include the need to increase scale and reduce costs in order to position the sector to withstand international competition and increase our penetration of high-value EU consumer markets. This would include improving the product mix to meet the demands of these markets and would in turn demand increasing the expenditure on research and development.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months, I have met the various processing groups and Enterprise Ireland to discuss the implementation of these strategies and identify any areas where I may be able to assist or facilitate with the changes required in the dairy industry. While I have made it clear that my Department and other State agencies will help in any way possible, within the constraints of EU policy, decisions on the best processing structure and the type of product mix best suited to Irish conditions and market requirements are a matter for the management and boards of the individual undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" />On production at farm level it is recognised that it is necessary to address the questions of increased scale, costs of production and other matters such as the level of milk constituents. The Luxembourg agreement has set the framework for the years ahead, with quotas extended to 2014-15, a reduction in support prices and the introduction of direct payments. It is clear that in this new climate producers will need to scale up their operations. We therefore need to have mechanisms in place that will facilitate the transfer of quota, at an affordable price, to active producers who need to increase the size of their operations and which will, at the same time, facilitate those producers who wish to leave the industry. The decision I made to bring forward the decoupling of the dairy premium to 2005 should help this process, since, after they have established their entitlement to a premium, producers will have the possibility of giving up milk production while retaining the premium and in turn making additional quota available to those remaining in production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, receive education appropriate to their needs.</P>
      <P>All children with special educational needs within the primary school system, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, ASD, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The special educational needs of children with ASD can be addressed in special dedicated schools, special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools or, on an integrated basis, in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>Many children at primary school level, with disorders on the autistic spectrum, are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of resource teachers and-or special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities receive enhanced capitation grants and operate at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. Special needs assistant support is also provided where required. There are currently 130 such classes for pupils with autism in the primary system. This includes four special classes for pupils with Asperger's syndrome, which is on the autistic spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" />It is the policy of my Department that all teachers working with children with special needs will have relevant training and continuing professional development. In this regard, the existing full-time pre-service primary teacher training courses in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>There has been a major increase in recent years in the level of additional teaching resources made available by my Department to schools to assist them in catering for children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the inservice training and professional development needs of these teachers, my Department has put in place a comprehensive strategy which involves: a major expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes; the introduction of a range of new training programmes to provide a mix of intensive induction training and more advanced training in specific areas; the funding of a wide range of shorter courses, including on-line courses, for teachers on aspects of special education; and the establishment of a new special education support service.</P>
    <P>Postgraduate courses in special educational needs are provided in: St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra &ndash; 50 places, primary; Church of Ireland Training College, Rathmines &ndash; 45 places, primary and post-primary; St. Angela's College, Sligo &ndash; 25 places, primary and post-primary; University College Dublin &ndash; 15 places, primary and post-primary; and Mary Immaculate College, Limerick &ndash; 25 places, primary and post-primary.</P>
    <P>A postgraduate professional programme in autism is also provided in St. Patrick's Training College in association with the University of Birmingham and 75 teachers have undertaken this programme to date.</P>
    <P>A nationwide induction-introductory programme for resource teachers is delivered by: St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra; Church of Ireland Training College, Rathmines; St. Angela's College, Sligo; and Mary Immaculate College, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Up to now my Department has provided funding for a wide range of shorter courses for teachers in the special needs area. These are mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers. In this regard, four e-learning courses were provided on a pilot basis during July and August 2003 for teachers in the areas of autism, dyslexia, inclusion and ADHD. The courses were successfully delivered on-line and more than 900 teachers availed of them. These on-line courses are also available to teachers during this autumn term. Much of the work involved in the support of personnel working with children with special educational needs is now being devolved to the new special education support <Col N="567" />service, which has the responsibility to co-ordinate provision in this area.</P>
    <P>The special education support service will consolidate and co-ordinate existing inservice provision at local level for personnel working with children with special educational needs. It will further explore various models of inservice and support for teachers in the classroom and will also work co-operatively with colleges of education and other agencies to maximise the effects of training and support across the spectrum.</P>
    <P>The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 provides for the national council for special education to advise me on the resources that will be required and the steps that must be taken to implement the Bill over a period not exceeding five years from the establishment of the council under the Bill. Any issues that arise in the context of the advice provided by the council that have implications for teacher training and continuing professional development will be considered in due course.</P>
    <P>My Department endeavours to provide cost-effective school transport to as many special needs pupils as possible, including pupils who are placed in special autism units. In the event that suitable cost-effective transport cannot be provided, grant aid may be offered to the families concerned towards the cost of private transport arrangements. My Department allocates grant aid to boards of management of special schools participating in the school bus escort scheme to assist them in defraying the costs involved in engaging a suitable person to act as school bus escort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation continues to monitor security of supply and has initiated a number of positive actions to redress postulated generation capacity shortfalls in the short-term and the medium to longer term. Short-term measures put in place for the coming winter include the implementation by ESB National Grid of a demand side management programme and increased imports of 167 MW of electricity from Northern Ireland, contracted on a priority basis to meet customer demand here until 30 June 2005, with possible extension to autumn 2006. In addition, ESB has purchased 104 MW of additional peaking capacity, which will be operational from 1 January 2004.</P>
      <P>As to the capacity deficit in the medium to longer term, the CER recently announced the two preferred bidders in the competition it is running to facilitate the introduction of new generating plant, with a combined generating capacity of over 500 MW. Additionally, ESB is currently undertaking a significant networks investment programme, of some &euro;4 billion up to 2007, to bring the transmission and distribution systems up to required international standards and to meet projected capacity demand requirements. The programme is being delivered within the planned timeframe and budget.</P>
      <P>As demonstrated by recent international blackout events, no electricity power system can be fully protected from all eventualities. However, I am advised that the transmission system operator, TSO, has in place specific plans to deal with any incident quickly and effectively, whereby supply is matched to demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 November last, the TSO published its annual Generation Adequacy Report for the period 2004 to 2010, in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. This report assesses the likely minimum generation capacity <Col N="569" />required to achieve an adequate supply and demand balance for electricity over a seven year time horizon. The findings of this report will inform policy developments in this area.</P>
    <P>Plant availability has a major impact on generation adequacy. The report points to the need to improve current plant availability and states that if availability improvement measures are sufficiently effective, the supply demand balance could be restored without the need for excessive amounts of additional plant above that envisaged by the current CER capacity competition.</P>
    <P>It also projects demand for electricity domestically to grow at an annual rate of between 2.9% and 4.3% over the period 2004 to 2010. By year end, generation capacity installed here or contracted with Northern Ireland is estimated at 5,892 MW. Excluding projected capacity of at least 500 MW to be added to the system as a result of the current CER capacity competition, the Generation Adequacy Report estimates that the generation capacity will have increased to 6,387 MW by the end of 2010. For the Deputy's ease of reference, the report is accessible on the TSO's website, <i>www.eirgrid.ie</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 167 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently launched the report of the expert working group on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. The report provides a detailed plan for the further development of radiation oncology services in this country. The Government has accepted the recommendations of this report and it agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clini<Col N="571" />cal radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first step of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; of the future service expansion. This is the best model to provide a radiation oncology service to the highest standards. The development of radiation oncology services along the lines recommended in this report is the single most important priority of my Department in cancer services in the acute setting.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have announced my approval of the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the Cork centre and the necessary capital investment amounting to &euro;4 million to commission this service as rapidly as possible. I have now approved the appointment of a project team to prepare a brief for the rapid expansion of current capacity from four to eight linear accelerators. I also intend to prioritise the necessary resources to ensure that the radiation oncology centre in Galway, which is currently being commissioned is in a position to treat patients, commencing in spring 2005. I have also requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate the expansion from three to six linear accelerators in the medium term. I will also give early approval to the establishment of a project team to plan this expansion. These developments in Cork and Galway will provide an additional five linear accelerators. This is a significant increase and, when fully developed, it will ensure an additional 2,000 patients are treated per year. Five additional consultant radiation oncologists will be employed in the provision of these services.</P>
    <P>I will require radiation oncology centres to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. I will also require radiation oncology centres to provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions. This is currently the case and as more consultant radiation oncologists are appointed it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services. This will improve access for patients in the southeast, mid-west and northwest.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has also decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the northwest. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access regardless of <Col N="572" />location and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a co-ordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report. I have now established a national radiation oncology co-ordinating group, which will, <i>inter alia,</i> facilitate improved access to existing and planned services. It will comprise clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing experts from different geographic regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with autism is a matter for the authority and the individual health boards. Health boards have, over the years, provided a level of support, either directly or through specialist voluntary agencies, for children with disabilities. These services include diagnosis, assessment, multidisciplinary support, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology services, for pre-school children and for children of school going age on an outreach basis. Additional funding of approximately &euro;15 million has been made available in recent years to enhance the level of health related support service available to children with autism and those with an intellectual disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have undertaken intensive recruitment drives at home <Col N="575" />and abroad. My Department has also asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches that might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services.</P>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The report recommends a significant annual increase in course places for these professions and all the new training places have now come on stream.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Hanly report's proposals, St. Columcille's Hospital will be developed as a local hospital. The report recommends investment in local hospitals such as St. Columcille's so they are in a position to provide most of the local population's needs for hospital care. Improvements proposed include: a greatly expanded proportion <Col N="576" />of elective day surgery and elective medical procedures for the region in a range of specialties. This will involve an increasing volume of elective procedures that are often currently performed in the larger hospitals; a strong focus for locally accessible multi-specialist day and out-patient &ndash; OPD &ndash; care; prenatal and postnatal maternity services; a point of access for general practitioners to services and diagnostic facilities; and rehabilitation and long-stay care.</P>
    <P>The report proposes that St. Columcille's will have the services of a number of health professionals giving people access to a wider range of hospital services in their local hospital than ever before. The report also states that a full range of acute hospital services should be available within the East Coast Area Health Board region, so that patients should not have to travel outside the region other than for specialised supra-regional or national level services. This will ultimately involve the appointment of an additional 129 consultants to the East Coast Health Board region. These consultants would work in local hospitals, including St. Columcille's Loughlinstown.</P>
    <P>On accident and emergency services, the Hanly report recommends that St. Columcille's hospital should provide a minor injury and illness service. This would cater for up to 80% of patients currently attending the hospital's accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>Emergencies in the community will be catered for by ambulance personnel with advanced training who can provide immediate treatment at the site of the accident or illness and then bring the patient to the hospital best equipped to provide high quality care.</P>
    <P>Membership of an implementation project group in the east coast areas will be announced shortly. The report emphasises that implementation of its recommendations should be on a phased basis. This means that services would not be altered until each hospital is properly equipped and resourced for its new role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 174, 178 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the expert medical group on whooping cough which was established by the then Minister for Health in 1977 to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available to them and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination. A copy of the report compiled on each child examined by this expert medical group, as well as a copy of the individual files compiled by the group, are retained by this Department. In cases where parents request a copy of the expert group file in respect of their child, a copy is provided to them; however, such reports cannot be published as they relate to the confidential health matters of individuals. The expert medical group did not make recommendations or produce a report other than the findings in each individual case examined.</P>
      <P>I understand that the most recent correspondence related to this issue received by my Department from the company referred to by the Deputy is dated 11 June 2002; it consists of a follow up by the company in response to an earlier request from my Department for details on adverse events reported to the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
      <P>I have not had direct discussions with my British counterparts on this issue and I am not aware of the UK report to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the tracing of the individuals who received Trivax batch 3741, the following is the position concerning the four health boards concerned. The Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board confirmed this week that the position concerning this matter has not changed since their last reply in mid-2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board undertook a comprehensive search of vaccine records which included the following measures: an examination of the electoral register; the board wrote to a number of GPs to request their assistance and sent lists relevant to their area; community welfare officers and public health nurses were consulted regarding the possibility of identifying recipients; and an examination of the board's intellectual disability register. This search identified that 106 people in the Southern Health Board region received vaccine from Trivax batch <Col N="578" />number 3741. Letters were sent to those for whom the board had current addresses, 37, which asked the individuals concerned to make contact with the relevant senior area medical officer. Some 29 of the 37 individuals concerned subsequently made contact with the board. In a further 18 cases, the individuals were no longer resident at the home address and the board considered it inappropriate for reasons of confidentiality to make contact with the home. I understand from the board that despite all of the above attempts, it was not possible to contact the remaining individuals. According to the Southern Health Board, none of the 29 individuals contacted had suffered any ill effects from the vaccine.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board confirmed this week that the situation in its region, as detailed in my previous reply, remains unchanged. The board identified three persons who received vaccine from Trivax batch number 3741. It clarified this by explaining that it was unable to trace any other records as the register represents vaccinations in the Galway area only and in most cases batch or lot numbers were not written in at the time the vaccination was given.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board and the North Western Health Board have not provided a response in the time allowed, however, the following is the most recent information provided by the health boards earlier this year. As previously outlined to the Deputy, the most recent correspondence from the Mid-Western Health Board states that the board's records indicate that 183 people in that region received vaccine from Trivax batch number 3741; of that group, the board was successful in obtaining current addresses for 104 individuals to whom it then wrote advising that it had received vaccine from that batch. Some 67 of the individuals contacted subsequently telephoned the board to get further details. As also stated in my previous response to the Deputy, an extensive trawl of records by the North Western Health Board identified three individuals in that region who received vaccine from Trivax batch number 3741.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the four health boards concerned have done all that is reasonable within their power to contact the individuals concerned.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the number of children in each health board area who were vaccinated with out of date polio vaccines; the numbers to be revaccinated; the reason that the revaccination programme has not been completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards which enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my previous responses to the Deputy, information received from health boards indicates that they have experienced difficulties in establishing the current position in relation to the number of children revaccinated, following the administration of oral polio vaccine, OPV, after the expiry date, as not all GPs have provided the required information.</P>
      <P>As advised previously, my Department has written to the health board chief executive officers on this matter on numerous occasions since this issue arose and requested that any discrepancy between the number of children in their health board area where records indicate they received OPV more than one month after the expiry date and the number of children who were subsequently revaccinated be comprehensively explained.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my letter of 22 January 2003 to the Deputy, health boards have indicated that the apparently high number of children yet to be revaccinated may not in fact be as high as current records show for the following reasons: GPs may have revaccinated children but have not advised the health boards; GPs may have established, on rechecking their records, that the vaccine was not in fact administered after the expiry date but may have failed to advise the relevant health board; parents may have decided not to have their children revaccinated; some children may have moved from the region; GPs may have decided against revaccination; and GPs may not have advised parents that vaccine was given more than one month after the expiry date and that revaccination is recommended.</P>
      <P>The health boards have assured my Department that they have contacted all relevant GPs and advised them of the recommendation to revaccinate; however, they have advised that in all instances the clinical responsibility rests with the GPs in question. My Department contacted the health boards this week in relation to this matter and has been advised that the situation as detailed above still prevails.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy last week, the new independent airport authorities at Shannon and Cork will have a statutory commercial mandate similar to the mandate which Aer Rianta has at present. Any new debt arising from trading or for investment purposes, such as waste facilities referred to by the Deputy, will appear on the balance sheets of the new companies in accordance with normal accounting practices.</P>
      <P>The cost estimates for the measures referred to by the Deputy are a day-to-day matter for Aer Rianta which, until the new Shannon Airport Authority is established on a statutory basis, remains responsible for the management and operation of Shannon Airport and I have no function in relation to the matter.</P>
      <P>The new boards designate for the three State airports, including Shannon Airport, will work with the current Aer Rianta board and with my Department on relevant issues involved in bringing about the transition to independent and autonomous authorities for Dublin, Shannon and Cork.</P>

      <Quest>if he is negotiating to retain the 50:50 status between Shannon and Dublin Airports on transatlantic routes in the context of EU-US negotiations on open skies; the status of these negotiations; his views on whether such a position is not at variance with EU competition rules; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in previous replies to the House on this matter, formal detailed negotiations took place between the EU and the USA in early October 2003 in Washington. A second round of negotiations will take place in Brussels on 9, 10 and 11 December 2003. During these negotiations, a special committee made up of all member states will assist the Commission. Ireland is represented on this committee by a senior official from my Department. It is unclear how long these negotiations will take.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the issue of the dual gateway status of Shannon Airport, I must also take account of wider considerations, especially the opportunities for new business for Ireland currently not being exploited due to the limitation on the number of US destinations open to Irish airlines because of that dual gateway policy.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism recommends that my Department should immediately renegotiate the Ireland-US international air agreement in advance of an EU-US agreement to remove the current US gateways restriction.</P>
      <P>As I said previously, change in this area is inevitable. Officials are currently holding consultations, on my behalf, with the trade unions representing airport staff, and I will shortly consult the new board designate of Shannon Airport. I have also recently spoken to interest groups from the Shannon region. When these consultations are concluded, I will decide on the next steps.</P>
      <P>Any bilateral negotiations between my officials and the US would be conducted following notification of our intentions to the European Commission, and the Commission may decide to participate in those discussions. This is expressly provided for in the package of measures on external relations in aviation agreed at the Transport Council on 5 June 2003. That involvement of the European Commission is to ensure that any negotiations carried out by Ireland are not in conflict with the Commission's position regarding its negotiations with the USA on the open aviation area agreement, particularly in view of the fact that negotiations between the EU and the USA have already begun. The outcome of such negotiations must also be notified to the Commission, and would be the subject of scrutiny under a comitology procedure. In view of this close involvement of the European Commission, I am confident that the negotiations between Ireland and the USA, and their outcome, would not be at variance with any EU rules.</P>

      <P>I set out my policy objectives for public transport reform in my November 2002 statement to the Public Transport Partnership Forum and to the Oireachtas Committee on Transport in June 2003. These detailed proposals are currently the subject of discussions between my Department, the CIE trade unions and the managements of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann. Once these discussions are completed I will finalise my proposals which will include the issue of public support for private operators. It is my intention to proceed with the necessary legislation in 2004.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of EU rules for state aid in public transport, the Court of Justice in the recent Altmark ruling clarified the rules regarding state aid and public subsidies paid for local public transport services. I understand that the ruling is being examined by the European Commission which intends to issue a formal communication on it in the near future.</P>

      <P>In response to public demand, and as part of my Department's assistance in the preparations for the Killarney 250 celebrations, which will celebrate 250 years of tourism in Killarney in 2004-5, a programme of minor works to improve the general amenity of the area around Ross Castle was carried out during 2003. This area is managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, as part of Killarney National Park.</P>
      <P>The programme of works included the development of new pedestrian pathways, the opening up of new viewing vistas on the lakes, as well as the erection of a bollard to restrict access to an area around Ross Castle and Island to pedestrians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The works were intended to improve the amenity of the area by the provision of a pleasant walking experience around Ross Island and also to provide for improved safety for pedestrians, improved security in the area around the castle <Col N="587" />and the elimination of horse dung from this area of the national park. I understand that these improvement works have been welcomed by the public. I also understand that there are currently 15 kilometres of internal roads in Killarney National Park available to jarveys, which are maintained at my Department's expense.</P>
    <P>Pony trekking operators who used the routes in question were consulted and provided with alternative routes. The routes involved were not widely used by jarveys. However, the proposed works were discussed in advance by my Department's regional manager with responsibility for the park with the Killarney National Park liaison committee, on which the jarveys are represented. I understand that no objections were raised in the discussions with the liaison committee on this matter. I am also advised that the traditional jarvey stand in the Ross Castle area is not affected by the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>The Review of Fire Services and Fire Safety in Ireland report was published in March 2002. I indicated my firm commitment to taking forward the fire safety and fire services elements of the review report recommendations. The report, which analyses current arrangements, key trends and international comparators runs to 272 pages and contains a chapter of some 44 pages with recommendations which are not all specifically itemised.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report, my Department, the fire authorities, the Fire Services Council and the National Safety Council, which currently retain their respective roles and responsibilities for fire services and fire safety development, have been guided by the review report recommendations in advancing their respective policies and services. I appointed a new Fire Services Council last February for a two year period and I have the assistance of the council in moving forward with the review and in highlighting the positive contribution of local fire services to the safety of the community. In addition, co-operation with the review implementation and change programme is included in relevant negotiations with staff interests through the Local Government Management Services Board and at individual fire authority level.</P>
      <P>I have also progressed the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003, incorporating amendments to the Fire Services Act 1981, through the Houses of the Oireachtas over the past year to address a number of changes called for in the review. The new Act significantly amends and updates the enforcement provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981 and these provisions came into effect on 14 July 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review report's recommendations on to inter-agency major emergency planning were overtaken by the creation of the Office of Emergency Planning at the Department of Defence in <Col N="589" />late 2001 which supports a Government task force on emergency planning chaired by the Minister for Defence. In addition, my Department and the City and County Managers Association, CCMA, recently formed a sub-committee under existing Department-CCMA structures to act as an interface and forum on local authority emergency planning issues and provide a vital link between the local and national structures.</P>
    <P>The implementation process in relation to the report includes the development and improvement of structures for the co-ordination and delivery of fire services. Work to this end is continuing.</P>

      <P>Section 82 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that an activity which was in operation immediately prior to the introduction of integrated pollution control licensing may, pending determination by the agency of an application for a licence, continue in operation after the date on which a licence is required for that activity concerned, provided that, before that date, an application is made to the agency for a licence.</P>
      <P>This provision was designed to ensure that activities could continue to operate in the period leading up to full mobilisation of the licensing system. However, the Act also makes it clear, including in section 99, that in this period any requirements imposed on the activity by other specified environmental legislation continue in force. In addition, section 85 of the Act requires the agency to give decisions on applications for licences as expeditiously as may be.</P>
      <P>The operation of the licensing system is a matter for the agency and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is legally precluded from becoming involved in particular cases which fall under its remit. I am satisfied that the relevant legislative provisions are reasonable and appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Composting is widely acknowledged as a natural process whereby organic waste is decomposed by the action of micro and macro-organisms in the presence of oxygen to produce a humus-like material. Under appropriately prescribed conditions, including suitable site selection criteria, the controlled composting of organic and green waste is internationally accepted as a long established, well-proven and broadly acceptable method for the treatment and recovery of biodegradable waste, resulting ultimately in a beneficial and useful end product, that is, compost.</P>
      <P>Bioaerosols, air-borne micro-organisms, including pathogenic bacteria and fungal spores, arise in many natural environments including lawns, farms and wooded areas. However, the operation of large-scale composting facilities may, in the absence of adequate precautions, give rise to the production of odours, volatile organic compounds and the release of bioaerosols in the immediate vicinity of such facilities. The main source for these bacteria and fungal spores at these installations may occur during mechanical agitation of the compost windrows, in activities such as screening, shredding and turning. Notwithstanding this, measures can be taken to reduce the potential health and safety risks associated with composting and may include: controlled blending-mixing of the raw material to provide a uniform fabric with a high porosity during the composting process; controlled turning of the windrows, including restrictions on the extent of turning operations consistent with the need to maintain adequate aerobic composting conditions; the addition of moisture to the compostable material; controlling the airflow by carrying out all or part of the process in a sealed building, or in-vessel, with appropriate air-handling systems; and treating all gases and odours produced during the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, considers bioaerosol emissions to be one of the potential negative impacts of large scale composting facilities. In certain cases, the agency therefore requests that a bioaerosol monitoring plan be submitted by the applicant prior to the commencement of the activity. In addition, under the environmental research, technological development and innovation, ERTDI, programme, the EPA has commissioned Cré &ndash; the Composting Association of Ireland &ndash; to carry out a study on bioaerosols and composting &ndash; a literature evaluation. A principal aim of the study <Col N="591" />is to provide a reference document for the guidance of both regulatory authorities and the composting industry in Ireland regarding bioaerosol emission management in significant composting facilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 208 together.</P>
      <P>Subject to certain conditions, any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her basic needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant may be entitled to assistance under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The objective of the scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term solution in any individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crèche supplement was introduced with the intention of providing assistance to the parent of a child who is in need of a short-term emergency support. This can arise, for example, to assist a parent who would not otherwise be able <Col N="593" />to avail of particular supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>It is clear that payment of crèche supplements is increasingly being made for reasons which are outside the scope of the original scheme. An analysis of crèche supplements shows that some 35% of supplements have been in payment for over eight months, 20% of supplements for over one year and approximately 10% for more than two years. The fact that the supplements are in payment for long durations in many cases indicates that they have become a long-term child care support rather than the short-term social support for which they were intended. At present many of the groups involved in providing early education initiatives receive the bulk of their funding from the health boards. While the total amount spent on crèche supplements is significant the actual amounts contributed in individual cases is relatively small and administratively inefficient. My Department has discussed this matter with the health boards concerned to ensure that appropriate alternative measures are put in place to address the needs of families with children in this regard. The Northern Area Health Board has confirmed that the nurseries in question will not be closed as a result of these measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to extending social insurance pension cover to as many categories as possible. In this regard a number of measures have been introduced in recent years which are making it easier for people to qualify for pensions. These measures are of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the average number of contributions required for pension purposes was reduced to ten and in 2000 a special half rate pension was introduced based on pre-1953 insurance contributions. <i>Pro rata</i>pensions were also introduced to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment.</P>
      <P>The Government is also committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults who are aged 66 or over to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. This process commenced in budget 2000 and a number of special increases have been granted since then. The rate of the qualified adult allowance on the contributory pension now stands at &euro;121.50 per week which is about 84% of the maximum rate of the non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New applicants for pensions can now apply to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly <Col N="594" />to their spouse or partner. This facility has been available since October 2002.</P>
    <P>Measures are also in place since 1994 to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties. This scheme, known as the homemaker's scheme, allows for up to 20 years to be disregarded when a person's insurance record is being averaged for pensions purposes.</P>
    <P>The scheme is being reviewed as part of the second phase review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. The review will be completed shortly and further development of the homemaker's scheme will be examined in the light of the conclusions of the review.</P>

      <P>The Department's press office is committed to ensuring all press statements are posted to the Department's website on the same day as they are issued to the media.</P>
      <P>On 26 November 2003 when the press statement in question was issued, it became impossible to post to the Internet that evening due to volume of work and some technical difficulties. The statement was available on the website the next morning when those issues were resolved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that such occasions are rare and the Department will try to ensure that such difficulties do not recur. I am satisfied that the website gives adequate access to press information to all interested parties.</P>

      <Quest>if she has changed the rules in 2003 in respect of the payment of the Christmas bonus; and if the Christmas bonus applies to the payment of the fuel allowance.</Quest>

      <P>I have not changed the rules for receipt of the Christmas bonus. A special Christmas bonus payment was first introduced in December 1980 for social welfare pensioners and people who depend solely on their social welfare payments for income support in recognition of the additional financial burden associated with that time of year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past three years the Christmas bonus amount was set at 100% of the recipient's normal weekly payment. In 2000 and 2001, the minimum amount payable was £20, equivalent to &euro;25.40. <Col N="595" />The 2002 bonus was also set at 100% or a double week's payment, and the minimum amount payable was increased to &euro;30. The 2003 Christmas bonus will again be paid at 100%, subject to the minimum &euro;30 payment.</P>
    <P>In addition to recipients of long-term social welfare payments, the Christmas bonus is also paid to certain recipients of the employment and income supports applicable to persons participating in FÁS, VTOS, job initiative and community employment schemes, and to recipients of certain health board payments such as domiciliary care allowance, blind welfare allowance and mobility allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" />The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. The fuel allowance is an additional payment of &euro;9 per week payable to eligible households, with an additional &euro;3.90 payable in smokeless zones. These allowances have been extended in duration from 26 weeks when introduced, and are now paid over the course of a 29 week fuel season, thus providing income support over the winter period. The Christmas bonus is not applicable to fuel allowance payments but virtually all recipients of fuel allowance benefit from the Christmas bonus payment.</P>
