      <P>The changes introduced to the Freedom of Information Act by the Government gave rise to a great deal of controversy. Is it not a fact that the Government promoted a culture of secrecy in implementing those changes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that there has been a serious drop in the number of requests under the Freedom of Information Act? The changes, restrictions and charges introduced have led to a drop in requests of up to 53%. Does the Taoiseach accept that official information is the oxygen of democracy which has been strangled by the changes and charges introduced by his Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If one looks at the chart for my Department for June to October 2002 and June to October 2003, there were 34 requests in 2002 and 30 in 2003. I am not sure of the figures across all Departments. I do not think that &euro;15 is a major deterrent to using the Act if one remembers the charge is only for using the legislation in respect of non-personal issues. In personal issues or appeals in personal issues there is no charge at all. I am told by some people in my Department that there are some drops in the categories where there are no records held and where requests were transferred. They are the areas in which requests were often vexatious anyway, as we have seen over the years. I do not think there will be any great change in the operation of the Act in terms of serious information.</P>

      <P>As we dealing with freedom of information, it is ironic that we face limitations in the way in which we may ask the questions. I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's ruling however. Does the Taoiseach agree that his description of what amounts to a vexatious inquiry is very subjective? Does he agree that in terms of the number of requests to his Department, it is not insignificant to charge &euro;150 for an appeal on top of the initial &euro;15 and &euro;75 for an internal appeal? The money required to obtain information and to pursue an inquiry mounts up significantly. Does the Taoiseach agree that this relates considerably to the fall off in inquiries which we are hearing about in the reply he has referred to and which we look forward to seeing when we receive the table in hard copy? Given that the matters we are discussing relate to the Information Commissioner, is the Office of the Information Commissioner sufficiently resourced to deal with them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Finance. I will allow the Deputy's first question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have a view on whether the office is well enough resourced and possessed of sufficient powers to deal with the Freedom of Information Act? I would like the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Several times over the last few years we have given both powers and resources to the office in question. I do not accept that &euro;15 is a major deterrent to using the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is &euro;150.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An enormous amount of staff time is spent in replying to freedom of information requests and huge expense is incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that five Government Departments have seen a drop of approximately 85% in the number of freedom of information requests since the changes were introduced. They are the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be more appropriate to submit a question to the Ministers in the line Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am outlining the statistics which are relevant to the question. Four Departments &ndash; Defence, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Foreign Affairs and Health and Children &ndash; have seen a drop of between 70% and 75% since the changes were introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Department of Agriculture and Food the decrease is 61%; the Department of Defence, 17%; and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, minus 47%. There are lies, damn lies and statistics, but these statistics do not tell lies because they show a clear drop in the requests for information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you want to get on to the questions on Northern Ireland, a Cheann Comhairle, but I have one other question for the Taoiseach as he referred to it. He said, rightly, that these requests take up a good deal of time. Is it not a fact that there are staff in these Departments appointed to deal with freedom of information requests but that no requests have come into Departments for weeks on end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>You should submit the question to the Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a relevant question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions are relevant to the Taoiseach's Department only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Cavan-Monaghan air has affected you, a Cheann Comhairle, but you are very restrictive on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being restrictive on it. Each of the three questions refers specifically to requests processed in the Taoiseach's Department. The Chair has no choice but to stay within the limits of the questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me comply with your ruling. Will the Taoiseach indicate the number of staff in his Department appointed to deal with freedom of information requests? Are those staff fully employed in view of the strangulation of the Freedom of Information Act, the restrictions imposed and the charges brought in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, the number of requests coming into the Department is not much different. As I have stated many times during Question Time, designated officers are appointed under the Freedom of Information Act. It is existing staff who undertake this work and if they are burdened with this work, they cannot do other work. That is the only change it will mean, but my Department has not changed much in terms of the figures. When one looks at the figures, other than questions which are transferred or are not relevant because there is no information, there has not been much of a change in my Department. It appears that in areas where we have no records or where the questions were transferred because people were sending in <Col N="1457" /> requests which were not relevant, that number is down. I understand the reason for that when some money has to be paid for it. As far as questions relevant to my Department are concerned, there has been no change.</P>
      <P>In regard to the sections about which we spent a good deal of time talking, where records are exempt because of Government meetings and other mandatory exemptions, there has been none in my Department in the period in question. As I said then, that would be a fairly rare occurrence and it has proved to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be prepared to request all Departments, including his own, to carry out some analysis at the end of the year of the profile of requesters or requests made in terms of explaining the kind of requesters that have fallen off as a result of the imposition of the fees to which Deputy Kenny refers? Has there been discussions with the Information Commissioner who went public &ndash; rightly so according to Deputy Sargent &ndash; on her opposition to the &euro;150 charge for an appeal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to get an answer to the question I put. I asked if the Taoiseach had a view on whether &euro;150 for an appeal was a significant and onerous amount. He thought &euro;15 was not much. What is his view on &euro;150 for an appeal in light of his dismissal of &euro;15? Did his Department have any role in lobbying the Department of Finance for restrictions in the freedom of information legislation? From whence did this seed of secrecy spring?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, as you know, it followed a review that took place but we have been through all of that. In fact, I do not think there is any secrecy in all of this. Practically everything that is looked for from Departments comes out.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 53, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Over the course of the summer, and particularly over recent weeks, both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties have been working closely together to make the necessary progress that will enable us to achieve the restoration of devolved Government in Northern Ireland on a sustained basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I met Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin on 4 September. I met a delegation from the SDLP led by Mark Durkan on 9 September and I met Prime Minister Blair at Chequers on 13 September and again last Saturday in Rome. I also met David Trimble on 15 September and I met the Women's Coalition last Friday. I expect to have further meetings over the coming period as we seek to secure the progress we need. We want to make the kind of progress that will help assure a stable working Executive following elections.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear what is now needed. We need elections. We need to have an end to all paramilitary activity backed up by decommissioning. We need the Unionists to commit to sustaining stable and inclusive institutions. We need the two Governments to deliver on their commitments to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including those outlined in the Joint Declaration.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Blair and I are determined to work jointly with the parties to get back to a position where we have the Executive and Assembly working effectively. As Governments, we are doing our best to encourage progress but a great deal lies in the hands of the political parties themselves. They each in their own way, and together, have a responsibility to move the process forward. In this context, I welcome the recent engagement between Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party. I hope these contacts can help build a foundation of confidence and trust, and address the issues that are essential for progress.</P>
      <P>The good summer has had a settling effect on the situation generally. I commend all those who have worked to bring this about. This achievement must be sustained and consolidated throughout the whole year and through next summer and beyond.</P>
      <P>Since last May, we have been proceeding with the implementation of the Joint Declaration in so far as we can. We have also recently announced the details of the Independent Monitoring Commission which both Governments believe can play an important role in building confidence on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At our meeting last Saturday, Prime Minister Blair and I took the opportunity to discuss the current situation. We are very conscious of the <Col N="1464" /> time constraints for elections. We want to see progress made in the next week or so.</P>
    <P>I travelled to Albany, New York on Monday, 22 September where I met Senator Hillary Clinton at the College of St. Rose. We discussed business and educational links between Ireland and upstate New York. I thanked Senator Clinton for her continuing close interest in Ireland and I updated her on developments in the peace process. Afterwards, I met Governor Pataki and attended a reception for the Irish community in Albany hosted by the Governor. I also thanked the Governor for his close interest in Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, I attended a number of economic events and met business and economic leaders. I also met Ambassador Richard Haass and we discussed recent developments in the peace process. I thanked the Ambassador for the US Administration's continuing support for the process and our efforts to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland. I will meet Ambassador Haass in Dublin next week when we will discuss the matter again.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, I travelled to the Thomas J. Dodd Research Centre at the University of Connecticut. There, with the British Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, representing Prime Minister Blair, I was honoured to receive the first Thomas J. Dodd Prize in international justice and human rights. Thomas J. Dodd, a distinguished lawyer and Senator whose career was devoted to the promotion of human rights, was the father of Senator Chris Dodd who has worked closely with successive US Administrations in promoting peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday evening, I met the President of Mexico, Vincente Fox. I reported last week on that meeting. On Thursday, I addressed the United Nations General Assembly and I also reported last week on the matters I covered in my address there.</P>
    <P>I later visited Fairfield University in Connecticut where I received an honorary degree and gave the William and Mary Stack lecture in Irish history and culture, &ldquo;Ireland Today &ndash; Building on Peace&rdquo;. In the course of my address, I spoke about the key role played by US companies in Ireland's recent economic transformation and the enormous contribution of the US to the peace process. In all my public statements in the US, I stressed the crucial importance of making progress in the peace process.</P>
    <P>I met Geraldine Finucane and the Finucane family on 2 September and I restated the Government's position that an independent public inquiry is the only way to uncover the truth about all the circumstances surrounding the murder of Pat Finucane.</P>
    <P>I will receive this evening Judge Peter Cory's two reports into the murders of Lord Justice and Lady Gibson and of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan. I am referring these reports to the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, <Col N="1465" /> and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, for their consideration, with a view to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform bringing the matter before Government as soon as possible. Judge Cory has also today presented his reports to the British Government in the cases of Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill, Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to commend Judge Cory and his team, who have shown enormous dedication and commitment in the course of their work. I am very grateful to Judge Cory for his deep personal commitment to the task both Governments set him. Both Governments are committed to publishing the reports without undue delay.</P>
    <P>I met the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board last March. My schedule of engagements in New York recently was such that, while I met with some individual members of the board, I was not in a position to meet with the board itself during my visit. Contact with the board is maintained primarily through our embassy in Washington which provides reports, as necessary, to my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the support of the Fine Gael Party for the efforts of both Governments to bring about closure to the problems in the Northern Ireland peace process. I support the Taoiseach in his personal efforts to make progress in this regard. I share his view that, on the one hand, there needs to be an end to paramilitarism and the implementation of decommissioning from the Unionist perspective. On the other, there needs to be adherence to stable and inclusive institutions.</P>
      <P>We are now in October and, obviously, if elections are to be held, it must be soon. Is the Taoiseach happy that, on the one hand, Unionist politicians are anxious and fully committed to seeing the completion of the Good Friday Agreement? Will they adhere to stable and inclusive institutions? Is there any evidence available to the Government that the IRA intends to cease all activities and to end the war, as it were, irrespective of what phraseology they put on it? Is there evidence available to the Taoiseach and the Government that this is happening? If we are to have elections, they must be based on that premise, out of which can come stable, inclusive and long-lasting institutions for the governance of Northern Ireland. Is the Taoiseach happy on both these scores? I state my support once again for the efforts being made to bring about completion in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny asked if we are now in a position to move towards positive and stable elections that will restore the Assembly and Executive and fulfil the various aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, the North-South bodies and all the other matters in the near future. I wish to answer the question in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible. Next week will <Col N="1466" /> mark the first anniversary of the failure of the Northern institutions due to the lack of the necessary trust and confidence to keep them going. We spent several months working on a plan to try to revive them. In response, the Governments completed the joint declaration at the beginning of March. In it, we set out the commitments of both Governments. We accept that role. I reiterate that we are prepared to fulfil the commitments contained in the joint declaration. We failed in that effort when the talks broke down at the beginning of May without bringing about the desired effect. The British Government postponed the elections, a move which we opposed and continue to oppose. All parties in this House stated at the time that the elections should take place anyway.</P>
      <P>At my last meeting with Mr. Trimble, he confirmed that if he gets the necessary clarification and commitments, he is prepared to fight the election from a positive pro-Agreement stance and, if successful, to implement the Good Friday Agreement in terms of the Executive working in a cross-party and cross-community mode. We welcome the ongoing talks between the parties &ndash; the UUP and Sinn Féin. We wish the talks well. It is not necessary for the two Governments to be involved in all talks. We are anxious to see whatever dialogue is possible taking place and we support it. There is no opposing view, either between the Governments or the parties. We have not, as yet, reached a position where we have the basis of an agreement which would allow us to positively move towards elections, or even for people on both sides to be positive in their manifestos and manner of canvassing going into those elections.</P>
      <P>That is the dilemma, but we hope we will get to that position. As I outlined in my reply, we have been trying to do so, on the dates I outlined, since the beginning of September. We have been seeking to make that progress, particularly over the past month, but we have not yet achieved it. It might not matter a great deal if time drifted on for another few weeks but for the fact that a timespan is required to have an election. It is now 7 October and there is some debate about whether the six week rule could be slightly shortened. As of now, we are negotiating on the basis that six weeks' notice will be required. It would be difficult to get everything set up and moving by the end of November, given that it is now mid-October. I stated categorically, not only in America but last week that, effectively, we have about a week. As of now, I cannot tell the House the basis of how such an end could be constructively engineered, but that is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Taoiseach said is very sig nificant if the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. David Trimble, has confirmed that he is prepared to fight elections from a positive perspective in the context of the completion of the Good Friday Agreement. We have not yet arrived at a point where sufficient trust and confidence is coming <Col N="1467" /> from the republican side to do the same. Given the timescale, is it not incumbent upon Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness to send out a very clear signal to their supporters and to what are termed &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; that the Sinn Féin political party is fully committed and to request that all others support it in that context for elections that are soundly based and will lead to lasting institutions and good governance for Northern Ireland? </P>
      <P>Given the shortage of time, is the Taoiseach aware of any further meetings planned to take place in the next week to ten days with Sinn Féin whereby such a statement could issue and such confirmation could be given? There is clearly an onus on Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness to deal with this matter which everybody else wishes to see completed in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Meetings are ongoing between Sinn Féin and the UUP and, as I stated, I wish them well. Obviously it would be regarded as very positive progress if a formula could be agreed within those meetings. There have been a number of meetings. I receive general reports of those meetings but I cannot say I am fully briefed on all of them. Like every series of discussions, it will have to come to an end and it will have to end in a positive light.</P>
      <P>My stated position is that one way or the other I want elections to be held and I will not move from that position. The difficulty is that if this is not approved in the next period of time there is a possibility that there could be a situation that would lead nowhere and everybody would be fighting the elections from a negative position. It is my view and that of the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and all the other people on the pro-Agreement side that if that happens, the chances of finding a workable Executive and electing a First Minister and Deputy First Minister and carrying out a programme for Government in a positive frame of mind would be a total mess. I do not think any party or any party spokesperson wants to be in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been endeavouring all year to ensure that elections are held in this calendar year. That is our stated position and I believe I speak for everybody when I say that is what we want to achieve. Second, there should be elections so that the pro-Agreement parties in a positive frame of mind will ensure that an Executive is elected and the institutions properly set up. This will require something of the order of what we were stating earlier this year about acts of completion. We have been talking about this for 12 months. The acts of completion should be clear commitments that paramilitarism is finished, in whatever form that is stated. I have stated many times that I am not interested in the wordsmith use of language on this matter. I think people will know what it means if it is stated in a way that is clear and meaningful and if people mean what they say. I <Col N="1468" /> am sure if they say it they will mean it. On the other side, I believe Mr. David Trimble will publicly state his position and that will supply the trust and confidence to move forward. That is the key issue but the reality is that if it is not achieved within a short period of time, we will have a major difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that enough is being done on the matter of political and physical intimidation of persons connected with the district policing partnerships? Will he indicate his response to the comments of the vice-chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, Denis Bradley, who seemed to be critical of the Irish Government's stance in that regard? What is his reaction to the motion passed last Friday by the Ulster Unionist Party executive seeking radical changes to the Hillsborough Declaration? Are the two Governments minded to cede changes to the Hillsborough Declaration? Is it the Taoiseach's intention to lay before the House the report from Judge Cory, subject to protecting sources of information? Was the Nally report received by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform prior to the end of August in respect of allegations that information may have been withheld from the security forces in Northern Ireland which, it is claimed, might have helped to prevent the Omagh atrocity? Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform still intend to come into the House, as he pledged at the end of August, to make a comprehensive statement and to take questions on the Nally report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will make a report to the House on the Nally report, which has been completed. I know the Minister is anxious to deal with that. He cannot publish that report because there are many sensitive security issues. However, he is happy to give as comprehensive a report as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards Judge Cory, we will have the report today on the cases I mentioned, namely, Lord and Lady Gibson and the two members of the security forces, Buchanan and Breen. As I stated many times, we will examine that in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Office of the Attorney General is looking at aspects of it. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring forward a report on that. I cannot promise full publication until I see the precise security aspects of the report. However, we will put through the data.</P>
      <P>We have not yet finalised the arrangements with the British Government as regards when we will get access to its reports and when it will get access to our reports. However, we will exchange information once they are examined by the Departments. The British Government has an interest in our reports and we have an interest in the cases it has put forward because we have already stated positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> As regards the district policing partnerships, I condemn the threats against the members of the district policing partnerships. Deputy Rabbitte made a serious point in that regard. I know it is a difficult decision for many members to join the boards, but they do so out of a profound sense of public duty. The partnerships are a vital part of the new beginning in policing. The people serving on them deserve our full support. There is always a danger that those opposed to this process will act against these people who are working to implement the new policing arrangements. I have met a number of the members of the policing boards. Last weekend I met different groups of people, many of whom are not in the public domain, who told me about the harassment and the intimidation they have faced. They do not want to be in the public domain because that would put more pressure on them.</P>
    <P>It is important that those who support the process, particularly in the Nationalist and republican communities, support and protect those who are working for an effective and accountable new police service. I welcome the fact that the Sinn Féin leadership has categorically denied any involvement by mainstream republicans and that it has condemned the intimidation and harassment. I urge Sinn Féin to take the next step &ndash; to endorse the policing boards and district partnerships and take their places on the boards. This would help greatly and enable progress to be made. I have read some of the criticisms but we have at all times endeavoured to help the boards and individuals involved in every way. I understand that they are under some pressure in these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>What about the Hillsborough talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, David Trimble described the UUP's position on the Joint Declaration as &ldquo;nuanced&rdquo;. We must wait and see what that means as we move ahead in the coming days. However, I discussed this matter with him before last week's statement. I do not want to misinterpret his position, although I am sure we will have a chance to discuss the details, but there are not too many difficulties with what he is saying. I can understand the different arguments and issues, but I know Mr. Trimble subscribes to most of what is in the Joint Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, Sinn Féin, the UUP and other parties all have some difficulties with the Joint Declaration, but they want the Governments to implement the parts they agree with while stating their positions on the parts with which they have difficulties. Like everyone, they want to have their cake and eat it. However, we are determined to implement the Joint Declaration as stated and are trying to work with the various parties in doing that. Many parties have difficulties, but the document is an overwhelmingly positive one which addresses all the outstanding issues &ndash; policing, demilitarisation, human rights, <Col N="1470" /> an end to paramilitarism &ndash; and we intend to proceed with its implementation. Naturally, when I meet the parties I discuss with them the bits they do not like, but they all need to understand that to engender trust and confidence we must implement the whole document, not just the parts with which one group or one side agrees. Officials of the two Governments went through the document again recently and we will continue to implement it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will note that he has not embraced all the commitments given by him and his Government in the Good Friday Agreement. Can the Taoiseach confirm to the House that he has strongly pressed the British Prime Minister on the unacceptable delay in calling the Assembly elections? The Government and the Dáil have called for elections to take place before the end of the autumn. Will these elections proceed before Christmas 2003?</P>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's view of recent reports that the British Government has undertaken to increase the role of its secret service, MI5, in their so-called security operation in Ireland, both in the Six Counties and in this State? Will he undertake to impress upon the British Prime Minister that this is totally unacceptable and runs absolutely contrary to the commitments made to a new policing arrangement north of the Border? Has the Taoiseach taken receipt of both the reports of Mr. Peter Cory &ndash; one for the British Government and one for the Irish Government? When will these reports be published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on receiving the Thomas J. Dodd award. Could the Taoiseach describe the Government's knowledge of the progress being made in the negotiations? What are the positions of Sinn Féin and the UUP? Can he tell us when the Dáil will be informed of any progress? In the interim, will he be open to taking soundings from party leaders and trying to move forward in as inclusive a spirit as possible? Is there any validity to the reports that following the presentation of the reports by Judge Cory, there will be judicial inquiries into the Patrick Finucane and Rosemary Nelson cases, as well as the cases of the murdered RUC officers in south Armagh, Bob Buchanan and Harry Breen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet received Judge Cory's reports but I will receive them later today. The reports I receive will be those dealing with the deaths of Lord and Lady Gibson, and Breen and Buchanan. The British Government will receive reports dealing with the other cases. As I outlined earlier, we will then put them through the process with our Departments and the Attorney General and, ultimately, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will report on them. We will publish them in so far as we can do so, depending on what security details the <Col N="1471" /> reports contain. We will have to work out a mechanism with the British Government on how to exchange our information on the cases. We have a deep interest in the cases that Judge Cory has dealt with for the British Government and, of course, the British Government will want to know about the cases that affected us in one way or another.</P>
      <P>As regards the elections, I have clearly stated the position, which is that we do not want the situation to drift. It is five years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the parties need to renew their democratic mandates. In our view the political process will be reinvigorated if it is a positive political campaign, particularly if it takes place in a positive atmosphere where pro-Agreement parties can present their manifestos for stable, inclusive, partnership Government. That is why we are trying to get everybody to do their bit. It is a year since the institutions were suspended and we have been trying since then to achieve a position. We need to establish the fact that paramilitarism has ended for good and that all parties will rely solely on their democratic mandates. We will not make progress if we do not achieve that. That is the reality and it is no good anyone saying otherwise.</P>
      <P>Time is short but the parties have been actively engaging with each other and with both Governments, which I welcome. I hope that some progress is being made but it is not visible yet. The final steps have yet to be taken that would convince everybody that they are for real, that peace is here to stay, without doubt or equivocation, that everyone accepts that the institutions have to be inclusive and that we have to work in a sustained way in order for the Agreement to work properly, as was intended.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 115 and 117 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No more than 18 minutes have been allocated for these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish aquaculture industry provides full-time and part-time employment for some 1,770 people and had a production in 2002 of over 62,000 tonnes, valued at &euro;117 million. Finfish production accounted for 24,000 tonnes, with a value of &euro;82 million, while shellfish production was 38,000 tonnes, valued at &euro;35 million.</P>
      <P>The industry plays a vital role in the economic life of many peripheral coastal communities and is recognised as having potential for further growth and development, focused, in particular, on the delivery of premium, high-quality products that meet market requirements. The experience in Ireland in this regard is likely to reflect trends in the industry worldwide. Aquaculture has grown significantly over recent decades, with annual growth in the order of 10% globally since 1990, and is expected to maintain its position as the fastest growing area of food production. The industry is also characterised by ongoing diversification and innovation including the cultivation of new species.</P>
      <P>The potential for growth can only be realised and the future of existing operations secured, if the industry operates on a sustainable basis and in accordance with high standards of environmental ecological protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of critical importance, therefore, that all operators comply in full with the terms and conditions of their aquaculture licences, and co-oper<Col N="1473" /> ate fully with the authorities charged with the monitoring and control of their operations. Failure to do so could, apart from the serious legal issues involved, damage the reputation and competitive position of the industry generally. I am, therefore, very concerned by reports of instances of alleged failure to comply with the appropriate standards and requirements.</P>
    <P>A specific instance of the alleged inappropriate disposal of fish mortalities has been investigated by my Department and the advice of the legal services has been sought on further action to be taken. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the particular case.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fish mortalities in Inver Bay in 2002 referred to by Deputy Ryan, the position is that this incident was investigated fully by my Department. Arrangements for dealing with the situation were put in place in line with advice received from independent consultants and the Marine Institute, and the situation has been monitored on an ongoing basis in the meantime. A comprehensive investigation of the fish mortalities which occurred in Donegal Bay in July of this year has been initiated. The scope of this exercise has been extended to take account of the significant mortalities experienced over recent months at other farms along the west coast. As the investigation is continuing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on these matters at present. However, I would bring to the House's attention the fact that the Marine Institute, in a statement last week, said that the studies carried out indicate that the dredge spoil from Killybegs Harbour did not cause the fish mortalities at Inver Bay or McSwine's Bay.</P>
    <P>As regards regulatory arrangements generally, I have instructed my Department to initiate a comprehensive review of the existing procedures for monitoring and control of aquaculture and marine finfish farming in particular. The objective of this review, which will be undertaken by a unit established for the purpose, will be to ensure that appropriate systems and processes are in place for the regulation of all aspects of the industry. Any new arrangements that may emerge from this review will build on existing systems for control and enforcement. These include 14 visits by the Marine Institute in connection with sea control, as well as annual fish health inspections and the residues monitoring programme. Farm inspections are also carried out by officials of the Department, which to date this year covered 35 marine finfish sites.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department is also examining structures for the delivery of regulatory services to the aquaculture industry and will bring forward proposals in this respect in the near future. The Department is also working with industry representatives and other public bodies in a group established to address matters relating to the disposal of waste from fish farms. An underlying objective is to ensure that arrangements put in place by fish farms are fully in conformity with <Col N="1474" /> the legal procedures governing the disposal of such waste.</P>
    <P>The House may be assured that failure on the part of fish farmers to comply with the specified standards and requirements for their operations will not be tolerated and will be pursued vigorously. There must also be a clear recognition by fish farmers that their best interests and those of the industry generally are most effectively served by rigorous compliance with the prescribed standards and obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen this morning a video of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme broadcast a couple of weeks ago. The revelations arising from it are absolutely frightening. There are three or four aspects about which I would be seriously worried. Will there be a full investigation following that programme? Was the Minister of State aware of the full extent of the problems before the programme was made? Does he think that the reputation of the aquaculture sector has been tarnished following this programme? What has the Marine Institute done since the programme, or before it? I realise the Minister of State has referred to this, but perhaps he could go into it in more detail.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also mentioned the dredging of Killybegs Harbour. Could he say if this had anything to do with the fish kill? Another issue which has come to light is the lice problem that was seen in the television programme. What action does the Minister propose to take to ensure that all salmon farmers control the lice levels on their farms in the critical period between January and May each year to ensure that the sea trout in adjacent rivers are not decimated by sea lice?</P>
      <P>I would hope that his Department would take this &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme seriously because, leaving fish kills aside, the economy in the local area is totally dependent on aquaculture &ndash; fish, trout salmon, etc. That would have been a major part of the economy and it has gone totally downhill in recent years, with the widespread closure of bed and breakfast accommodation. The programme did not make good viewing. It is important to know whether the Minister was aware of what had happened and if the Marine Institute has taken up the matter. Has the Minister of State seen the programme? It is very important that action is taken on this as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us would be concerned about the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, but we are also very much aware of the importance of aquaculture, particularly on the west coast. We have been initiating very strict regulations over the years. It is a very new industry, but very important, employing as it does about 2,000 people. We were aware of the Inver Bay mortalities at that time. We had asked the Marine Institute immediately to carry out a comprehensive investigation with a view to determining the <Col N="1475" /> cause of the mortalities. It has done extensive work across a range of disciplines over recent months. However, it has not to date been possible to establish the reason for the fish deaths. The investigation is continuing and its scope has been broadened in light of information that has emerged in recent times about the high levels of mortality at other fish farms along the western seaboard over recent months. The Marine Institute has vets, chemists and marine scientists as well as experts from abroad involved in its investigations.</P>
      <P>On the issue of dredging, a number of allegations were made as to the cause of the mortalities. Practically all of them have been ruled out. As regards dredging, specifically, the Marine Institute indicated in a media statement last week that dredge spoil from Killybegs Harbour did not cause the mortalities at Inver Bay or McSwine's Bay in July or August. It is adamant that the dredging there was not a problem. The Marine Institute, however, is continuing its investigations. Naturally, both the Minister and I want to see the matter fully investigated and cleared up as quickly as possible. While some Deputies in this House &ndash; not Deputy Kehoe &ndash; may not regard aquaculture as important, we would certainly see its potential and further development in this country as very important, particularly in the coastal counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State please advise which Members of this House do not believe that aquaculture is an important industry? Is there any particular party or Member that he feels does not desire to see an aquaculture industry developed in a sustainable manner? I would be interested to hear that answer. He has just said there are some such Members. In the Green Party we certainly recognise the potential benefits in economic and employment terms from aquaculture. Sustainability is required, however, on a variety of different fronts.</P>
      <P>In listening to the different organs of the State in terms of developing aquaculture, one would think that the only sustainability they are interested in is economic. Environmental sustainability is an afterthought. Unfortunately, nature has a way of biting back and if one is not operating in a sustainable manner one may not be able to operate economically because what is being done is not feasible and may lead to some of the large fish kills that we have seen this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked numerous people in various Departments about what happened in Inver Bay in 2002 and have been told that 8,000, 15,000, 50,000 or 80,000 fish died. It is impossible to know who is right on this. However, we know that the owner has admitted that 40,000 fish were dumped at the bottom of a net. Would the Minister agree that the sanctioning by his Department and by the Marine Institute is remarkable given the clear guidelines set out by the FAO, the Food and <Col N="1476" /> Aquaculture Organisation, the UN body responsible, in its code for good fishery practice? Specifically CCRF article 9.4.6 states:</P>
    <P>Dead fish and other waste that may be hazardous either to the aquaculture establishment or the public should be disposed of in appropriately designed facilities, approved by the relevant supervisory agency.</P>
    <P>This dumping was not approved by the Department and it runs against the code of practice recommended by the international organisation setting out guidelines for responsible aquaculture policy. On that basis why did the Department think it was such a good idea that it sanctioned it after the fact, as it was not aware of it during the fact?</P>
    <P>In terms of the monitoring and investigation that needs to be carried out it is not satisfactory for the Minister of State to say that the Minister and he are looking into it, are keen to find out details and are asking the Department to clarify matters. The problem is that the accusation is made against that Department in that it was not monitoring the level of sea life properly, it acquiesced to dumping activities and it was not carrying out the monitoring activity it needed to carry out as thoroughly as other countries do. It is impossible for the Department to review its own operations in that regard. It needs an outside body to carry out an investigation into the Department, which publicly is seen not to be carrying out its functions properly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not believe that point there is a further problem in that the industry is pointing the finger at the Department in saying that the Department itself in its dumping of dredge material off the Donegal coast may have caused the problems at Inver Bay this summer. Even if he does not accept that the Department&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he think it is sufficient for the Department to recognise this itself? Will the Department carry out a long-term strategic review of the fish farming business in light of what has happened this summer? Does the Minister recognise there are serious questions about the level of sea lice on the wild sea trout and salmon populations? Does he recognise there is serious concern over the effects of global warming, combined with nitrogen and phosphorous releases from fish farms which could be leading to toxic algae blooms, which could be responsible for what we saw in Inver Bay this summer? There are serious concerns about the long-term sustainability of the fish farming industry as it is currently devised given the level of eutrophication and phosphorous emissions from these farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These farms use four pounds of wild fish to create one pound of farmed fish. Is that sustainable given the millennium goals concerning the catch of wild fish for farming? Will the <Col N="1477" /> Department review that? I would like to be able to stand here and support an aquaculture industry that promotes jobs to the west and north-west. However to do that needs a product that is economically viable &ndash; giving a high price &ndash; and environmentally viable. There is no evidence that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is taking such a view.</P>

      <P>As I said in my initial reply there were 14 visits by the Marine Institute to inspect for sea lice, which is more than one per month. To date officials from the Department have covered 35 marine finfish sites. It is obvious that the Department is monitoring on a regular basis. I have instructed my Department to initiate a comprehensive review of existing procedures for monitoring and control of aquaculture and marine finfish farming in particular. We are also examining structures for the delivery of a regulatory service to the aquaculture industry and we are working with the industry representatives and other public bodies in a group established to address matters relating to the disposal of waste from fish farms.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about dumping. I assure him that all the allegations made in the programme about dumping are being and will continue to be fully investigated by the Marine Institute. Some local authorities which are responsible for illegal dumping have taken a direct interest. The programme mentioned that the Norwegians are considerably ahead of us on sea lice. This is not the truth. Our programme has been running since 1992. The Norwegian officials came here in 1998 and had to copy our system. That country's system has only been in operation for two years. It is run by the salmon farmers themselves on a self-regulating basis.</P>

      <P>Every effort will be made, first by the Marine Institute, to find the reasons for the mortalities, which have subsequent serious financial losses for the fish farms involved, and we want to get to the bottom of the problem. If the institute cannot find a solution to the problem we will have to look at different ways to find a solution. We are very concerned about what was shown in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and want to find the reasons for the mortalities to ensure the aquaculture industry will not suffer in the future and will continue to develop and expand, which is what all sides of the House wish to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I was devastated by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report, which presented <i>prima facie</i> evidence of grave wrongdoing by two companies, one in Donegal and one in Connemara. The Minister spoke about arms-length actions. What steps has he taken to address the allegations in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme? For example, has he been in touch with Galway County Council and the EPA about John O'Carroll's farm given the serious allegations about that? Has the Minister contacted the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions about either of the major instances that were portrayed in that programme?</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Department undertakes a major monitoring role. Over the past five years has the Department fined or in any other way punished fish farms over sea lice or waste disposal? In other words what monitoring is carried out? We will discuss the topic of dumping later this evening when we debate the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill. For six years the Government promised the coastal zone management Bill and it is on the Clár again for 2004. We do not have a White Paper on aquaculture and there is no other promised legislation. When will we see the coastal zone management Bill?</P>
      <P>Following the serious allegations made in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, has the Minister given consideration to memberships of State boards by directors of companies, which are the subject of serious allegations?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned Norway. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme showed clearly that certain fjords on the Norwegian coastline were precluded from fish farming and that aquaculture is simply not allowed. There seems to be very close control and monitoring of the industry, which on the evidence presented this afternoon does not exist in Ireland.</P>

      <P>My officials and I have on numerous occasions this year expressed disquiet about the An Post financials but were assured by the company that the situation, while difficult, was under control. As a response to the serious financial situation outlined to me last month, I expressed my concerns to the board and asked for confirmation that the losses forecast represent an accurate representation of the An Post group as it currently stands, and an assurance that the cash position of the company is sound for the remainder of the year. I also requested a report outlining how the current financial situation arose, a recovery plan, and monthly meetings with An Post's management team and departmental officials to review progress. Finally, I asked for a review of the financial operations of the company.</P>
      <P>Early last week An Post submitted a response to my letter including an outline recovery strategy. In regard to the issues raised in my correspondence, the company has confirmed that the financial position as outlined is an accurate account of the An Post group financials as they currently stand; that the cash position for the company is sound for the rest of this year and that An Post's management will meet monthly with departmental officials. A review of the financial operations has been concluded and key steps are being implemented to improve the quality of financial reporting to the board, and a report on how the current financial problem arose has been provided.</P>
      <P>My Department is examining the recovery strategy but the detail of this has to be discussed with unions before it can be finalised. An Post has a statutory obligation to provide a nationwide postal service and to operate a post office network. Therefore, I expect that the recovery strategy would have no significant adverse affect on An Post's customers. As I have already mentioned, the plan is subject to negotiation with unions. An Post signalled staffing reductions amounting to approximately 1,140 early last year but provisional numbers from the outline recovery strategy envisage an advance on this figure.</P>
      <P>While the board, management and staff of the company have my full support and assistance, and that of my Department, in dealing with the difficult challenges ahead, the responsibility for designing and implementing the recovery plan ultimately rests with the company.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister happy with the performance of the board of An Post? When he appeared recently in public after this astonishing announcement of the major losses for 2002 he seemed to be extremely unhappy with the directors' work performance. Is he seeking to make any changes in regard to the chairperson and directors? He seems to be calling into question the way in which the board carried out its oversight role and suggested that he and his Department had been grievously misled.</P>
      <P>There has been grave criticism about the payment of large performance-related bonuses to the outgoing chief executive officer over recent years, given that the company was losing money and that it was not dealing with major problems. Does the Minister have any view on performance-related bonuses? I sympathise greatly with the 1,100 to 1,500, employees whose jobs are now in jeopardy. The number varies depending on which report one reads. Is the Minister happy with what seems to be a grave deterioration of the service apparently connected with restructuring and the introduction of new technologies which are not successful despite the effort of the workforce to use them? </P>
      <P>A large part of An Post's financial problems seems to stem from the REIMS II agreement with state and non-state companies outside our borders. There is another question today about volumes of post going through the Royal Mail and other companies in the UK. Will the Minister be asking the board of An Post and the new chief executive to renegotiate the REIMS II agreement and perhaps to give An Post a better chance to make progress? Some administrative areas of An Post, such as subsidiaries and so on, fall within the remit of the chief executive and the board but how does the Minister see restructuring in the context of some of the directives? Will he issue any directives to ComReg on the future, given the universal service obligation of An Post in regard to the future development of the company?</P>

      <P>Boards can operate only on the information that is relayed to them. The company was in a state of denial regarding the position of its financials as far as back as November 2002. My Department indicated its concern on what it saw, based on the figures which it had received, indicating that there were difficulties in this area. In December last we were told that there was no need for a survival plan and in May of this year we were again told that the existing plans were working and there was no need for a recovery <Col N="1482" /> strategy. It was only after I refused to bring the annual accounts to Cabinet that the company confirmed that things were getting worse fairly quickly. Over recent years certain commitments on cost reduction have been made but not fulfilled yet employers have fulfilled their various commitments under An Agreed Programme for Government, and the various partnership agreements have been fulfilled. The company has seisin of the strategy and it is up to the company and its management, in association with the board, to ensure that the relevant cost reductions are made.</P>
      <P>When the economy was doing reasonably well in recent years this probably to an extent masked the difficulties in An Post. Now as we are going into a situation of more difficult economic circumstances tough decisions will have to be taken and I like to think that would be done in consultation with the management and the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to work to increase annual forest planting to 20,000 hectares. Under the terms of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to the development of the forestry sector in a manner that maximises its contribution to national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis. The partnership agreement repeats the commitment to promote and support increased planting levels up to 20,000 hectares per annum. However, the agreement acknowledges that this commitment is subject to the available budgetary resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government continues to face a very difficult situation in the area of public finances and will have to make very difficult choices as between programmes across the range of public spending. In the latter context, the House should be aware of the high historical and future cost of forestry if existing policies are to be maintained. For example, &euro;613 million or <Col N="1483" /> an average of about &euro;88 million per annum has been spent on forestry since 1997 and, if existing policies were to continue, annual average costs, assuming respectively 10,000 and 20,000 hectares per annum, would be &euro;100 million and &euro;130 million per annum over the next three years. By 2020 the annual costs of meeting the Sustaining Progress targets of 20,000 hectares per annum could be over &euro;210 million.</P>
    <P>I wish to reassure the Deputy that this Government is strongly committed to the development of the forestry sector. This commitment is underlined by the provisions of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, to which the Deputy referred and clearly demonstrates that this Government recognises the important role which forestry plays and will continue to play in the development of rural and local economies. As part of those commitments, I have directed that a fundamental review be undertaken of the strategic policy for forestry, Growing for the Future, which was published in 1996. This review will reflect the significant changes in the sector as a whole since 1996 and will involve wide stakeholder consultation. It will also address the potentially huge future cost of forestry, especially premia, which the existing policy involves, as well as the financial consequences of interaction with other agricultural land use support policies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the applications in question, all applications received for afforestation grant aid are being processed in line with normal procedures. However, it would be entirely inappropriate for my Department to issue approvals, thereby encouraging land use decisions by farmers and others, in the absence of certainty in relation to whether they will receive the appropriate funding in 2004. In the latter context, I assure the Deputy that the Government will make fully informed decisions on all allocations of public moneys, including those in relation to forestry, in the context of the Estimates process. It is not appropriate at this point to speculate, in advance of Government consideration, on matters relating to funding or on the corresponding levels of planting that will be possible in 2004.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">

      <P>The Minister of State is well aware of the importance of forestry, especially in the south-eastern area where we both live. In 1996, the then Minister for Agriculture and Forestry, Ivan Yates, published Growing for the Future, setting an afforestation target of 20,000 hectares per year. This was reiterated by the Minister of State's Government colleagues in their programme for Government, with a commitment of &euro;687 million to fund the planting programme and necessary supporting measures. This Government has not lived up to its commitments. If approval of applications is not issued as soon as possible, it will be absolutely devastating to the whole forestry industry. As is well known, there has been a major development of forestry nurseries over a <Col N="1484" /> number of years, with millions of trees now ready for planting.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Government brought forward part of this year's budget allocation to last year. The IFA commissioned a report on the forestry sector.</P>

I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to fly the flag for forestry. We will not make decisions until we get the allocation for 2004 and I assure the Deputy that we will make strong demands on the Department of Finance, in line with other allocations, to ensure the maximum allocation for forestry in 2004.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> the reason the funding committed for the erection of a new pier at Bantry has not been provided; and if he will make a full statement in relation thereto.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary reason I have not made a decision regarding the provision of Exchequer funding for this project is that I am awaiting advice from the Attorney General on various legal issues pertaining to the pier development. As the Deputy will be aware, my predecessor pledged Exchequer support of up to &euro;1.65 million towards a new pier development at the port as outlined in the Proposed Development Plan 1997 of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. My predecessor intimated at that meeting that he would be prepared to provide up to &euro;1.9 million if necessary, but in the event that the project exceeded &euro;1.9 million the harbour commissioners would have to provide the additional funds from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The commitment from my predecessor was to be paid from the Department's Vote and was not a commitment for funding under the national development plan. The harbour commissioners subsequently updated their estimate of the cost for the development to &euro;6.54 million and, in light of this significant increase in the estimated price, the harbour commissioners applied for funding under the seaports measure of the NDP. Under the Harbours Act 1946, a harbour authority is required to seek the Minister's consent for any financial commitment in relation to infrastructural works.</P>
      <P>In August 2002, it was belatedly brought to the attention of my Department by the harbour commissioners that they had entered into a contract in respect of the pier development. The harbour commissioners were subsequently advised that, pending clarification on all financial issues relating to the project, the contractors were not to proceed with the project or incur any additional expenditure. As I stated at the beginning of my reply, advice has been sought on various legal issues pertaining to the pier development and a response is awaited from the Attorney General in this regard.</P>

      <P>Why have the papers been with the Attorney General for the past 15 months? Is it for the purpose of parking the file there to ensure the Minister can welch on commitments made by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government to the people of Bantry? <Col N="1486" /> Is he not aware that &euro;1.9 million was legally committed in the year 2000 towards this pier contract of &euro;6.5 million? Is he not aware that, in the days before the general election, a further &euro;1 million was committed politically by the then Minister for the Marine under the national development plan? Taking all those circumstances into account, is the Minister not aware that the contract which was signed by Bantry Harbour Commission is now held up? Apparently, the Minister is trying to welch on the agreements made. He is trying every possible tactic to wriggle out of the legal and political commitments given in respect of this pier. Some honesty would be appropriate for the people of Bantry because it is now clear that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party lied to them about the funding that would be made available. Will the Minister display a modicum of honesty about the project and tell those people what the situation is? This pier is needed and the funds were committed to it, but the Minister has made every effort since he took office to wriggle out of the commitment to provide the necessary money. It is time to stop fooling about with this project.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to wriggle out of anything, I am trying to get legal advice on the position I am obliged to follow under the law. It is the case, and the harbour commissioners know this, that under the Harbours Act, the harbour authority is required to seek the Minister's consent for any financial commitments on infrastructural works. It was made clear in correspondence with the harbour commissioners that no commitment should have been made to commence work or incur costs until the Minister and the Minister for Finance had seen and approved the operating agreement proposed. We were belatedly notified that a contract had been entered by the harbour commissioners. They should have received my consent and the consent of the Minister for Finance to proceed on the basis of the ultimate estimate, which was much greater than originally proposed. I assure the Deputy that if the Attorney General's advice is such that we have to proceed, we will do so.</P>

On foot of that contract, &euro;660,000 was expended by the Bantry Harbour Commission and it drew down some of the money from the first grant. How can the Minister now question the legality of the contract into which Bantry Harbour Commission entered when it was done solely on the basis of the commitments given by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources? It is an outrage that the Minister is trying to wriggle out of the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What legal advice is he seeking? Is he trying to find an avenue to escape the financial and legal commitments made to the people of Bantry? <Col N="1487" /> Why is he hiding behind the Attorney General, who apparently has had the papers since July 2002?

On the specific instances referred to, I understand through contact with An Post and ComReg that An Post is pursuing legal action under section 4 of the Evasion of Postage Act 1937 which will require First Active to furnish details of its mailing by 8 October. An Post will be use every avenue possible to recover the loss of postage which might arise.</P>
      <P>This area is reserved to An Post under the existing rules, but it is the case that as the market opens in the coming years there will be competition in this area and other operators will be able to enter it. Until that is the case, it remains the reserve of An Post. Postal services for weights above 100 grammes are open to competition and the reserved list for An Post is for postal services below that weight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 347 together.</P>
      <P>As soon as I became aware of the intention of the USA authorities to tow 13 derelict naval ships to Britain, I instructed the Irish Coast Guard to establish all relevant facts regarding the proposed operation and to assess the risks to this country in the event of an accident. I am aware of concerns expressed about the dangers that an accident might pose. I was also very concerned that it was intended to tow these old vessels across the Atlantic in wintertime.</P>
      <P>The Irish Coast Guard has established direct contact with the authorities in both the USA and the UK and it has been provided with all the information it requested. The vessels will be towed two at a time and it is intended to tow three pairs of vessels in 2003 and the remainder in 2004. The Irish Coast Guard has been provided with specific information regarding the planned departure times and routes in each case. The first tow commenced late last night, Monday, 6 October, and is expected to take 28 days to berth. The second is planned to commence tomorrow. The planned route will take the tow some 210 miles south of the Fastnet Rock. This route does not enter Irish territorial waters, the Ireland search and rescue region or the Irish pollution responsibility zone, the south-western tip of which it passes by approximately 35 miles. The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Secretary of State Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention are co-ordinating the voyage and acting as centre for communications to and from the USA's maritime authority.</P>
      <P>As well as the information provided by the UK, Ireland has sought and received information on the seaworthiness, watertight integrity and stability of the vessels and on emergency preparedness, manning and the tug's fitness to tow. The vessels in question have been surveyed by three independent surveyors including a UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency surveyor. The US Coast Guard has issued each vessel with a valid load line exemption certificate for the trip. Conditions attaching to the certificates provide for all openings to the hull being closed and securely fastened. Each vessel will be connected to the tug by two towing lines, while a third towing line will be rigged and available on each vessel. A second tug will be on standby in the United States of America to assist in recovery of any of the vessels suffering a broken towline and call-out contracts are in place for tugs in Europe as part of the same contingency. Each of the vessels and the tug will be fitted with satellite transponders allowing them to be accurately tracked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Coast Guard is satisfied in principle with the preventative and response measures pro<Col N="1491" /> posed and will continue to monitor all aspects of the tow very closely. It will maintain contact with the relevant authorities in the United States of America and United Kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously very pleased with President Bush's environmental controls and willing to accept the risks the President is sending out across the North Atlantic. I have two specific questions for the Minister. He says we have call-out contracts with European towing vessels. Should there be a problem with one of the towing vessels and should one of the ships in question begin to edge toward Bantry Harbour or Fastnet Rock, from where will the Minister get a tug? Will we be sending out our marine research vessel to turn around these massive merchant ships?</P>
      <P>If, owing to weather or other circumstances, the authorities in the United States of America ask for access to Irish waters, will the Minister provide it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been monitoring this matter from the beginning and I assure the Deputy that we have taken it very seriously. We have raised it with the UK authorities on quite a number of occasions and we cannot understand why they are willing to accept into their jurisdiction for dismantling rust buckets from another state. We have been assured that the vessels will not come anywhere near our zones and that they will be well away from our coast lines. There is nothing we can do to prevent the operations from a legal point of view.</P>
      <P>We have put full measures in place to address all possible contingencies. Any difficulties which arise will be taken care of. As I said earlier, call-out contracts are in place in relation to tugs in accordance with normal procedure in these cases. In this instance we have been given notice of the movement of the vessels when it is usual to receive none in relation to pollution disasters.</P>

      <P>I have a question down also. Was the Minister's Department in direct contact with the authorities in the United States of America and the United Kingdom in respect of this matter? There is no point saying the vessels will be passing outside our territorial waters since any maritime accident will affect us. We should learn from the lessons taught by the accident off the coast of Spain. There is no point saying tugs will be available when there is the possibility of a major environmental disaster which would affect the livelihoods of fishermen and those dependent on marine activity on the Atlantic seaboard. Why has the Minister failed to stand up to the authorities in the United Kingdom on this occasion to tell them that there will be no gain to Ireland from this commercial venture between them and the United States Navy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy aware of the situation which was properly averted on the north-west coast of Donegal last year? The Irish Coast Guard and the various support agencies successfully prevented a major pollution incident from happening. That was an instance at European level of the way in which the authorities can react to such scenarios. It was said that if the same had happened in relation to the <i>Prestige</i> a couple of months earlier, we would not have seen the disaster on the Galician coast.</P>

      <P>This morning saw a new twist in public service broadcasting when the nation was informed by RTE radio of the decision by Irish Rail to close down DART services for 18 months with four days notice. Surely, this is commercial lunacy as we approach the busiest period of the year. It begs the question of who is really in charge of the running of the country and our public services when it is announced on behalf of a major State agency that it is intended to discommode 90,000 commuters every weekend for the next 18 months. When did the Government become aware of this plan and why did Irish Rail fail to make it public long before now? Why did Irish Rail fail to involve itself with those customers, commuters and retailers who will be discommoded? What contingency plans have been put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that a spokesman said that for two Saturdays the lines will remain open, as we approach the time when the Taoiseach will take over the Presidency of the European Union and shops are already filling with Christmas goods, the numbers referred to will vastly exceed 90,000 over weekends in the run-up to Christmas. Will the Taoiseach indicate when he found out about this matter, the reason it was kept secret and the <Col N="1494" /> contingency plans that are in place to allow for the smooth running of public affairs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvements to DART and commuter rail services will involve an investment of &euro;176 million which is necessary to facilitate the operation of eight-carriage DART and commuter trains, accessibility to mobility impaired customers, delivery of 40 new DART carriages and an increase in peak passenger capacity of over 30%. The work is due to commence on the southern section of the line this weekend and will continue until June 2004. Work on the city centre and northside routes will commence after the work on the southern route is completed, presumably the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>The work schedule is planned to avoid affecting customers on busy weekdays. It will commence on Friday nights, after the last DART, and work will continue around the clock through to early Monday morning. In other words, a week's work will be done in one weekend. Those are the arrangements.</P>
      <P>The most efficient and value for money option is to close a large chunk of the network at a time as the power has to be shut down to undertake work on the overhead lines. Iarnród Éireann has advised that normal services will be provided on the two Saturdays before Christmas, the two busiest shopping weekends of the year. Extra bus services will be provided by Bus Éireann adjacent to the affected routes. Apparently those arrangements have been put in place.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport has requested the chairman of CIE to examine the possibility of maintaining DART services during the three weeks in December before Christmas. The Minister has also requested the chairman to further consider suspending the start-up of the necessary upgrading work and to carry out this work during the days after Christmas and early in the new year, which traditionally is a quiet time for transport services, and on weekends when DART services could be suspended for a period of seven days.</P>
      <P>I understand CIE indicated in March that it intended to undertake this upgrading work. There appears to be some disagreement as to whether it indicated a period during which the work would be started. I understand that was not made clear to commuters in the past few weeks but I believe it was put into the public domain in the spring that it would commence this work in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach rightly referred to improvements on the DART line. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to whom Irish Rail is responsible, is the man who does not miss an opportunity for promotion of himself, his Department and his vision. He was present when the boring machine broke through from Fairview.</P>

I am astounded to think he has invited CIE to reconsider commencing this work. When he was informed by CIE as to its plans, this matter should have been discussed in public with the people who will be discommoded every weekend. Today, retailers said they will be at a loss of &euro;300 million because of this work. What is the position of those who have paid &euro;76 for monthly tickets and &euro;750 for annual tickets? How will they be dealt with? Where are the buses that will become available? Why are they not on the streets now? Has Irish Rail suddenly purchased a new fleet of buses to deal with the effect of the DART not being run at weekends for the next 18 months? It begs the question as to who is in charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that there will be 24 hour contracts and, as happened in the country, the lines will remain open during the day and closed at night for continuous work? If they can be kept open for two weekends, does that not indicate that a more streamlined way could be found of doing this work? Is this another example of a semi-State company doing its business without clarity of direction from the Minister responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument is about when the work started and the notice given. I hope there is no argument about the work that needs to be done. This work will take cars off the road and increase the capacity of the DART from 11,000 passengers per hour to 16,000 per hour. The work is necessary. It is a large part of the company's capital programme. To be fair to CIE, I understand it made clear in the spring that the work would start in the autumn although it did not make clear until recent days that it would start now. For that reason, the Minister made the two points that they should avoid December and, if possible, the period until after Christmas because people did not get sufficient notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question most citizens have asked about Luas is why people are not working late into the night and at weekends. In this instance, the work will start after the last DART on a Friday night and continue through the entire weekend until early Monday morning. I do not believe people will quibble with that. The short notice is the issue and I have stated that the Minister has asked that these issues be examined. While there has been an enormous amount of capital expenditure on buses, it would mean CIE having extra routes and additional people working at key times on weekends in those locations but the <Col N="1496" /> work has to be done. The Minister will report back on whether it can be adjusted around the Christmas period but there is a significant benefit for commuters once this job is finished.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, there is a convention in the House and required by the House that where a Member misleads the House, he or she takes the first opportunity to correct the record. It would appear that the Taoiseach deliberately misled the House on a number of occasions in respect of a number of matters dealing with the deal with the religious congregations, and I want to raise two of them.</P>
      <P>In respect of the matter of the exclusion of the Attorney General and his office from the critical meetings, the Taoiseach said otherwise on a number of occasions in the House. In respect of whether the terms of the indemnity were debated in the House, the Taoiseach said they were. For example, on 12 February of this year he told me that the indemnity was worked out in February. The Committee of Public Accounts was told that the officials did not start work on the indemnity until 19 April. The House collapsed on 24 April and there was only one sitting day between 19 and 24 April. The House was dissolved on 24 April. The redress Bill concluded on 10 April. Negotiations on the terms of the indemnity did not start until 19 April. How could the Taoiseach say on one occasion that the indemnity was worked out in February and on another occasion tell the House that the matter &ldquo;was discussed repeatedly in the House&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>On the matter of the exclusion of the Attorney General, we know now from both the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and from the then Attorney General that the Taoiseach's statement on 11 February that &ldquo;The Attorney General and his office was involved throughout the entire period&rdquo; is untrue. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is now an orphan in Cabinet, disowned by the Taoiseach and his Ministers and abandoned by his own&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the two aspects, I did not mislead the House. I have made this point already. Deputy Rabbitte quoted the start of what I said on 11 February, and he quoted me correctly as saying the Attorney General and his office were involved throughout the period. That was the first line. As Deputy Rabbitte knows, this is a stand alone in its own right, and might suggest a direct contradiction. However, if one reads the whole paragraph, which I intend to do, it is quite clear that I pointed out to the House that the former Minister, Deputy Woods, and the Secretary General held meetings in which the Attorney General was involved. I would like to read the full paragraph if I may and not the cynically edited extract the Deputy raised. On 11 February I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the party leader will allow me to reply. He does not need any help from Deputy Ryan. The Attorney General and his office was involved throughout the entire period. All of the issues of the indemnity came fully in front <Col N="1500" /> of the Government. Deputy Woods who was then the Minister for Education and Science dealt with the issues on the authority of the Government. All of the Departments were involved in most of the discussions. When Deputy Woods and his Secretary General and one of his officials dealt with the meetings they did not need anyone holding their hands. He did as any Minister would.</P>
    <P>I made it quite clear the Attorney General was not at all the meetings, so I did not mislead the House deliberately, or in any other way. Deputy Rabbitte picked one line in one paragraph but he left out the rest. I am afraid Deputy Rabbitte knows that is not even clever, never mind smart.</P>
    <P>On the issue of whether the matter was discussed on other occasions, it was discussed. I put that on the record last week. It was discussed in the Dáil on 12 and 20 February and on 8 March in the Seanad and on other occasions the matter was referred to. That was made clear last week and I will go through the quotes if necessary, but the Deputy has them, as he has the full quote of the last part. The document or the agreement on the indemnity was drawn up on 30 January and it was effectively agreed then.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The workings continued on until June. There are plenty of documents on the issue. As always when I raise this matter with Deputy Rabbitte, I remind him that the sole motivation of the Government was to help the victims and not put them in a position where they had to go to courts and fight cases in the courts one by one and where they would not have got proper redress. To send old people, who had been badly treated by successive Governments, to the courts and not allow them to put their cases, is, and will remain, the central issue. I cannot understand why people want to ignore that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point on helping the victims, the Taoiseach's Government deliberately collapsed the Laffoy commission. I do not know how that is helping the victims. For a number of weeks since this controversy developed, the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers have been saying that the previous rainbow Government declined to meet the people concerned or their organisations. It is completely untrue. The organisations came into existence after the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programme when the Taoiseach's Government was in office. If anybody is trying to be clever, it is the Taoiseach. He is the one who clearly told the House last February, at a time when we did not have the benefit of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, when on four successive days I raised this matter, that &ndash; it is in black and white &ndash; the &ldquo;Attorney General and his <Col N="1501" /> office was involved throughout the entire period&rdquo;. That is the Taoiseach's statement. That is the sense of everything he tried to say until the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform broke cover. The Taoiseach has now left him swinging from a lamp-post, disowned, abandoned and contemplating his future. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>As regards the terms of the indemnity, how can the Taoiseach seriously say to this House it was referred to? That is the way we do business &ndash; by referring to it. Mr. Boland of the Department of Education and Science told the Committee of Public Accounts that it did not start to negotiate the terms of the indemnity until 19 April. The Taoiseach has tried to say to my colleague, Deputy Shortall, that the document was presented in January. The Department did not look at or start to deal with the terms of the indemnity until 19 April 2002 and the Taoiseach dissolved the House on 24 April 2002. The redress Act had concluded its passage through both Houses on 10 April 2002. How could we possibly have debated the terms of the indemnity and how can the Taoiseach stand over this way of doing business when he also told this House that there was a record of all meetings? There is no record, contemporaneous notes or transcripts of the critical meetings of 7 November and 7 January, which the Taoiseach knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given the quote of 12 February where I made it absolutely clear that there were meetings. As far as I recall from looking at the record last week, there were 16 meetings in all. The then Attorney General was involved in 12 of the meetings and was not involved in four of them. We know his office would have liked to have been at all the meetings but&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because the talks had broken down at that stage, the Secretary General and the Minister were endeavouring to get the issues back on track. The Deputy is wrong to say the Laffoy commission has been pulled down. The Laffoy commission is completing its report. Then Mr. Seán Ryan, SC, will take over to continue the work. In the meantime, most of the aspects of the commission, other than the investigation end, are working successfully and well. I do not agree with any of the contentions made by Deputy Rabbitte. The key issue in this matter is to work this agreement successfully through so that the individuals will be entitled to their claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get into an argument about a former Member of the House and I will not mention the then Minister of State's name. However, I will remind Deputy Rabbitte that there were four attempts to have a meeting with the then <Col N="1502" /> Minister of State. The programme that RTE started, for Deputy Rabbitte's information, was in the spring of 1996. I was not Taoiseach in the spring of 1996. That was the first RTE programme when this issue started and it was not when I was Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the huge damage that is being done to local communities as a result of the ongoing cuts in community employment schemes? Is he aware that during the course of this year, some 5,000 cuts have taken place? These have affected services for people with disabilities, the elderly, adult education, the maintenance of community <Col N="1503" /> centres and other facilities, local transport and child care.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Harney, pledged that schemes designed and focused on the needs of child care and drug treatment would be ring-fenced. Is the Taoiseach aware that the cuts being imposed by the Government are now affecting such schemes dealing with child care and drug treatment despite the Minister's so-called assurance that those areas would be ring-fenced. We have a situation where day care, adult literacy services, meals and transport for the elderly are all being placed at risk as a result of these cuts and attacks on communities.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach further aware that these attacks on communities are compounded by the decision to cut the voluntary training opportunities scheme, whereby those seeking educational opportunities are having their child care provisions withdrawn? Does he accept that CE schemes, while designed initially as training and preparatory schemes for entry into long-term employment, have provided a major resource within local communities? They have given new life and opportunities to communities and to the individual participants. Will the Taoiseach undertake in recognition of the important role CE schemes play, to reverse the cuts and ensure that they are placed where they belong &ndash; within the communities, guaranteeing opportunity and service?</P>

When one includes the JI and the social economy schemes, it is about 25,000 participants The Minister did give the commitment that the CE places in the health sector, which include personal assistants services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of those services. I understand that is the case.</P>
      <P>Projects are prioritised based on the services provided. The drugs task force activity and child care provision are ring-fenced. Any reduction in the projects in the RAPID scheme are being given priority. The most in need places have been maintained. There have been difficulties in some of the other areas. There have been a number of cross-departmental meetings endeavouring to see how best to maintain schemes and services that are valuable to the health services. I know that the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Centre for Independent Living and others have made cases which have been looked at across Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CE scheme funding for this year is &euro;274 million, which will provide a participation rate of about 22,500 people. FÁS has stated that to hold the existing position, it would need 25,000 places. Next year's funding will be looked at again in the Estimates over the next month. The case, again, <Col N="1504" /> will have to be made for what areas are to be ring-fenced. FÁS argues that ring-fencing is not a good idea because the shortfalls in funding will fall on other categories. One can have some schemes that might not be a priority which are then protected, while others in more beneficial areas are not. That can create difficulties for the schemes.</P>
    <P>Issues such as the beneficial schemes, the phasing out of the JI schemes and the long-term unemployed receiving more training places than at present, are all matters that are under examination across Departments. It is hoped, in the context of the Estimates, to alleviate some of the problems that have been created for the CE schemes over the last few months.</P>

      <P>Everyone recognises that the CE schemes were far from perfect. However, does the Taoiseach not recognise that they identified an important and valuable niche in terms of community service? The Government decisions on their funding is having a devastating effect, not only on the individual participant, but also on important and valuable service roles within communities throughout the country. Despite his reaffirmation of the ring-fencing with regard to the provision of scheme support in child care and drug treatment, it is not the case. Whatever the Minister's understanding of ring-fencing is, the reality is that it is a far cry from the factual position on the ground.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that these cuts are being equally applied to areas of greatest disadvantage where the RAPID and CLÁR programmes are already part of addressing community needs? How can this be justified? There is a clear contradiction in the Government's so-called commitment to these programmes when, at the same time, another Department is actually taking away this valuable service and role.</P>
      <P>With regard to a review that has been mentioned time and again, will the Taoiseach indicate to the House what consultations are being undertaken about these schemes? There is no evidence of consultation with scheme organisers or key participants. That is a critical need if a real and worthwhile review is to take place.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised three questions. The Deputy asked if I am aware and agree with the excellent work that takes place within many of the CE schemes throughout the country. Yes, I am aware of that. I acknowledge that they do excellent work in the schemes, particularly in community centres, meals on wheels, disability and health-related areas. That is why the Government is still putting in &euro;274 million in funding to the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the officials state that not alone are the ring-fences which the Tánaiste requested in place, but in some cases they would rather they were not there. The Deputy said they are not there, but the Tánaiste rightly brought them in to protect the drugs task force areas, the child care ser<Col N="1505" /> vice and the RAPID areas, and from that meeting I clearly heard him stating&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will respond very briefly to the third question asked by Deputy Ó Caoláin about the current review of community employment and job initiative programmes. The PPF provides that an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes are carried out. The work has been undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market which is chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That cross-departmental group of senior officials has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking into account the link with the provision of community services. We are in the process of meeting the Deputy's request.</P>

      <P>Last Thursday the Tánaiste told the House that there was an omission from the list of legislation which was published for consideration by the House. She said that a planning Bill was being prepared by the Government. I asked her about a planning Bill which would address two issues. The first was the abolition of the &euro;20 fee for making planning submissions and the second was to give effect to the Taoiseach's promise to amend the planning laws regarding one-off rural housing. It was not clear from the reply if the promised planning Bill would address both issues. Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify for the House if the Bill, which was omitted from the list, will address both issues.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport the inquiry which is planned into the derailment of a freight train near Cahir, County Tipperary, on 7 September 2003 and the consequent collapse of a section of the bridge known as the Cahir viaduct; the steps being taken to review safety procedures at such locations in view of the crash and the potential consequences had this been a passenger train; the implications for the future of <Col N="1518" /> the Waterford-Limerick Junction line; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>This morning Iarnród Éireann notified the chief railway inspecting officer of my Department of a railway incident involving a freight train, which occurred earlier this morning on the Limerick-Waterford rail line. Thankfully, I understand, no injuries were sustained.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by Iarnród Éireann of the preliminary details of the incident. The incident occurred when the 3.35 a.m. Limerick to Waterford bulk cement train derailed as it passed over the River Suir viaduct outside Cahir. The train comprised two locomotives and 22 wagons. The locomotives and one wagon remained fully on the track, with a further nine wagons becoming derailed but remaining on the track bed. The remaining 12 wagons fell from the centre span of the viaduct and landed on the bank of the river or, in some cases, in the river itself. These wagons were extensively damaged. Part of the viaduct and a section of track between the viaduct and Cahir station were also extensively damaged.</P>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding the derailment are currently being investigated by Iarnród Éireann's mechanical and infrastructure engineers to determine the cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>Due to the level of damage sustained, the line has been closed and I understand that preliminary indications are that it may remain closed for some time. The extent of the damage is currently being assessed by Iarnród Éireann and this will allow the company to estimate the length of time needed to carry out the necessary repairs. Meanwhile, Iarnród Éireann is making every effort to assist in setting up alternative arrangements for its passengers and for its freight customers, including its beet and cement customers.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the Garda Síochána, the Civil Defence and officers from the Environmental Protection Agency, the local authority and the fisheries board have been in attendance at the site. The chief railway inspecting officer of my Department is in attendance and will meet Iarnród Éireann's chief engineer at the site.</P>
      <P>The details I have given to the House are based on the initial information provided to me by Iarnród Éireann and the chief railway inspecting officer. I have asked for a more detailed report on the incident from the chief railway inspecting officer on his return. I have also asked Iarnród Éireann that I be provided with the findings of its investigation when it is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response at such short notice. Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that the Waterford-Limerick rail line will be reopened and that this morning's incident will not threaten the viability of beet or cement deliveries by rail? Has the Minister any indication of the implications <Col N="1519" /> this incident could have for other viaducts or for the use of cement bubble wagons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason the line should not reopen as normal. The cause of the derailment is not known at this stage. When I receive those final details, I will be in a better position to answer the Deputy's question more fully. However, I see no reason the line cannot be restored to its previous condition. Although I will consider the matter, I cannot see the immediate implications for other viaducts. However, if the results of this investigation raise questions about standards at other viaducts, I will ensure that the railway inspecting officers take the necessary action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for replying to these questions which are very important to people in the south-east, particularly given the transportation of beet by rail from Wellingtonbridge to the Mallow beet plant. We are all trying to encourage road safety and we do not want to see additional lorries on the road transporting beet from Wellingtonbridge to Mallow, which is a long journey.</P>
      <P>I have been in touch with the beet growers' association in Wexford which, in turn, has been in contact with Irish Rail. The beet growers have told me that it could be the end of this year or early in 2004 before the rail line is reopened. On two or three occasions, I have met the Minister, with other Deputies from Wexford, on deputations from the county to discuss the future of the Rosslare to Limerick railway line. I hope that the line will not be closed down as a result of today's incident. The importance of the line both for passenger and freight traffic has been explained to the Minister so I hope he will be able to get the line reopened as soon as possible. Have Irish Rail officials indicated a timescale for reopening the line? What will the cost of the repairs be and can work on the line begin before the investigation has been completed? The most important matter is the transportation of beet by rail because we do not want more lorries using the roads. I think the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will back me up on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Preliminary indications from Iarnród Éireann are that the line may be closed for some months. That is the most accurate information I can give the Deputy at this point. I agree with him that policy should be to get freight off the roads and on to the railways and, in that connection, I fully support use of our railways for beet and other freight transport. I understand the importance of this particular line for freight traffic. The best estimate I can provide, however, is that it will take some months to reopen the line. I will be able to give the House more accurate information when I receive the final report on the incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister will have to wait some time for the report but can he provide an assurance on funding because I do not want to see any excuse being used to downgrade this railway line? Meetings have been held in an effort to keep the line open and in fairness to the Minister, he is committed to maintaining it. Will he provide the necessary funding for CIE? I saw the scene of the incident early this morning and it looked like something from a war. The Minister should make the necessary funding available for repair of the line. He should also ensure that no excuse is provided to close the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This accident could have been much more serious if a passenger train had been involved. We were lucky on this occasion. I would not allow Iarnród Éireann to link a particular event such as this to the future assessment of the need for a line. That is a separate issue, which I have to assess separately. There is one passenger service in each direction per day on that line. I told the delegation, to which the Deputy's colleague referred, that it is incumbent upon people to support the railway services. I see no reason such a rail service, effectively from Limerick to Waterford, should not be a good one, linking those two large areas of population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incumbent on everybody involved to make sure the service is supported and to build it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been somewhat disingenuous with his last comment, with all due respect. He knows well that Iarnród Éireann cannot build up that service without proper investment in it. Would he accept that the reason for today's very serious incident was because that line has been neglected over many years and that he and his predecessors have failed to provide the necessary investment to make it a fully functioning and safe line? The Minister knows as well as we do the type of approach that has been taken by Iarnród Éireann in recent times because it has been starved of funding. The company has said to us that it wants to get out of the freight business. The Minister has said today that he is fully supportive of rail freight. It is not enough just to pay lip service to it. He knows perfectly well that investment needs to be put in place to make rail freight possible. We need upgrading of the lines and we need to allow Iarnród Éireann the flexibility it needs to let that happen. Due to the financial pressures on the company at the moment it is keen to close lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already been asked by Deputy Naughten to give a commitment on the future of this line. Many people living in the Munster area want to see the line developed. They realise the potential it has, even if the Minister does not. If he is serious about balanced regional development he must accept the argu<Col N="1521" /> ment that investment has to go into the infrastructure and development will follow after that. Let us take the pressure off Dublin and make a real commitment to developing rail links outside the capital. I want to ask the Minister to give a clear commitment that he will not use this incident as an excuse for closing down that line. I am asking him to put on the record that he is committed to maintaining, improving and upgrading that line into the future. I would also ask him to give a commitment that as soon as he receives the report of the rail inspector he will make it available to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe I am the one that is being disingenuous. The Deputy is trying to suggest that the reason for the accident is because of lack of investment in the line. I do not believe the Deputy can come into Dáil Éireann and say that. There are inspectors investigating the accident. It may or may not have anything to do with the investment in the line. I want to say that straight away. If it turns out to be the case, fine, but I do not think the Deputy can state it as a fact. Accidents happen and it may or may not have had anything to do with investment.</P>
      <P>The second thing is that I believe the Deputy decided not to listen to me. I said clearly that I would not allow Iarnród Éireann to use this accident as an excuse to interfere with the line. The future of the line is a separate issue completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that I said it, the Deputy asked that I should not use it as an excuse to close the line. I have no intention of closing any railway line. My approach to railway lines &ndash; I have said this many times &ndash; is to build them up and get more passengers for them. It would be silly for a country like this to go around closing railway lines in circumstances where the roads are clogged and the car population is growing dramatically. We need to make the railway lines work for us. Finally, with regard to investment, I would inform the Deputy that &euro;400 million a year is going into railway investment and rail safety. In the past five years &euro;1 billion has gone into rail safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is up and down the country. I can get the details on particular lines for the Deputy, but I can assure her there has been enormous investment. Some 80% of the mainline track is now completely replaced. That is a very significant investment. All I can say about this particular line is this is an incident, an accident, that will be dealt with professionally by the inspectors. We will find the cause of it and we will learn lessons from that. The future of the line is a separate issue and I will not attempt &ndash; nor will I allow Iarnród Éireann &ndash; to link the two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support my colleague, Deputy Kehoe, in his sentiments as regards the Rosslare-Limerick Junction line. As the Minister is aware we had a number of meetings earlier this year with Deputies and Senators from the south-east, from Wexford right through to Tipperary. He gave us an assurance at that time that no line would close &ndash; and in particular that that line would not close, despite the fact that Iarnród Éireann made several attempts over the years to close it. I would like to welcome the Minister's statement that there will be a distinction between today's accident and what Iarnród Éireann might want to do regarding the line, and that it will not be allowed to use the accident as an excuse.</P>
      <P>As regards the beet industry which is very important to south Wexford and Wellington Bridge, could I ask the Minister how many farmers are geared up to put it on wagons and send it to Mallow? Could he ask Iarnród Éireann what alternative arrangements it is going to make with farmers? Obviously they are not in a position to haul the beet all the way to Mallow. Iarnród Éireann should be as helpful as it can to the farmers, in whatever way is possible. Finally, in many ways we are lucky that we are not dealing the more serious problem of fatalities, if a passenger train had been involved. I would welcome the Minister's statement of assurance that CIE will not use the incident as an excuse to close the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would confirm for my colleague's benefit that Iarnród Éireann has advised me that it is making every effort to assist in making alternative arrangements for both its freight and passenger customers. I do not have details on what those arrangements are right now, but it has assured me and I will insist the company makes alternative arrangements for freight and passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone will accept that we need to investigate what happened and come to conclusions on that &ndash; and that the issue of the railway line is separate. It gives us a useful opportunity today to look into that issue. For me the interesting thing is to look at the facts of the line, particularly with regard to freight. I think that at this time of the year there are something like six freight trains a day, two cement trains and a more frequent Norfolk container line. We are looking at about nine freight trains a day on the line, given that the beet trains comprise about 30 wagons and the cement trains about 20. If this traffic was to be replaced on the road one is possibly looking at 200 additional juggernauts a day on the Wexford, Tipperary and other road networks. That would do huge damage and cause enormous difficulties in our towns &ndash; and present a huge safety issue. What struck me immediately was, as Deputy Browne has been saying, this is a line that Iarnród Éireann has been desperately <Col N="1523" /> trying to close down. There are nine trains a day without any effort being put into developing the service.</P>
      <P>For a line to work, it has to cater for as many services as possible. There is a very large fixed cost in providing the line. It makes no sense, then, to run as few services as possible. The marginal cost in adding on additional services is much smaller. That begs the question as to what Iarnród Éireann was doing in the scheduling of its passenger freight services on this line. The Minister has said there is an obligation on the people of Clonmel, or Carrick-on-Suir or Waterford to use the service. How can they be expected to use the service when on occasions it would be quicker to cycle on certain sections? On occasion one is left waiting by Iarnród Éireann. It apparently sets its timing almost deliberately to discourage passenger use of the service. Ultimately the Minister is in charge. We had the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, earlier saying in regard to An Post that he was not in charge of details but was in charge of policy. Likewise, the Minister for Transport is in charge of overall rail policy in this State. Where we see a rail company in charge, treating a passenger rail like that, it is the Minister's responsibility to tell it that he is not satisfied. That is the rail service Percy French would have sung about, but it is not suitable for 21st century Ireland. The lesson from today is what the Minister will do to ensure the viability of this line, not only with regard to the particular viaduct or the possible repair of the line or whatever the circumstances of the accident, but overall, how he is to ensure continued service.</P>
      <P>There are many more details that may emerge from this. We have an opportunity next week during questions to the Minister, and I intend to put a certain number. The real issue for the Minister is the fact that he makes policy and that he avails of the current opportunity &ndash; not with regard to the details of the accident or the day-to-day management of the particular line &ndash; to recognise that a substantial freight business is possible here and that the reason we do not have a passenger service on it is because of its deliberate mismanagement by the rail company.</P>
      <P>Lastly, there were reported comments by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen and others, of particular concern to the Waterford area. I believe he expressed slight concern that if we pay too much attention to the rail line, it might possibly divert traffic from the new motorway planned for the Waterford area. Does the Minister agree with the assessment that we have a choice between rail and road services and because we are investing so much in the road service into Waterford, perhaps there is not such a case for the Waterford rail line? Does the Minister agree with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that regard?</P>

      <P>I have made it clear several times that I am a supporter of rail travel and 21st century travel in Ireland will require it. In the past we closed railway lines and regretted it. That infrastructure is critical for the future shape of modern Ireland. I am a strong supporter of freight on the lines. While I can take responsibility for policy issues, the company will have to take responsibility for individual day-to-day decisions under the general policy the Government lays down for it.</P>
      <P>That line should be able to carry more freight, as should the rail network in general. The freight service in Iarnród Éireann is a heavy loss-maker. The company has frequently approached me with a view to reducing its involvement in certain aspects of freight and I have refused its requests and will continue to do so. I have also made it clear that if Iarnród Éireann cannot or will not successfully develop a strong freight business, we should consider giving it to another body and take on the trade union and other difficulties that may cause. If we decide to do that, I hope the House will support us.</P>

      <P>The issue of this rail line has been raised with the Minister on a number of occasions. Everyone would agree that there has been underinvestment on the line. We will have to wait and see if that forms part of the cause of this particular rail accident. Is it not true that we are lucky this was not a huge tragedy? Had it been a passenger train rather than a freight train, there could have been a serious tragedy. Will the Minister give a firm commitment to the House that a lack of funds will not delay the repair of the viaduct? We need a response to that critical issue today.</P>
      <P>Will funds be made available to upgrade the line from Limerick Junction to Waterford and Rosslare? As the Minister knows that line has huge potential simply as a freight line. In light of the EU announcement that it wants to develop a motorway of the sea from the Irish coast to the Iberian Peninsula, it is critical that that rail line be upgraded to provide exporters in the west and mid-west access to both Rosslare and Waterford ports, as we do not have the road structure at this point.</P>
      <P>I understand that part of the track in the vicinity of the viaduct has been upgraded recently. Had Iarnród Éireann any plans to upgrade the viaduct? Will the Minister give the House any information that becomes available to him? When will Report Stage of the Railway Safety Bill be taken so that we can have a proper investigative measure to ensure that the company does not have to investigate itself after any future incidents?</P>

      <P>I certainly would not stand over a line that was not safe. I will review the report very closely to see what conclusions it draws about the line.

There was also an accident around the same area in the 1950s. Work was carried out at that time and that seems to be where the problem is. Work carried out many years earlier seems to be in considerably sounder condition. Will the report cover all those aspects? If the report established what was wrong with the tracks, will the Minister alert those affected by other parts of the line?</P>

The chief inspecting officer is at the site and on his return he will give me fuller details than I now have. At that point I can decide on any possible legal investigation.

Has the company at any stage brought his attention to problems that may exist on the line? In respect of the action following today's incident, is he saying that the entire line is being closed or is it possible to keep portions of it operational? Given the Minister's responsibility for policy in respect of the railways, what is his policy for the future of the Limerick Junction-Rosslare line?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was more enthusiastic than Iarnród Éireann about this line. We talked earlier about the DART service and people working overnight. Does the Minister get a sense of urgency from Iarnród Éireann about the repairs to this line? I note that he says it may be closed for some time but if there is no urgency on the part of Iarnród Éireann could we be talking about a long time and can the Minister can use his influence to try and speed up the repairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister have any broad idea how much it will cost to repair the 12 damaged carriages? Is there any indication of the cost of repairs to the viaduct? Does he have any idea <Col N="1528" /> how long the inquiry will take? I was impressed to hear that the Minister is concerned to get the Railway Safety Bill through the House. What is causing the delay? If the Minister does not have time to answer that question now perhaps he could send me a letter about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this incident happened at 3.50 a.m. this morning, it is only hours old. I do not have any sense that there is a lack of urgency in getting the viaduct repaired. I assume Iarnród Éireann will get on with that as quickly as it can. I do not have any estimate of costs. The Deputy's guess would be as good as mine at this stage. I have not asked the company about this because it is focusing on getting information about what happened. The Deputy can make a good guess himself as to what it would cost to repair the line, the carriages and the viaduct. It will be an expensive operation. When the inspector returns and gives me his report I will decide whether we need a formal inquiry under section 7 or whether the inspector's report covers enough to satisfy the House.</P>
      <P>The Railway Safety Bill was delayed by the summer recess. It was on Committee Stage and I made a commitment to Deputy Shortall that I would bring it back to the House at some stage. The main reason for the delay was that there were several issues to do with the use of alcohol, the disciplinary measures available and other similar issues which we have yet to resolve. I have undertaken to talk to the trade unions about these. I am hopeful of making progress with that and getting the Bill back into the House quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Our rail system is largely a radial system in and out of Dublin and this is one of the few lines that does not have its terminus in Dublin. Does the Minister agree that with the speed restrictions that already existed on the Limerick Junction-Rosslare line and the attempt earlier by Iarnród Éireann to stop the passenger and freight service, this line was not given priority and suffered from lack of investment? This morning's incident was an effect of that type of policy, for which the Minister has direct responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am uncertain whether the train can go from Waterford to Cahir station. Clonmel is a major urban centre and it is important that a signal is given that links can be maintained between Clonmel and Waterford city. Can the Minister give some indication of the Government's policy on that and how Iarnród Éireann could be persuaded to maintain such a service? An indication that part of the line would be used would give hope in the short term that the full line can be restored for use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise with the company the question of leaving parts of the line open, which is a good idea if it can be brought about. I will do that tomorrow and see how practical that is. I do not want to give a public indication that the accident was in any way caused by the level of invest<Col N="1529" /> ment in the line. It would be premature to draw that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's comment that the company is less enthusiastic about the line than he is yet it does not surprise me. It is an indictment of the company. The Minister is the person who sets policy on behalf of the Government and there is an onus on him to set down clear parameters for the provision of services and the maintenance of lines. Does he not agree that this line services three of the most important ports which are also the least utilised because there is no road infrastructure to service them? Does he not agree that it is crazy that the service coming from the west has to do the circuit of Ireland, up to Kildare and back down to Waterford because there is no access to that line?</P>
      <P>Would he not agree that the fact that the Railway Safety Bill is not passed seriously limits the range and scope of the investigation that can take place, and the powers that he and the railway inspecting officer have in dealing with this? Can he give a commitment &ndash; which would be unusual but it should be done &ndash; that this investigation will be completed and delivered to his desk before the Christmas recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Railway Safety Bill is important and it would be useful were we to have it available. I do not see why the railway inspector cannot get on and give us the cause of this accident as quickly as possible in order that we know exactly what we are dealing with here and precisely&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the principle of publishing the legislation in the first place because the railway inspector did not have power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe the absence of that power will in any way prevent the making of those inquiries. I have not yet ordered a formal inquiry under section 7. I will take that decision after I hear from the inspecting officer on his return. At that point we can decide if there is full co-operation from everybody involved. I have no reason to expect less than full co-operation from the company with regard to all relevant questions and documentation. However, I accept that the more modern, streamlined structure of the Railway Safety Bill is a better regime, to which we will move as soon as possible. The Deputy asked me to have this done before Christmas &ndash; I will make every effort to have the Bill brought forward as quickly as we can.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's reference to my role, nobody in my job can start taking responsibility, on a mile by mile basis, for approximately 1,000 miles of railway. There is an independent State board established under statute by this House to manage the day-to-day operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I take responsibility for policy. However, when it comes down to whether trains can be stopped at particular stations and how much of the track can be kept open between certain towns after a derailment, a great deal of this is in the area of operations, which is a matter for the company to handle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute that. However, it is one of the most critical rail lines in the country. The Minister has stated it is his policy to develop rail freight services but not one cent has gone towards that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. The line has been open, freight has been carried and the company has been seeking to develop that business. Quite an effort has been made to further develop freight services on the line. When it is repaired and new rolling stock is put in place, I see no reason the company cannot continue that development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of people have said this could have been a major tragedy. It was just a matter of luck that a freight train was involved, rather than a passenger train. Perhaps the nature of the incident has underlined the need for legislation in this area. The Railway Safety Bill dates back to 2001 and it was only this year that the Minister got around to dealing with it on Committee Stage, where there were major delays because of new sections which he sought to introduce, literally overnight.</P>

It was not until David Begg made contact with him and the Taoiseach that he pulled back. Let us be clear about the facts. The Minister tried to ram through two major sections which had huge implications for rail workers &ndash; manual rail workers, not for any of the management &ndash; about which we expressed serious concern.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill was amended and passed by Seanad Éireann on 25 October 2000. It is designed to clarify the law enshrined in the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 in a number of important respects so as to copperfasten long-standing practices. Early enactment is, therefore, most desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government has delegated to me certain functions of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources under the Act. I should emphasise that the Act is an important regulatory measure which ensures only material adjudged on scientific advice as suitable for disposal at sea, mainly arising from port dredging, is disposed of at sea in an appropriate location and manner. In so far as it concerns the protection of important natural and archaeological heritage, the Bill, as passed by Seanad Éireann, specifically included the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the list of Ministers to be consulted by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in relation to all applications for dumping at sea permits. The Bill now requires amendment to reflect the changes last year, as a result of which natural heritage and archaeolog<Col N="1534" /> ical heritage functions were assigned to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is already specified in the 1996 Act among Ministers who must be consulted regarding all such applications.</P>
    <P>The Bill also specifically included any likelihood of interference with important natural or archaeological heritage in the particular matters to be considered by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources before making a decision on any application for a dumping at sea permit. Sections 2 and 4 of the Bill were designed to remove any doubt about the proper protection of important natural and archaeological heritage in the context of the operations covered by the Dumping at Sea Act 1996.</P>
    <P>Ministers already specifically listed in the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 for consultation are the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government &ndash; regarding water quality, natural heritage, archaeological heritage and radiological protection following the Government changes in departmental responsibilities that I mentioned &ndash; and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment &ndash; regarding any implications for industry. The reference in the 1996 Act to the Minister for Public Enterprise will also have to be removed by way of Dáil amendment to take account of those Government changes. Other Ministers of the Government shall also be consulted by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources where considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>The remit of the heritage and planning division of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as regards both the natural heritage and the archaeological heritage applies offshore as it does on the mainland. Applicants for dumping at sea permits are encouraged by my Department to consult that division at the earliest possible stage of planning any dredging or dumping to identify any important heritage areas to be avoided or to be approached with caution and expertly surveyed before any dredging or dumping goes ahead.</P>
    <P>Section 2 was amended by Seanad Éireann &ndash; by the addition of paragraph (<i>e</i>) &ndash; to require the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to have the public register of dumping at sea permits published by electronic means from 1 January 2001 on the Department's website at <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i> That has been done for all permits granted since then under the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 and particulars of all further permits will be published as they are granted. This does not affect the statutory public register of dumping at sea permits already kept in book form and available for inspection free of charge at the Department's headquarters. It does not affect either the statutory requirement on the Minister to publish annually in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> particulars of all dumping at sea permits granted. In 2002, a total of 14 dumping at sea permits were granted, eight of which were for port and harbour dredging for maintenance and development purposes, <Col N="1535" /> as were 11 of the permits granted in 2001. Details of all of these permits are available on the Department's website.</P>
    <P>In the interests of transparency and fairness of procedures, the Bill imposes a statutory requirement &ndash; in place of the present non-statutory one &ndash; on applicants for dumping at sea permits to advertise their applications in a local newspaper. Interested parties will have 21 days after publication of the newspaper advertisement in which to comment to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the proposals in the applications, except in urgent cases involving navigational safety, where public advertisement only is being provided for. Those comments will be referred to the applicants for their response within a reasonable time, which will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. Both those comments and the response of the applicants will be carefully considered by me, under powers delegated from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, before I make a decision on the application.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill, which adds a new section 5A to the 1996 Act, makes specific provision for this. Section 3 of the Bill was amended by Seanad Éireann by the addition of subsection (7) to section 5A of the 1996 Act, requiring the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to publish by electronic means all applications for dumping at sea permits received on or after 1 January 2001 and all submissions or observations from the public in relation to such applications. The necessary arrangements were put in place and are working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The present non-statutory public consultation arrangements regarding port and harbour dredging and dumping at sea operations have not caused any delays in permitting any such operations, and I do not expect any delays to arise from enactment of this Bill. That goes for regular maintenance dredging as well as for dredging for development purposes. It is important that ports and harbours plan necessary dredging and dumping at sea operations well in advance, in consultation with customers and the public, so that the business of the ports and harbours can continue to develop without unnecessary disruptions.</P>
    <P>The lack of such consultation could generate challenges to the proposed dredging and dumping and put at risk the business of the port or harbour in question. Any local concerns should clearly be identified at the earliest possible stage by all of the parties concerned and be appropriately addressed. At my Department's insistence, five year dredging and dumping plans for ports are being prepared and will be published as part of the necessary consultation with the public and statutory consultees regarding dumping at sea permit applications by the ports in question.</P>
    <P>Already, five year dredging and dumping permits have been granted to the Dublin Port Company, Drogheda Port Company and Port of Cork Company. The Port of Waterford Company sub<Col N="1536" /> mitted a five year dredging and dumping plan for consideration but is currently in the process of carrying out a detailed monitoring programme in connection with its proposal. Shannon Foynes Port Company is expected to submit its five year plan soon for approval.</P>
    <P>The preparation and publication of such five year plans makes sound business sense as well as appropriately informing the public of proposed significant activities on State-owned foreshore which could be of particular interest to them. Following the granting of a dumping at sea permit to a port for a period of up to five years, covering several dredging and dumping operations as detailed in the port's five year plan, it will suffice for the port in question to publish a notice of intention to dredge and dump within specific areas as needs arise. Such a notice of specific dredging and dumping is a timely reminder to any persons who may be affected to allow the approved and necessary dredging and dumping operations to go ahead without interference or delay.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining sections, section 1 updates the definition of &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; in the 1996 Act, for enforcement and related purposes, to take account of later legislation including the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2000. Section 5 is a standard provision for the short title for the Bill when enacted and for its construction and referencing with the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, I now propose to deal with the 1996 Act and policy developments to control dumping at sea. The Dumping at Sea Act 1996 has stood the test of time, a tribute to its sponsors. I pay particular tribute to Deputy Gilmore who piloted the Bill through this House to enactment. The Act strengthened considerably and replaced earlier legislation for the control of dumping at sea, in line with updated international obligations of the State as set out in the 1992 OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic. The Act bans incineration at sea and the dumping of any radioactive substance or material or any toxic, harmful or noxious substances. It also extended the limit of Irish jurisdiction regarding dumping at sea, from 12 nautical miles offshore up to 200 nautical miles and beyond that to coincide with the continental shelf of the State.</P>
    <P>The Act enables the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to grant permits for certain dumping, as specified in the permits and subject to such conditions as the Minister may specify in them. It also empowers the courts to impose such monetary penalty and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, as they may decide, on conviction on indictment of any person for illegal dumping as defined by the Act. So far, those essential penal provisions have deterred illegal dumping at sea.</P>
    <P>All applications for dumping at sea permits are carefully considered by my Department with the assistance of specialist advisers who form the marine licence vetting committee, which meets as <Col N="1537" /> frequently as business demands. Detailed guidelines have been published by my Department to assist applicants and copies of those guidelines are available in the Oireachtas Library. Those guidelines will be updated as soon as this Bill is enacted and will be published on the Department's website together with a consolidated text of the 1996 Act as amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Applicants are obliged to consider thoroughly all non-dumping at sea options and, in particular, other beneficial uses such as beach nourishment and land reclamation. Non-dumping solutions have been successfully pursued in a number of cases already and more will be pursued in the context of the five year dredging and dumping plans being prepared by the ports I mentioned. Scientific advice governs what material may be dredged and dumped at sea and where exactly dredged material may be dumped.</P>
    <P>Dumping is not allowed where fisheries or important resources or natural heritage or archaeological heritage would be damaged. Dump sites are monitored before and after dumping takes place, as the Department requires, to ensure that any dumping is properly carried out. Permission has been refused, and will continue to be refused, for the dumping at sea of any harmful materials found on the seabed of any port or harbour. Non-dumping at sea treatment is and will be insisted upon in such cases in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>It is not policy to permit the dumping of ships or aircraft at sea. Such dumping could have an adverse impact on the marine environment not to mention the obvious navigational safety considerations. According to the 1992 OSPAR Convention and as provided for in the Second Schedule to the 1996 Act, the dumping of ships or aircraft will be formally banned from 31 December 2004 at the latest. The dumping of offshore installations could only be permitted under the Act if both Houses of the Oireachtas were to approve the making of a Government order for that purpose under section 5(13) of the 1996 Act. I have no proposals for any such order. Indeed, as a contracting party to the 1992 OSPAR Convention, Ireland has been proactive in ensuring that other contracting parties address seriously the dumping at sea of chemical weapons and munitions.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also sought to ensure that radioactive discharges into the sea from the nuclear reprocessing at the Sellafield and other nuclear reprocessing plants is addressed also. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and the Attorney General are spearheading Ireland's legal actions against the MOX fuel fabrication plant at Sellafield. A special OSPAR expert group has begun work to develop within three years procedures for the proper management of the risk associated with dumped chemical weapons and munitions.</P>
    <P>I wish to signal to the House that I will propose a number of amendments to the Bill on Commit<Col N="1538" /> tee Stage. The amendments will be required to reflect changes in the titles and functions of relevant Ministers since the Bill was passed by the Seanad in 2000. Amendments to the Bill are also needed to give effect to a number of policies which have been developed in the interim. Biodiversity within and between species and ecosystems must be protected to reflect the Government-approved national biodiversity plan which was published in 2002. There must be an end to any exemption in the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 from the prohibition on the disposal at sea of fish waste from industrial fish processing operations to bring the Act into line with Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 and SI 248 of 2003.</P>
    <P>Penalties must be increased for summary offences generally under the 1996 Act and provision must be made to include the hirers of vessels involved in offences under that Act among the persons chargeable with such offences to enhance deterrence against illegal disposals at sea and to provide flexibility, via ministerial regulations which either House of the Oireachtas could annul if it saw fit, for charging appropriate fees for dumping at sea permit applications by reference to different kinds of permits and circumstances to better reflect the costs of processing such applications. Charging provisions on those lines for other fees were included on 13 May 2003 on Committee Stage of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2002 which became law on 1 July 2003 on its signature by the President.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for the text of the proposed amendments to be tabled immediately after Second Stage of the Bill is agreed and for explanatory notes to be supplied to the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many Ministers, including Deputy Fahey and Hugh Byrne, and it is very disappointing to have to wait this long to see legislation come before the House. I acknowledge the fact that a great deal of work has gone into this legislation which will prevent much of the dumping and pollution that continues to go on. I understand this Bill to be an amendment to the 1996 legislation introduced by the previous Ministers with responsibility for this portfolio. The 1996 Act went a long way toward bringing our laws on dumping at sea into the 20th century and into line with the OSPAR Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> We have all heard appalling stories of unauthorised dumping at sea. A great deal of dumping takes place about which we know nothing which is why I welcome the provisions to extend the limits from 12 miles to 350 miles. I am pleased to see that people will now have to obtain a licence to dump at sea. Polluting and dumping at sea include the reckless abandonment of vessels along our coastline. The dumping of boats and helicopters to lie on our sea bed as described by the Minister of State is absolutely terrible. They may pollute now or later. It is great to hear that all this will be cleaned up and that any shipping accident which results in a sinking will not mean a vessel will be left at the bottom of the sea like the <i>Titanic.</i> Vessels have been abandoned after major accidents especially where there have been tragedies.</P>
    <P>I am aware of vessels which represent eyesores and which still threaten to pollute. The Minister of State will be well aware of the large vessel at Salt Mills, Wexford, which it is absolutely terrible to see in such a beautiful place. Although that vessel is only by a river, such wrecks are also abandoned along our coastline. I would like to see that eyesore removed though I realise it might cost a great deal of money. I see many ships which are of no use to anybody being pulled in and left along the Wexford coast to rust for many years. It is deplorable to see this practice given the beautiful, scenic coast right around the island of Ireland. One often sees large cranes and ships in old ports where dredging was once carried out. I hope the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2000 will see an end to these things.</P>
    <P>I do not remember any very serious oil spillages in Ireland, but one need only look at France and Spain to see what can happen. While we have had spillages one might view as serious, other countries have had spillages wash up on their shores which have taken months and years to clean up. Ireland has many beautiful beaches, especially in my own county, Wexford, the coastline of which is absolutely lovely. It would be terrible to see a major oil spillage destroying the fish in the sea and ruining our beaches. While one often seas oil washing up on our strands, we have been very lucky that no major catastrophe has occurred which would take a long time to clean up. We depend totally on our coastline and from Killybegs in Donegal to Kerry, Cork and Wexford fishing is of great importance to our economy as the Minister of State will be aware. Any incident of major pollution would be a great disaster.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Act as amended by this Bill will ensure the control and curtailment of pollution. While no one can legislate for the major accidents which may happen at sea, it is important to enact legislation to deal with any problems that occur. To be in a position to act immediately, it is important that rules and regulations are in place to address any major accident that happens off our coast. As the Minister of State has said, the <Col N="1540" /> Bill before us will copperfasten existing legislation while safeguarding our coastal communities, harbours and coastlines. I would like to see the Minister of State investing more money in harbour boards like the one in New Ross which, like others, has done great work with little in the way of resources. Will the Minister have direct control of harbour boards following enactment of the Bill? I am concerned that all harbour boards are given financial assistance.</P>
    <P>A concern of mine and I am sure of many Members is the plant at Sellafield. People living on the coastline from County Louth to the south-east are concerned about the plant polluting the sea and there are many questions to be asked about it. I am aware that the Minister, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Attorney General are trying to get some answers from the authorities at Sellafield. On a recent visit I was frightened to see what went in and out. If an accident happened, because of the closeness of our coastline, we would be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask a number of serious questions of the authorities at Sellafield. We can ask questions but they will always give a political answer. They will only give an answer that suits them but will never give an honest answer. I believe an accident is waiting to happen, something about which the public is very concerned. In particular, families with children are concerned about their health and the health of marine life in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I am aware that every Member of the House is of the same view as myself. I would like to see the plant close down because it would make people happier and more content. It would also make a major difference in terms of the well-being or our people, the quality of our seas and the air. That aspect is of the major concern, and my party is fully committed to dealing with it. I favour the closure of the plant and hope this comes about as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Any pollution caused by radioactive substances in the sea is of great concern to the community, particularly those on the east coast. I come from a county which has a coastline with many holiday homes. The Minister is aware of the number that have been built in County Wexford in recent years.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister of State. I am concerned about sewage being released onto our lovely coastline. I frequently call on the Government to put money into sewerage systems to ensure we clean up our act. I realise they cost a good deal of money but do not want to see any sludge being released into the beautiful seas around Ireland. Deputy Broughan may not be too happy when I say Dubliners come down to our lovely coastline in County Wexford to live&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In my county there is a need for a good deal of money to be spent on sewage treatment plants, with which the Minister will agree. Like other Deputies and I, he is constantly fighting against raw sewage filtering into the bays and causing pollution. I ask him to ensure money is spent on treatment plants, particularly in coastal towns. We all know the importance of marine life and our beaches. It is important that the legislation recognises what has to be done in this area.</P>
      <P>Those seeking a licence to dump at sea should be made advertise in the local and national newspapers. It is important that the Minister and his Department determine what is happening in this area because illegal dumping is a major problem which I am concerned will get out of control. I have made representations to my local county council on whether illegal dumping is being carried out, and presume every Deputy in the House has done the same. It takes a long time for the problem to be sorted out in terms of the legalities. It is important that the Minister ensures illegal dumping at sea is not being carried out and that people have licences. I read in the Bill that if they are caught breaking the law, they will be reprimanded. They have to be reprimanded because if they are penalised on the first occasion, not many others will break the law subsequently. If they advertise in local and national papers, it will give others an opportunity to object, as is the case with planning permission. The sea is part of our lives. We are surrounded by water which people do not want to see being polluted. This provision will give them an opportunity to object if that is happening. It is a sensible way to carry out our business.</P>
      <P>I intend to table some amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. Dredging works are an important part of the Bill. Dredging work has to be carried out and will be carried out in the future. I presume much more would be carried out if funding was available but we should ensure other material is not dumped at sea when such work takes place.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of the Bill is that it will protect our waterways, fisheries and beaches. I welcome it for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2000. I find it astonishing that it has taken three and a half years for the Bill which was discussed in the Seanad over three years ago &ndash; the Minister referred to amend<Col N="1542" /> ments, of which people were notified at that stage &ndash; to get into this Chamber. I asked about it on a number of instances because it was scheduled to be taken in the House on nine or ten occasions since the Government came to power. It is extraordinary that it took so long. It was tabled for some of the famous Friday sessions which most Fianna Fáil Members missed until they were caught out by a vote in the House.</P>
      <P>On a serious note, the lethargy the Minister of State and his senior Minister have shown in bringing the Bill before the House to amend the 1996 Act is an indication of the lack of importance given to all things marine. The Government even tried to exorcise the title &ldquo;Marine&rdquo; from the Department's title, and the length of time the Bill has taken to come before the House illustrates the problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill hopes to strengthen the 1996 Act. I thank the Minister for the kind comments he made about my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, who steered the original Bill through the House. The 1996 Bill was a response to a horrendous history of abuse of the seas off our coastline. In the earlier debate in 2000 many referred to the dumping of munitions off the northern coast in the Beaufort Dyke which for decades was used by the British Government to dump all kinds of deadly old munitions. During the years we have also had to contend with thousands of tonnes of radioactive material being dumped in the Irish Sea from the plant at Sellafield &ndash; the old Windscale facility. The attempts in the 1996 Act to ban incineration and toxic and harmful materials being dumped within 200 miles of our coast were important.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister what sanctions or fines had been applied to those who had allegedly behaved badly in the management of fish farms. It appeared from his answer that none had been applied. He said he would give me an answer on the issue but it seems there was a regime where anything went and where the sea was vast enough to take any kind of abuse and toxic materials. Importantly, the 1996 Act sought to bring to an end this myth once and for all. We live in a fragile ecosystem, of which the sea is the major part.</P>
      <P>I welcome the key elements of this short Bill which seeks to extend the 1996 Act, especially the definition of the word &ldquo;harbours&rdquo; to include local authority, Iarnród Éireann and other incorporated harbours. I also welcome the inclusion of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands among the Ministers who must be consulted in relation to licences for dumping as well as the process which the Minister has sought to initiate whereby third parties can have their comments and ideas considered in the context the 1996 Act and, I hope, the 2003 legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having perused the Bill, there are a number of issues to which I hope to return on Committee Stage, or ask the Minister to consider. I refer to section 3 which deals with notices in newspapers. I believe the Minister said there were 14 such licences in the last year or so and 20 in the previous year. They should be advertised nationally <Col N="1543" /> because often they affect a significant part of our coastline.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsection (3) of the new section 5A, 21 days is a short period of time within which a third party is allowed to submit comments on an application for a licence. I would find it difficult. I engaged in a similar exercise today in relation to general planning legislation where one has 35 days to submit a submission or an objection to perhaps a huge development deeply affecting one's constituency. I ask the Minister to extend the timeframe to at least 42 days.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister sending comments from an objector or a person who has made a submission to the individual who has applied for a licence, the timeframe is vague in that subsection (5) states, &ldquo;the Minister shall as soon as may be&rdquo;. Subsection (6)(<i>b</i>) reads, where &ldquo;the Minister is satisfied sufficient time has elapsed since a copy of the submission&rdquo;. This should be specified more clearly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister said he would proceed with the amendments promised in 2000. A number of those amendments refer to the fees which can be charged. The exclusion of those who hire vessels was a huge omission from the Bill which was intended to improve the 1996 Act. I welcome the reference to issue of biodiversity.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that aquaculture and fish waste were excluded from the 1996 Act. This exclusion will end under this Bill. I am not clear but believe the Minister will still have the power &ndash; certainly, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has &ndash; to severely punish those who have dumped on land and in our bays in a cavalier fashion as charged by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. I welcome the fact that the Minister will bring forward those issues and strengthen the Bill in that regard.</P>
    <P>The history of the Department and the management of our marine resources show that we have an important responsibility for the seas around our coast. It has been well said we could have made a stronger and more determined case on the Sellafield problem had we had in force a much stricter regime for the management of our coastal areas, the Irish Sea, adjoining seas and the Atlantic. The fact we did not have such a regime and did not seem to care too much about what was dumped in the Beaufort Dyke, off Sellafield or anywhere else by the British and other dumpers during the decades has considerably weakened our case.</P>
    <P>The famous report, The Ocean: Our Future, by the Independent World Commission on the Oceans, chaired by Mario Soares of Portugal, highlighted the fragility of the ecosystem on our blue planet. It also showed that there was a huge responsibility on each island nation, such as ours, to take care, in every respect, of the adjoining seas. The commission said oceans could no longer be considered in isolation from land areas. That is true of our country because of sewage and other pollutants which have been allowed to run off <Col N="1544" /> into streams and rivers and, ultimately, to pollute the seas.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is deplorable, despite the fact that the Government has been in office for six and a half years, we have not seen the coastal zone management Bill about which one of our Green Party colleagues has asked month after month. During the last Dáil Deputy Sargent was promised that it would be published in the next term but we are still waiting. It is listed for publication in 2004 on the Chief Whip's current list of legislation. Why do we have to wait seven years, given that when my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, was Minister of State, the next step following the passage of the Dumping at Sea Act was the introduction of the coastal zone management Bill? </P>
    <P>One of the most deplorable actions in the recent history of the Government relates to the management of Bantry Bay to which Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred. Some 70% of the people living there, certainly on the Beara Peninsula, depend on fishing and the sea directly for their income. It was extraordinary that the community in south-west Cork, the constituency of my party colleague, Senator McCarthy, got together and drew up the Bantry Bay charter and set in train a management system for the bay and began to develop what I thought was an important process for that part of our coastline. About six or nine months ago resources were needed by the Department and the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, but the carpet was pulled from under that group and the Bantry Bay charter, effectively, no longer exists.

      <P>In an interview with <i>The Sunday Times</i> last weekend, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developers are tying up potential land by buying long-term options on its future purchase. The Government believes it is essential <Col N="1545" /> to maintain a steady supply of new housing to help control increasing property prices.</P>
    <P>The article went on to state, &ldquo;A package of measures to tackle land speculation is expected to follow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is not the first time the Taoiseach has identified development land speculation, land hoarding, land option-buying and the price of building sites generally as being central to the continuing rise in house prices. Earlier this year he asked the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to &ldquo;look as a matter of urgency at the cost of building land and to assess the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land&rdquo;. That quotation is from the Taoiseach's speech to the ICTU conference on 4 July 2003. Speaking to reporters following the conference the Taoiseach was even more explicit. He said:</P>
    <P>The whole initiative is based on the fact that what makes houses so dear is the land value. By being able to have the land value at an affordable rate, it then allows the local authority, or whatever agency handles it, to control what the price of houses is.</P>
    <P>On 6 April he told RTE that failure to tackle the rising cost of housing now would lead to future problems for the next generation. He said:</P>
    <P>To try and make progress in this area we have to try and deal with it in the area of land. Developers not only have their land banks, but now have land options for the future, land options that will lead to enormously costly land into the future that will make sure that housing continues to be so costly.</P>
    <P>In February, in the Dáil, speaking on housing, the Taoiseach stated that we could do much more in this area but that the debate always came back to the same issue &ndash; land.</P>
    <P>The key issue of development land and its relationship to housing affordability, which the Labour Party Bill seeks to address this evening, is one on which the leader of the Government agrees with the Labour Party. The Bill before the House is a legislative measure for which the Taoiseach has repeatedly made the case since the beginning of this year. No interpretation can be put on the Taoiseach's statements other than that it is his clear wish that the price of building land should be capped and that this is the central measure required to make housing affordable again for working families.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach believes in the statements which he himself has made over the past nine months he will see to it that the Government agrees to the Second Reading of this Bill. I acknowledge that there may be points of difference on detail, but these can be addressed if the Bill is allowed through Second Stage and referred to Committee. The general purpose and principle of this Bill is to cap the price of building land and <Col N="1546" /> to end land speculation with a view to making housing affordable. These are the very objectives for which the Taoiseach has repeatedly called since last Christmas.</P>
    <P>It has of course taken the Taoiseach six years to reach the conclusion that profiteering and speculation in building land is at the heart of the housing crisis. The report of the Labour Party commission on housing, Housing &ndash; A New Approach, published in April 1999, stated:</P>
    <P>A factor of central importance is the price of building land. Builders, planners and estate agents all agree that it is a major determinant of the rise in house prices. For example, the Irish Home Builders Association has estimated that average site prices in Dublin have risen by 200% since 1955 and in 1998 accounted for 36% of the average house price compared to 21% in 1995. Recent land sales indicate that in the future the proportion taken up by the price of land could be even higher.</P>
    <P>This summer, a report published by construction economist, Mr. Jerome Casey, demonstrated that the proportion of the price of a house, which is accounted for by the cost of the site had risen from about 15% in the early 1990s to between 40% and 50% now, confirming the trend which the Labour Party first pointed out four and a half years ago.</P>
    <P>Mr. Casey's report in <i>The Building Industry Bulletin,</i> July 2003, entitled &ldquo;An Analysis of Economic and Marketing Influences on the Construction Industry&rdquo;, stated:</P>
    <P>Prior to the boom, land costs represented 10% to 15% of Irish house prices. Typically in the mid 1990s, Durkan Brothers sold apartments off O'Connell Street for £35,000 to £40,000 for which the site cost was £5,000. Currently, both the Irish Council for Social Housing and private house builders are reporting city house site costs at up to 50% of the house price. Outside the cities, site costs can represent up to 40% of the house price. For the country as a whole, site costs may now constitute 42.5% of the house price, an increase of almost 30 percentage points on the pre-boom position.</P>
    <P>Mr. Casey went on to point out that in other EU countries, land costs of 10% to 15% would be considered normal, citing Denmark, Portugal and Holland as examples. He stated that:</P>
    <P>There was a total transfer of &euro;6.6 billion in the new and second hand housing markets last year, as a result of having land costs which were thirty percentage points above their long run average.</P>
    <P>He continued to state that the main losers were those outside the housing market but attempting to gain entry, such as first-time buyers. Mr. Casey's conclusion means that up to eight years <Col N="1547" /> in the life of a normal 25 year mortgage now goes to pay for the excess in the price of the site.</P>
    <P>Mr. Casey's assessment is consistent with the information published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The <i>Housing Statistics Bulletin,</i> which is published quarterly by the Department, compares indices for private new house prices, consumer prices, the average earnings of adult workers and house building costs. Throughout the first half of the 1990s all four indices were virtually identical. Based on a 1991 index of 100, in the respective 1995 indices private new house prices stood at 116, average earnings of adult workers stood at 116, house building costs stood at 114 and the CPI stood at 111.</P>
    <P>By 2002, all four indices had widened somewhat, but consumer prices, average earnings and house building costs remained reasonably in touch. CPI stood at 139, average earnings stood at 163, house building costs at 170, however, the price of houses index had shot up to 296. This was 126 points more than the house building cost index.</P>
    <P>One word explains such a dramatic change between house prices and the cost of building them &ndash; land. As the Taoiseach stated in February, this debate always comes back to the same issue &ndash; land. The Assistant Director General of the Central Bank, Dr. Michael Casey, also drew attention last week to the part played by increased site costs in the escalating cost of housing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach clearly knows the problem which is making housing unaffordable for working families. To date, however, the only action he has taken has been to refer the whole issue to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, presumably because he considers it may be necessary to amend the Constitution before legislating to control the price of building land.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party does not agree that a constitutional change is necessary. In our submission to the all-party committee we stated:</P>
    <P>The Constitution has acquired a reputation for paying undue deference to property and the rights of property owners. We believe this reputation is largely undeserved and has in fact been relied upon, as an excuse for doing nothing, by those who are by and large satisfied with the status quo in terms of legislative intervention for the regulation of property and the enjoyment of property rights.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party submission went on to examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted existing Articles 40 and 43 and why legislation to regulate by the principles of social justice and the price of building land would be consistent with that interpretation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> The availability of land at a reasonable price for housing, especially in the main urban centres, has been a deep cause of concern for almost three decades. In the early 1970s, this concern resulted in the establishment of the Committee on the Price of Building Land under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny. That committee was asked to consider, in the interests of the common good, possible measures for controlling the price of land required for housing and other development. It was also asked to ensure that some, or all, of the increases in the value of development that was attributable to the decisions or operations of public bodies could be secured for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>The main objective was to find a way to stabilise or reduce the price of building land and to ensure that the community acquired on fair terms the betterment element which arises from works carried out by local authorities. The committee reported to the then Government in 1973. The main proposal was that local authorities should be enabled to acquire potential development land designated by the High Court at existing use value, plus 25%. Objections were inevitably raised to this proposal. In particular, it was argued that it was an unjust attack on property rights and was, therefore, contrary to the Constitution. This view was far from universal, however, on the grounds that the rights of property owners must be regulated by the principles of social justice and the common good, also set out in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Building Land) Bill, 1980, was introduced into the Dáil by Deputy Ruairí Quinn. It was defeated on Second Stage on 11 June 1980 by 15 votes to 59. The purpose of the Bill was to enable local authorities to designate land required for development and to enable them to acquire land at existing use value within five years of such designation, along the lines recommended by Kenny. Since the defeat of that Bill, no further action has been attempted.</P>
    <P>Our advice is that any constitutional challenge to legislation along the lines proposed by Kenny would fail. In the present circumstances, in particular, where we face a severe housing shortage, social justice and the common good must surely dictate that land owners should not accrue huge gains purely as a result of land rezoning or planning permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Such planning permission always carries the responsibility to provide services, yet land owners only make a relatively limited contribution to this. Every opinion which the all-party committee received on this question is, however, of necessity speculative. The only way of finding out whether such proposals will survive constitutional scrutiny is to incorporate them into legis<Col N="1549" /> lation and await the outcome of constitutional challenge. If the legislation falls, then at least we will have a clearer view why it fell and the nature and extent of the amendments to the Constitution required in order to adequately restore it.</P>
      <P>Our central proposal, therefore, is that legislation should provide that land being compulsorily acquired by local authorities for development purposes should be capped at existing use value, plus a reasonable addition. Time, however, has moved on since the publication of the Kenny report. First, constitutional jurisprudence no longer seems to require that the delimiting of property in the manner envisaged by that committee is an exercise that could be undertaken only by the High Court. Legislative interference in property rights occurs every day of the week, without direct High Court involvement. One could instance restrictions on the use of gaming machines, limitations on land use so as to protect national monuments, the regulation and control of banking, residential property tax, the super-levy on milk production and restrictions on casual trading. All of these were the subject of unsuccessful challenges to their constitutionality, yet none involved the direct participation of the courts, as Mr. Justice Kenny considered necessary.</P>
      <P>Second, the Kenny report did not state its main proposal as being that a local authority should have power to acquire land anywhere at a price below its market price but rather that a court should authorise a form of price control in designated areas. If one has to justify compulsory acquisition at current use value by reference to the principles of social justice and the exigencies of the common good, then surely it is the purpose for which the land is acquired that is of importance rather than its location.</P>
      <P>We consider it not to be constitutionally necessary as well as unduly cumbersome and restrictive, the idea that acquisition at current use value should be available only within specifically designated areas of a local authority's functional area and that such designation should be undertaken by the courts. This entitlement should be enjoyed by local authorities in any circumstance where they have powers of compulsory acquisition in respect of land needed for the performance of statutory functions and which is not being exploited by its current owner to its full development potential.</P>
      <P>There is no reason in any such case the portion of the open market price of that land attributable to local authority works and/or economic and social forces such as planning schemes and the like should, as a matter of constitutional or any other principle, be held to belong exclusively to the land owner and to be immune from restriction or regulation under Article 43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that since 1963 planning authorities have had general powers to <Col N="1550" /> develop or secure the development of land. In particular, under section 212 (1) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, a planning authority has powers, <i>inter alia,</i> to:</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) Provide, secure or facilitate the provision of areas of convenient shape and size for development; and</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) secure, facilitate or carry out the development and renewal of areas in need of physical, social or economic regeneration and provide open spaces and other public amenities.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (2) of that section:</P>
    <P>A planning authority may provide or arrange for the provision of:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) sites for the establishment or relocation of industries, businesses, houses, offices, shops, schools, churches, leisure facilities and other community facilities.</P>
    <P>Further, it reads:</P>
    <P>. may maintain and manage any such site, building, premises, house, park, structure or service and may make any charges which it considers reasonable in relation to the provision, maintenance or management thereof.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) enables a planning authority to:</P>
    <P>Make and carry out arrangements or enter into agreements with any person or body for the development or management of land, and to incorporate a company for those purposes.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) makes it clear that:</P>
    <P>A planning authority may use any of its powers in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land, in relation to these functions, and, in particular, in order to facilitate the assembly of sites for the purposes of the orderly development of land.</P>
    <P>Section 213 of the Act provides, more generally, that:</P>
    <P>A local authority may, for the purposes of performing any of its functions (whether conferred by or under this Act, or any other enactment passed before or after the passing of this Act), including giving effect to or facilitating the implementation of its development plan or its housing strategy under section 94, do all or any of the following:</P>
    <P>(i) acquire land, permanently or temporarily, by agreement or compulsorily.</P>
    <P>Section 94, of the Planning and Development Act which deals with housing strategies provides that each planning authority must include in its development plan a strategy for the purpose of ensuring that the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the development plan provides for the housing of the existing and future population of the area in the manner set out in <Col N="1551" /> the strategy. This strategy encompasses both private and public housing provision.</P>
    <P>In summary, there is no shortage of enabling provisions to equip local authorities to take a proactive role in the planning and development of their areas, including the acquisition and development of land banks, either by themselves or in partnership with commercial developers, and in accordance with the provisions of a coherent overall plan rather than by considering planning applications submitted on a piecemeal basis. The only restraining factor is cost. Local authorities cannot afford to acquire land compulsorily on such a scale and for such a purpose at the current inflated and excessive price of building land. The Bill proposes to amend the rules for the assessment of compensation in cases where local authorities are compulsorily acquiring development land in order to enable the performance by them of statutory functions. The purpose would be to equip local authorities to undertake a programme of acquiring undeveloped land at present in private hands. The land could subsequently be either built on by the authority itself or zoned, serviced and sold on, with a view to ensuring that a constant supply of such land is available for local authority housing, voluntary and co-operative housing and private development purposes within the framework of a coherent and detailed plan for the area in question.</P>
    <P>If effect was given to the Kenny report, local authorities would be entitled to acquire development land compulsorily at its current use value, plus 25%. This requires stripping out from the present compensation assessment rules, references to potential for or restrictions on, future development; current use value would be the governing criterion. It also requires however, special provision to be made in respect of development land that was acquired before the publication of the legislation so as to avoid an attack based on the claim that the legislation was expropriatory in nature and so unconstitutional due to a failure to provide compensation at least equivalent to expenditure actually incurred, plus a reasonable return on investment.</P>
    <P>Our view in this regard is based on the fact that the courts lean against legislation affecting property rights with retrospective effect. The courts also lean in favour of the view that compensation should be provided in all cases where its provision is not inconsistent with social justice or the requirements of the common good and is clearly practicable. The intention, therefore, should be to cap the landowner's return on his or her investment rather than abolish it.</P>
    <P>Where a person had acquired land before the publication date of this Bill, 4 October 2003, then compensation for its compulsory acquisition would be assessed first by reference to the cost of acquisition, including the cost of any loan entered <Col N="1552" /> into for the purpose, if that land was acquired by the claimant through a bargain at arm's length.</P>
    <P>Where land was acquired otherwise than by way of an arm's length transaction, that is by inheritance or a gift, the cost would be the amount which would be assessed by an arbitrator applying the rules in force prior to the passing of this Act as the open market value of the land on the date of its acquisition by the claimant. To the cost of acquisition would be added the amount, if any, assessable in respect of the cost of improvements carried out, other than work consisting only of maintenance, repairing, painting and decorating, which have added to the value of the land. Finally, an amount would be added to represent a reasonable return on investment in the land. This might, for example, be calculated as if an amount representing the cost of acquisition and of improvements had been instead invested in securities yielding an annual rate of return 2% higher than Government stock. This total figure would in no circumstances exceed the open market value of the property. In other words, compulsory purchase rules would not produce a rate of compensation greater than what the market would provide.</P>
    <P>There is of course nothing cast iron about the figure of 25%, or of 2% over Government stock as a rate of return on investment. Kenny picked 25% simply as offering a &ldquo;reasonable compromise&rdquo; between the rights of the community and those of landowners. Other figures may be suggested. It may also be argued that the circumstances of particular cases would require a greater degree of flexibility. If the principle in this Bill is accepted by the House, the specific terms could be developed on Committee Stage. This Bill will end the ongoing speculation and option-taking in building land and over time reduce the rate of increase in house prices and make housing more affordable. It will also ensure that building land which is zoned and serviced is released for development.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there are 5,580 acres of zoned serviced land, capable of yielding over 100,000 dwellings. Much of this land is held by a small number of property owners. Jerome Casey in his July 2003 report to which I have referred, has conducted the only study of ownership of development land in Dublin and he concludes that over half of the development land in Fingal is currently controlled by 25 individuals or organisations.</P>
    <P>The slow release of building land, particularly in Dublin, was identified as far back as the first Bacon report in 1998. Following that report, the Government reduced capital gains tax on residential development land from 40% to 20% with the proviso that the CGT would rise to 60% after four years. The incentive for landowners to develop was obvious and would probably have succeeded in greatly increasing housing supply in <Col N="1553" /> Dublin, had the same Government not abolished the 60% CGT within two years of its introduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In his interview published in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday, the Taoiseach hinted that the 60% may be re-introduced. It should never have been abolished in the first place, and the Labour Party calls for its re-introduction.</P>
      <P>The prospect of CGT being increased from 20% to 60% if land is not released, coupled with the revised compulsory purchase regime proposed in this Bill, would ensure that housing land, especially in the urban areas where demand is greatest, is brought to construction. It is madness that in areas such as Dublin where house prices are highest, large tracts of zoned and serviced building land are lying idle while Dublin builders are constructing new commuter towns 30 and 40 miles out and home buyers are forced out of their own city to buy a house.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be considered in conjunction with other proposals on housing policy which have been made by the Labour Party. We have proposed a system of fair price certification for new houses and the establishment of a housing market regulator. Fair price certification will be necessary to prevent the benefits of the cap on land prices being transferred to builders and to ensure that the ultimate benefit will accrue to the house buyer. We have also proposed the establishment of a national housing authority which would encompass the existing National Building Agency and the Housing Finance Agency. This authority would provide the professional and managerial support needed by local authorities to operate the new system and would be the agency for the provision of funding.</P>
      <P>Unless we put a stop to speculation and profiteering in building land, we will not be able to make housing affordable and, as the Taoiseach said on 6 April, &ldquo;Failure to tackle the rising cost of housing now will lead to future problems for the next generation.&rdquo; It will also lead to huge problems for the economy and the public finances. <i>The Sunday Times</i> article reported that the Taoiseach said the Government had spent &ldquo;an awful lot of time&rdquo; since 1997 examining the housing market. It is to be noted that in the six years since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came to Government, the average price of a new house increased nationally by 125%. That is over five times the rate of inflation, over four times the increase in average earnings and three times the increase in the cost of building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in Dublin is even more dramatic. In 1996, the last year before Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came to power, the average price of a new house in Dublin was &euro;97,058. <Col N="1554" /> Last year the average price of a new house in Dublin was &euro;297,424. That is an increase of 206% or a trebling in the price of houses, nine times the rate of inflation, five times the increase in average earnings and four times the increase in the cost of building.</P>
    <P>Who can now afford to buy the average priced new house in Dublin? The maximum loans provided by lending agencies amount to three times the combined household income, subject to a maximum of 92% of the house price &ndash; 92% of &euro;297,424 is &euro;273,630 and that is three times &euro;91,210, well in excess of a TD's salary. That is the combined income a couple would now need from their own resources to buy the average priced new house in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Noel Ahern, may well shrug and respond, as he has done previously, &ldquo;Sure a lot of them are managing to buy, somehow&rdquo;. It is true that some are. With interest rates low many new house buyers are over-borrowing and will come to grief if interest rates rise significantly. Some are receiving financial help from parents. Many parents are remortgaging the family home or committing pension lump sums to provide house deposits for their children. In many cases, young families are buying way out into the commuter belt adding pressure to themselves and to traffic congestion. It is the high cost of housing in our cities which is fuelling the demand for one-off housing sites in the countryside. We no longer need to rely on anecdotal evidence concerning families who can no longer afford to buy a house from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the first time a means of estimating the number of families who have been priced out of the housing market. Under the Act each local authority is required to draw up a housing strategy which estimates the number of newly forming households who cannot afford to buy a house from their own resources.</P>
    <P>In mid-2002, Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold came together and produced an analysis of housing strategies. From an examination of the housing strategies, they concluded:</P>
    <P>It is projected that 33% of new households will not be able to afford to become house owners, based on calculations prescribed under Part V. That figure rises to 42% in urban areas.</P>
    <P>It is almost 50% on average across the four Dublin local authorities, it is 55% in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, will no doubt be aware that the highest rate, at 65%, is in his city of Waterford. It should come as no surprise that as house prices soared increasing numbers of families were unable to buy and would have to turn to the State for assistance in <Col N="1555" /> meeting their housing needs. What are the implications for the public finances if one in every three families nationally and one in every two in Dublin will require some form of housing assistance from the State?</P>
    <P>Last year, the Department of the Environment and Local Government spent &euro;1,126,993 on local authority and social housing programmes and for that they produced 4,403 local authority houses and 1,360 from the voluntary and community sector, a total of 5,763, but how much more will need to be spent to meet the needs of the 60,000 applicants who are already on local authority housing lists, plus the additional 10,000 applicants who are now joining these lists each year? Many local authority housing applicants are in private rented accommodation for which they receive a rent allowance from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. This now amounts to approximately &euro;300 million per annum and will grow as families have to wait longer for council housing and even more families join the list.</P>
    <P>The new affordable housing schemes under which State-owned land is provided free for housing purposes or the local authority buys up to 20% of the sites owned by private developers under Part V of the Planning and Development Act will all cost money. These are the immediate costs to the State of high house prices. We may yet have a demand, as happened in 1992 when interest rates went up, for additional assistance for families who cannot meet their mortgage repayments. There is also the huge personal cost to those who are stuck on council waiting lists, living in overcrowded conditions at home or in poor standard private rented accommodation for which the State may have to pay in the future through increased education, health and social welfare. These are the issues of social justice and the common good on which the Labour Party Bill relies, to delimit the rights of a small number of landowners to profit from development land.</P>
    <P>Since the proposal to limit the price of building land returned to the public agenda, there has been a series of comments to the effect that the State should stay out of the building land market. Even the eminent Dr. Peter Bacon in a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; interview recently, when asked what went wrong with his housing reports, blamed it all on the politicians, although he did not indicate which side of the House he had in mind.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that over the next two evenings some of his thinking will be reflected in the debate. I am interested to note that the IAVI, in its submission to the all-party committee, states that the need for social and affordable housing &ldquo;is best and most fairly met by the public sector drawing funds from the National <Col N="1556" /> Exchequer rather than imposing selective obligations on individual developers and landowners&rdquo;.  It also states that it is the &ldquo;view of the IAVI that any subsidy of housing costs should be borne by the taxpayers at large rather than penalising individual landowners&rdquo;.  However, the IAVI does not say by how much taxes would need to be increased for the State to subsidise the housing needs of one in three new households nationally and one in two in Dublin.</P>
      <P>This country faces some hard choices about housing policy. What is a house for? Is it a place in which to make a home or is it a property in which to invest? This House must make a clear choice in deciding on this Bill. Are we to continue to defend as almost absolute the property rights of a small number of development landowners at the expense of working people who, in increasing numbers, are being denied the right to a secure home at an affordable price? Whose right to property will this House vindicate tomorrow night? Will it be that of the owners of development land to make excess profits or the right of working people to buy and own their own home? I hope the Taoiseach will give meaning to his words and lead his Government to support this Bill for which he has been making an eloquent case.</P>

      <P>I heard a former member of the Fianna Fáil Party declare on the radio this morning that he had left what had been a right wing party because it had dramatically shifted away from its founding ethos. Nowhere is that more clear than in relation to the deal that was done between Fianna Fáil and the builders and owners of private land to ensure that the maximum profits from the development of land and housing around our towns and cities did not go in due proportion to the original owners of the land at a rate of return of 25%, as was stated by Deputy Gilmore and referred to in the original Kenny report, or to the local authority or the other agencies which wanted to provide homes for people, but to the builders and developers who, either by way of option or outright purchase, exercised ownership and control of the land and were in an extraordinarily strong position to influence its rezoning when county development plans were being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak about the experience in Fingal and Dublin west. Last year's census shows that Dublin north and Dublin west, particularly Fingal, have undergone and will undergo in the future extraordinary levels of house building. The land, which is close to the city, is available. There is a clear argument that tens of thousands of people should find homes at reasonable prices in both Dublin west and Dublin north. What has happened in Fingal is that a profit of more than &euro;300 million has been made as a result of land values being held by landowners and developers. <Col N="1557" /> That profit is not subject to any form of taxation. Through the system of options, split ownership, management companies etc. little of it is subject to capital gains tax even at the low rate introduced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This is not a victimless operation. One often sees celebrations taking place at the end of certain council meetings or at the publication of development plans because a lucky landowner or consortium of builders or developers has hit the jackpot. We often read in the newspapers that a profit of &euro;25 million was made. We read the other day in the newspapers that one of the 26 firms mentioned by Deputy Gilmore made a profit of &euro;25 million last year. It is not that people are envious of those who have suddenly won a triple jackpot and a triple lottery at the same time. However, the people have been left behind to pay for this by Fianna Fáil which once sought to represent them.</P>
    <P>I spent the past day and a half at an An Bord Pleanála hearing on the Hansfield strategic development zone which was designated by the Taoiseach approximately a year ago. Under that plan a further 2,000 homes will be built in an area totally suitable for housing development. There is no problem with the principle of developing the land for housing as it is close to a railway line. However, a recent study by the Department of Education and Science shows that the population has grown by 65% in that area compared with an average growth of 17% in Fingal. That is probably the highest rate of growth in western Europe.</P>
    <P>What has happened in relation to the strategic development zones, given that the Taoiseach said they would be accompanied by all necessary infrastructure? Several of the 26 firms mentioned presented a detailed submission to build a further 2,000 homes in an area where 4,000 homes have been built in the past four years and 3,000 are currently being built. The Government promised that all the infrastructural needs would be met. How have they been met? What provision has been made for educational services? Some 4,000 houses have already been built and occupied. One of the builders responsible for most of the building declared a profit this year of &euro;25 million. What schools have been provided? Only one ten-room prefabricated school has been provided for 4,000 houses. The builders said at the An Bord Pleanála hearing that although 4,000 houses had been built, 3,000 were being built and a further 2,000 would be provided in the strategic development zone at Hansfield, there was no need for additional educational provision. The designation of sites on their plots of land in the strategic development zone would cost them the profit on 300 to 500 houses.</P>
    <P>Not only are the young couples who are buying the houses being robbed by paying 42% extra in site costs which are widely inflated, but, as tax<Col N="1558" /> payers, when their children want to go to school they will not be able to because the money will have gone into the pockets of those who grace the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway races. Like the gentleman said this morning on the radio, that would shame those who were involved in founding Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which proposes to amend the basis on which compensation is payable in respect of the acquisition of land by local authorities. Local authorities' rights to acquire land compulsorily are important instruments in facilitating public interest objectives for housing, water, roads and general development. It is essential in the interests of the common good that we ensure the right balance between the rights of property owners and those of public authorities.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was a serious and well-directed intervention in this area. It enables local authorities to acquire up to 20% of zoned housing land at existing use value. It represents a more targeted approach than the proposal before the House, which applies to the compulsory purchase of development land for any purpose by a local authority. Part V contains nine sections and has been supplemented by three sets of ministerial guidelines to assist local authorities in its implementation. In light of this experience, I do not think the Bill before us, comprising just four sections, can seriously deal with the complexity of compensation for compulsory purchase and help local authorities deliver, for example, more affordable housing in a realistic timeframe.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a major departure from the existing rules of compensation for compulsory purchase, under which the basic valuation of land is that of open market value, in favour of a system whereby land valuation would be determined by one of several different mechanisms, depending on the circumstances of each acquisition. It is not at all evident from this short Bill that important legal and practical issues have received the attention they deserve, that there has been the necessary rigorous evaluation of actions and consequences or that it is based on a clearly thought-out strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill would apply in respect of any acquisition of development land required for the purpose of any function of a local authority. However, it must be assumed that the underlying concern is the availability and cost of development land for housing purposes. The fundamental question, therefore, is whether in current circumstances this Bill would be an effective and work<Col N="1559" /> able response to the issue of housing supply. The Government is satisfied that it would not. Accordingly, we oppose not only the Labour Party motion but also the Fine Gael motion seeking to defer Second Stage of the Bill for six months. I have sympathy for the Fine Gael motion, but it would be disingenuous of me, based on my assessment of the Bill, to suggest that it be deferred for six months because that would imply that I would accept it in six months. I would rather be up front about this and not do what some have suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should wait until he hears all I have to say. It will then become clear to him. The Government's strategy on housing is to continue to maximise and accelerate housing supply to match existing demand and stabilise prices so that people who desire to own their own homes will be able to do so. Rapid economic growth, coupled with increases in population and changes in demographics, including increased inward migration, increasing numbers in the household formation age group and decreasing household sizes, has led to unprecedented demand in the housing market. The overall objective of the Government is to continue to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, especially for first-time buyers.</P>
      <P>The House should consider carefully what has been achieved. We have put in place a series of measures that have seen the supply of housing expand every year for the past eight years. In 1997 about 39,000 houses were built, in 2000 about 50,000 were built and in 2002, 58,000 units were built. Ireland is building at the fastest rate in Europe, with 14.7 units completed per 1,000 population in 2002. This compares to about three units per 1,000 in the UK. Record numbers of completions have continued into 2003, with more than 13,700 new houses and apartments built in the first quarter, an increase of 14.5% on the same period last year. Completions this year could reach 60,000 units or even more. These figures are evidence that our housing policies are very effective and we will continue to deliver housing at these rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan estimated that an additional 500,000 new units would be required over ten years from 2000 to 2010 to meet <Col N="1560" /> demand, with some easing thereafter. We have been meeting and exceeding these targets. The Government remains committed to implementing measures to boost the supply of housing and in this way we seek to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases. We are assisting low income groups and those with social housing needs by means of a range of targeted social and affordable housing programmes, delivering high quality housing units nationwide. Last year more than 12,700 units of social and affordable housing were provided, compared to less than 8,700 units in 2000. Local authority housing output was 5,074 units in 2002, while the voluntary housing sector delivered an output of 1,360 units, the highest level ever recorded. About 13,000 units of social and affordable housing will be delivered this year.</P>
    <P>Our target of 2,000 units under the affordable and shared ownership schemes was comfortably exceeded last year and I expect activity to increase further during 2003. Nearly 1,700 houses were sold under the shared ownership scheme in 2002, an increase of 4.6%. I expect a similar level of activity this year. The affordable housing scheme supported 880 households in 2002, a threefold increase on the previous year, and about 1,000 houses will be sold this year. Overall, the total capital funding for housing this year, at &euro;1. 7 billion, is up almost 7% on the amount provided in 2002. At the same time, our policies seek to maintain an adequate balance of investment in the market to ensure a supply of private rented accommodation &ndash; this is particularly important to newly formed households and to an increasingly mobile workforce. The past 12 months or so have seen a welcome change in the supply of rental accommodation, with moderation and even reduction in rents in certain segments of the market. We will be exploring ways of continuing the development of the sector &ndash; for example, under Sustaining Progress the development of PPP arrangements in relation to rental housing will be considered.</P>
    <P>We have been very innovative and proactive in introducing legislation to address the housing needs of all sectors of the community. Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, deals with housing supply and has specific provisions for delivery of social and affordable housing. There is now greater flexibility in concluding effective agreements between planning authorities and developers. Detailed implementation guidelines for these provisions have been issued following consultation with the industry and other major stakeholders. These will be followed up over the next month or so with a series of regional information seminars for local authority staff, builders and so on. Many authorities are actively engaging with developers in Part V pre-planning discussions and negotiations and I look forward to the contribution to overall output from this measure. The Residential Ten<Col N="1561" /> ancies Bill 2003, currently going through the Houses, reforms landlord and tenant legislation. It will ensure that for those who want to rent there is a fair, vibrant and high quality private rented sector that can contribute to the achievement of overall housing policy objectives.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, almost a quarter of a million new houses have been built. New house price inflation was reduced from about 40% to about 8% at the end of 2002. We in Government continue to take new initiatives to improve affordability. In Sustaining Progress we launched a special new affordable housing initiative aimed at people who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but find that they are unable to do so in the current housing market. The Government recognises that the identification of suitable sites is a critical factor in the success of this scheme and in July we approved the immediate release of two sites in Dublin and agreed to proposals relating to two further sites in Meath and Kildare to ensure early delivery of affordable housing under this initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a laugh. It is the greatest red herring of all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The release of these spearhead sites will allow work to begin immediately. This shows the Government's determination to make measurable progress by the time of the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, which will take place in mid-2004. Looking forward, available information clearly shows that the supply of zoned and serviced land coming through the planning system is adequate to meet demand.</P>
      <P>The fourth national inventory of zoned residential serviced land, carried out in June 2002, indicates that there was a more than adequate stock of zoned serviced land available throughout the country for residential development &ndash; more than 30,100 acres nationally, with an estimated yield of 328,000 housing units. Dublin city and county council areas had approximately 5,700 acres of zoned serviced land with a potential yield of 96,700 units, while the mid-east region has 3,000 acres with an estimated yield of about 27,000 units. We now have in place a supply for the next three to four years so even if I were to accept this Bill tonight, it would not make a shred of difference over that time. Deputy Gilmore was absolutely right, the key is to bring enough zoned serviced land onto the market to cater for our needs and to bring the capacity of the building industry up to its maximum potential. We have done that and exceeded it because, as Deputies know, not only the builders who build houses are directly involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because this is a quiet time in the commercial sector, all the developers who would normally be in the commercial sector are involved in the housing market. That is why we have been able to <Col N="1562" /> bring the capacity of the building industry up to phenomenal levels. I have no doubt that in years to come, case studies of housing in this country will be done in universities throughout the world.</P>

She made an interesting analysis of Fingal, including some very serious accusations. I would be delighted if she would give me the information and to see the evidence of land hoarding, abuses by developers, not releasing land, or land being built on elsewhere while there are land banks between built-up areas and other areas. Deputy Burton gave the impression that she has substantial evidence of this happening in Fingal. It is extremely important to me as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to have that evidence presented to me. If Deputy Burton has hard evidence &ndash; rather than making anecdotal comments about this, although I am not saying she is &ndash; I would like to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand Fingal probably better than most. I have carried out assessments on housing and Fingal is probably one of the most dynamic county councils. I invite her most sincerely to <Col N="1563" /> come to see me and to present the evidence on the specific points. If the case is as Deputy Burton claims, it is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Provisional planning permission data for the first six months of 2003 indicate that nearly 34,714 units received planning permission nationally.

There was a larger increase of nearly 32% in Dublin, where 10,260 units received planning permission in the first half of this year alone. Since the summer, planning permission has been granted for the Adamstown SDZ, involving 10,000 units, and for over 2,000 units at the Phoenix Park racecourse. The expansion is phenomenal. The thrust of Deputy Gilmore's Bill is to get more houses to the market on cheaper land. We would all like to do that but I wonder where the builders are who will build it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are at capacity, where will further capacity come from? Where is this land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are all very positive indicators that supply of housing is set to continue at the very high levels maintained over the past eight years. To <Col N="1564" /> summarise, the overall outlook for 2003 is positive from all quarters and supply is increasing to meet predicted levels of demand. The Government remains committed to targeted and effective measures to boost the supply of housing and assist low-income groups and those with social housing needs. We will continue to monitor housing developments and review policies and schemes as necessary to ensure that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are making significant inroads into the housing sector, the Labour Party proposes a radical intervention which, in the view of many, has potential constitutional implications. In fairness, the Deputy acknowledged that they may or may not have. These implications are currently under consideration by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. The committee is examining the two articles of the Constitution relating to private property, to ascertain the extent to which they are serving the good of individuals and the community, and decide whether changes in them would bring about a greater balance between the two.</P>
    <P>The committee had already been asked to consider the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land. In discharging its functions, the committee has received detailed submissions and taken presentations from a wide range of individuals and expert groups, and has engaged legal advice to assist it in developing an agreed position on the various issues involved. The committee is expected to report in early 2004, a matter of a few months away, which is clearly indicated in the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <P>In a submission to the all-party committee, the Labour Party contended that it is not the committee's function to determine State policy in relation to development land, or to offer legal advice as to constitutional restrictions, if any, on the formulation of such policy. Accordingly, it sees no reason why action on issues such as the reform of compulsory acquisition policy should await the final outcome of the committee's deliberations. I do not agree either with the Labour Party's restrictive interpretation of the committee's role, or that it is necessary or prudent to pre-empt the considered conclusions of the committee.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council is currently undertaking a major study on housing and land policy, which is expected to be completed by end of this year. I look forward both to that study and the committee's review. The council is adopting a broad approach to the study, undertaking an initial review of many aspects of housing systems and public policy with a view to highlighting what they perceive to be the key housing issues and policy problems in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>Pending the conclusion of the work being undertaken by the all-party committee, and also <Col N="1565" /> the NESC, the Government is satisfied that it would not be appropriate for the Oireachtas to enact measures for such a significant intervention in the housing and land markets as is proposed. If I am reading it correctly, that is what the Fine Gael Party's motion is saying. This is very serious information that will enlighten everybody in the House, on both the Government and Opposition benches. The information is imminent and we will all have the benefit of it in order to see where both the anecdotal evidence and the facts lie. This is a grey area because we are not absolutely sure but we commissioned these studies to establish the facts. We should do justice both to the NESC report and that of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, both of which will conclude in the next few months. No doubt we will then be back in the House either with further Bills from the Opposition or proposals from the Government. At least, we will have a reasoned debate based on the facts. I hope the NESC report will be extremely enlightening on these matters.</P>
    <P>Is the proposed Bill appropriate, well founded in fact, proportionate and equitable in its likely impact? Is there a clear picture of what is to be achieved, of the extent and consequences of the proposed intervention? Does it clearly demonstrate itself as the best way to achieve our objectives? I believe it does not.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that a measure such as this must be supported by more than anecdotal information or assumptions. It can only be justified on the basis of comprehensive information on the operations of the marketplace, rigorous analysis of the legal and economic issues, clear guidance to relevant public authorities as to implementation, and confidence as to its consequences. These essential elements are not in evidence.</P>
    <P>It would appear from an initial consideration of the Bill that, apart from legitimate concerns regarding the constitutionality of the basic approach, there are specific legal shortcomings. For instance, the Bill proposes three different systems of calculating compensation, depending on the circumstances of the landowners concerned &ndash; whether they acquired the land after 4 October 2003, or before that, either by inheritance or purchase.</P>
    <P>The Bill would appear to discriminate arbitrarily between a landowner who could sell development land at open market prices, and those affected by a particular decision of a local authority to acquire their land at the much lower current use value. Who is to decide which farm we will take? I would like to be sitting at a council meeting deciding that one.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to spell out the principles in accordance with which different local authorities should operate the new compensation provisions. It appears to be at their discretion. Without a proper statement of guiding principles, local authorities could apply the proposed new powers to <Col N="1566" /> different degrees in a way that would undermine the fair operation of the provisions. The Supreme Court has already ruled in the Laurentiu case that the Oireachtas cannot delegate its powers without giving guidelines on how the powers are to be applied. This Bill does not provide such guidelines.</P>
    <P>While not made clear in the Bill, the extent that lands acquired by local authorities could be passed on to some private developers at reduced prices, but not to others, could impact unreasonably on competitiveness within the building industry and again give rise to issues of fairness. As we know, a CPO award incorporates not only the price of land, but compensation for damages caused by disturbance, severance and other injurious effects to retain lands. In practice, these can constitute a significant, even major, part of the overall award. These grounds for compensation are not affected by the Bill so the scope for overall cost reduction is completely overstated by the way it has been presented. Finally, key definitions and concepts are less than clear. For instance, &ldquo;development land&rdquo; could include land attaching to private houses, open land in urban areas etc.</P>
    <P>Consider the practicalities of applying article 3(c), a calculation of notional return on investment, and possibly re-investment, in &ldquo;Government stock&rdquo;, especially over a prolonged period. This could entail so many imponderables and arbitrary assumptions as to be wholly unworkable. There are a number of practical considerations arising from this Bill that also merit attention.</P>
    <P>Underpinning the Bill is an assumption that public authorities intervene in the housing market and either directly deliver or oversee the provision of most large scale housing. At present we are successfully delivering over 60,000 houses a year, through the co-ordination of public authorities, voluntary housing bodies and the private sector. To radically change the system of procuring this major housing output without first ensuring a build-up in local authority capacity, would invoke a high risk of disrupting housing construction programmes in the short-term. Further, if the powers provided for in this Bill were to have any short-term impact, it would be essential that the construction industry, which is already delivering record house completions, has the spare capacity to substantially ramp up its output. There is no evidence to show this. Otherwise we risk increasing construction inflation, which we have now managed to get to reasonable levels.</P>
    <P>As stated, it is the Government's view that house prices are best stabilised by an effective housing market where supply closely matches demand. Considerable progress has been made in this direction. To the extent that further measures are considered necessary to enhance the supply side, the Government is prepared to consider a <Col N="1567" /> taxation-based approach to incentivise the early use of development land and secure a stable supply of land for housing. The development of this kind of initiative will be fully considered in light of the all-party committee and the NESC reports. Indeed, all the other issues that have been pronounced by the Government, which have been picked up on by the Labour Party, will be looked at in light of those two reports because we will have the facts to do it.</P>
    <P>The Government has commissioned research and analysis of ownership control of building land in certain development areas, particularly Dublin, to determine whether current practices are retarding the overall delivery of building land or impeding long-term market stability and to explore the feasibility of possible interventions. All this is being assessed at the moment. This work will be completed shortly and will assist the Government in assessing the need and scope for action on possible land hoarding. That is why I have invited Deputy Burton to give us evidence of this.</P>
    <P>At a time when record housing output is being achieved, we have before us a Bill that proposes a radical intervention by local authorities in the land and housing markets. This not only raises profound constitutional issues, but also gives rise to serious concerns about the practicality and the likelihood of unintended perverse effects on the operation of those markets. It seeks, deliberately in my view, to pre-empt the conclusions of an all-party committee that is specifically examining the constitutional implications of such an intervention. The Government considers this Bill to be premature in its timing and ill-judged as to its specific content. Accordingly, the Government opposes the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF" hpid="Mr. P. Power Mr. P. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing time with me. I compliment Deputy Gilmore and the Labour Party for, at the very least, reducing an argument which has come before the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to legislative form for the purposes of debate. As the specific issue which he has introduced in his Bill was debated and submissions were made at length on this subject, I welcome its introduction at this stage. However, without doubting the bona fides and the intention behind the Bill, I have certain doubts and reservations, the reasons for which I cannot support the Bill in its entirety at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I sit on the all-party constitutional committee looking into this and other issues, which is chaired very well by my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan. It has been working intensively for the past year under the auspices of the House and the Taoiseach's Department. It was requested specifically by the Taoiseach to look into these issues, not just the narrow issue of the capping of land in so far as this relates to CPOs <Col N="1568" /> by local authorities, but the capping and the price of development land generally.</P>
    <P>The committee held public sessions over the summer, which were attended by the Deputy's colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, and by members of all parties. Much time and effort went into the formulation of the committee's methodology and approach and its timing. Invitations went out to all interested parties. Much time was spent scrutinising the submissions that came in. People, including in the Labour Party, were invited to make oral submissions. The committee studied the Kenny report and the implications that arose from that. Advertisements were put in the newspapers and eventually the committee finished its hearings in the middle of September. Today we embarked on the process of evaluating all those and setting out the format of our final report.</P>
    <P>Taking all those factors into account, to submit a Bill to this House which impacts on a small area, albeit an important area, of our work would interfere unreasonably with the work of the committee. It would be premature to the work of the committee and to some extent it would pre-judge its outcome. The Labour Party, through its representative, Deputy O'Sullivan, has an actual input into the committee and is entitled to put forward the proposals that are included in this Bill into the final report. I submit that this proposed Bill will form a welcome part of our deliberations over the next few months, pending the delivery of our report early next year, because there are certain merits behind the thrust of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Gilmore drafted the Bill, but it was presented by Deputy Rabbitte in a very interesting submission. The submission states: &ldquo;It is not in our view the function of the all-party committee to determine, for example, what the State role in relation to development land should be&rdquo; I cannot agree with that &ndash;&ldquo;Nor is it the committee's function to offer the Government or the Oireachtas legal advice as to its restrictions&rdquo;&ndash; I cannot agree with that, to a large extent &ndash;&ldquo;The former functions belong to the Government and the Houses while the latter, so far as Government policy is concerned, is the responsibility of the Attorney General.&rdquo;  It goes on to state: &ldquo;There is no reason, in our view [the Labour Party's view] that action on some of the more urgent items [presumably this Bill] on which submissions have been invited, should await the final outcome of the committee's deliberations and the publication of its report on the matter.&rdquo;  I cannot agree to the Labour Party's submission on this point.</P>
    <P>The reason I say that is that in our hearings and submissions &ndash; Deputy O'Sullivan attended practically all of them &ndash; a wealth of information came forward from a wide variety of bodies from the Law Society to the Bar Council, the IAVI, planners, architects, engineers, voluntary housing organisations, Threshold, Respond, the whole <Col N="1569" /> gamut of bodies interested in this subject. The members of the committee have been informed to a large degree on these issues both in written and oral forms. That in turn will inform our deliberations in our final report. To seek to bring in legislation at this stage while we are considering all these issues in a much wider context than the narrow issue which is being determined now would be premature. The Labour Party, as I have indicated, will have an opportunity to contribute to those final submissions.</P>
    <P>While I in no way want to pre-judge the outcome of the committee, I see no reason the general thrust of the Deputy's Bill should not form part of one of the committee's options. Having said that, I do not want to pre-judge it, but it certainly is an option. I could refer to two of the submissions in particular that came before the committee in so far as they relate to the proposed legislation. The NRA and the railway procurement agency, RPA, made very interesting cases on the powers of compulsory acquisition by public bodies. The NRA made a detailed submission on the technicalities and problems associated with processing CPOs in terms of property referencing, problems associated with judicial reviews, the level and cost of awards and all the legal issues involved.</P>
    <P>It made a very strong case to the committee that the problem with existing CPO legislation is not necessarily associated with the levels of awards but rather with the technicalities of the legislation. It would be better to introduce legislation with comprehensive reform of all the modalities of how local authorities and other public bodies deal with such issues. Many other proposals put before the committee deserve further consideration in a much wider context.</P>
    <P>The legislation is premature and forms part of much wider issues being considered by the committee. There are better and more immediate ways of achieving the Deputy's goal of increasing the housing supply. All those were adequately addressed by the Minister in his contribution. While I have some support for the thrust of the Bill even though it is premature, it could form part of our deliberations in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee on the Constitution is examining property rights in the context of the Constitution and it has invited the public to make written submissions. My party has two representatives on the committee, Deputies McCormack and Neville, who have been consistent in their attendance and contributions. I understand the committee has received 139 submissions and held public meetings during July and September. It decided to deal with the issues under four headings: the balance of the rights between the individual and the common good; the dynamics of the property market; the planning system; and other issues related to access to the countryside and ground rent.</P>
      <P>Initially I thought this committee would serve as a fig leaf for Government inaction on the housing problem. The Government has not proposed or implemented one coherent measure to tackle spiralling house prices. It has ignored the problem, which is an insult to those trying to buy their own homes and those on the social housing list. As of now there are 52,000 applicants for housing nationwide and the problem is so bad that the waiting list for social housing in Cork city has gone from 3,000 to more than 4,000 in a very short time. A sense of urgency and tangible action are needed and not Government promises, which it has a habit of breaking.</P>
      <P>I repeat tonight some of the options my party has proposed. We believe the creation of a national housing agency would smarten up the whole planning system and would be an effective body to implement elements of the national spatial strategy. In previous debates here I have set out my view of the role of such an agency. As my time is limited I will not go into detail tonight. The implementation of the national spatial strategy is an important element of all this. A senior Minister should be appointed with specific responsibility for the overall implementation of that strategy. If the Government carried out its promise to decentralise the 10,000 civil servants from Dublin to the regions, it would diffuse somewhat the demand for housing in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The first-time buyer's grant and an increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers should be reconsidered. The Government cut the legs from under first-time buyers with the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. Based on parliamentary questions tabled today it is clear there are still ongoing problems for people who thought they had that grant, but were let down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There needs to be an integrated approach to homelessness, with a multi-pronged approach by <Col N="1571" /> the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science and the health services. I have gone into more detail on this in previous debates. We need a special strategy for student and elderly housing facilities.</P>
    <P>Based on CSO figures the cost of building materials in the 12 months to 30 June 2003 increased by only 0.6%. Despite this there were double-digit percentage increases in housing prices. I welcome the Minister's statement that a consulting group is looking at the issue of hoarding building land, which we have called for. The Competition Authority should have investigated the hoarding of building land. The Taoiseach was recently &ldquo;door-stepped&rdquo; about once-off rural housing. The Government should come off the fence on this issue. A national commission to consider all the issues relating to once-off housing would give us much information and allow the Government and Opposition to draw conclusions about the different arguments about once-off housing.</P>

      <P>I fully acknowledge Deputy Gilmore has an interest in housing, as has my colleague, Deputy Allen. In recent years they have both repeatedly laboured in the wilderness, calling on the Government to do something about the serious housing problem. Unfortunately and unwittingly the Labour Party has walked into the trap baited by Members on the other side of the House. The Government has no intention of making houses affordable. In the past few days the Central Bank has indicated there would be a catastrophe if house prices dropped or even stabilised because Government revenue would fall. The Government never intended house prices to stabilise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gurgling sounds came from the Taoiseach in the past six or eight months indicating that something should be done about the cost of building land because house prices were getting out of hand. Immediately after the Central Bank statement, the Minister of State said the Government would consider doing something about it. <Col N="1572" /> However, it has no intention of doing so because the land bank that was bought after 1987 when the local authorities were instructed to sell their land as quickly as possible is now nearly exhausted.</P>
    <P>In recent days I heard the Minister of State with responsibility for housing indicate there were great schemes of affordable and social housing and that the public should be grateful for what is happening. However nothing is happening. It is an appalling vista. I have never seen anything like it in my life. This is not anecdotal. What worries me most is that I thought when the Minister took over in the Department he was the kind of man who knew something about this subject and that he would do something about it.</P>

      <P>The same people who have been buying semi-detached starter houses in the past couple of years will continue to buy them. Which house prices have stabilised? Those at the top of the market because there are no speculators buying there. They are not buying the six or eight bedroom houses in Killiney or Dalkey. They are buying the semi-detached three bedroom house which is a great investment and they move in first time. Why did the Government not introduce an incentive to encourage those who are building houses to build for the private first-time buyer? That would have been a simple solution, instead it commissioned three Bacon reports all intended to be the panacea for the housing problem. What did we get? Absolutely nothing.</P>

      <P>It has been said, and this is anecdotal, that one of the contributory costs to housing is building land. The more scarce it is made, the more difficult it becomes. Landowners resented particularly in the past few years seeing the developers who bought their land cheaply achieve an enhanced value by keeping it in store for a long time, and then selling houses on it at an increased value. It is a disgrace. It is presumed that land price is a serious issue. It is a contributory factor but nobody has mentioned Government intervention in the housing market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Government intervention has increased the price of houses by anything up to 40%, in levies, VAT and the removal of the new house grant. The only area of revenue which is increasing is stamp duty. I can understand why the Central Bank and the Government are concerned about dropping revenue from housing. If the presumption is right that 50% is land cost, 40% Government costs, is one to presume that 10% is the cost of building the house?</P>

      <P>I must declare an interest at the outset. I am and have been for many years a solicitor, a politician and have been involved in a minor way in a few minor development projects. It has brought odium on me from three points of <Col N="1574" /> view but it has also given me a perspective on this most serious issue. The Labour Party has done a service to the House by raising it and providing an opportunity for debate. My initial reaction to the Labour Party Bill is that it is a good idea to have the issue debated but the Bill is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The Constitution is quite clear on property rights and Article 40.3.2. says &ldquo;The State shall in particular by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack, and in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.&rdquo;. In Article 43 there is a further provision on private property. That is not my law, that is the Constitution of the people and we have to abide by it. If we do not like the Constitution we have to change it but any law that we consider passing must be in line with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>However, let us not hide behind the Constitution. The proposal is an unjust one. In that view I am agreee with the minority Kenny Report which came to that conclusion. In one respect it targets the super rich property developers &ndash; and I am in not in that category. It also applies to everybody, including the widow in West Cork with a cottage acre, part of which she wants to develop maybe for her son, or to sell for a few euro.</P>
      <P>Laws apply to everybody and just because they are aimed in a particular direction does not mean they will be confined to that. It is not the right approach yet there is a need for some approach. I do not intend to provide a <i>pro forma</i> solution here. My colleague from West Cork, Deputy O'Donovan and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which he chairs, are looking at this in great detail. I have read some of the submissions which are very interesting and I look forward to the committee's report.</P>
      <P>The market needs supply. I see people who want cheap housing yet will oppose rezoning. Rezoning is a dirty word because of what is happening in Dublin Castle and I am opposed to the behaviour of the people being investigated there, but if we want more supply we must rezone more land. But what do we do about it? I am in favour of applying the new rugby law: use it or lose it. If hoarding is the problem then the rugby law might be applied so that if the rezoning is not used to beneficial effect the local authority can change it. Maybe that is the approach to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. I keep hearing about hoarding land; rezoning is not an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a possible answer to hoarding. The Government has to look into its <Col N="1575" /> own heart. One does not help new house buyers by abolishing new house grants or by increasing stamp duty and VAT. The Government has done all three and we are now in a situation where it is estimated that 30% of the price of a new house goes to the Government in taxes. The Government must look at what it has done in that regard. Of course we should be looking at new thinking and new measures and the proposals to the Oireachtas committee are very interesting. For example, one from the Irish Planning Institute proposes the separation of ownership and development rights which is common in many northern American states. I am not saying this is the answer but let us look at these suggestions.</P>
      <P>I look forward to a good debate on this but in regard to the Labour Bill, many people will look at a complex problem and say that for every complex problem there is a simple solution. However, I say if you look at it that way, you look at a solution that does not work. It may be necessary to find a complex solution to a complex problem.</P>

      <P>I am a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution but the fact that we have been given the job of looking at the Constitution, and what changes might be needed in that area, does not mean that we as legislators do not have a duty to do whatever we can within the constitutional framework to make proposals. That is exactly what my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, is doing tonight on behalf of the party and I fully support him. The Minister and the Government have not addressed the main points Deputy Gilmore has made. The central point is the percentage cost of the price of land as a proportion of the cost of buying a house for young people. There are many people who cannot afford to buy a house. They are the two chief reasons the Labour Party is bringing forward this Bill. I do not believe we can delay in addressing this issue. From personal experience of queuing with my daughter to put a deposit on a house last winter, I know there is a huge problem in terms of huge numbers of people being unable to buy a house.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me, I will quote briefly from Article 43 of the Constitution to address the point made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. The rights with regard to property are tempered in Article 43.2, which states that civil society has to take account of, and be regulated by, the principles of social justice. It goes on to state:</P>
      <P>The State, accordingly, may, as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>

    <P>I believe that is quite clear. Many of the groups which came before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, in public session, made that point &ndash; that the rights to property under the <Col N="1576" /> Constitution are balanced by the principles and the exigencies of the common good. Quite clearly, the legislation we are proposing takes those points into account. The case has been made by people better qualified in constitutional matters than I to the effect that there is considerable scope under the current Constitution to make changes in legislation which will address this central issue of the non-affordability of houses for so many of our young people.</P>
    <P>I fully stand over the Labour Party's position in bringing forward this legislation. It is constitutional, on the basis of our legal advice, and addresses a most urgent problem for many people who cannot afford houses. People on local authority housing lists will be waiting for years before provision is made for them under current arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to raise the need to retain the tax incentive for film-making contained in section 481. This support to the film industry is vital to the future of many hundreds of jobs and the livelihoods of many small businesses currently dependent on major film projects.</P>
      <P>In County Wicklow, there is a long tradition of film-making. Direct jobs across the range of technical and creative activities have been developed, as well as the spin-off to local businesses which film-making brings. A film commission has been established in County Wicklow in recognition of the value the local authority puts on its economic importance to the county. The role played by Ardmore Studios as the country's largest film studio is evident. Over 24 major productions selected the county as a location. Not only did these companies spend money in the county, they also highlighted its tourist attractions. Tourist numbers to Avoca doubled after the making of the &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo; television series.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax incentives play an essential part of attracting such business. All other EU countries provide these incentives. In the UK, there are four such schemes. Not only does section 481 attract business very successfully to Ireland. As well as supporting indigenous film-making, it also constitutes good value for money. An example is the film &ldquo;King Arthur&rdquo; currently being made &ndash; much of it in the Minister for Finance's home county, Kildare &ndash; which is employing 900 people for nine months. Since the investment liable for tax relief is capped, the maximum relief is &euro;3.5 million. The amount of money being spent in the <Col N="1577" /> Irish economy adds up to &euro;50 million alone. Between &euro;8 million and &euro;10 million is returned directly to the Exchequer by way of VAT, PRSI, PAYE etc. This is true value for money.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Government, on a daily basis, is being found deficient in ensuring the good management of the public finances, it is impossible to understand why the Minister is targeting this tax incentive for abolition when it has proved itself time and again. The same Minister for Finance introduced a wasteful and unnecessary tax incentive scheme at the behest of a constituent who is building a private day care hospital.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made by the Government &ndash; regrettably even by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, who represents County Wicklow and should know better &ndash; that abuse of this scheme is the cause of its abolition. That is an erroneous argument. Clearly, the vetting procedures and the film community itself are capable of dealing with any abuse.</P>
    <P>According to Screen Producers Ireland, the organisation representing the industry, the Irish film and TV drama industry employs 4,300 people. If a tax incentive for the industry is not available, it is estimated that 80% of production work may stop immediately, with the loss of 80% of the jobs overnight. However, if tax incentives were to continue, the organisation believes that, within ten years, the industry could employ up to 11,000 people directly and spend &euro;500 million euro in Ireland. This industry is growing fast on a worldwide basis. The issue now is as to whether Ireland, particularly County Wicklow, will be able to keep up or will be left behind because of wrong-headed Government intransigence.</P>
    <P>The film producer, Jim Sheridan, noted that Los Angeles holds the Irish film industry in high esteem. This has helped to bring an average of $136 million inward investment annually to Ireland. Ireland has become one of the top six preferred locations in the world for film production. A considerable talent and skills bank has grown up over the years. We have developed the essentials for a successful industry: a talent base, professional support, infrastructure and a good reputation. Students are coming out of our film schools well trained and ready to take up jobs in an industry that is growing and expanding in its potential. I ask the Government to think again before it is too late.</P>
    <P>Film could be a key enabler for the development of an indigenous digital media industry. Other countries can see the potential, yet our Government is intent on blindly pursuing a policy that will damage rather than develop film-making. Far from withdrawing section 481, there is a strong argument for increasing the cap in order to attract more and larger productions. I urge the Minister to see the value of this incentive in fin<Col N="1578" /> ancial, employment, commercial and tourism terms before it is too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for raising this matter. She has articulated very well the importance of tourism and the film industry to this country, especially to County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>As the House is probably aware, tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984, under the business expansion scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector-specific tax reliefs in the economy and has involved an Exchequer contribution, in terms of tax forgone, of the order of some &euro;265 million in the last ten years alone.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that this relief has continued, over time, against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and reduction of rates generally. The termination of this relief is part of a larger package to maintain our low income and corporation tax rates. As the Minister for Finance said in his Budget Statement last year, reliefs narrow the tax base; a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to keep tax rates low and this is a price worth paying. Therefore, all tax reliefs must be kept under review.</P>
      <P>In that context the Minister for Finance announced that a number of reliefs across a range of sectors, including film relief, would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004. These reliefs include the urban renewal scheme, the town renewal scheme, the scheme of relief for the construction of multi-storey car parks, the rural renewal scheme, the living-over-the-shop scheme, the park and ride scheme, the student accommodation scheme and the relief for expenditure incurred on certain buildings used for third level educational purposes. In the Budget Statement and Finance Act 2003, the Minister for Finance also announced a termination date for the special capital allowances regime for hotels and holiday cottages, subject to transitional provisions which provided for the continued availability of the regime until 31 December 2004 for certain pipeline projects.</P>
      <P>No one is arguing that these reliefs have not been of benefit. Special reliefs have played an important role in many areas and in the development of many business sectors. However, the key value in such reliefs is in kick-starting such developments, rather than in providing ongoing support on a permanent basis. While there may be a case for maintaining each of these reliefs, the case for broadening the tax base and keeping tax rates low is even stronger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attention has been drawn to the fact that many other countries, such as the UK, Canada and Australia, have tax incentives and other forms of State aid for film production. However, all of these countries have higher cor<Col N="1579" /> poration tax rates than our rate of 12.5%. If these countries adopted our approach of maintaining a low corporation tax rate as a means to encourage enterprise and stimulate employment, it is not likely they would also be in a position to retain a wide range of sectoral specific reliefs, such a tax incentives for film production over the long-term. In the Minister's view, having low tax rates and a plethora of reliefs simultaneously is not a viable long-term option. It is widely acknowledged that low tax rates have been a critical factor in our present high employment situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the views of many in the film sector that have been expressed, either directly by way of representations or indirectly through the media, with regard to the economic and social impacts of the termination of this relief in December 2004. The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism has recently forwarded to the Minister for Finance a copy of a study reviewing the relief that was commissioned jointly by his Department and the Irish Film Board. The Minister for Finance has asked officials from his Department to examine this study. However, as things stand. the position with regard to the 31 December 2004 termination date for this relief remains unchanged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this important issue once again. My immediate family have been involved with the Cork School of Music for the past 24 years, with children starting violin at age four. In May I visited the temporary premises in Moore's Hotel for the Cork School of Music and saw students and teachers working in poor and overcrowded conditions. They were, however, full of hope that, despite numerous delays, the announcement on a new school of music would have been made by now. We were given unofficial assurances that an announcement would have been made long before now.</P>
      <P>It was appalling, however, to see students and teachers in the cold weather yesterday protesting the lack of a decision from the Government. I read the little book of horrors that is the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and he sets out an appalling vista of mismanagement, indifference and wasting of taxpayers' money in this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promises were made before the general election in 2002. The then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, on more than one occasion announced that a new Cork School of Music would proceed immediately and be ready for the time when Cork would become European City of Culture in 2005. The election came, the promises were broken and we are still waiting for the school. I call on the Government to make up <Col N="1580" /> for this deceit of the people of Cork and Munster by sanctioning the school.</P>
    <P>EUROSTAT has been blamed and other excuses given. Every time we table a Dáil question, we are told a decision is imminent. What is the Minister's definition of imminent? I hope the Minister will give a specific date for approval of the school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third time I have raised this issue of major concern throughout Munster. I was told today that the rent paid to date since July 2001 is over &euro;1.5 million, money down the drain. The costs have increased from &euro;12 million to &euro;200 million. It appears that one side of the Government did not know what the other was doing in this matter. The Department of Finance finally got involved and said there was no money left and the project could not go ahead.</P>
      <P>While this continues, the students, teachers and staff are suffering. Cork has a fantastic tradition of music spanning the decades. We all hoped that with Cork being designated the European City of Culture in 2005, this would be the centrepiece of culture in Munster and Ireland. The Government has let Cork and the rest of the country down . We want a decision one way or the other, but I hope the building will be allowed to start. We have been told it is imminent but there has been speculation in the press that the building will be on a smaller scale, which probably means going through the planning process again, with further delays as a result.</P>
      <P>We raised this issue nine months ago and again six months ago. The Government is still dithering and cannot make up its mind and come to a decision. The Departments of Education and Science and Finance did not get their act together from day one and that is why we are in such a mess. Promises were made and broken. That is not good enough for the people of Cork or the nation.</P>
      <P>This is a major project the cultural significance of which cannot be overstated. Perhaps the Minister will have good news for us tonight and one decision might be announced in this House. The Minister might make history by making a decision in the Dáil. It would be historic as far as the Government is concerned. We await that decision with hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy and Deputy Allen know, it is bad politics to make an announcement on behalf of a colleague. The Minister for Education and Science has spoken on this issue in the House on a number of occasions and discussed it with the Joint Committee on Education and Science. The project was launched in July 2000 and a total of 12 consortia expressed interest in bidding for it. After initial presentations and interviews, a final short-list of three bidders was issued <Col N="1581" /> with the invitation to negotiate documentation in November 2000. Detailed evaluation of the final bids was undertaken in February 2001 and Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder the following month. Department of Education and Science officials and advisers entered into a period of intense discussion with Jarvis Projects Limited with a view to reaching financial closure on the project.</P>
      <P>During this period Jarvis Projects Limited, under the terms of the project, sought and received planning permission for the project from Cork City Council. However, a planning appeal against the grant of permission was submitted to An Bord Pleanála. During the period of the appeal, work on the project was suspended and was only resumed after An Bord Pleanála rejected the appeal and granted planning permission for the development on 24 December 2001.</P>
      <P>When the project was first launched the economic climate in the country was very healthy. Since then, however, as the committee is well aware&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;economic circumstances have changed significantly, so much so that the question of affordability of each capital project must be examined very closely in relation to overall Government expenditure.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the question of the general Government balance. This is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the stability and growth pact of the Maastricht treaty. Under EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance over the construction phase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue. A standing committee established by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will also advise on the general Government balance implications of private sector financed projects. EUROSTAT has ruled on the GGB implications of the bundle of five post-primary schools and found that the capital cost must be reckoned for GGB purposes. While EUROSTAT has not specifically ruled on the Cork School of Music project, the prudent approach is to adopt a working assumption for the moment that the cost of the project will have to be counted for GGB purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> In recent months the Government's priority has been to ensure the competitiveness of our economy and to respond effectively in managing the economic changes. With the limited resources now available for major infrastructural projects it is imperative that all such projects are critically reviewed to ensure that the best value for money is achieved and that we prioritise our needs to the funding available.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the final approval for the Cork School of Music will be a matter for the Government and consideration of it will be based on a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes and taking into account the issues surrounding the general Government balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In July this year, it was reported that 2.5 tonnes of radioactive material, the remnants of a particle accelerator, continue to be stored on the grounds of University College, Cork. This machine was given to the college by the government of the United States of America in the mid-1970s as a gift of the sort that keeps on giving. Particle accelerators were also given to other countries such as India and Pakistan which subsequently went on to develop full nuclear programmes. After a few years, the machine stopped being used and by the early 1980s it was dismantled. It has remained on the grounds of the university. As 2.5 tonnes of radioactive material, it poses significant health and safety risks for those who work and study at the college. In addition, Irish Steel and Irish ISPAT were responsible for receiving a large quantity of radioactive metals which were largely sourced through Haulbowline and much of which remain on the island long after the closures of both companies. In recent weeks a fire at the Sunbeam factory came close to destroying a facility which deals with small quantities of less dangerous radioactive materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These instances demonstrate the lack of a Government policy in relation to radioactive materials. The only statement we have from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicates his opinion that while the problem will be sorted out, it does not need to be sorted out now. This Minister is quite emphatic in his comments most of the time and I can only contrast his statement on radioactive waste with statements he has made about toxic waste. He is quite insistent that we need a toxic waste incinerator, one of which is proposed for my own constituency. We do not produce enough toxic waste to make such an incinerator economically viable which means we will have to produce more toxic waste or import it to justify its construction. On the other hand, we have a very real <Col N="1583" /> problem with radioactive waste to which the Government and, in particular, the Minister are giving no consideration.</P>
    <P>The problem does not relate only to the three locations of which I have made mention. Radioactive waste in its largest component is the residue of the radiological departments of our hospitals. Much of it must be stored in lead canisters deep underground. The Government should commit to a central facility deep underground with the necessary lining to prevent the type of incident which almost happened at Sunbeam last week. Radioactive materials can become part of a conflagration, expose people to the kinds of health and safety risks we have seen at University College, Cork, for the last 20 years or be left behind by a company which ceases operations with the price being paid by those who live in the area.</P>
    <P>While I am grateful that a member of the Cabinet is taking the Adjournment, I would like to hear from the Minister a statement of personal concern in spite of her reluctance to speak on behalf of her colleague or initiate any Government policy in this area. I would like Deputy Coughlan to bring this issue to the Cabinet and to indicate that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can be shaken out of his complacency.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on the need for a national repository for radioactive waste. We have been addressing this issue for some time and it is of particular relevance in the context of current negotiations on a proposed European Council directive on the control of high activity sealed radioactive sources and the presentation by the European Commission of a new legislative package on nuclear safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's radioactive waste is generally low level and low volume and derives, as the Deputy has said, in the main from hospital and certain industrial applications. As a standard policy and in accordance with the polluter pays principle, <Col N="1584" /> those who generate such waste should ensure its safe disposal and must guarantee a high level of public and worker safety and environmental protection. The storage, removal or disposal of radioactive waste is subject to strict licensing by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland or RPII. While the RPII's annual reports provide details of its licensing and enforcement functions, the institute has for some time advocated the establishment of a national repository for radioactive waste. This would be consistent with best international practice and our obligations under the International Atomic Energy Agency Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. While this is the preferred option to storage on the premises of some 60 RPII licensees, it does not reflect a view that radioactive waste is being stored unsafely. The institute has not identified any capacity problem in hospitals or industrial premises as regards storage.</P>
    <P>Ireland's radioactive waste falls into the two categories of unsealed sources which are usually in liquid form and sealed sources which are enclosed in containers. Unsealed sources have a very short radioactive half-life. This type of waste from hospitals is normally discharged through public drainage systems and does not result in any residual contamination. Other unsealed radioactive solid waste is retained in designated radioactive storage under RPII licence conditions. Sealed radioactive sources are used in hospitals for radiotherapy and for various purposes in industry and education. Sealed sources are normally sent back to the manufacturer as part of the contract governing their purchase and importation in the first place, while waste that cannot be returned is currently stored in hospitals and on industrial premises under licence from the RPII. The RPII inspects such premises regularly.</P>
    <P>A full specification for a storage facility, having regard to the range of appropriate considerations involved, is under development in consultations between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the RPII. No decisions have been taken in this regard and any proposal will, of course, be subject to extensive evaluation and normal planning procedures. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is satisfied that we must move forward in the interests of optimum safety at national level while adhering fully to existing and emerging international obligations.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister and I express my sympathy that she must cover for two or three other Ministers.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter which was also the subject of a parliamentary question of 30 September 2003. It related to a lady who, having worked in the same job for 20 years, took early retirement to care for her ailing mother. Alas, her mother eventually passed away and left the woman with mortgage liabilities and without a job, as is quite common. The woman in question did what she felt she had to at the time. She made an application for mortgage interest supplement as is normal in such cases. There are many people who have been in receipt of this supplement for a long time as a result of the serious housing problem we spoke about earlier. The woman supplied all the information she was asked to provide and having done so was asked to provide more. She also supplied this information. For some unknown reason the relevant health board decided this information was insufficient and determined to make an issue of it. Ultimately, the unfortunate applicant lost patience and hope and gave up, which apparently suited the scene in so far as the investigation was concerned.</P>
      <P>I know what the Minister's reply will be &ndash; I could write that script. I had some experience of that. If the reply is in accord with the reply to the parliamentary question, it is incorrect. The incorrect part is the statement that the person did not supply the details requested and subsequently withdrew her application for mortgage interest supplement. I reject that. She supplied the details but she became very annoyed when she was repeatedly pursued for more information. She informs me that she supplied all the information requested and I ask the Minister to check with the relevant health authority to find out precisely what was required and what was supplied. The reply goes on to state that if she wishes to reapply for mortgage interest supplement she will be required to furnish the details previously requested. To the best of my knowledge all the information was requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second or third time I have had to raise an issue of this nature with the Minister, and the Minister acknowledges that. In previous cases the matter was resolved to the satisfaction of my constituents. I am not trying to pre-empt the Minister's reply but I will become extremely annoyed if I find out that the information requested was supplied but that the Minister was not informed to that effect when she replied to <Col N="1586" /> the question on 30 September last. I ask the Minister to investigate that issue. I regard it as a serious matter and I hope the Minister will treat it accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not break with precedent on this occasion but I will complete my deliberations with a one-liner.</P>
      <P>This matter concerns an application for a mortgage interest supplement under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the regional health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. The main objective of the SWA scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means and basic needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining the amount of assistance payable.</P>
      <P>The mortgage interest supplement is designed to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a dwelling which is their sole place of residence. The scheme operates on the basis that a person shall be entitled to a supplement towards the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. The capital element of the repayment is not taken into account in calculating the amount of supplement payable as it is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should repay part of the initial loan and thereby provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>Mortgage interest supplements, which are subject to a means test, are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to his or her family circumstances less a minimum contribution of &euro;12. Many recipients pay more than &euro;12 because applicants are required to contribute, towards their mortgage interest, any additional assessable means they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1374, which I answered for the Deputy on 30 September 2003, I advised him that the South Western Area Health Board had been contacted on behalf of the individual in question and had advised me that she made an application for a mortgage interest supplement at her local health centre. She was asked to supply details of her financial circumstances to facilitate the means test. The individual in question was unwilling to supply particular information requested by the board <Col N="1587" /> and subsequently withdrew her application for mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>I understand the details sought by the health board may relate to a redundancy payment the individual received. The means test for supplementary welfare allowance is carried out in accordance with Part III of the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. In addition to assessing income which an individual may have, the legislation requires an assessment of property, other than the applicant's home, and savings or investments in determining the level of assistance to be provided in individual cases. The position, therefore, is that to allow a health board to process an application for assistance under the terms of the SWA scheme it must be in possession of all the relevant information to be in a position to carry out the means test. In the case the Deputy raises this evening, the board advised that it was not in possession of all the relevant <Col N="1588" /> information as suggested in the Deputy's original inquiry.

      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the serious cost and inconvenience being caused to private and commercial e-mail users as a result of spam; when the promised regulations to control spam will be in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Spam is a growing problem and remedial action is urgently required. Recent figures released by the European Commission indicated that about 48% of global e-mail traffic was spam and that time wasted in clearing inboxes cost firms &euro;2.5 billion in productivity. Aside from significant costs to recipients, Internet service providers and network operators are also finding that spam is having a considerable impact and is clogging global communications networks and interfering significantly with legitimate data transmission.</P>
      <P>The issue of spam to businesses requires careful consideration. It is important that any measures introduced do not impede legitimate marketing by reputable companies. The effects of measures on small and medium enterprises have also to be considered. E-mail is a hugely important marketing and communication tool. It is important in that context to achieve an appropriate balance between measures to combat spam and to facilitate the use of electronic communications as a driver for further development and increased productivity.</P>
      <P>The European Commission and the member states of the EU have agreed a co-ordinated approach and are also determined to ensure that progress is made on global measures to deal with this phenomenon. Measures are being considered at OECD level and also by the International Telecommunications Union, an organisation affiliated to the United Nations. It is anticipated that discussions on additional co-operative measures will take place over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently transposing EU Directive 2002/58/EC on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. The directive contains requirements regarding the control of unsolicited commercial e-mails or spam. It is due to be transposed into Irish law by 31 October <Col N="1590" /> 2003. I expect the Department to meet that deadline.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently considering responses to the public consultation on the draft regulations transposing the EU directive, prior to finalising the text. The new regulations will prohibit the sending of spam to individuals without their prior consent. For the purposes of the regulations the definition of spam will also include the short message service, SMS, so popular with mobile phone users. The incidence of spam on mobile phone networks is also increasing to unacceptable levels.</P>
    <P>Initially business will have access to a less restrictive regime for spam. They will have the facility to notify individual companies or organisations which have sent unsolicited commercial e-mails or spam that they no longer wish to receive such communications. It is intended to provide for specific offences in the proposed regulations to deal with any non-compliance.</P>
    <P>My Department is also considering the necessity for further regulation in the area of spam for business and will be monitoring the impact of the regulations with a view to recommending further legislative action if considered necessary.</P>

      <P>The AER VI competition had to be completed before we could devote resources to future options. Apart from the supplementary allocation proposed this is now complete. Allocation of capacity under AER VI puts us well on the way to achieving the target set in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now time to review alternative support systems for renewable energy. To that end, I stated publicly on several occasions my intention to publish a consultation document to discuss future targets and support mechanisms. The consultation document addressing all aspects of this topic will be published shortly. This document is in the final stages of preparation. We will allow a reasonable interval for submissions and the Department and <Col N="1591" /> SEI will need a further short period to evaluate the submissions before deciding on the next steps.</P>
    <P>The AER mechanism was designed to deliver demanding Government targets from the mix of available technologies for the minimum additional cost to consumers. Under the AER mechanism we plan to deliver 800 megawatts of wind energy on to the grid. This places us well on the way to meeting and exceeding our EU directive commitments.</P>

      <P>EU Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market requires that member states increase, by 2010, their gross national electricity consumption derived from renewable energy sources to the thresholds outlined in the annex to the directive. My requirement will be to have sufficient renewable energy based generating capacity in place to generate this volume without reliance on imports.</P>
      <P>The current national target for renewables is to add an additional 500 megawatts of generating capacity to the grid by 2005 and additional capacity in offshore wind and biomass-fed combined heat and power plant by 2006. This capacity, together with generating capacity from existing renewable energy plant, as defined in the directive, could increase the percentage of green electricity to over 12% by 2006 if all AER V and AER VI projects are built.</P>
      <P>A 10% target is a more conservative assessment to allow for planned projects which do not proceed for reasons which cannot be identified at this time.</P>

      <P>Reports were received during July that significant levels of fish mortalities were being experienced by salmon <Col N="1592" /> farms in Inver Bay, County Donegal. I immediately mandated the Marine Institute to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the situation, with a view to determining the cause of the mortalities.</P>
      <P>An extensive process of investigation and analysis has been undertaken since then by staff of the Marine Institute and other experts engaged by the institute. The key topics that have been addressed in the course of this work include fish health, chemistry, seabed conditions, phytoplankton, oceanography, fishing activity and fish farm operations. Despite the considerable time and resources that have been devoted to the investigation, it has not been possible to date to establish what caused the mortalities.</P>
      <P>Since the investigations commenced, it has come to light that significant mortality levels have also been experienced over recent months by other fish farms along the western seaboard. I have, therefore, asked the Marine Institute to broaden the scope of its investigations to look also at what has happened at other locations.</P>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of the mortality levels, the investigation has been accorded priority status by the Marine Institute. It will be progressed as quickly as possible, while ensuring that appropriate consideration is given to all relevant issues. As the investigation is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the Government has confirmed its commitment to the development of the forestry sector in a manner that maximises its contribution to national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis. The partnership agreement contains a commitment to promote and support increased planting levels up to 2,000 hectares annually.</P>
      <P>The agreement acknowledges, however, that this commitment is subject to the availability of budgetary resources. The Deputies will be aware that the Government is facing very difficult choices in the areas of public finances and may not be in a position to make as much money available for all programmes as it would wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the serious concerns among forestry stakeholders in relation to the funding situa<Col N="1593" /> tion for forestry in 2003. In this regard there have been extensive consultations with the sector following which the primary focus of funding during 2003 has been the planting programme. As a result, while final figures are not available, planting levels in 2003 are expected to reach 12,000 hectares, of which 2,000 hectares will be paid for in 2004. Planting levels in 2000, 2001 and 2002 were 15,695 hectares, 15,464 hectares and 15,054 hectares, respectively.</P>
    <P>I wish to reassure the Deputy that the Government is strongly committed to the development of the forestry sector. This commitment is underlined by the provisions of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, and clearly demonstrates that the Government recognises the important role which forestry plays and will continue to play in the development of rural and local economies. I also have directed that a fundamental review of the strategic policy for forestry, Growing for the Future, which was published in 1996, be undertaken. This review will reflect the significant changes in the sector and society as a whole since 1996 and will involve wide stakeholder consultation. It will also need to address the potentially huge future cost of forestry, especially premia, which existing policy involves as well as the interaction with other agricultural land use support policies.</P>
    <P>In the latter context, the House should be aware of the high historic and future cost of forestry, if existing policies are to be maintained. For example, &euro;613 million &ndash; an average of about &euro;88 million per year &ndash; has been spent on forestry since 1997 and, if existing policies were to continue, annual average costs, assuming respectively 10,000 and 20,000 hectares per annum, would be &euro;100 million per year and &euro;130 million per year over the next three years. By 2020 the annual costs of meeting the Sustaining Progress targets of 20,000 hectares per annum could be over &euro;210 million per year.</P>
    <P>Besides the financial implications outlined above, the review of the national climate change strategy and the mid-term reviews of the CAP rural development plan and various operational programmes of the national development plan which are currently under way will also inform the review of the forestry strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought forward last month new fleet policy proposals for discussion. The discussion document contains a range of proposals in relation to the licensing of sea-fishing boats, including those with pelagic bulk storage capacity in the polyvalent fleet segment.</P>
      <P>The two vessels to which the Deputy refers were built recently, despite a clear moratorium being in place since early 2001 on the licensing of such vessels in the polyvalent segment. There could therefore have been no legitimate expectation by the vessel owners of these vessels being licensed in the polyvalent segment of the fleet. In the context of strong representations made for the licensing of additional pelagic bulk storage capacity in the polyvalent segment, I proposed in the discussion document a limited increase in the number of such vessels in the polyvalent segment. The proposed higher replacement capacity requirement of 1:2 was proposed taking account of the advantageous position of any such vessels <i>vis-à-vis </i>the rest of the polyvalent fleet. The current mackerel quota allocations reflect the traditional fishing patterns of the respective fleets.</P>
      <P>The tank vessels in the pelagic segment of the fleet, which are allocated the major portion of the mackerel quota, have depended for many years exclusively on pelagic fisheries and continue to do so. In contrast, the polyvalent fleet does not have the same reliance and has traditionally been able to target both whitefish and pelagic stocks. As the current allocations for mackerel were negotiated in October 2001 following very difficult and protracted discussions and involved a substantial transfer of mackerel quota to the polyvalent fleet, I do not consider it constructive to reopen the mackerel allocations discussion at this time.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, considering policy in relation to additional bulk storage capacity in the polyvalent segment on the basis of the current quota allocations. I must be satisfied before taking any decision that allows additional bulk storage tank vessels into the polyvalent segment that such a decision could be justified on the grounds of economic viability and the sustainability of pelagic stocks.</P>
      <P>I will examine carefully the views expressed by industry on the new policy proposals and the issues raised before finalising and introducing a new fleet licensing policy which in any way changes the moratorium put in place in 2001. There are widely divergent views within the industry on this specific point.</P>
      <P>These two tank boat vessels can always be introduced to the tank boat segment by withdrawing equivalent capacity in that segment.</P>

      <P>The Digital Hub, which is the Government's flagship project in the digital content sector, is intended to provide a high-quality environment for Irish and international new media companies, research and development and educational and community initiatives in the Liberties and Coombe areas of <Col N="1596" /> Dublin. The digital content industry has been identified by our development agencies as a high growth, value added industry in which this country already exhibits significant strengths. A substantial amount of progress, which I will now outline, has already been made in realising the aims of the project.</P>
      <P>The Digital Hub Development Agency Act 2003 was enacted in July of this year. The legislation which places the development company for the hub on a statutory footing in an important indication of Government commitment to the project. Property purchase amounting to &euro;75 million has been completed. The property which was vested in the Commissioners of Public Works transferred to the new agency on enactment of the legislation. The Digital Hub is currently conducting negotiations to select a preferred developer for the refurbishment of the properties. A short list of four consortia has been drawn up and a contract is expected to be awarded by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that when completed, the project will deliver 500,000 square feet of enterprise, learning and educational, residential and retail space. The refurbishment of the print depot which has been progressed as a co-operative venture between the Digital Hub Development Agency, Enterprise Ireland and Dublin City Council catering for established and high potential start-up companies in the digital media sector is complete. A number of firms in the digital media sector have already located in the hub. Construction of a 3 km high speed, fibre broadband network in the hub at a cost of &euro;2.29 million is complete and the facility to offer high quality competitively prices telecommunications services to firms locating in the hub is now available.</P>
      <P>The Liberties learning initiative, an education and community based programme being run in conjunction with the development of the Digital Hub, has a number of projects using technology to tackle social and educational disadvantage. Initiatives include digital storytelling which is using digital technology to allow local children to become familiar with technology and the digital communities project where a number of partners have come together to fit out 11 housing complexes in the inner city with computers, printers and scanners. The digital hub is providing training to residents.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the private companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation. At present, a basic telephone connection allows normal speed dial-up Internet access in any area. Higher rates of access, such as those provided by digital subscriber lines, wireless, fibre optic or satellite-based systems, are available on the market from a number of telecommunications service providers. A full list of licensed service providers is available from the Commission for Communications Regulation, Irish Life Mall, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1, or from the website <i>www.comreg.ie</i>The main thrust of investment under the communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP 2000-2006 is the creation of metropolitan area fibre optic networks (MANs) initially in 19 towns and cities across the country in association with the local authorities. This will facilitate the provision by private telecommunications companies of a wide variety of advanced services. The 19 towns were selected following a Government decision of 7 March 2002 based on the recommendations of the interdepartmental working group on telecommunications. They are Cork, <Col N="1598" /> Limerick, Galway, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Dungarvan, Clonmel, Athlone, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Roscommon, Ballina, Letterkenny, Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton and Gaoth Dobhair. This is the first phase of the strategy and the implementation of phase 2, which includes Monaghan town and Carrickmacross, will be contingent on its successful implementation.</P>
      <P>I am currently discussing the acceleration of MANs for Monaghan and Carrickmacross with my colleague, the Minister for Finance. Full details of all of the metropolitan area networks and the MSE are available from my Department's website <i>www.dcmnr.ie/mse</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 136 and 137 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By letter dated 12 September 2003, my Department officials informed the EU Commission that the AER programme appeared to be outside the scope of EU state aid rules when tested against the judgment of the European Court of Justice decision in Altmark. The European Commission responded by letter dated 26 September that in its view the state aids rules continue to be applic<Col N="1599" /> able and recommended that we should continue to pursue state aids clearance. The Commission cautioned that if Ireland proceeds to allocate the additional capacity proposed under AER VI without state aids clearance it will commence an <i>ex officio</i> investigation. My priority is to get the necessary clearance for the additional capacity proposed in AER VI as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Gerrard Hassan report on the impacts of increased levels of wind penetration on the electricity systems of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is welcome and indicates the short-term constraints to the greater deployment of wind energy technology in the electricity market using the existing AER mechanism. I consider the study's findings fundamental to the co-ordinated growth of our wind energy electricity generating sector. Prior to this study being commissioned, little work had been published quantifying the network constraints on future Government targets to support additional contributions from wind energy technologies in the electricity market in the medium to long-term. This study goes some way towards addressing this deficiency and identified areas where further development work is required. I have recently asked the Commission for Energy Regulation to examine the study and other available documents with a view to advising me as definitively as possible about future options. In addition, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) runs programmes supporting renewable energy research and is, in collaboration with the Commission for Energy Regulation and other key stakeholders, directing research effort in this regard. The report concludes the amount of wind generation capacity which could be accepted on to the network by the year 2005 is 790 MW. My current proposals for AER VI together with AER V contracts and existing wind-powered plant will take the potential wind powered capacity to 800 MW approximately.</P>
    <P>The IWEA did suggest if additional AER VI winners were required to constrain at certain times the capacity which could be connected would increase. However, this would constitute a material change to the terms and conditions of AER VI. In addition, Sustainable Energy Ireland advises me that while increased levels of penetration are theoretically feasible there are many changes to codes, practices, financial and legal arrangements and regulatory structures that would be required before any decision could be reached. The additional 140 MW I propose to allocate in AER VI is significant and is as far as I can go for several reasons including the additional cost to the customer levy; the constraints detailed in the CER commissioned Garrad Hassan report as they impact on the terms and conditions of AER VI; the advice I have requested from CER on the study; the research currently under way by SEI in collaboration with CER and Eirgrid, and potential impacts on future <Col N="1600" /> North/South co-operation in the electricity market.</P>
    <P>In response to the query about strategic directions regarding the electricity network, the position is I have no statutory authority to give directions to the Commission for Energy Regulation or to the transmission system operator in relation to investment in the national grid. I am satisfied the impediments now facing the wind sector are short-term. The studies now under way will contribute significantly to the alternative solutions. There will be ample opportunity for disappointed applicants in AER VI to participate in future support programmes which I will announce after concluding a public consultation programme.</P>

      <P>Consultants retained by my Department to conduct a study of the Irish Coast Guard made over 100 recommendations for the future development of the service having regard to international best practice and value for money. Reflecting modern communications technologies, one of the main recommendations was that the Coast Guard should operate two control centres as opposed to the three centres that exist at present. This approach will have the effect of achieving significant cost savings, thus enabling other elements of the Coast Guard service to be developed and this in turn leading to further improvements in our marine emergency response services nationally. My objective is that the remaining two centres at Valentia and Malin will be developed to handle all emergencies around our coast, on inland waters and in relation to mountain, cliff and cave rescue. Communications technology today is such that the geographical location of the co-ordination centres is less important now than in the past and, in this context, Government policies on decentralisation from Dublin are also relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to emphasise that the decision to close the Dublin centre will not affect the emergency response resources on the ground. For example, the Coast Guard operates three medium lift marine emergency helicopters out of Shannon, Dublin and Waterford airports, it supports over fifty coastal search and rescue units and it co-ordinates a number of declared resources, including the RNLI lifeboats, nine community inshore rescue service boats and an Air Corps SAR helicopter based at Sligo Airport. <Col N="1601" /> All of these resources will remain available to the Irish Coast Guard on a 24 hour basis all year round.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by staff, and as part of the closure arrangements discussions are taking place between my Department and staff representatives. My objective is that these discussions can be brought to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>At the meeting of the interdepartmental committee on science and technology in January 2003, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment requested that a European research area (ERA) steering group be established. My Department is participating in this steering group the role of which is to assess the implications of key emerging ERA policy initiatives and prepare action plans for progressing priority areas. Through the ERA initiative and other associated initiatives, the EU intends to become the world's leading knowledge economy by 2010 and is seeking to achieve average gross expenditure on research and development of 3% of GDP across the union by 2010 with two thirds of the increased investment coming from industry. This reflects concern that a key area of weakness in the EU innovation system is the absorptive capacity of industry. However, research capacity is also acknowledged to be a problem.</P>
      <P>Investment in research and development is increasingly recognised as an <i>entrée</i> to innovation, and as such, a key driver in the development of the knowledge economy. Through its participation in this group, my Department is contributing to the development of an action plan to ensure that the telecommunications industry remains innovative and competitive and has access to requirements in terms of research and development for the future. The Department will further ensure that this takes place in the context of the ERA initiative.</P>

      <P>The total capacity tendered in the 113 applications received under AER VI in the onshore wind category was in excess of 1,000 MW. I was only in a position to offer support to 485 MW in this category and I am urgently seeking EU clearance for a further 140 MW from the reserve list which is published. This will bring support for wind energy on the grid to 800 MW. In County Cavan three projects with a total capacity of 43.5 MW were successful in the competition. No proposals were submitted to build projects in County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The support programme operates at the national level and the competitive process does not discriminate in favour or against any particular region or county. The priority is to support those projects which will operate most economically so as to ensure the consequential public service obligation levy imposed on all electricity customers is the minimum necessary to deliver the targets in each published category. I will shortly commence a consultative process about future support for renewable energy.</P>

      <P>I am finalising proposals at this time for the establishment of a new independent safety agency to take responsibility for all aspects of marine safety and emergency response. My objective is to bring these proposals to Government as quickly as <Col N="1603" /> possible with a view to getting the agency up and running without delay.</P>
      <P>The agency will, among other things, bring together safety services currently provided by the Irish Coast Guard and the maritime safety directorate of my Department. As a regulatory body, the agency will have a wide range of licensing functions relating to the operation of vessels in Irish waters and Irish registered vessels operating in international waters; it will play a central role in all aspects of search and rescue in both marine and inland areas; it will address ship and port security requirements on foot of recent international agreements in the International Maritime Organisation and the EU; it will promote measures to prevent pollution from oil tankers in our territorial waters; and it will maintain the national shipping registers relating to all vessel and craft types, including a new register for leisure craft.</P>
      <P>The agency will give a high priority to programmes to promote safety awareness by the public with the objective of creating a maritime safety culture generally. Of particular importance, the agency will also give priority to the enforcement of safety regulations across the board.</P>
      <P>Through establishing the agency, I want to move the marine safety agenda onto a new plane where there is greater public awareness of and personal responsibility for safety and I want to promote a more streamlined and effective delivery of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the wearing of life jackets by everybody on small open craft as an essential element in staying safe on the water. Addressing the unacceptable practice of individuals using vessels without wearing a life jacket has been at the top of my safety agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the many statements I have issued over the past year urging members of the public to take personal responsibility for their own safety through wearing a life jacket, the Coast Guard, as part of my Department's 2003 safety awareness programme, undertook an intensive public safety awareness campaign across the summer months on the radio and through other media, focusing on the wearing of life jackets for all water based activities. Reports from the Coast Guard that an increase in the wearing of <Col N="1604" /> life jackets was noticeable this year suggests that the public is responding to the safety advice. However, we need to continue with our efforts until everybody accepts the safety message. The Coast Guard is planning a similar public awareness campaign for 2004.</P>
    <P>As part of a review of safety on small water craft which I initiated last year, I issued a consultation paper dealing with carrying and wearing life jackets. Following an assessment of the very significant number of responses received from the public, I announced on 1 August 2003 that I will introduce new regulations to strengthen the current provisions in relation to the carrying and wearing of life jackets. Currently, life jackets must be worn by commercial fishermen while on deck, by children up to the age of 16 on mechanically propelled pleasure craft, by jet-ski operators, and on certain categories of small commercial passenger boats. I have decided that under the new regulations a life jacket will have to be carried for everyone on board a vessel and, in the case of small open craft, all occupants will be obliged to wear a life jacket. My objective is to have the new regulations in place in 2004 and I also intend to publicise widely the requirements under these regulations.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that the maritime safety directorate will prepare a new safety code of practice for pleasure craft, which will be given statutory effect. The code will specify the conditions in which life jackets should be worn, particularly on larger leisure vessels, and other important safety features and practices which should be observed on all vessels. The directorate will undertake a public consultation process as part of the process of preparing the code.</P>

      <P>Revised charges were introduced in respect of the five fishery harbour centres &ndash; Howth, Rossaveel, Castletownbere, Killybegs and Dunmore East &ndash; with effect from 1 October 2003. Details of the revised charges are set out in the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates and Charges) Order 2003, SI No. 439 of 2003.</P>
      <P>The harbours operate under the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts 1968 to 1998. The Act requires the harbours to fully meet their costs from rates, tolls and other charges. The charges at fishery harbour centres were last increased in 1990. The 2002 draft accounts for the harbours show an operating deficit of &euro;544,990 and the accumulated deficit stands at &euro;1.2 million.</P>
      <P>The proposed charges were published on 21 May 2003 with a statutory consultation period of 21 days, which ended on 10 June 2003. Prior to publication, the charges were advised to the representatives of the main fishing organisations at a meeting on 20 May 2003. A subsequent meeting was held in July with representatives of the harbours and the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without a significant increase in income the deficit was set to rise rapidly as staff and other <Col N="1606" /> operating costs are increasing and the good management of the harbours requires increased operating expenditure. It is important to point out that the Exchequer totally subvents the capital costs for developing the harbours under the fishery harbours development programme. This programme cost the Exchequer &euro;30 million in 2003.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the concerns raised by various representative organisations and individuals during the public consultation process and have made substantial modifications to the original proposal. The bottom line, however, is that the fund must be self-financing, without further recourse to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>As I advised the House before the summer recess, the monitoring of activities in waters within Ireland's exclusive economic zone, including the Irish Box, is undertaken by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, agencies of the Department of Defence. My Department is kept informed routinely as to <Col N="1607" /> the trends and levels of activities detected in these waters. Particular attention has been, and continues to be, paid to vessel activities within the Irish Box as this area has been the subject of particular fisheries measures.</P>
      <P>The Irish authorities are continuing to monitor closely activity within the Irish Box. In relation to the specific restriction on the number of Spanish vessels permitted within the Irish Box at any one time, the number has remained below the 40 vessels threshold in the relevant EU regulations.</P>
      <P>This matter was not discussed at the EU Fisheries Council on 22 July as the Italian Presidency considered that the issue warranted further detailed discussion and technical analysis in the relevant Council working group. The issue, however, is to be discussed again at next Monday's Fisheries Council in Luxembourg and I will be pressing strongly for the matter to be finalised at that Council.</P>
      <P>The Italian Presidency has recently tabled a compromise which moves considerably forward from the Commission's proposal of last December but in my view it does not adequately address all of our concerns. We are continuing to work on securing necessary improvements to the compromise proposal in order to ensure that fish stocks in the waters around our coast receive the necessary level of protection.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the licensing of sea fishing boats for commercial fishing. I recently introduced new policy proposals for sea fishing boat licensing. The discussion document concerned, which is available on my Department's Internet website, contains a range of proposals in relation to the licensing of sea fishing boats. These include proposed replacement capacity requirements, which relate to the tonnage and engine power capacity required to be provided before vessels could be licensed.</P>
      <P>The new licensing policy proposals arose from the introduction of a new fleet management policy at EU level, and have regard to the overall capacity situation of the Irish fleet. The new policy proposals are designed to ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that capacity currently held by fishermen &ldquo;off-register&rdquo; can be reintroduced into the fleet, and that binding EU fleet capacity limits are complied with.</P>
      <P>The new policy proposals have been the subject of consultation with the industry. Having considered the views put forward, I propose to shortly finalise and introduce the new licensing policy. Details of the new policy will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> as required under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003. That Act has established an independent licensing authority, which will implement the new sea fishing boat licensing policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The telecommunications sector in Ireland is fully liberalised, with private companies offering services under the regulation of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. My Department has overall responsibility for telecommunications policy. With regard to broadband uptake in Ireland, this will be determined by the relative factors of supply and demand.</P>
      <P>With regard to supply, there are a number of competing technological platforms for delivery of broadband in Ireland, including fibre, cable, satellite, digital subscriber lines and wireless, including wireless local area networks. While in the main it is expected that private sector investment will lead to the deployment of these platforms throughout Ireland, under the e-commerce and communications measure of the National Development Programme 2000-06 an indicative &euro;200 million has been set aside for telecommunications infrastructural developments in areas where private sector investment is lacking. To date this investment, which is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, has supported a comprehensive programme of development, including metropolitan area fibre networks, new national fibre trunk lines, and extension of digital subscriber lines to 1.2 million telephone lines by mid-2004.</P>
      <P>With regard to demand, it is quite evident that there is latent demand from both consumer and business for broadband services. Evidence of this includes: the EU Flash Barometer report places residential Internet penetration in Ireland at fourth in the EU, with the predominant method of home Internet access by standard telephone line &ndash; 91% &ndash; followed by ISDN &ndash; 6%; and Internet penetration among SMEs is running at 84%, with ISDN as the predominant access technology, followed by standard telephone line, leased line and digital subscriber line.</P>
      <P>Turning this latent demand into high broadband uptake figures requires competitive pricing by service providers. Recent developments, particularly in the DSL market, demonstrate that companies understand this dynamic, and are, as a consequence, lowering the price to consumers and businesses.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that the figures taken from the ITU report relate to broadband uptake in 2002. Developments in the Irish market during the course of 2003 would suggest that broadband penetration is now increasing rapidly, and I have no doubt that Ireland will be shown to have moved substantially further up the scale in any comparative study for the current year.</P>

      <P>I am assured by the Commission for Energy Regulation that sufficient measures are being taken to ensure security of electricity supply in this country. Black outs can occur due to network failure or insufficient generating capacity on the system. In the case of the electricity networks, the ESB is currently undertaking a significant investment programme, amounting to some &euro;4 billion up to 2007 to bring the transmission and distribution systems up to the required international standards and to meet projected capacity demand requirements. The ESB advises me that the programme is being delivered within the planned timeframe and budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation has initiated a number of positive actions to redress the postulated generation capacity shortfalls in the short-term and the medium to longer term, as forecast by the ESB national grid in its most recent generation adequacy report. Measures <Col N="1612" /> which have been put in place to meet short-term capacity requirements include the implementation by the ESB national grid of a demand side management programme that will be operational for the coming winter; increased imports of electricity under contract from Northern Ireland which are currently operational, together with the purchase by the ESB of 104MW of additional peaking capacity which is expected to be in use from 1 January 2004.</P>
    <P>With regard to the capacity deficit in the medium to longer term, the CER is holding a competition for the award of contracts for up to 531MW to be announced in December next. This will facilitate the entry to the market of additional generation capacity at the earliest date achievable.</P>
    <P>The recent statements by the CER, referred to in the question appear to stem from its response to a discussion paper issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the subject of a strategy to reduce emissions. These statements are not a forecast of what will happen in practice and should not be cited out of context.</P>

      <P>When the Central Fisheries Board published the economic-socio-economic evaluation of wild salmon in Ireland, which it commissioned from Indecon, international economic consultants, I asked that the board obtain the views of stakeholders to the publication with a view to identifying areas of consensus. I have been informed by the board that it hopes to submit its report by mid November 2003.</P>
      <P>As previously stated to this House, my overriding objective is to preserve the salmon resource in its own right and for the coastal and rural communities that it helps to support. The economic goals for a sustainable commercial salmon fishery based on quality and value rather than volume and also the development of salmon angling as an important tourism product are both fully compatible with the primary objective.</P>
      <P>There is already a regime of measures, which are being implemented through the central and regional fisheries boards, the aim of which is to first and foremost allow adequate spawning stock into our rivers through the establishment of and adherence to conservation limits. I hope that if we act collectively in a responsible manner to protect the salmon resource over the short-term, we will enhance its sustainability over the longer term to the benefit of all who depend on it. I have been urging all to support the quota reductions and bag limits on recreational anglers based on the science and socio-economic needs of the commercial sector. The Indecon evaluation now provides a greater and more up to date insight into the economic and socio-economic value of wild salmon.</P>

      <P>Monitoring and inspection of fish farms is carried out by my Department with the advice and assistance of the Marine Institute. Each marine fish farm is inspected 14 times a year by Marine Institute staff in connection with monitoring and control of sea lice levels, in accordance the terms of a protocol published by my Department in 2000. One inspection is carried out in the period December to January, two inspections per month are carried out at farms during February to May, and one inspection per month is undertaken during the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of fish health at each fish farm is also undertaken by the Marine Institute and involves at least one inspection of each farm each year. As part of this programme, samples of fish are screened for viruses and bacterial infection, as well as certain parasites. A sampling and monitoring programme for residues is carried out by the Marine Institute each year in accordance with EU Directive 96/23. The programme involves monitoring for a wide range of residues, including antibiotics and environmental contaminants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspections of fish farms are also carried out periodically by officials of my Department. For example, 35 inspections of marine finfish farm <Col N="1616" /> sites and 24 inspections of freshwater sites were carried out in the year to end September by the Department's engineering division. In addition, fish farms operations are scrutinised through returns and reports that are required to be made to my Department by the companies concerned.</P>

      <P>The Dooish exploration well, which was drilled last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland off the Donegal coast and which discovered a hydrocarbon accumulation, was re-entered and deepened this summer. Drilling commenced on 11 May 2003 and the well was plugged and abandoned having confirmed the existence of a substantial gas condensate column. The rig moved off-site on 30 July 2003.</P>
      <P>Both my Department and Shell-Enterprise Energy Ireland are continuing to analyse the well results and integrate them with other data from the area. Further technical work on the prospect will be required before the size of the gas condensate accumulation and the possibility for any commercial development can be accurately assessed. However, it is extremely encouraging that this well, only the second to be drilled in the Rockall Basin, proved to be such a significant discovery, and my Department has emphasised the positive implications of this discovery for the prospectivity of the basin as a whole. No further oil or gas exploration occurred during the summer months of this year.</P>
      <P>The Cong exploration well is currently being drilled in the Erris Basin, approximately 60 km off the Mayo coast and some 20 km north-east of the Corrib gas field. Drilling began on this exploration well by Statoil in the Erris Basin on 5 August 2003.</P>
      <P>There have been a total of three seismic surveys carried out offshore Ireland this year, all off the west coast. However, one of these surveys was abandoned following damage to equipment. The results of the surveys are not yet available due to the highly technical processing required for this type of data.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations, it is not illegal for fishermen to engage in the practice of clawing crabs <i>per se.</i> For catches of crabs made by pots or creels, a maximum of 1% by weight of the total catch of crabs, may be retained onboard as claws during any fishing voyage or landed at the end of any fishing voyage. For catches of crabs made by any fishing gear other than pots or creels, a maximum of 75 kg of detached crab claws may be retained on board at any moment during a fishing voyage or may be landed at the end of a fishing voyage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the processing of crabs, there is no legal limitation on whether claws are processed separately. There is a valuable market for both whole crabs and crabmeat products, including crab claws.</P>
      <P>The regulation limiting the amount of crab claws that may be landed by fishermen is monitored and controlled as part of a range of conservation regulations enforced by the sea fishery officers of my Department. There have been no prosecutions taken with regard to the landing of crab claws in the last five years. However, sea fishery officers have been checking the level of compliance with the regulation and acting according to the results of the inspections.</P>
      <P>The viability and sustainability of the crab fishery is of great concern to me and is being developed and protected within the framework of measures, including licensing, inspection, and management of inshore fisheries.</P>

      <P>In January 2003 the European Commission set out a work programme for its review of the television without frontiers directive. The work programme included an invitation from the Commission to all interested parties to make submissions to the Commission by 15 July 2003, based on a series of documents published on the Commission's website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a consultation with interested parties in the Irish television market, Ireland made a detailed submission to the Commission. A copy of the submission has been forwarded to Deputy O'Sullivan. One of the key issues addressed in Ireland's submission relates to the impact of sat<Col N="1618" /> ellite television broadcasting services that are regulated in one member state, but intended for reception primarily in another member state.</P>
    <P>Ireland has suggested that the directive should be amended to ensure that a broadcasting service originating in one member state, but intended primarily for reception in another member state, should be subject to the broadcasting standards of the member state at which it is primarily directed. In an Irish context, it is reasonable to expect that Irish broadcasting standards should be applied to television channels intended primarily for reception in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Based on the results of the consultation process the Commission will publish a communication on the future of audio-visual policy together with proposals to amend the directive if appropriate. The Commission expects to publish the communication in late 2003 or early 2004.</P>

      <P>The provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market, with reference to the direction and supervision of the Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
      <P>Currently, a basic telephone connection allows normal speed dial-up to the Internet in any area. Higher rates of access, such as those provided by digital subscriber lines, wireless, fibre optic or satellite-based systems, are available on the market from a number of licensed telecommunications service providers. A full list of providers is available from the commission's office, Irish Life Mall, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1 or from the website <i>http://www.comreg.ie</i>To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. These programmes have been designed following consultation and support from the various development agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, &euro;26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects to a total value of &euro;70 million were supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, an indicative &euro;200 million has been set aside <Col N="1622" /> under the e-commerce and telecommunications measure, to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services and to enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities. This investment, which is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, addresses the infrastructural deficit caused by the private sector companies' lack of resources for investment, and supports a comprehensive programme of development of metropolitan area fibre networks, new national fibre trunk lines, and extension of digital subscriber lines to 1.2 million telephone lines by mid-2004.</P>
    <P>My Department is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects, utilising VSAT and Wireless LAN technologies are under way in a number of locations countrywide, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services.. The results of these trials are expected to be available by year end.</P>

      <P>As I advised the House in my reply of 11 June 2003 to Question No. 119, the agreement of the purchasers is not required to finalise payments to the Exchequer in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the terms of the sale, which involved the retention by the INPC of the company's existing debt and a number of other <Col N="1623" /> responsibilities having financial implications, it is estimated that the final net return to the Exchequer will be between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million. Of this amount, which represents a very positive financial outcome for the State, INPC has already paid &euro;20 million to the Exchequer. The company is not yet in a position to definitively determine and pay over the final balance because a number of outstanding matters have still to be resolved. These matters, comprising chiefly environmental claims and a contractual dispute, have potential financial implications. Until these matters have been finalised the INPC, having regard to the Companies Acts, will not be in a position to divest itself of its remaining financial assets.</P>
    <P>The environmental claims were lodged by IPCL, the purchasers of the INPC' s businesses and commercial assets in July 2001, in respect of certain remedial works at the site of the refinery at Whitegate. The details of these claims are a day-to-day matter for the INPC and it is not appropriate for me to elaborate on them or their merits at this stage. The contractual dispute referred to is a commercial dispute with a former customer and also a day-to-day matter. Because of the close involvement of third parties in the unresolved matters, neither INPC nor my Department can say when the remaining proceeds will be made available to the Exchequer. However, I am hopeful that a further, though not necessarily final, payment may be made before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The operation of jet-skis and other high powered leisure water craft in areas where bathing takes place, in harbours and other places frequented by water users has been a matter of particular concern for me. Since taking office I have implemented a number of measures to address this matter.</P>
      <P>At present there are two sets of regulations, introduced in 2001, which contain specific national provisions governing the safe use of jet skis and similar craft. These regulations include provisions in relation to age restrictions for operators, the carriage and use of life jackets and restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs while operating one of these craft. The regulations also provide for careless and dangerous navigation and operation offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> I have recently brought forward proposals to amend the fishery harbour centres Acts to increase penalties for breaches of fishery harbour centre by-laws. The proposals will also provide for stronger controls on jet-skis and other high-powered craft that could endanger life and seriously prejudice the proper operation of the fishery harbours.</P>
    <P>A key objective of mine is that local authorities should adopt local by-laws for the safe operation of jet-skis in their areas of responsibility and, to this end, my Department have been encouraging all local authorities to adopt suitable by-laws. To date, eight local authorities have done so and a number of others are considering them. However, a legal issue has arisen regarding the making of these by-laws in respect of water areas not directly under the control of a local authority. My Department is in discussions at this time with officials from the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the matter. I have requested the Department to bring forward proposals as quickly as possible to enable local authorities to adopt regulations in regard to the operation of jet-skis in any waters within their jurisdiction where such controls are considered desirable.</P>

      <P>Following protracted and difficult negotiations at last December's Fisheries Council, agreement was ultimately reached by EU Ministers on a new basic Common Fisheries Policy regulation. This new regulation will govern EU fisheries policy over the next decade and accordingly the question of considering alternative strategies to that framework does not arise.</P>
      <P>Ireland participated in the reform process in an extremely active manner and the reform package finally agreed contains many of the recommendations of Ireland's national strategy review group. In this regard, it is appropriate to draw particular attention to an action plan to address the problem of the discarding of juvenile fish catches, stronger control and enforcement, continued recognition of Ireland's entitlements for additional quotas under the so-called &lsquo;Hague Preferences' and new regional advisory councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.</P>
      <P>Throughout the CFP reform process, intensive consultation was maintained by my Department with all of the leading players in the Irish fishing industry. I believe that this high level of consultation played a significant role in ensuring the best possible outcome in all the circumstances from an Irish perspective.</P>
      <P>Now that the overall legislative framework is in place for the next decade, the immediate challenges concern the implementation of a series of regulations giving effect to the new CFP. A new fleet management EU policy was adopted in August 2003, which has to a significant extent taken account of Ireland's situation and requirements. My Department will continue to consult closely with the Irish fishing industry in order to ensure that the implementing regulations, following on the agreed legislative framework, take appropriate account of Ireland's particular situation and needs into the future.</P>

      <P>My Department did not take specific advice in relation to the issue raised in the question. AER VI is the sixth in a series of competitions conducted under the AER programme. The initial competition, AER I, was conducted by the ESB. Subsequently the ESB declared an interest in participating as an applicant in future competitions.</P>
      <P>Legal advice was then taken and the ESB was excluded from any part in the selection process of subsequent AER competitive rounds. The terms and conditions of each subsequent AER competition were set by my Department and scrutinised by independent legal advisers. No concern was expressed about the ESB's participation.</P>
      <P>The ESB has participated in previous AER competitions without attracting adverse comment from a legal or competition point of view. The European Commission has had ample opportunity to raise issues of this kind and thus far has not done so.</P>

The author made a presentation of his report to my Department and also I understand to the Department of Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The report makes a worth<Col N="1627" /> while contribution to the debate on forest policy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The funding allocation for forestry in 2004 will be decided in the context of the Estimates process which is currently under way. In the latter context, the House should be aware of the high historic and future cost of forestry, if existing policies are to be maintained. For example, &euro;613 million, or an average of about &euro;88 million per annum, has been spent on forestry since 1997 and, if existing policies were to continue, annual average costs, assuming respectively 10,000 and 20,000 hectares per annum, would be &euro;100 million per annum and &euro;130 million per annum over the next three years. By 2020 the annual costs of meeting the Sustaining Progress targets of 20,000 hectares per annum could be over &euro;210 million per annum.</P>

      <P>The 2003 IEA in-depth review of the energy policies of Ireland was undertaken by a team of energy policy specialists drawn from the member countries of the IEA. The review process occurs every four years and comprises a critical assessment of the country's performance against the IEA's shared goals evaluation criteria, which include energy efficiency, flexibility, open markets and environmental sustainability.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report particularly as it highlights the fact that Ireland has made excellent progress on market reform in the electricity and natural gas sectors and this ultimately will encourage the growth of a cheaper, more secure energy sector. However, the review also shows that further efforts are needed to deliver more comprehensive market reform in electricity by ensuring the unimpeded entry of new competitors and in addressing the dominance of the incumbent utility. Achieving market reform, energy security and climate change mitigation simultaneously is also a major challenge.</P>
      <P>This review, which offers an independent, outside perspective on Irish energy policy, will be a valuable resource, contributing an expert, objective view which will make a significant contribution to ongoing policy formulation in the energy sector.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to the organisation Women In The Home. In inviting organisations which had sought inclusion in social partnership to make their case for inclusion, the criteria for recognition by Government as social partners were set out that organisations be national and representative in nature, have the capacity to meet the demands and obligations that arise as part of this participation and add to the capacity of the social partnership process to address issues effectively. Following consideration, Government decided that Women In The Home did not meet the criteria.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the review of models of participation provided for in An Agreed Programme For Government, Government invited nine organisations to join the social partnership process. I can assure those organisations which have not been admitted to the process that their views and experiences are and will continue to be taken into account by Departments and agencies in the consultative process, outside the framework of social partnership. It is only possible for those who are social partners to have a role in implementing Sustaining Progress.</P>

Statistics <Col N="1631" /> on employment and unemployment are compiled, at a regional level, from the quarterly national household survey. The latest statistics show that there were 10,800 people classified as unemployed in the south-east region in the March-May quarter of 2003. The south-east region consists of Counties Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, South Tipperary, Waterford and Waterford city. Sub-regional statistics, of the kind requested by the Deputy, are not available from the quarterly national household survey.</P>
      <P>Figures for the south-east region from 1996 to 2003 inclusive, from the annual labour force surveys 1996 and 1997, and the quarterly national household survey, Q2 1998 to Q2 2003 are as follows:&ndash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other claimants registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. A breakdown by postal district is not available. The most recent information available is for September 2003. It should be noted that: a) the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit &ndash; statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the quarterly national household survey; b) the exact area covered by each local office is not limited to the immediate locality of the particular office. For instance, in the Tallaght local office there may be registered, persons from the Blessington area.</P>
    <P>The live register figures for the county of Wexford, and the local offices of Enniscorthy, Gorey, New Ross and Wexford town, from January 1996 to September 2003 are set out in the following tables:</P>

      <P>Terms and conditions of employment for construction workers working in Ireland are regulated by the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Wages and Conditions of Employment) Variation Order 1996 with effect from 17 June 1996 and Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Pensions Assurance and Sick Pay) Variation Order 1994 with effect from 10 October 1994. Because the variation order governing wages and conditions of employment has not been updated, due to legal difficulties, the going rate in the industry is much higher than that which is provided for in the 1996 variation order and legally enforceable.</P>
      <P>My Department has no reason to believe that the company in question is not compliant with its obligations under work permit requirements or wider aspects of employment law. I understand that the company's workforce is fully unionised and, should there be specific issues in dispute normal industrial relations machinery is available. However, if the Deputy is aware of any evidence to the contrary, my Department will examine such evidence carefully. The company in question has been the subject of allegations in the past, which, on investigation, were found to be without substance.</P>

      <P>While the provision of court facilities is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law reform, I understand that IDA Ireland was approached by the owners of the lease on the former Tellabs building in Drogheda for its views on whether it could consent to a change of use in relation to a portion of the building, approximately 10,000 sq. ft. for the purpose of a District Court. The IDA's consent is required for a change of use under the terms of the 999 year lease under which the building is held.</P>
      <P>The former Tellabs building in Drogheda is currently being marketed by IDA Ireland as part of its efforts to attract new overseas investments and jobs for the people of Drogheda and has been shown to 20 potential clients over the past two years. The agency's view is that the nature of the activities of a court would impact negatively on its ability to market the remainder of the building and that, as such, it would not be an appropriate use. IDA Ireland is continuing to market the building with the full support of the owners of the lease and two companies have expressed an interest in the building.</P>

      <P>From my Department's point of view the major problem for business identified by the Small Firms Association's survey was insurance costs. Many of the other issues raised are very wide ranging and fall within the areas of responsibility of different Ministers. The isurance reform programme seeks to bring about a reduction in insurance costs by the insurance industry, for the benefit of consumers and business. It is proposed to achieve this by: <Col N="1636" /> improving the functioning of the insurance market; decreasing the cost of delivery of compensation; and investigating the competitiveness of the market. I am chairing a committee comprising the Ministers for Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as well as the chairperson of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board to oversee the implementation of the reform programme. Initial indications are that the reform programme is having the desired effect. There has already been some downward movement in motor insurance premia, with more reductions in the pipeline. Reductions in relation to employer's liability and public liability insurance costs, which currently represent a significant burden for business in Ireland, are also expected.</P>
      <P>In general, the Government is well aware of the many problems facing small firms at present and is mindful of the continuing need to constantly improve all aspects of the business environment.</P>

A decision on the future funding and structure of CE and JI, including the recommended hours of participation, will be taken in the context of the Estimates provision for 2004, having regard to the outcome of the current review process, which is now nearing completion.

      <Quest> the total shortfall in funding grants sanctioned by county enterprise boards; if a separate allocation will be made to each board to cover grants already notified to small business and applications sanctioned and awaiting payment; the advice given to boards by her Department in relation to this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>Early this year my Department advised each city and county enterprise board, CEB, of its budget allocations for 2003, including funds to meet grant commitments. It is the responsibility of each board to manage within the funds provided. The Department also retained some limited funds to enable it address contingencies arising during the year.</P>
      <P>During the year my Department became aware that some boards were estimating that they would require additional funds if the grant commitments projected to fall due for payment before the end of the year were to materialise in full. It should be noted that it is not possible to estimate precisely the full extent and timing of all commitments as these are often contingent on the speed with which projects proceed. In addition, projects approved sometimes do not proceed leading to decommittals of grant approvals.</P>
      <P>In the light of the emerging situation, my Department has been reviewing the overall position and, based on the most up-to-date information available, it appears that in addition to the funds already allocated to them earlier in the year, the CEBs would require up to &euro;1.7 million extra to meet the estimated level of grant commitments, including grants to enterprise centres, likely to fall due for payment this year. The Department is currently in the process of determining the appropriate allocation of the additional funds available and is confident that each board will be in a position to meet all its commitments.</P>
      <P>In July this year my Department also instructed each CEB not to approve any new projects unless the projected drawdown for the year could be met from within the existing cash allocation to the board and the total commitments in respect of 2004 and later years did not exceed 50% of the cash allocation provided for the board for 2003. This instruction, which remains in place, should ensure that the pressures on the CEBs' funding are contained.</P>

      <Quest> the progress in relation to the resolution of outstanding issues with the union representing the employees of a company (details supplied) in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, relating to the closure of the plant and the financial entitlements of the workers; the action which has been taken to attract new industry to the area and to assist those unemployed now to gain employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The position is that the company concerned made 153 workers at its factory redundant mostly in December 2002 and January 2003. The company paid them their statutory redundancy lump sum entitlements plus some extra statutory amounts. My Department has repaid the company its entitlement to a 60% rebate of the statutory amount.</P>
      <P>I understand the workers and their representatives feel they lost out on payment of the new enhanced statutory redundancy lump sum by virtue of the fact that the Redundancy Payments Act 2003 was not backdated. The clear legal advice to me from the Office of the Attorney General is that it is not legally allowable to place a retrospective requirement on employers to make additional enhanced payments. In this particular case the workers were made redundant and paid their entitlements towards the end of last year and early this year, but the new enhanced redundancy rates were subsequently agreed with the social partners and given legislative effect by the Oireachtas with effect from 25 May last, when I signed the required commencement order. I regret that the workers concerned and other workers have not been able to benefit from the increased redundancy payments. However, I cannot change the legal position nor can I make special legislative provisions for any particular group of persons.</P>
      <P>A further 13 employees were made redundant without notice from the company concerned on 26 June 2003. I am pleased that these employees benefited from the new redundancy rates and were paid directly from the social insurance fund. A total of &euro;48,835 has been paid to the liquidator under the insolvency payments scheme for arrears of holiday pay and minimum notice payments on behalf of 17 employees.</P>
      <P>Following the redundancies in Castlecomer, a Castlecomer area employment advisory forum has been established. The forum is chaired by the county manager and has local and State agency representation. A business development executive has been recruited and employed by the county enterprise board with support from Enterprise Ireland and FÁS. A business development action plan for the Castlecomer area has been drawn up and a work programme has been agreed. One to one interviews have taken place with the redundant workers to identify employment and training needs. Training courses have been provided in information technology, forklift driving and planning for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national spatial strategy aimed at creating more successful and balanced regional development, Kilkenny was nominated as a hub. The awarding of hub status will benefit both the city and surrounding towns, including Castlecomer. Four international service projects involving almost 750 jobs have been announced for <Col N="1639" /> Kilkenny since July 2000, thereby enhancing Kilkenny's profile as the leading regional software and financial services location in the south east.</P>

      <P>The unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was commented upon by the Gleeson commission in its report in 1990. The matter had also been of serious concern to the military authorities for a number of years. The age profile was also the subject of severe criticism by Price Waterhouse consultants who had been engaged by the efficiency audit group, EAG, to conduct an in-depth study of the Defence Forces. One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis with a Reserve Force commitment of seven years. The recruitment of personnel on five year contracts was introduced following consultation with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Rep<Col N="1640" /> resentative Association, PDFORRA. In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for private soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of 12 years. Any extension was subject to the individual soldier meeting certain criteria to include standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for junior and senior non-commissioned officers. The new policy represented a substantial improvement for personnel who would otherwise have had to leave after five years service while continuing to address the issues of age profile and fitness levels in the Defence Forces. I am satisfied with these existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>PDFORRA has submitted a claim under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994. As discussions on issues raised under the conciliation and arbitration scheme are confidential to the parties concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

    <P>On a more general point, it should be noted that under EU harmonised rules, imports into the European Union from third countries must have been sourced in premises and in countries which are approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EU's Food and Veterinary Office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks on import laid down in harmonised rules prescribed at European level and must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export. Where required, sampling for laboratory analysis for the purpose of safeguarding human and animal health is carried out.</P>

      <P>The holding of the person named was selected for an on-the-spot inspection in accordance with normal control procedures. This process has now been fully completed. The person named claimed a total area of 73 hectares but it was established that he was only entitled to claim 70.51 hectares. This resulted in an over-claim of <Col N="1643" /> 2.49 hectares or 3.53%. Under EU rules, where an applicant makes an area over-claim of between 3% and 20%, a penalty of double the difference must be applied in determining the area eligible for payment purposes. Therefore, after application of the penalty, an area of 65.53 hectares was determined for this herdowner's 2003 area aid. However, no penalty may arise if the named person remains within the limit of 1.8 livestock units per hectare in respect of animals applied for under the 2003 livestock premium schemes. Payment of his full entitlement under the 2003 area-based compensatory allowance scheme on the maximum of 45 hectares will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 to 210, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The agreement reached by the Council of Ministers on 26 June 2003 on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy provided, in the case of cattle, sheep and arable crops, for full decoupling of direct payments and for a number of options for partial decoupling. In early July, I launched a consultation process in which I invited the social partners and the wider public to submit their views on the most appropriate arrangements to apply in the Irish context. My Department has received 198 submissions, the majority of which are from individuals expressing concern about the impact of the Council's decisions on their own situations. The submissions were invited to assist me in the decision-making process and I do not propose to publish them. I am examining the submissions received at present with a view to making a decision in relation to these sectors in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of direct payments in the dairy sector, while the relevant Council regulation provides for full decoupling only, it allows certain discretion to member states to decide on the timing of its introduction. In the interest of clarity, and to allow producers to take informed decisions in the period ahead about the sale and acquisition of quota and land and associated investment decisions, and having taken into account the views expressed to me by representatives of dairy producers, I have decided that full decoupling in <Col N="1646" /> the dairy sector should take effect from 1 January 2005. In order to ensure a consistent approach across the sectors, I have decided that the arrangements in the cattle, sheep and arable sectors, when decided upon, will also apply from 1 January 2005.</P>

      <P>Under the relevant EU regulation, extensification premium cannot be paid where the stocking density of the holding is greater than 1.8 livestock units per hectare. Based on the numbers of bovine animals over the age of six months declared by the person named as being present on his holding at each of the five census dates, the stocking density of the holding was found to have been 1.9157 livestock units per hectare. A cross-check against the CMMS animal database had also shown the stocking density to have been 1.9157 livestock units per hectare.</P>
      <P>In July last, a letter was sent to the person named informing him that since the stocking density of his holding was greater than 1.8 livestock units per hectare, he could not be considered for payment of 2002 extensification premium.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the reason there is such a long time lapse between the identification of dates under the census system for extensification and the subsequent information being conveyed to farmers participating in the scheme; the person who makes these decisions; if his attention has been drawn to the huge managerial problems the delay in conveying the message to farmers causes to the farming community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22214/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the relevant EU Commission regulation, census dates must be distributed throughout the year in such a way as to be representative of the entire year. The regulation also stipulates that census dates must be changed annually and that they cannot be announced until at least two weeks after their passing.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that farmers are made aware of each census date within the earliest possible time after its passing, while at the same time complying with the two week's waiting time, I issue a press release immediately after the two week period has passed. The press release is widely covered in the farming press both in newsprint and on radio.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that animal movement transactions that occur in the period immediately prior to each census date are updated on the CMMS animal database prior to the extraction for the preparation of the herd profiles, it is not possible to commence data extraction until a period of three weeks after a census date has elapsed. If data extraction were to commence any earlier, herd profiles issuing to farmers would be less accurate. The extraction of data for each census date involves the bringing together of some 6.5 million animal records for the printing of herd profiles by livestock unit value using eartag numbers and dates of birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For each census date approximately 122,000 herd profiles with accompanying notification letters issue to farmers. In addition, census date notification letters alone issue to another 7,000 or so farmers who do not have any bovine animals over the age of six months on their holdings on a particular census date. It takes up to 240 hours constant computer running time &ndash; ten days at 24 <Col N="1648" /> hours per day &ndash; to extract the data. When prepared the data is passed to a printing contractor who must format it before he can proceed to print herd profiles and notification letters.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it can be seen that the issuing of herd profiles is an extremely complicated and lengthy process. I do not accept that the delay in issuing herd profiles causes undue hardship on farmers as they are in a position to check the situation of their own farms when I announce the passing of census dates.</P>

Beef products sourced in the UK must be from designated processing plants prior to export. Supplies of beef from third countries can be imported into the EU on payment of EU tariffs or under certain agreed preferential quotas operated under the WTO. A condition of entry to the EU is that the beef must meet all EU veterinary and hygiene standards.</P>

      <P>Following the discovery of the disease in the UK in May 2002, the European Commission introduced emergency measures that came into force on 1 November 2002. These measures included the application of the plant passport system to plants of rhododendron spp, other than Rhododendron simsii, and plants of viburnum.</P>
      <P>In addition, member states were obliged to carry out a survey for the pathogen with a view to having the results and findings submitted to the Commission before 1 November 2003. The survey in Ireland is ongoing but should be completed before the deadline. I propose to arrange to make the conclusions of the survey available to interested parties as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish position on GMOs, as set out in the report of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology in October 2000, is one of being positive but precautionary. Over the past year a series of legislative measures on GMOs has been adopted by the EU aimed at providing maximum protection for the citizens of Europe and the environment. This legislation covers: the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment; GM food and feed; GM labelling and traceability; and the co-existence of GM crops with conventional and organic crops. All of the legislation, with the exception of that on co-existence, is in the form of binding Community-wide regulations.</P>
      <P>On the issue of co-existence, a subsidiarity approach will apply where each member state will be responsible for drawing up its own national strategy. In this it will be assisted by guidelines prepared by the Commission. These co-existence guidelines were discussed at the Agriculture Council meeting held in Brussels on 29 September 2003.</P>
      <P>One of the issues being explored by the Presidency is the possibility of having GMO free zones among the range of measures required to facilitate co-existence. My position on this is that the establishment of such zones could be a practicable measure for ensuring co-existence taking cognisance of the structural and production conditions in each member state. This matter is currently being examined by a technical working group set up in my Department.</P>

      <P>The general EU requirement is that pre-<Col N="1652" /> packed meats sold at retail level must have an indication of the last premises in which the product was prepared or packed for retail sale. In the case of beef, there are specific requirements which go far beyond this and provide for a full traceability system from the retail sale right back to the farm of origin.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned about two issues in particular in relation to labelling of food. One of these relates to the question of enforcement of existing provisions and I have arranged for the centralisation of control of food labelling in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. A second issue is the scope of the existing EU beef labelling regulations and in this regard, I have raised with the European Commission the question of extending these to the catering sector. Obviously, consumer requirements are a key element in assessing the need to change or broaden existing labelling rules on meat, and I have asked the consumer liaison panel to carry out market research in this area. I expect to have the findings of this research in the coming month.</P>

Nineteen of these animals were heifers under 30 months of age and are therefore eligible for a top-up from the national envelope for the beef sector. In accordance with the EU regulations governing the slaughter premium scheme, advance payment of estimated entitlement will commence for both of these schemes from 16 October 2003. The balance of premium due will be paid in 2004 after the national quota position has been established and after completion of all checks.</P>

      <P>The main means of distributing milk quota in the 2003-04 milk quota year are: the milk quota restructuring scheme; the temporary leasing scheme; and the milk quota appeals tribunal schemes for hardship and animal disease cases.</P>
      <P>I announced the conditions for the distribution of milk under the 2003 milk quota restructuring scheme in the spring and they are set out in public notice 94/24. These conditions include a maximum price of 31 cent per litre &ndash;&euro;1.41 per gallon. The priority groups for allocation of quota are certain young farmers, producers whose available quota was reduced due to non-renewal of a land lease since 2000 and small and medium scale producers.</P>
      <P>The conditions for the distribution of milk under the temporary leasing scheme are set out in public notice 94/25 which is published in this week's farming press. The maximum price is 4 cent per litre. The conditions and priority categories are broadly similar to the restructuring scheme.</P>
      <P>I will be announcing the conditions for the milk quota appeal tribunal schemes for hardship and animal disease cases in the near future. The conditions are likely to be similar to those which applied in previous years.</P>

      <P>The Valuation Act 2001, which came into force on 2 May 2002, updated the process by which valuations are determined. The Valuation Act listed, in Schedule Four, the relevant property, which is not liable for rates. The principal grounds for exemption from rates relate to the use of a property for public purposes, charitable purposes and public worship. In the area of education, exemption is limited to schools funded wholly or mainly from the public purse which do not rely to a large extent on fees, and which are not conducted for profit. Consequently, commercial pre-schools and child care providers are currently liable for rates.</P>
      <P>This issue was considered carefully by the Government in the preparation of the legislation. The view I took at the time and which I still hold is that as more direct approaches to assisting the sector are already in place, child care facilities should continue to be liable for rates. It should also be recognised that ultimately the effect of removing any particular category of property from the valuation base is to increase the rates burden on other ratepayers which can in turn lead to increased pressure for further exemptions from other groups.</P>

      <P>New residential property is exempt from stamp duty for any owner-occupier, including first-time buyers, where it is less than 125 sq m. If a new house is more than 125 sq m, stamp duty is charged on the site value or one quarter of the total value of the property, whichever is the greater. With regard to the transfer of second-hand residential property, first-time buyers are exempt from stamp duty where the consideration is up to &euro;190,500 and they can avail of significantly reduced rates in stamp duty compared with other purchasers where the consideration is up to &euro;381,000.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of giving a total exemption from stamp duty on second-hand houses to first-time buyers for both Exchequer cost reasons and because there is no guarantee that the tax revenue thus forgone would accrue to the purchasers. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the stamp duty exemption for the transfer of second-hand residential property for first-time buyers had been raised in 2002 from the current threshold level of &euro;190,500 to a threshold level of &euro;250,000, the cost to the Exchequer would have been approximately &euro;13 million in that year. Any change to the current rates or thresholds associated with stamp duty on residential property for first-time buyers would have to be considered in the overall context of the 2004 budget and Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a preferential loan is a loan made to an employee by an employer, directly or indirectly, on which the employee pays no interest or interest at a rate lower than the specified rate. A preferential loan is a benefit-in-kind. An employee in receipt of such a benefit is chargeable to income tax on the difference between the interest actually paid and what that amount would be at specified rates of interest provided for in legislation. The current specified rates of interest are 4.5% in the case of loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief and 11% in all other cases.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 the specified rates have been reviewed before each budget to take account of the interest rates trends in the marketplace at that time and any adjustment is made in the subsequent Finance Act. In my last budget I reduced the specified rates on home loans from 5% to 4.5%, and from 12% to 11% in all other cases, which reflected the downward trend in interest rates. As with all taxation matters, these specified rates will be reviewed in the context of preparing for the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>The position is that, except where exemption is provided, employer-provided benefits are subject to income taxation. From 1 January 2004, such benefits will be brought within PAYE and subject to PRSI and the health levy. This treatment will ensure that, in general, employee remuneration, in whatever form provided, is treated similarly for tax and levy purposes. I have no current plans to amend the status of preferential loans.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners inform me that the full year net cost to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to projected 2004 incomes, of the change mentioned by the Deputy is estimated at roughly &euro;60 million. The personal tax credits mentioned in the question are assumed to be the basic tax credits available to single, widowed and married persons as well as the additional tax credit for lone parents. This estimate is provisional and is subject to revision.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Deputy that a move along the lines implicit in his question would mean that, among other things, over 290,000 income earners who are exempt from income tax at present would be obliged to pay tax at the standard rate and, would reverse to a large extent the progress made by the Government over the last six budgets with regard to removing those on low pay from the tax net and tackling disincentives to work. In addition, the revised regime, if implemented, would mean that the progressivity of the income tax system, that is the extent to which the tax burden increases more than proportionally with income, would be largely removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several publications which provide detailed information on Ireland's competitive position, including the publications of the National Competitiveness Council which reports to the Taoiseach. Many factors impact on competitiveness <Col N="1662" /> broadly defined. These include fiscal policy, income developments, competition and regulatory frameworks, infrastructure and labour market policies.</P>
      <P>As a small open economy which is highly integrated into the global economy through our strong trade and investment links, economic conditions in Ireland are largely determined by our ability to supply goods and services to our major trading partners. In this context, exposure to the recent appreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling has been much greater in Ireland than in other euro zone countries given the pattern of trade. The exposure has been greater in some parts of the traded sector than others. While wage growth is projected to decelerate this year, the rate of increase is likely to exceed that pertaining in most of our trading partners. The deterioration in our cost base, together with the appreciation of the euro, is continuing to have a detrimental impact on national competitiveness. Exporting sectors face difficulty, particularly the more labour intensive sectors such as traditional manufacturing which are very exposed to developments in the euro-sterling bilateral exchange rate.</P>
      <P>The economy has the capacity to grow at up to 5% per annum over the medium term. Achieving growth rates of this magnitude, however, is conditional upon, <i>inter alia,</i> improvements in competitiveness. It is vital that wages and costs evolve in line with the terms of Sustaining Progress. It is also important that wages developments closely reflect productivity growth, in the private and public sectors.</P>

      <P>The functions of the Minister for Finance in relation to national savings schemes were delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990. An Post operates these schemes on behalf of the NTMA. While I issue guidelines to the NTMA regarding the management of the national debt, including the operation of the national savings schemes, these would not cover the detailed administrative procedures within An Post. Such detail would not be appropriate to what are general policy guidelines concerning the exercise of delegated functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, informed by the NTMA that An Post has stated that delays which have been experienced by members of the public and their legal representatives in the processing of inquiries relating to savings accounts in the name of deceased persons arose because of industrial action by staff employed by An Post. The delays were exacerbated by an increase in public queries to the savings product division of An Post arising from communications relating to the dormant accounts legislation. The industrial relations issues were resolved last month and I understand that An Post has put additional resources in place to help clear the substantial backlog and is confident the backlog will be cleared in about six <Col N="1664" /> weeks. It will then be able to return to its normal turnaround time for handling this type of query.</P>
    <P>Other than delays associated with deceased cases I am informed that there are no delays in relation to other valuations or withdrawals of proceeds of savings bonds or the other savings services they operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Sustaining Progress agreement, the phasing of the benchmarking increases are set out. These are: 25% with effect from 1 December 2001; 50% of the increases from 1 January 2004 and 25% of the increases from 1 June 2005. However, payment of these increases, with the exception of the 25% from 1 December 2001 and the general round increases, is dependent on meeting the conditions set out in the agreement. These are the absence of industrial action and the achievement of the objectives of the modernisation agenda.</P>
      <P>The commitments to co-operation with change and modernisation in Sustaining Progress are more extensive and more specific than in the past. Strong verification arrangements have been put in place, in particular with a greater independent representation. The Government will pay the increases on the basis of the conditions set down in the agreement. It is determined that all of the commitments agreed in Sustaining Progress must be delivered by those to whom they apply. There can be no rolling back on any of these commitments and there will be no renegotiation of them. The agreement sets out the process to be followed for verification of achievement of the conditions necessary for payments to be made under the agreement. If any grades, sectors or organisations fail to agree on specific actions to achieve the commitments or, having so agreed, fail to deliver on them, they should not expect the verification process to decide that pay increases are warranted.</P>
      <P>I am confident that over the period of Sustaining Progress the quality of public services will improve and that there will be a period of stable industrial relations with no disruptions to the public service such as we have had in, for example, the health and education sectors in the recent past. If this happens, then the public will get good value for money from the public service pay increases, not just in the short-term but also continuing into the future. However, if the agreement is not adhered to then, quite simply, the money will not be paid. As I have mentioned before, benchmarking as a process holds out the prospect of a better system of pay determination in the public service and replaces the old irrational system based on relativities. As such, it brings benefits to settling public service pay.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to have an opportunity to visit the Irish Cultural Centre in Canton, near Boston, on 11 July. The centre is a remarkable achievement, a living testament to the vision and endeavour of a group of Irish emigrants who have made their homes in the Boston area. Founded in 1989, the centre acquired land in Canton and, over a number of years, by drawing on volunteer labour from the centre's leaders and the local lrish and Irish-American community, began the development of a beautiful 46 acre campus, the first phase of which was opened in October 1999.</P>
      <P>The current facility which I visited comprises top-class playing fields and stands, where Gaelic games, as well as men's and women's soccer and rugby are played. There is a wonderful playground for young children, and a substantial clubhouse. Here a wide range of cultural groups and clubs meet, classes of various kinds, including Irish language classes, are organised, theatrical and musical performances are staged and people of Irish heritage of all ages come together to enjoy themselves in congenial surroundings and keep Irish culture and traditions alive. At a reception there, I had the pleasure to meet very many of the centre's 4,000 or more members, who come from almost every county in Ireland and to hear what the centre means to them and their families and about their lives in the US.</P>
      <P>The centre's president, Mr. Mike O'Connor, led the development during phase 1 and supervised the remarkable volunteer construction effort. He showed me the plans and model for phase 2, which envisages the creation of a 75,000 sq ft building, housing a conference centre, performing arts centre, restaurant-function rooms, a library and genealogy centre and various meeting rooms. I was also briefed about the centre's efforts to build bridges with other ethnic communities in the area in the form of joint cultural and sporting events, some of which the Consulate General in Boston has been pleased to sponsor.</P>
      <P>I was deeply impressed by the Irish Cultural Centre in Canton and by the dedication and vision of those who have worked so hard to make it what it is today and what it hopes to accomplish in the years ahead. We in Ireland pay tribute to them for their outstanding achievements in the development of the centre and in the promotion of Irish culture and traditions in New England. As regards the provision of financial assistance, the centre would be welcome to apply to the Cultural Relations Committee at any time in respect of its cultural activities.</P>

      <P>Preparation for the Irish Presidency of the EU has been in hand since 2001 when two interdepartmental committees were established, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to co-ordinate the policy, programming and logistical aspects of Presidency planning. These groups report through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on EU affairs and the Cabinet sub-committee on European affairs. In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach chairs an interdepartmental group which is co-ordinating preparations for the spring European Council.</P>
      <P>A draft calendar of Council meetings during our Presidency was circulated to partners in July and has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library. Planning for meetings in Ireland is also well advanced and the list of these meetings has also deposited in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members. This calendar will be updated on a regular basis as further decisions regarding meetings are taken.</P>
      <P>The additional staff resources required for the Presidency have been assigned. Chairpersons for the many meetings which Ireland will be required to chair have been designated. A comprehensive training programme for staff was conducted over, the past 18 months, by the Centre for Management and Organisation Development at the Department of Finance and is now nearing completion. The logo for the Presidency has been chosen and work is well advanced on the development of our Presidency website.</P>
      <P>We are working with the other five Presidencies for the period 2004-06, namely, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Austria and Finland, on a draft three year multi-annual strategic programme for the Council which is due to be adopted, following consideration in the General Affairs and External Relations Council, at the European Council in December 2003. We are also working intensively with The Netherlands on the annual operating programme for the Council for 2004, which is to be drawn up jointly by the Irish and Netherlands Presidencies and submitted to the General Affairs and External Relations Council in December 2003. Work on the development of the Irish Presidency programme is ongoing. It will have to be consistent with the annual and multi-annual programmes and take account of progress made under the Italian Presidency. It is expected to be finalised after the European Council in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, particular effort has been made to step up contacts at all levels with the EU institutions, our partners in the member states and accession countries and key partners around the <Col N="1668" /> world. Over the past few months, I have met many of my counterparts from the ten accession states and have discussed plans and priorities for our Presidency. I have also just come back from attending the UNGA week in New York where, as a member of the EU Troika, I participated in a range of meetings with the Foreign Ministers of the US, Russia, Japan, China, Sri Lanka, the San Jose group of Central American countries and the Andean group and the Gulf states.</P>
    <P>I am confident we are well positioned to take on our Presidency responsibilities and carry them out effectively when the time comes. I briefed the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs on 9 September concerning the likely priorities of our Presidency. The Oireachtas will of course be kept fully informed as these matters take shape.</P>

      <P>As I said in the House in response to a similar question on 1 October, I made the position of the Government clear in my statement of 12 September within hours of the Israeli Cabinet meeting. The Israeli security Cabinet's decision to expel President Arafat poses a serious threat to the Middle East peace process. President Arafat is the elected leader of the Palestinian people and should, therefore, play a central role in negotiations that would lead to a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. Any attempts by the Israelis to forcibly remove President Arafat would lead to a major upsurge in violence.</P>
      <P>Ireland also voted in favour of a United Nations General Assembly resolution, on 19 September, which demanded that Israel cease any threat to remove President Arafat. This concern was further reiterated in the Taoiseachs address to the UN General Assembly on 25 September when he told the world leaders assembled in New York that threats to expel or assassinate President Arafat are deeply misguided and dangerous and can only further delay efforts to achieve a settlement. The European Union, the United States and countries of the region have also warned the Israeli Government of the dangers of any attempt to expel President Arafat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish and EU policy towards Cuba is defined by the <Col N="1669" /> EU common position adopted in December 1996. This policy, which has not changed since then, aims to encourage and not to enforce by external coercion of any kind, a peaceful transition to democratic pluralism, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable increase in the living standards of the Cuban people. In line with this policy, the EU remains steadfastly opposed to the unilateral US economic embargo against Cuba. This opposition is reflected in Ireland's voting record when the issue has arisen at the General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Also consistent with the basic policy set out in the EU common position and, indeed, in implementation of that policy, the EU was obliged in June 2003 to take a number of diplomatic steps following the summary trial and lengthy prison sentences imposed on 75 dissidents for exercising their right to freedom of speech, as well as the summary trial and rapid execution of three ferry-boat hijackers in breach of international minimum standards for the implementation of the death penalty. The measures adopted on 5 June 2003 were: to limit bilateral high level governmental visits; to reduce participation in cultural events; to invite Cuban dissidents to national day events at EU embassies in Havana and to proceed to an early re-evaluation of the EU common position, which had not been due to take place until December 2003.</P>
      <P>On 21 July 2003, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, confirmed the objectives of the common position. The Council noted that, since the previous evaluation of December 2002, not only had there been no positive steps by the Cuban Government in terms of improved respect for human rights, but that the human rights situation had severely deteriorated, as demonstrated by the large-scale arrests of dissidents, summary and arbitrary judicial processes and severe sentences for the exercise of the right to freedom of speech and participation in public affairs, as well as the breach of minimum standards for the administration of the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council also noted that, since the beginning of 2003, the Cuban authorities had clamped down on private small businesses, further curtailed access to the Internet, impounded satellite televisions and confiscated foreign newspapers and radios. The Council could not fail to note also that, in the previous month, the Cuban authorities had mounted official mass demonstrations, headed by President Castro, against the embassies of two EU member states in Havana and that the Cuban state media had conducted an unacceptable campaign of personal vilification against certain EU Heads of Government. Nevertheless, the Council reaffirmed the validity of the common position's constructive engagement with Cuba as the basis of EU policy towards that country, to be pursued through continuing political dialogue with a view to producing tangible results in the political, economic and civil rights spheres, <Col N="1670" /> as well as by means of development co-operation in order, <i>inter alia,</i> to improve the living standards of the Cuban people.</P>
    <P>The last political dialogue meeting between the EU and Cuba took place on 4 November 2002. As I have already mentioned, the EU has made it clear that we are willing to continue the dialogue. It remains to be seen whether a meeting will take place during the Italian Presidency. In the light of developments, the Irish Presidency will assess the situation prevailing in the New Year and, in any case, will continue with the implementation of the provisions of the EU common position.</P>

The purpose and role of military attachés is to provide appropriate liaison between the military authorities of both countries.</P>

      <P>My Department allocates teaching hours to vocational education committees to support the delivery of education programmes in the prison system. Such allocations are made under the heading of co-operation hours with other institutions. A total of 214.24 whole-time equivalent teaching posts have been allocated to the prison service for the current school year. The allocation to the service for the 2002-03 school year was 221.3 whole-time equivalent posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of teaching resources under the co-operation heading has to be managed within the overall resources available to my Department and in the context of the cap on public sector numbers generally. This inevitably requires prioritisation in the utilisation of available resources. <Col N="1671" /> In this context, I am satisfied that the very small reduction in the allocation to the Prison Service is not unreasonable and I understand that arrangements have been made within the service to maintain a satisfactory level of programme delivery for 2003-04.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the ancillary services grants scheme which provides additional <i>per capita </i>grants for primary schools towards caretaking and secretarial services. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which caretaking and secretarial services are provided.</P>
      <P>The second scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of full-time caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. While my Department funds the full cost of salary, it is the individual board of management of each school which is the actual employer.</P>
      <P>These caretakers and other general operative grades were not examined under the benchmarking review. A parallel benchmarking exercise is currently being undertaken for these grades in the local authority and health sectors. The process involves the examination of pay structures and conditions of employment for general operatives and craft workers. It is expected that the parallel benchmarking review will be completed in the near future, at which time the terms can be applied to related grades in the education sector.</P>

The report of the project team was presented to my Department towards the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>Having given careful consideration to the matter, I decided in April 2003 that the national centre as proposed should not proceed, having regard to the low and declining pupil numbers in the schools for the visually impaired and the development costs, estimated to be in excess of &euro;30 million. However, my Department proposes to explore with the school authorities concerned how aspects of the proposed centre could be developed, in the context of available resources.</P>

In Acht na nOllscoileanna, 1997, Acht na gColáistí Teicniúla Réigiúnacha, 1992 agus Acht Institiúid Teicneolaíochta Bhaile Átha Cliath, 1992, tá sé luaite go bhfuil sé mar dhualgas ar na hollscoileanna agus na hinstitiúidí teicneolaíochta teangacha an Stáit, go háirithe an Ghaeilge, a chur chun cinn agus a chaomhnú ionas go gcaomhnaítear cultúir éagsúla na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Tá dualgas reachtúil ar leith ar an Údarás um Ard-Oideachas na haidhmeanna náisiúnta d'athbheochan na Gaeilge agus do chaomhnú agus d'fhorbairt an chultúir náisiúnta a choimeád i gcuimhne i gcónaí. Ón mbliain 1998 tá airgead curtha ar fáil don údarás ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ag an tríú leibhéal.</P>
    <P>Chuir an soláthar speisialta seo ar chumas na n-ollscoileanna beartais nua a chumadh agus a chur i gcrích a chuir borradh breise faoin nGaeilge ag an tríu leibhéal. Cuireadh &euro;1.5 milliún ar fáil i 2002.</P>
    <P>Tá maoin soláthraithe ag mo Roinn ionas go mbeidh deontais ar leith ar fáil do mhic léinn ón nGaeltacht, do mhic léinn a chuaigh chuig Gaelscoileanna agus do dhaoine ar mian leo cúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge a dhéanamh. Gach bliain tairgítear 15 scoláireachtaí do mhic léinn ón nGaeltacht faoi scéim scoláireachtaí tríú leibhéal do mhic léinn ón nGaeltacht agus 15 scoláireachtaí eile do mhic léinn faoi scéim scoláíreachtaí Gaeilge tríú leibhéal. Ina theannta sin, tairgítear 20 scoláireachtaí eile ar bhunús iomaíochta do mhic léinn a bhí ag freastal ar Ghaelscoileanna agus a bhfuil fonn orthu cursa tríú leibhéil a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is léir go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh fáil ar chúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge ag daoine ón nGaeltacht, ag daoine eile a chuaigh chuig Gaelscoileanna agus daoine ar mian leo cúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge a dhéanamh. Tá roinnt cúrsaí ar fáil sna hollscoileanna agus sna hinstitiúidí teic<Col N="1675" /> neolaíochta faoi láthair. Tá cursaí sa Ghaeilge féin agus sa léann Ceilteach in ollscoileanna éagsúla. Tá cursaí trí Ghaeilge i réimse ábhair eile le fáil sna hollscoileanna agus na hinstitiuidí teicneolaíochta chomh maith. Toisc go bhfuil tábhacht na Gaeilge san oideachas rí-shoiléir ba chéim tábhachtach é cúrsa ard-teastas san oideachais a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Taispeánann an fhianaise thuas luaite go bhfuil mé féin agus mo Roinn ag glacadh réimse leathan céimeanna chun oideachas tríú leibhéal trí mheán na Gaeilge a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh di.</P>

Action 1.10 recommends that the national youth work advisory committee should review youth information provision nationally and explore the possibility and the costs of upgrading and expanding the network of existing youth information centres. I have recently asked the NYWAC to investigate and report to me on the future requirements in relation to youth information provision and services. I will consider the situation further on receipt of this report.</P>

      <P>The revision of any syllabus can present difficulties for students who are repeating the leaving certificate. The revised syllabus in leaving certificate home economics became the approved syllabus on 1 November 2002; the leaving certificate examinations in June 2004 will be based on this revised syllabus.</P>
      <P>The syllabus has not been changed since the 1970s. Perhaps the most important change from the point of view of quality of learning and teaching is the new emphasis on practical work.</P>

      <Col N="1690" /> There had been an reliance on terminal examinations alone which is rectified in the revised syllabus.</P>
    <P>On foot of a Government decision of 6 March 2003, the State Examinations Commission has been established with statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the national certificate examinations. This would include the deadline for submitting journals of practical work. Consequently I am referring the Deputy's question to the chief executive officer of the commission for direct reply.</P>

The schools concerned will be informed of the outcome as early as possible in the current school year. Applications for resources in respect of new entrants have been given priority and, following a review of the supporting documentation submitted, the applicant schools have, where appropriate, been given allocations.</P>
      <P>My Department will be engaging in discussions with the education partners with a view to developing a weighted system of allocations for special needs teaching resources with effect from the 2004-05 school year. This would involve an annual allocation being made to schools based on predicted incidence of special educational needs within different size school populations. Such a system would obviate the need for individual applications for resources in respect of individual pupils other than in the most exceptional circumstances. In developing a weighted system, regard will also be had to the level of learning support teachers' caseloads.</P>
      <P>The Department will also be engaging in discussions in relation to the allocation and deployment of special needs assistants with a view to ensuring appropriate allocation and effective deployment. The funding for special needs assistants, resource teachers and additional hours of resource teaching is in the region of &euro;200 million for the current year. I am not in a position to say what allocation is to be made for 2004 until the Estimates provisions for that year are finalised.</P>

The investigation will proceed as quickly as possible but it is not possible to indicate definitively at this point when it will be concluded. I expect that a full report will be published by the Marine Institute when the work currently under way has been completed.

      <P>The National Salmon Commission, having completed a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme for 2002, recommended as part of its considered advice that the total allowable commercial catch of salmon for the 2003 season for all fisheries districts should not exceed 182,000 fish which included 15,141 in respect of the Waterford district. This recommendation was made rather than the application of the precautionary catch advice provided by its own standing scientific committee of 139,751 salmon which included 13,103 in respect of the Waterford district. The salmon commission tendered its recommendation based on the advice of the standing scientific committee and the management of the central and regional fisheries boards bearing in mind the socio economic impact of applying the precautionary catch immediately.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 739, answered on 30 September 2003.</P>
      <P>Recent developments in the telecommunications market indicate that broadband uptake is increasing in all areas of the country. This increase is due to a number of factors, not least of which is the reduction of prices to consumers and businesses in recent months. I have always believed that if companies price their products at attractive rates, the consumers will respond accordingly. Experience in recent months has confirmed that.</P>

      <P>Shell-Enterprise Energy Ireland, EEI, re-entered their Dooish exploration well on 11 May 2003, following its suspension in October 2002, using the drilling unit Jack Bates. The well, which is situated in frontier exploration licence, FEL, 2/94 in the Rockall Basin some 125 km off the Donegal coast, was deepened from the 2002 total depth of 4,146 m measured depth, MD, to 4,471 m MD and confirmed the existence of a substantial gas condensate discovery. Following a comprehensive evaluation programme the well has been plugged and abandoned.</P>
      <P>Both my Department and Shell-EEI are continuing to analyse the well results and integrate them with other data from the area. Further technical work on the prospect will be required before the size of the gas condensate accumulation and the possibility for any commercial development can be accurately assessed. However, it is extremely encouraging that this well, only the second to be drilled in the Rockall Basin, proved to be such a significant discovery. My Department has emphasised the positive implications of this discovery for the prospectivity of the basin as a whole.</P>

      <P>First, I should point out to the Deputy that Mayo County Council, the local authority responsible for dealing with issues associated with the disaster area. In this connection the council has commissioned an expert report on the causes of the landslide. I understand that an interim report is due out shortly and that a final report is due in the next two weeks. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate at this juncture as to the causes of the landslide before these reports have been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be of interest to the Deputy to note that <Col N="1701" /> the proposed route of the Corrib onshore gas pipeline runs along the north shore of Sruwaddacon Bay. Pullatomish, where the recent landslide occurred, is on the south shore of Sruwaddacon Bay a distance of some 0.8 km across the bay from the proposed pipeline route. The landslide, therefore, would not have impacted the pipeline in any way, had the pipeline been installed. A map showing the route of the proposed pipeline, which would be buried along its entire onshore length of some eight km from the landfall has been forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited, EEIL, has examined the proposed pipeline route and has advised that the only area affected by the increased water and mud run-off was a land drain close to the location where the pipeline crosses the estuary. The drain had already been identified during the pipeline design and measures have been incorporated in the proposed construction programme to ensure any flooding of this drain does not affect the pipeline.</P>
    <P>334. <b>Mr. Ferris</b> asked the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources if drilling carried out in connection with the proposed Corrib gas pipeline contributed to the recent landslide in north Mayo. [22131/03]</P>

      <P>In terms of exploration and appraisal drilling the location of the Corrib gas field is over 70 km west of Broadhaven Bay. In 2001 Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited, EEIL, undertook limited site investigation work involving coring in the nearshore, in the vicinity of the proposed gas pipeline landfall at Glengad. EEIL did not undertake any drilling in 2002. It did, however, undertake trial excavation along the pipeline route to determine how deep the sediment was in the nearshore and intertidal areas. I wish to inform the Deputy that trail excavations undertaken by EEIL were reinstated. No work in Broadhaven Bay or at the landfall has been undertaken by EEIL in 2003.</P>

      <P>I have attended a meeting, requested by Shell, with the Taoiseach and the managing director of Shell Exploration and Production for Europe. At the <Col N="1706" /> meeting, Shell briefed the Taoiseach on the present state of the company's consideration of the An Bord Pleanála rejection of its application for planning permission for the gas terminal at Bellanaboy. It took the opportunity to express its serious concerns as to the uncertainties in certain elements of the planning processes for major infrastructural projects. It drew attention to the substantial costs already incurred on the project and the length of time &ndash; 20 months &ndash; taken by An Bord Pleanála to deal with the planning appeal for the proposed terminal for the development. It was pointed out to the company that, while the Government was supportive of the project to exploit the Corrib gas reservoir, consideration of, and decision-making on, relevant planning applications, at county council and An Bord Pleanála levels were strictly subject to statutorily independent processes.</P>
      <P>Since planning approval for the development and construction of a proposed terminal at Bellanaboy, County Mayo, was refused at the end of April 2003 my Department has had a total of four meetings with Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited, EEIL on the Corrib gas field development.

      <P>On 29 May 2003, I announced that my Department would carry out a campaign of operational safety inspections on passenger ships and boats this summer. Three marine surveyors from the maritime safety directorate of my Department were specifically assigned to this work and, in addition, all other surveyors extended the range of inspections carried out in the course of their duties. These inspections, including unannounced checks, were undertaken around the country in relation to vessels at sea and on inland waters to determine compliance with licensing requirements. Licence <Col N="1707" /> conditions relating to manning levels, maximum passenger numbers allowed, the continued availability of safety equipment were among the issues which the inspectors focussed on.</P>
      <P>As part of its ongoing programme of enforcement of safety rules and vessel licensing conditions, the maritime safety directorate will incorporate a similar programme of inspections undertaken this year into its future operational plans.</P>

      <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation has recently approved a new demand side management scheme that will be in place in time for this winter's peak demand periods. ESB National Grid will operate this scheme which aims to secure a reduction in peak demand of about 200 mw. This represents approximately 5% of the Republic's peak load during the winter period. All customers currently open to competition and who have the appropriate metering will be able to participate in this scheme. This new demand side management arrangement will be running in parallel with the existing ESB winter peak demand scheme.</P>
      <P>The CER is also developing new wholesale trading arrangements that are expected to be operational in early 2006. The new trading arrangement will allow for demand side participation which will incentivise customers to reduce demand in response to changing electricity prices. The commission is currently consulting stakeholders on the extent and form of this market feature.</P>
      <P>A further aspect of demand side management is in minimising the use of energy through energy efficiency measures or energy conservation. Sustainable Energy Ireland has responsibility for implementing the sustainable energy programme under the national development plan and is currently operating programmes under the energy conservation measure to ensure improved energy efficiency.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to work to increase forest planting levels to 20,000 hectares annually. Under the terms of the new partnership agreement Sustaining Progress the Government re-affirms its commitment to the development of the forestry sector in a manner that maximises its contribution to national economic and social well being on a sustainable basis. The partnership agreement contains a commitment to promote and support increased planting levels up to 20,000 hectares per annum. The agreement acknowledges that this commitment is subject to available budgetary resources.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government faces very difficult choices in the areas of public finances and may not always be in a position to ensure continuing funding for all programmes. Funding for the forestry sector for 2004 will be determined in the context of the Estimates process which is currently under way. The long-term future of forestry policy will be addressed in the strategic review of forestry which is about to commence shortly. This review will, inter alia, examine the costs of forestry. In the latter context, the House should be aware of the high historic and future cost of forestry, if existing policies are to be maintained. For example, &euro;613 million (or an average of about &euro;88 million p.a.) has been spent on forestry since 1997 and, if existing policies were to continue, annual average costs, assuming respectively 10,000 and 20,000 hectares p.a., would be &euro;100 million p.a. and &euro;130 million p.a. over the next three years. Indeed, by 2020 the annual costs of meeting the Sustaining Progress targets of 20,000 hectares p.a. could be over &euro;210 million p.a.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultants, retained by my Department to conduct a study of the Irish Coast Guard, made over 100 recommendations for the future development of the service having regard to international best practice and value for money.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the need to provide for greater co-ordination and more effective delivery of safety services on the ground, I announced recently that I proposed to bring proposals to Government shortly for the establishment of a new agency which will bring together the services provided by the Coast Guard and the maritime safety directorate of my Department. The new body will be independent of the Department, reflecting recommendations of the consultants, and its mandate will be to respond to a very wide safety agenda, including better enforcement of safety regulations, promotion of public awareness of safety issues, development of new ship and port security measures and an enhanced pollution prevention and response capability.</P>
      <P>Reflecting modern communications technologies, the consultants also recommended that the coast guard should operate two control centres as opposed to the three centres that exist at present. This approach will have the effect of achieving significant cost savings, thus enabling other elements of the coast guard service to be developed and in turn leading to further improvements in our marine emergency response services nationally. My Department are currently in discussions with union representatives regarding the closure of the Dublin centre.</P>
      <P>The capability of the coast guard to co-ordinate and manage incidents will not be diminished as a result of the closure of Dublin rather than Valentia or Malin Head. My objective is that the remaining two centres will be developed to handle all emergencies around our coast, on inland waters and in relation to mountain, cliff and cave rescue. Communications technology today is such that the geographical location of the co-ordination centres is less important now than in the past. I would also like to emphasise that the decision to close the Dublin centre will not affect the emergency response resources on the ground which will remain available to the Irish Coast Guard on a 24-hour basis all year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants have also made a number of recommendations to enhance the radio communications network maintained by the coast guard as <Col N="1711" /> well as changes to operational procedures and staffing arrangements. An examination and implementation of these recommendations is being undertaken by my Department and senior coast guard management as part of the ongoing development of our emergency response services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351, 365 and 366 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market, with reference to the direction and supervision of the Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
      <P>To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. These programmes have been designed following consultation and support from the various development agencies: IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>There are a number of technological platforms for delivery of broadband including fibre, cable, satellite, digital subscriber lines and wireless, including wireless local area networks. Whilst in the main it could be expected that private sector investment would lead to the deployment of these platforms throughout Ireland, the Government recognises that due to a downturn in the telecommunications sector in recent years, private sector companies may have difficulty in funding the major infrastructure developments that are needed for broadband delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, under the economic infrastructure operational programme of the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, grants totalling &euro;26.5 million were made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. <Col N="1712" /> Some 13 projects were supported under the programme, with a total value of &euro;70 million.</P>
    <P>Under the e-commerce and communications measure of the NDP 2000-2006 an indicative &euro;200 million has been set aside for telecommunications infrastructure developments in areas where private sector investment is lacking. This investment, which is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, is supporting a comprehensive programme of development including metropolitan area fibre networks, new national fibre trunk lines and extension of digital subscriber lines to 1.2 million telephone lines by mid-2004.</P>
    <P>My Department is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless-based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and wireless LAN technologies are under way in a number of locations to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions. The results of these trials are expected to be available by year end.</P>
    <P>With regard to demand for broadband, it is quite evident that there is considerable demand from both consumer and businesses. As a measure of this demand the EU flash barometer report places residential internet penetration in Ireland at 4th in the EU, with the predominant method of home Internet access by standard telephone line (91%) followed by ISDN (6%). Internet penetration among SMEs is running at 84%, with ISDN as the predominant access technology, followed by standard telephone line, leased line and digital subscriber line. Higher broadband uptake figures will result from competitive pricing by service providers. Recent developments, particularly in the DSL market, demonstrate that companies understand this dynamic, and are, as a consequence, lowering the price to consumers and businesses.</P>
    <P>Developments in the Irish market during the course of 2003 would suggest that broadband penetration is now increasing rapidly in all areas of the country. The Government's guiding vision for broadband is to have widespread availability of open-access, affordable, always-on broadband infrastructure for businesses and citizens throughout the State within three years. At present, a basic telephone connection allows normal speed dial-up to the Internet in any area. Higher rates of access, such as those provided by DSL, wireless, fibre optic or satellite-based systems, are available on the market from a number of licensed telecommunications service providers. A full list of providers is available from the Commission for Communications Regulation, Irish Life Mall, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1, or from the commission's website <i>www.comreg.ie</i></P>

      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> the emergency measures which are in place within his Department to deal with a major blackout in the electricity grid in view of the recent major blackouts in the US and Italy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Major electricity blackouts are usually the result of a number of contingencies. These contingencies include generation shortages, transmission network failures or other operational difficulties. While no electricity power system can be fully protected from such events I am satisfied that measures are in place to reduce the risk of a major blackout occurring on the Irish power system.</P>
      <P>In the event of an emergency situation, the transmission system operator, as part of its licence conditions, has in place a number of specific emergency plans which can deal with the incident quickly and effectively. Procedures for activation and implementation of the plans, as well as communication procedures, are tested and reviewed at regular intervals.</P>
      <P>The plans include a power system restoration plan, the objective of which is to restore a continuous supply of electricity, as quickly and as safely as possible in the event of a total system blackout. Implementation of the plan is at the discretion and under the control of the transmission system operator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power system capacity shortfall plan, <Col N="1714" /> which will be put into operation in the event of a shortage of generation capacity, is designed to match supply to demand by shedding the minimum load necessary to ensure that the power system remains in a stable operating mode at all times. Supply to specific priority users such as hospitals are given priority in the load shedding plan. In addition, the business continuity plan ensures that the transmission system operator's main business processes can be maintained in the event of an evacuation of its main offices.</P>

      <P>The number of wind energy applications received under the recent sixth alternative energy requirement competition is outlined on a county-by-county basis in the following table. There were also eight offshore wind energy applications.</P>
      <P>Further details of the individual applications is available from my Department's website at <i>www.dcmnr.ie/energy</i> The competitive selection process is a national one and takes no account of county boundaries. Project locations tend to be largely based on wind regimes, transmission grid availability and planning constraints.</P>

      <P>Seafield Pier is owned by Clare County Council, which is responsible for its upkeep and any improvements necessary. The pier was inspected by an engineer of my Department in December 2002, and a proposal was put forward to raise the low wall on the inner pier and provide a rock armour revetment for this wall for a length of 115 m. The estimated cost of those works is &euro;240,000. It is not possible to provide Exchequer funding for those works in 2003 as the funding for fishery harbours is fully committed. The question of providing Exchequer funding in the 2004-06 period for this project will be considered carefully in the context of the funding available and overall national priorities. Clare County Council would, of course, be expected to contribute towards the cost of any improvement works.</P>

      <P>I have supported a number of key initiatives at EU level aimed at preventing maritime disasters like the <i>Prestige</i> incident off the coast of Spain in November 2002 and the <i>Erika</i> incident off France in 1999. Earlier this year the EU Council of Ministers agreed to accelerate the phasing out of single-hull tankers from EU waters and the introduction of a ban on the carriage of certain grades of heavy fuel oil in single hull tankers. Ireland is also playing a full role in the new European Maritime Safety Agency, which held its first meeting in December 2002. One of the key objectives of the agency is to support member states in identifying ships which have the potential to <Col N="1718" /> cause pollution incidents and prevent them operating in EU waters.</P>
      <P>I have also taken a number of measures at national level to both prevent major accidents taking place and to strengthen our response capability. I have appointed nine new marine surveyors to step up the level of port state control inspections. Ireland now exceeds its international obligations in undertaking detailed inspections of ships visiting our ports. Our emergency response plans relating to major oil pollution incidents is currently being updated. I have also announced that I will bring proposals to Government shortly for the establishment of a new independent agency with responsibility for all marine safety issues. The agency will have specific responsibility for pollution prevention and response, and I believe this measure will significantly strengthen Ireland's ability to both prevent and deal with maritime disasters around our coastline in the future.</P>

      <P>Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was completed last December and the agreement reached in that context provides the legislative framework for the fisheries policies to be implemented by the EU over the next ten years. The reformed CFP contains a heavy emphasis on the need to conserve fish stocks, an issue which was a high priority for Ireland in the CFP reform negotiations. In particular, recovery plans are signalled for a number of key whitefish stocks such as cod. Against this legal backdrop, a number of implementing regulations, outlining detailed conservation measures and stock recovery programmes, will emerge in the period ahead. In the context of the discussions that will arise when such proposals are being considered, Ireland will seek to influence the direction and scope of such measures in a way that will achieve effective results. In this regard, specific priorities for Ireland will be the need to protect spawning grounds and areas where juveniles aggregate.</P>
      <P>In so far as access to fishing grounds is concerned, Irish fishermen will be able to continue to fish in the same grounds as at present. These fishing grounds are located in discrete management areas which have been determined according to the biology of the species concerned.</P>

      <P>The Dooish exploration well, which was drilled last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland off the Donegal coast and which discovered a hydrocarbon accumulation, was re-entered and deepened this summer. Drilling commenced on 11 May 2003 and the well was plugged and abandoned having confirmed the existence of a substantial gas condensate column and the rig moved off-site on 30 July 2003. Both my Department and Shell-EEI are continuing to analyse the well results and integrate them with other data from the area. Further technical work on the prospect will be required before the size of the gas condensate accumulation and the possibility for any commercial development can be accurately assessed. However, it is extremely encouraging that this well, only the second to be drilled in the Rockall Basin, proved to be such a significant discovery, and my Department has emphasised the positive implications of this discovery for the prospectivity of the basin as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Cong exploration well is currently being drilled in the Erris basin, approximately 60 km off the Mayo coast and some 20 km northeast of the Corrib gas field. Drilling began on this exploration well by Statoil in the Erris basin on 5 August 2003. There have been a total of three seismic surveys carried out offshore Ireland this year, all off the west coast. However, one of these surveys was abandoned following damage to equipment. The results of the surveys are not yet available due to the highly technical processing required for this type of data.</P>

      <P>Including new purchases and maintenance, my Department spent a total of &euro;729,996 on software licences during 2002. Of this amount, &euro;212,325 was spent on products of the company referred to by the Deputy. My Department has taken the strategic decision to develop all business applications in an open source development environment. One of the principal reasons for this strategic approach was because of the advantages of being system independent, both hardware and operating. The application development uses a large number of open source software to develop and test the applications and publication to the Internet will be through an open source web server.</P>
      <P>My Department's information systems division uses a number of open source software packages, including the software referred to by the Deputy, to manage and monitor all the Department's networks and servers. Our overall approach is geared to using, and promoting the use of open source software where this is appropriate and cost effective. The open source community would generally agree that the general use of open source software in a corporate environment is only now becoming a realistic proposition. While the initial costs of open source software are very low, it does require a larger technical effort to support going forward with resultant cost implications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 370, 380 and 382 to 384, inclusive, together. The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. For the 2003 sports capital programme, following consultation with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs &ndash; DCRGA &ndash; it was decided that disadvantaged areas were those that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by DCRGA, namely, RAPID 1, RAPID 2, local drugs task force areas and Clár areas. In the assessment of applications under the 2003 programme, greater priority was also given to projects which were located in RAPID areas and which were endorsed by RAPID area implementation teams for those areas. Under the 2003 sports capital programme, a total of &euro;7.6 million was allocated to projects located in RAPID areas, of which almost &euro;5.5 million was for projects specifically endorsed by RAPID area implementation teams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of all applications under the 2003 sports capital programme had to take into account basic qualifying conditions and, apart from the level of disadvantage, many other criteria as set out in the published guidelines, terms and conditions document, which accompanied the application form for the programme, must also be met. Being located in one of the designated <Col N="1722" /> disadvantaged areas would not, of itself, qualify an applicant for a grant. Following this assessment process, I announced provisional grant allocations on 25 July last for those allocations classified as local and on 29 August for those classified as regional, municipal or multi-purpose and national.</P>
    <P>The applications referred to by the Deputy were unsuccessful. A letter was issued to each of the organisations concerned on 6 August advising them accordingly, together with a copy of the assessment carried out on their application, including any specific reasons for the applications being unsuccessful. It is open to the organisations in question, should they wish to do so, and should they have projects which satisfy the terms and conditions of the programme, to submit applications to the 2004 sports capital programme when that scheme is publicly advertised. Projects which meet the basic qualifying conditions and which are designated as disadvantaged will again be prioritised under this programme in line with the guidelines, terms and conditions for that programme when these are finalised.</P>
    <P>Rather than undermining the regeneration of RAPID areas as suggested by the Deputy, the improved targeting of RAPID projects in the designation of disadvantaged areas under the sports capital programme has recently been singled out for praise by Area Development Management Limited, the agency with responsibility for the administration of RAPID and also by the RAPID national monitoring committee.</P>

I will make an announcement shortly about the timetable for submission of applications for grants under the 2004 sports capital programme.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The closing date for receipt of applications under the 2003 sports capital programme was 25 April 2003. A total of 1,337 applications were received and evaluated by my Department in accordance with the assessment criteria for the programme published in the guidelines, terms and conditions document which accompanied the application form for the programme. Following completion of the evaluation of the applications received by my Department, I announced all provisional grant allocations under the programme on 25 July and 29 August last, amounting to over &euro;52.8 million. As requested, a schedule of the allocations to Dublin, which totalled just over &euro;14.1 million follows.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the concern that exists within the Irish film sector about the future of the section 481 scheme, and that international film investment is very mobile, with decisions on where to make a film often based on a forensic analysis by producers of the competitive environments in all possible locations. Certainty about the future is obviously important in a business where projects have such a long lead-in time. I will be discussing all the issues arising in this context with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the near future.</P>

      <P>The provision in my Department's 2003 Estimates for the local authority swimming pool programme is &euro;9 million, which is available in the form of grant aid in respect of the construction of local authority swimming pools. Maintenance of such facilities is specifically precluded from the provisions of the programme and is a matter entirely for the local authority concerned. Payments to individual projects in 2003 are dependent on progress through the construction process and the submission to my Department of appropriate supporting documentation in respect of grant claims. It is expected that the total allocation of &euro;9 million will be drawn down this year. Payments totalling &euro;4,737,495 have been made up to the end of September 2003.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the domino/home birth scheme in University College Hospital, Galway, was not independently evaluated before the Western Health Board made the decision to axe it; if the discontinuation of this midwifery-led service in Galway represents a retrograde step in view of recommendations made by the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme Review Group in 1994; if he will request the Western Health Board to rescind this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The service plan adopted by the Western Health Board for 2003 stated the need to appoint a consultant neo-natologist to meet both the volume and complexity of cases presenting at University College Hospital, Galway. The service plan approved the transfer of funding from domiciliary home care services to support this priority development. The home birth scheme was suspended by the Western Health Board on this basis.</P>
      <P>An application by Parents for Choice in Birth Limited for leave to bring judicial review proceedings seeking to annul the Western Health Board's decision to terminate the home birth scheme was refused in the High Court in July last. I understand that this decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue at this stage.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Western Health Board that it is committed to the development of a midwifery led service at UCHG. Proposals for this service have been endorsed by midwifery, obstetric and management staff at the hospital. Although significant progress has been made in this regard, some outstanding industrial relations issues have yet to be resolved. The board proposes to initiate the service once these have been addressed.</P>
      <P>I understand that an internal review of the home birth pilot project, by the steering committee, has taken place and was issued at the end of September 2003. I should also say that the domiciliary births group, established by the health board chief executive officers, has commissioned an external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects in Dublin, Cork and Galway, and the service in the South-Eastern Health Board area. This evaluation is due for completion in mid-November 2003. The domiciliary births group will then engage in a public consultation process and report to the chief executive officers in February-March 2004. The group's report will inform the development of future national policies, procedures and protocols for domiciliary births.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, I can confirm that the Western Health Board makes a grant towards midwifery services in respect of home births where <Col N="1733" /> women contract an independent midwife. The maximum grant is &euro;1,269.74 for full midwifery service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards are not legally obliged to provide chiropody services to medical card holders. The formal position is that arrangements for the provision of services, including chiropody services, are a matter for the individual health boards to decide, having regard to their priorities within the funding allocated. Accordingly, chiropody services provided by health boards vary somewhat throughout the country but, usually priority is given to medical card holders who are aged 65 years and over, persons who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin-anti-D, or from the receipt within Ireland of any blood product or a blood transfusion and who have Health Amendment Act 1996 cards, and for people with illnesses such as diabetes or arthritis.</P>
      <P>A person must be referred for chiropody services by their general practitioner or a public health nurse and most boards provide three chiropody treatments per annum to all medical card holders over the age of 65 when considered clinically necessary. In some board areas the chiropody service is being delivered by voluntary agencies who provide the services in locations in the community e.g. day care centres, and to whom an allowance is paid by the health board. Domiciliary visits are made in some areas, if necessary.</P>
      <P>My Department recently placed an advertisement in national newspapers inviting applications from chiropodists who wish to be assessed for eligibility to practice in the public health service. The assessment of these applications is being undertaken at present and a new updated list of chiropodists, considered eligible to practice in the public health service, should be available early in 2004. This should ensure a greater number of professionals available and easier access for patients.</P>

      <Quest>if he is ignoring the most damning aspect of the health services, that is, the grossly unfair, unnecessary and avoidable inequality which provides health care according to financial means rather than medical need; and his views on whether equality is supposed to be at the centre of health policy.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that equity is one of the four key principles underpinning the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. The strategy explicitly identifies equity as being central to policy development, particularly in reducing the difference in health status currently running across the social spectrum in Ireland and in ensuring equitable access to services based on need. The strategy outlines measures to ensure that all public patients can expect a high quality of service within a reasonable period of time. This includes a ten-year programme for the largest ever concentrated increase in public acute hospital capacity. In addition, the national treatment purchase fund is being used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients who have waited longest for treatment. Some &euro;31 million has been provided in 2003 for the NTPF and available capacity has been identified in different specialities in Ireland and Britain to treat those eligible. In excess of 7,200 patients have been treated since the commencement of the scheme in July 2002. Investment in public hospital services has led to a reduction in waiting lists by 35% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment between June 2002 and March 2003 and a reduction of 56% in the number of children waiting more than six months in the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy recognises that there are barriers in the system to equity and these have been prioritised to ensure that the eligibility framework in the future can support equal access for equal need. As part of the implementation process for the strategy, a review of all existing eligibility legislation is ongoing in my Department. Arising from this review, legislation will be drafted to clarify and simplify eligibility and entitlements to health services in line with the goals and objectives set out in the strategy. In <Col N="1736" /> addition, the health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
    <P>The actions set out in the strategy will ensure that all those eligible understand their entitlement, can easily access services they need and can be sure that, no matter where they live, there is a standard approach to their eligibility for services. As part of ensuring fair access, the strategy identifies the need to assure equitable access to services. This is primarily concerned with improved access to hospital services for public patients as well as recognising other barriers, which affect people's ability to access services.</P>
    <P>The targets to reduce health inequalities set out in the Government's review of the national anti-poverty strategy have been integrated into the health strategy. These targets were developed in the course of an extensive consultation process with poor and excluded groups. Key health targets are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by ten per cent by 2007, and to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest of the population.</P>
    <P>Because of the wide range of factors which affect health status and health inequalities, the health strategy envisages these targets being met through a range of actions including greater focus on multi-sectoral work and health impact assessment. The health strategy asserts quite clearly that to achieve better health for everyone and to reduce health inequalities, health must be put at the centre of public policy. In this context health impact assessment is being developed so that relevant policies, strategies and legislation undergo a comprehensive process of health proofing so that their impact on the physical, mental and social well-being of the population is positive.</P>
    <P>The important role of primary care in effectively addressing health inequalities was highlighted in the national anti-poverty strategy consultation process and in the report of the national anti-poverty strategy and health working group. The primary care strategy provides for an interdisciplinary team-based approach to primary care provision. Clients may self-refer to any team member, and appropriate procedures will be in place to facilitate referral between team members and, where necessary, joint management by the team also. I have approved the establishment of an implementation project in each of ten locations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> The primary care strategy model includes mechanisms for the involvement of the community. The community and voluntary pillar is represented on the steering group for the implementation of the strategy and is also working with four of the ten initial implementation projects. Sustaining Progress includes a commitment that the learning from community involvement will be used to inform models of participation appropriate to the wider national health strategy. Also, the document community participation guidelines, published last December by the Health Board Executive sets out the spectrum of ways of involving patients and communities.</P>
    <P>In May, my Department co-hosted a conference with the Combat Poverty Agency to launch their building healthy communities programme, which has a special focus on community development approaches to reducing health inequalities. My Department is also supporting financially, in the context of the implementation of the primary care strategy, a number of research projects under the aegis of the building healthy communities programme.</P>
    <P>The report Ireland's Changing Heart, the second report on the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy, published recently, highlights the importance of addressing health inequalities in the context of strategy implementation. Consideration is currently being given as to how this can best be addressed. Targets to reduce health inequalities will also be taken on board in the review of the cancer strategy currently under way. Mechanisms for developing an injury prevention strategy are under discussion between my Department and the health board executive.</P>
    <P>In the 2003 letters of determination, and in other correspondence, my Department has asked health agencies to prioritise actions to reduce health inequalities. Further, the chief executive officer of each health board was asked to prioritise its funding allocations in favour of the RAPID and CLÁR projects. The Deputy will be aware that there are also a range of policies targeting specific vulnerable groups, for example Traveller Health: A National Health Strategy 2002-05 and the integrated strategy on homelessness, the youth homelessness strategy and the homelessness preventative strategy.</P>

      <P>Emergency medical technicians are at present precluded from administering certain life saving medications and from using certain medical equipment. In order to address these restrictions the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council submitted proposals to my Department in relation to the introduction of the emergency medical technician &ndash; advanced programme to the ambulance service. I was pleased to announce policy approval earlier this year to this initiative. The drafting of the regulatory changes necessary to give effect to this initiative is at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>Following a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011, with 450 additional public beds to be in place by the end of 2002. I introduced the first phase of this process in January 2002 which provided funding for an additional 709 acute beds. My Department has been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that, to date, 568 of these beds have been commissioned. The following table provides a full listing of the hospitals in which the 568 additional beds were commissioned.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the National Association of Health Boards in relation to the health service reform programme announced by the Government on 18 June last. One of the key concerns of the Government was to communicate its vision of reform across the health system. A communication programme was launched as soon as the Government decisions were taken. The objective of the programme was to ensure that everyone in the system was fully informed about the content of the Government decision in relation to organisation reform in the health system, knew and understood the commitment to the consultation process and availed of the opportunity to have an input, individually and collectively, into developing the best way to implement the programme of reform.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General of my Department and I engaged in a major exercise meeting directly with members and staff of health boards in July. In the course of these meetings I obtained at first hand a good cross-section of the spectrum of views being expressed by board members and staff in health boards. In addition, the Office for Health Management undertook a structured communications process with staff throughout the health service on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>The set of reforms agreed by the Government involves modernisation of every aspect of the organisation, governance and management of the health system. As an integral part of the reform a new framework has been adopted for governance of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for ensuring an appropriate input by the community and from elected representatives have also been adopted by the Government as part of the overall reform. I have undertaken to bring more detailed proposals to Government on the representation arrangements in the coming months. These arrangements will ensure that <Col N="1744" /> there will be appropriate mechanisms to support adequate democratic input into the planning of service delivery in the context of national policies and that there is an appropriate interface between elected officials and planners/managers at regional and local level.</P>

I told the group that arrangements have been made by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to make a range of services available to women who had undergone the procedure of symphysiotomy, including provision of counselling services. An information pack for patients is to be compiled. A similar pack will also be made available to general practitioners. Independent clinical advice is to be offered where requested. The establishment of a helpline for patients is to be considered as a priority. Sympathetic consideration is to be given to the refund of medical expenses in respect of treatments required to address the effects of symphysiotomy, including the provision of medical assessment and treatment for patients.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council is the independent authority charged, under the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, with primary responsibility for the registration and regulation of medical practitioners.</P>

As part of this review process, consultations have been carried out with a number of bodies, including patient groups and the key stakeholders in health service provision, regulation and post-graduate medical education and training. Some of the main issues under consideration are greater public representation and transparency, as well as the fitness to practice procedures and competence assurance measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Question Nos. 438, 451 and 459 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the National Roads Authority to ensure that motorways and dual carriageways are equipped with appropriate containment barriers in accordance with the NRA's design manual for roads and bridges. Funding is available to the NRA as part of its annual block grant for the improvement of national roads &ndash;&euro;1.209 billion in 2003 &ndash; to meet the cost of such barriers.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the NRA, as a matter of practice, keeps road design standards, including safety aspects, under regular review. The position in relation to the provision of median safety barriers on motorways is that the NRA, in July 2001, amended its design to provide for median safety barriers on all new motorways with a central reservation of less than 15 m and has commenced a programme of retrofitting median safety barriers to existing motorways with a central reservation of less than 15 m.</P>
      <P>In relation to the M1, I understand from the NRA that a contract for the provision of median barriers on the Dunleer-Dundalk motorway is currently being tendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to July 2001 the design standards for motorways in Ireland provided for the provision of safety barriers on motorways and duel carriageways where the central reserves were less <Col N="1752" /> than 9 m. This was in line with accepted international practice.</P>
    <P>Following a review the NRA decided, as outlined above, to provide safety barriers on all motorways/dual carriageways with a central reservation of less than 15 m.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the provision of purpose-designed crash barriers on motorway central reservations is not without risk and unfortunately cannot guarantee that fatalities will be avoided in the future. Occupants of vehicles out of control may sustain injury or death on impact with a barrier depending on the angle and speed of impact. There is also a risk of the vehicle concerned being projected back onto the carriageway from which it has come with potential serious consequences for the occupants and other road users. The provision of wire fences in the central reservation of motorways and dual carriageways is intended to support plants and hedging as an anti-dazzle measure. The wire concerned has no crash barrier function or capability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to answer Question Nos. 439, 454, and 456 together.</P>
      <P> An Agreed Programme for Government included a commitment to continue to transform Aer Rianta and, as part of that process, to ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence.</P>
      <P>In July last, the Government decided to establish the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork as fully independent and autonomous authorities under State ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work in relation to the implementation of this decision is proceeding apace in my Department. I will shortly be seeking Government approval for the drafting of the necessary amending legislation to give effect to the decision and I would hope that this legislation could be enacted by the end of the year. I have appointed the chairmen <Col N="1753" /> of the new boards-designate for the three airport companies and I expect to be in a position shortly to announce the other members of these boards.</P>
    <P>My Department is also at an advanced stage of a public procurement process to engage expert advisers to assist with the implementation of the Government decision. It would be my hope that the three new State airport companies could be up and running on a statutory basis in the first half of next year.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the two new independent airport authorities for Shannon and Cork will both commence business free of debt and that the debts associated with these airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme at Cork Airport, will remain with Dublin Airport. The desirability of these arrangements emerged from the analysis of the financial position of the three State airports within the current Aer Rianta structure which was conducted for my Department by Aer Rianta. These arrangements will ensure that both Shannon and Cork airports will have sound balance sheets, giving both a fresh start to develop and grow their business at a pace which I believe can be even greater than in the past. </P>
    <P>While the precise levels of debt involved in each case have yet to be determined, Shannon and Cork had estimated net debts at the end of 2002 of approximately &euro;70 million and &euro;40 million respectively. When these are added to the estimated net debt of &euro;120 million associated with the new development programme at Cork Airport, the total debt of those two airports which will remain with Dublin is &euro;230 million.  </P>
    <P>Dublin Airport accounts for almost 80% of the total annual passenger throughput at the three State airports and, in effect, Dublin has been carrying the bulk of the debt associated with all three airports. Under the new arrangements, therefore, a burden which already exists on Dublin Airport will, as currently envisaged, be crystallised through a once-off transfer of the debts associated with Shannon and Cork on a more transparent basis. </P>
    <P>As the implementation process in relation to the restructuring continues over the coming months, I will give detailed consideration to the implications for Dublin Airport of absorbing the debts of Shannon and Cork in the context of other significant assets of the Aer Rianta Group, such as the Great Southern Hotels and Aer Rianta International.</P>
    <P>Both I and senior officials of my Department have had a number of meetings with ICTU and the group of unions in Aer Rianta, including SIPTU, with the aim of addressing any concerns on their part arising from the Government decision. I wrote to David Begg, general secretary, ICTU, following these meetings outlining my position on a number of points which had been raised by the unions in Aer Rianta. I also pointed out that I regard the unions as key stakeholders in the context of the various consultations already under way in my Department with other <Col N="1754" /> relevant parties on the implementation of the Government decision.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the unions that I remain available to meet them again as required.</P>

      <P>Following unanimous agreement by the Council of Transport Ministers on 5 June, to give the European Commission a mandate to negotiate an open aviation area (OAA) agreement with the United States, the first round of formal detailed negotiations commenced in Washington last week. A second round of negotiations is due to take place in Brussels in December. During these negotiations, a special committee made up of all member states will assist the Commission. Ireland is represented on this committee by a senior official from my Department.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in answer to questions earlier this year, the objective of the EU/US negotiations is to create a situation in which European and US airlines are not constrained as to the destinations to which they fly, just as they are not so constrained within Europe today. It is unclear how long these negotiations will take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this issue, I must take account of wider considerations, especially the opportunities for new business for Ireland currently not <Col N="1755" /> being exploited due to the limitation on the number of US destinations open to Irish airlines.</P>
    <P>Last week's report of the Tourism Policy Review Group to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism recommends that my Department should immediately renegotiate the Ireland/US international air agreement in advance of an EU/US agreement in order to remove the present US gateways restriction.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, there will be change. This change must be introduced on a phased basis and must run in tandem with the putting in place of a package of measures that will be equally beneficial for Shannon.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to authorise my officials to engage in bilateral negotiations with their US counterparts once I have completed the necessary consultations with all the appropriate interests including the new board-designate for Shannon airport, so as to shape the best overall package for Shannon airport in the future.</P>

      <P>As far as wider aviation policy is concerned, I do not believe that there is any pressing requirement at this stage for a second fully commercial airport to serve the greater Dublin area, whether at Baldonnel or anywhere else. Dublin Airport has capacity to expand to cater for growth in passenger traffic for many years to come. Also, the Government's decision in July last to restructure Aer Rianta and establish the three State airports as new, independent, autonomous authorities will allow the airports at Shannon and Cork to compete, to the extent permitted by market dynamics, with Dublin Airport for a greater share of future growth in Irish air travel. Planned improvements in other national transport infrastructure, particularly roads, will also facilitate future access to our State airports within their catchment areas thus strengthening the capacity of Cork and Shannon to serve their regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 443 and 444 together.</P>
      <P>The current regulations on the use of safety belts in vehicles have been in force since 1 January 1993. With effect from 25 August 2003, safety belt-related offences by drivers of vehicles attract penalty points.</P>
      <P>In general, each occupant of a passenger car is required to wear a safety belt or an appropriate child restraint, as the case may be. The driver of a vehicle is obliged to ensure that an occupant of the vehicle who is under 17 is either restrained by an appropriate child restraint or, provided she/he is four years old and upwards, is wearing a safety belt.</P>
      <P>The requirements to wear a safety belt do not apply in respect of the use of a vehicle in which the fitment of safety belts is not mandatory. For cars first registered before 1 June 1971, seatbelts are not required in any seating position. Cars registered between 1 June 1971 and 31 December 1991 are required to have safety belts fitted to the driver's seat and the outermost front seat. Cars registered on or after 1 January 1992 are required to have safety belts fitted to all forward facing seats.</P>
      <P>Fitting an appropriate child restraint is not mandatory. Accordingly, the duty of the driver to ensure that a restraint is worn is subject to the availability of such a restraint in a vehicle.</P>
      <P>The regulations define an appropriate child restraint as an approved child restraint which is appropriate to the user by virtue of the weight range indicated on the restraint. The regulations specify approval authorities and approval marks.</P>
      <P>Certain exceptions to the requirements to wear a safety belt or restraint system are provided for in the regulations. Under the exceptions, the licensed driver of a vehicle being used as a small public service vehicle is not required to wear a safety belt. No other distinction is made between small public service vehicles and other passenger cars with regard to the fitment or use of safety belts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some exceptions are also made in respect of the use of safety belts and restraints systems by children in vehicles. A person under four years of age occupying a seat, other than a front seat and for which there is no unoccupied appropriate child restraint, or a person who is 12 years of age <Col N="1757" /> or more and who is less than 150 cm in height, is not required to wear a safety belt or be restrained by a child restraint. Where three or more children under the age of 15 are being carried in a vehicle, the regulations only apply in so far as is reasonably practical.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the Garda, with the involvement of the courts where a garda deems it appropriate.</P>
    <P>However, since the introduction of penalty points for seat-belt offences, greater attention is being paid to the detail of the regulations. This has identified the fact that there are apparent gaps in the regulations, which has given rise to some confusion, particularly regarding the status under the regulations of the law regarding the carrying of children under four years of age. As the safety of children in this age category is paramount it is my intention to tidy up the regulations and to close the apparent gaps.</P>

      <P>The Railway Procurement Agency, which is responsible for the delivery of the LUAS project, has confirmed to me that the agency complies with the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, including conformity with the guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure in the public sector. In addition, a Light Rail Monitoring Committee is in place comprised of representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Railway Procurement Agency. It is assisted by independent technical experts who report to the Department on a monthly basis. The Railway Procurement Agency also reports on programme and budgetary issues to my Department on a monthly basis. My Department continuously reviews this and other information on the LUAS project to ensure that the highest standards of project management are adhered to by the agency.</P>
      <P>The Department of Transport reported to Government at critical stages of the LUAS project. This included reporting on physical progress and budgetary considerations.</P>
      <P>The RPA have informed me that LUAS passenger services will commence in summer 2004 and that the project is within the &euro;691 million budget and risk provision, as notified to the Government in 2002.</P>

      <P>Expenditure under the economic and social infrastructure operational programme over the period 2000-2002, amounted to &euro;10.59 billion, which is 5.4% in excess of that forecast in the NDP. Details of the financial and physical progress in the implementation of the programme are set out in the mid-term evaluation of the programme recently completed by Indecom economic consultants and available on the NDP website at www.ndp.ie, and the progress report to the spring meeting of the OP monitoring committee. Copies of both of these reports will be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office strategy, A Platform for Change, is the blueprint of the transport needs for the greater Dublin area. The DTO's strategy proposed a metro system running from Shankill to the south of the city to Dublin Airport, connected to an orbital line which includes Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a metro with a link to Dublin Airport. I have received the outline business case for phase one from the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA). Phase 1 of the metro, as proposed by the RPA, involves a line from the airport to the city centre designed to connect at a later stage to Blanchardstown as part of the orbital route.</P>
      <P>I am considering all of the options and will be bringing proposals to the Government in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of facilitating a comprehensive review of speed limits, I established a broadly based working group in February of this year. The working group presented their report to me last week. I will now give careful consideration to the report <Col N="1759" /> and the recommendations that the working group has made. </P>
      <P>The review has addressed all of the relevant issues and has been pursued against the background of, among other things, plans to provide for the metrication of speed limits by the end of 2004 and the fact that the last review of speed limits was carried out ten years ago. One of the issues which is discussed in detail in the report is the question of special arrangements for speed limit management at approaches to schools.</P>
      <P>A range of measures is available at present for deployment by local authorities to address the particular road safety and traffic management issues that may arise in the vicinity of schools. These measures include the provision of advance warning lights at approaches to schools, including special road traffic signs incorporating flashing lights and the facility to impose a total ban on vehicles stopping at school entrances. Local authorities may also engage a school traffic warden service to stop traffic and assist school children crossing the road where they deem it appropriate.</P>

      <P>The day-to-day oversight of aviation safety falls within the responsibility of the Irish Aviation Authority. In so far as this proposal may lead to legislative changes, I can assure the Deputy that I always give the highest priority to safety matters.</P>
      <P>This matter is not on the agenda for the Council of Transport Ministers meeting.</P>

      <P>The Road (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 give local authorities the power to apply restrictions to heavy goods vehicles from entering particular public roads or areas. Article 17 of these regulations provides that where the applicable traffic sign is provided at the entrance to a road, the driver of a vehicle, the unladen weight of which exceeds the weight specified on the sign, is prohibited from proceeding beyond the sign except where it is necessary for the vehicle to enter a road solely for the purpose of gaining access to or egress from premises accessible only from that road. The application of such restrictions is a matter for each local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, decisions in relation to traffic management plans are matters for the road authority concerned. I understand from Dublin City Council that a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) manage<Col N="1762" /> ment strategy will have three objectives: to ensure the optimal use by HGVs of the port tunnel, to minimise adverse effects of remaining HGV movements in the city and to manage the movement of vehicles not within permitted dimensions.</P>
    <P>I understand that Dublin City Council will undertake widespread consultation before implementing any HGV management strategy. I have been informed that the current position in relation to the development of the HGV management strategy is that Dublin City Council intend to issue a preliminary consultation identifying the issues involved shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 455 and 457 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport is our largest airport and primary international gateway accounting for 15 million passengers last year. Traffic at Dublin Airport is expected to double to 30 million passengers by 2020 and one of the key objectives of our aviation policy is to ensure that our principal gateway airports, including Dublin Airport, are in a position to provide cost-competitive and appropriate infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of airlines and other aviation companies, consistent with a commercial mandate.</P>
      <P>One of the main issues in An Agreed Programme for Government is the commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at Dublin Airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report earlier this year by the panel of experts chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey, which assessed the expressions of interest in relation to this matter concluded that such a terminal would be operationally and technically feasible. The panel drew attention to a number of aspects including the need for regulatory arrangements <Col N="1763" /> to ensure a level playing field between any new independent terminal operator and the incumbent operator. The panel also believes that an independent terminal is a viable strategic option for the development of Dublin Airport and would elicit considerable market interest.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to give urgent attention to the independent terminal concept. I intend to appoint the remaining members of the new board-designate for Dublin Airport shortly and I will ask the chairman-designate, Mr. Gary McGann, for the urgent views of the board in relation to infrastructural development generally at the airport, including its views on the second terminal concept. I will then bring proposals in this matter before the Government.</P>

      <P>The NRA is required in the construction and maintenance of national roads to take account of the needs of all road users. It should be noted, however, that: a) the bulk of the upgrade work on national roads is currently focused on the inter-urban sections of national primary routes where there is limited demand and scope for cycle facilities; b) the provision of town and village by-passes will provide greater capacity on the existing routes by removing through traffic; and c) many sections of the major inter-urban routes are being upgraded to motorway standard and this will not be available to cyclists.</P>
      <P>In regard to upgrade work on national roads in urban and suburban areas, I understand that the NRA co-operates with local authorities and, in the greater Dublin area, with the DTO in the provision of cycle facilities as part of an integrated approach at local level to overall traffic management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the greater Dublin area significant work has been undertaken by the Dublin Transportation Office and local authorities in relation to the promotion of cycling and the provision of suitable facilities with the assistance of traffic management grant funding for local authorities administered by the DTO. A high priority continues to be afforded to funding the provision by local authorities of cycle routes under this grant scheme. To date, 170 km of cycle network &ndash; QBC cycle facilities and dedicated cycle facilities <Col N="1764" />&ndash; have been constructed in the greater Dublin area, together with 2,500 cycle parking spaces. I understand that the DTO is currently conducting a review of the regional cycle strategy and facilities together with development of a four-year plan for cycling 2003-2006.</P>
    <P>In 2000, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which is responsible for regional and local roads also introduced regional traffic management grants for the first time for the city councils of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. Under this scheme funding is provided for the upgrading of pedestrian and cycle facilities, traffic signalling, bus lanes and traffic calming on regional and local roads in residential areas.</P>
    <P>A revised cycling design manual, which will be national in application, is also in preparation and should be published by the DTO in 2003. My Department will also be discussing with the NRA the further development of its policy in relation to the facilitation of cycling as a transport mode particularly outside the major inter-urban route network.</P>

      <P>All incidents of unlawful killing are the subject of exhaustive investigation by the Garda. All contributory facts, causes and aspects of the crimes are considered in the course of these extensive investigations.</P>
      <P>These investigations are undertaken by divisional and district officers at local level. All the necessary technical services are available to these investigations. National units such as the national bureau of criminal investigations and the national drugs unit are available to assist where necessary. All available resources are employed in respect of all murders to bring these investigations to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>The files in undetected murders are not closed until they are investigated to a successful conclusion. All new evidence coming to light in these murders is acted upon.</P>
      <P>The following tables show the number and location of all undetected murders from 1992 to 30 September 2003. It is not the practice when answering questions of a statistical nature to include details of the victims' names.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 has been used on 88 occasions since the legislation was enacted.</P>
      <P>Proceedings were initiated in 30 of these cases and convictions obtained in 13 cases. I understand that four cases are currently pending before the courts. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the statistics sought by the Deputy are not compiled on a county-by-county basis but rather on the basis of the Garda divisional boundaries.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that it is not the practice of the Garda Síochána to provide details of specific Garda operational plans in relation to such events. While the rights of citizens to protest or demonstrate in a peaceful fashion will be respected and facilitated, it is incumbent on the Garda Síochána to ensure the safety of all citizens <Col N="1771" /> and the safety of those attending these EU meetings.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have established contact with the necessary international police co-operation networks with a view to ensuring the safety and security of those attending the various meetings being held during the Presidency. The resources required for the policing of events associated with the EU Presidency will vary and can only be truly identified as the information on possible protests or demonstrations becomes available.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that there are no training programmes in place, at present, associated with the use of less than lethal weapons. Proposals to have Garda personnel undergo such training to instructor level are currently under consideration by Garda management. These trained personnel will then be tasked with developing and delivering a training programme in the use of the selected less than lethal weapons.</P>
      <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that three members of sergeant rank completed a public order tactical instructors course with the greater Manchester police in September 2002. These personnel subsequently developed a public order instructors course within the Garda Síochána. Public order training has devolved to the Garda regions so that each region can be self sufficient in the provision of public order training for its personnel. There are currently 756 personnel, all ranks, trained as public order operatives to date.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are indications of an increase in the availability and use of cocaine in Dublin in the recent past. However, offences involving cocaine represent a small proportion of the overall number of drug offences annually.</P>
      <P>Operations have been initiated throughout the Dublin area in response. Divisional and district drug units, working closely with Garda national drugs unit, have targeted known suppliers and abusers.</P>
      <P>The forensic science laboratory analyses drugs seized and, based on its analysis, there have been three separate seizures of crack cocaine in Dublin since 1 January 2003. The situation will continue to be monitored throughout the Dublin area and operations targeting suppliers of crack cocaine will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that, in accordance with a commitment in the <Col N="1772" /> annual policing plan 2003, the Garda research unit, in conjunction with the Garda national drugs unit, is conducting research into cocaine usage and criminal activity and will bring forward policing recommendations accordingly. The objective of this research is to provide a better insight into the linkages between cocaine usage and criminal activities and inform police management on appropriate policing strategies. The Garda authorities have also initiated a broad study into illegal drug use and associated crime. The results of this research will provide a clear picture in relation to overall trends in drug misuse.</P>

      <P>Fireworks are deemed to be explosives under the provisions of the Explosives Act 1875. They may be imported into the State only under an importation licence granted by my Department. It is a long-standing policy that these licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by professional and experienced operators. The Explosives Act also provides for restrictions on the sale of fireworks.</P>
      <P>Despite these restrictions, fireworks are imported illegally especially around Hallowe'en. However, the Garda Commissioner has informed me that each year the Garda Síochána puts in place special operations to address the problem in the lead-up to and during that time. This involves the gathering of information and appropriate follow-up action by the Garda aimed at the seizure of illicit fireworks and involves close liaison with local authorities.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the probation and welfare service office to be established in Donaghmede will be a local office and not a regional office. The probation and welfare service, nationwide, has moved towards localisation of its offices within the past number of years. Local service delivery enhances co-operation from those people working with the probation and welfare service who are normally also based locally.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, the probation and welfare service has been successful in establishing offices in Dún Laoghaire, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Finglas, Crumlin and Clondalkin. These offices are sited in local communities, alongside businesses, over shops and within industrial units. No complaint has been received by the probation and welfare service to date from any member of the public about the behaviour of those attending a local office, nor has any complaint been brought to the attention of any officer of the service about the behaviour of those attending a local office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> The premises concerned were identified over three years ago by the service and the Office of Public Works as being suitable for a probation and welfare service local office. A lease was subsequently arranged with the owners of the shopping centre. Planning permission was sought and obtained in 2002 to adapt the building to service the needs of the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the probation and welfare service will, for the most part, deal with people attending the office on an appointment basis to meet their obligations to the courts or if they are in crisis due to homelessness or other personal or family difficulty. Clients will include those on whom the court has ordered reports, prior to considering the type of sanction it will impose, and those who are on statutory orders from the court, either a probation order or a community service order. There are no known child sex offenders under the supervision of the probation and welfare service in the area at present. In addition, parents whose children's behaviour is causing them concern often seek advice from service personnel. Others who visit service local offices include lawyers, gardaí, other statutory and voluntary agencies and representatives of local communities. There is no reason to believe that the Donaghmede office will be any different from the other local offices in this regard.</P>
    <P>I met with representatives of the residents associations adjacent to Donaghmede shopping centre in October 2002 and also held a further meeting with local elected representatives on this matter. During these meetings, I acknowledged the concerns expressed about the possible impact on the area. However, I also encouraged all concerned to give the probation and welfare service the opportunity to demonstrate that the office can operate to professional standards as in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>A monitoring group for the office will be established comprising representatives of the residents, traders of the shopping centre, the property management group, the probation and welfare service and the Garda. The probation and welfare service has not been given a date to move into the Donaghmede premises as building work is still ongoing. It is anticipated that the move will take place later this year. The first review of the operation of the office is planned to take place after six to 12 months of operation allowing for a settling in period which will involve setting the office up, meetings, etc. I intend to take appropriate action, if in the collective opinion of the monitoring group, it transpires that the presence of the office is linked to a significant rise in criminality in the area.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my response to his Parliamentary Question No. 1155 on 30 September 2003, following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of &ldquo;L&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo;, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish-born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There is a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered &ndash; but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport him. In that context, he will be notified of the proposal and given an opportunity to make representations in relation to it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order, he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Due to the large number of such cases on hand, I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that when the go-ahead was given to proceed with the installation of the above 17 town centre CCTV systems, it was decided that the implementation of the CCTV systems in these locations would proceed on a phased basis. Phase 1 of the scheme comprises Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The contract for the supply, installation and commissioning of Garda CCTV systems for these locations was awarded to SKS Communications Limited and work on the implementation of these systems is on-going at present. Phase 2 of the scheme comprises Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford. The pre-tender process for these systems is at an advanced stage. Phase 3 of the scheme comprises Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo. The planning for the installation of these is scheduled to commence later this year. Until the planning for the CCTV system has been completed it is not possible to ascertain how much the system in Kilkenny will cost. However, it has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV camera is, on average, &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000 per camera excluding associated civil works.</P>

    <P>It is clear that drink driving continues to present a major challenge. We still have a problem with drivers who see fit to risk their own lives, and those of others, by engaging in driving while intoxicated. However, the statistics strongly indicate that the increased level of enforcement by the Garda Síochána over recent years is having a positive effect upon road casualties. The annual report of the Garda Síochána for 2001, shows that the 12,841 arrests made in 2001 represented a 70% increase over the number recorded in 1997, and 23% higher than the corresponding figure for 2000.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Race Directive, 2000/43/EC, is to provide a flexible general framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin in both the employment and non-employment areas. Discrimination in relation to employment and in the supply of goods and services on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race &ndash; which includes race, colour, nationality, or ethnic or national origins &ndash; and membership of the Traveller community is already prohibited in Ireland following commencement of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000. Ireland's legislation is already largely in compliance with the race directive.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the comments of EU Commissioner, Anna Diamantopoulou, where she expressed her concern that most member states failed to transpose the race directive into national law by the target date of 19 July 2003. Implementation of the race directive necessitates amendments to both the Employment Equality Act 1998 and to the Equal Status Act 2000. On 9 May 2003 the Government approved the drafting of the Employment Equality and Equal Status (Amendment) Bill, on a priority basis, to implement the race directive and also two further equality directives, namely, the Framework Employment Directive, 2000/78/EC and the Gender Equal Treatment Directive, 2002/73/EC, which must be implemented by 2 December 2003 and 5 October 2005, respectively. Furthermore, implementation of the directives necessitates amendments to legislation to provide for equality in relation to occupational pensions which will be dealt with by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the Social Welfare Bill 2004.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality and Equal Status (Amendment) Bill is with the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. It is intended to ensure that the provisions of the directives will apply to all nine grounds covered by the 1998 and 2000 Acts, where possible. Once drafted, the Bill will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a common approach at EU level to the designation of safe countries of origin and safe third countries is <Col N="1782" /> being considered in the context of discussions on a proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawal of refugee status.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 2 and 3 October 2003, there was general agreement that the proposed directive should include a mechanism for the establishment of a minimum common list of safe countries of origin binding on all member states. The intention is that the list will be established after consultation with the European Parliament. The proposed directive also makes provision for member states to establish national lists designating states as safe countries of origin which may include countries not on the common list.</P>
      <P>There was also agreement at the JHA Council that discussions should continue on the establishment of common EU criteria providing for the national designation of countries as safe third countries. While I am aware of the views on these proposals put forward by both NGOs and the UNHCR in the context of discussions on the proposed directive, I would point out that both the safe country of origin and safe third country principles are supported by Ireland and were included in the recent amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 contained in the Immigration Act 2003, which were commenced on 15 September 2003. They are also applied in a number of other EU states.</P>
      <P>Discussions on these proposals will continue at EU working party level over the coming weeks. The European Council at its meeting at Thessaloniki set a deadline of 31 December 2003 for the adoption of this directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent launch, during the September 2003 National Adult Literacy Week, of an Irish Prison Service publication entitled, The Prison Adult Literacy Survey Results and Implications. Preparation of this study was funded by a grant awarded by the policy planning and research unit of my Department.</P>
      <P>The study examines the literacy levels among the prison population in Ireland, based on questionnaires compiled by a random sample of the approximately 3000 persons in custody in May 2001. One of the survey's aims was to ascertain how prisoners compared with the general population with regard to literacy skills. This is important since accurate statistics are important in planning the most appropriate kind of courses for prisoners.</P>
      <P>The major results of the survey show that a significant number of prisoners have virtually no literacy skills &ndash; 52% of them were at level 1 or pre-level 1 literacy levels. In other words, more than twice as many prisoners are at the lowest level as compared with the general population. The survey's results, I should point out, are broadly in line with findings from other countries.</P>
      <P>Successive policy initiatives in relation to the prisons, dating from the Whitaker report in 1985, have placed emphasis on the crucial role education can play in the management and rehabilitation of prisoners. A particular commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government states, &ldquo;We will tackle the high level of illiteracy and lack of educational accomplishment prevalent in many prisoners by supporting enhanced educational programmes within prisons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific actions in relation to the above Government commitment by the Irish Prison Service include: the prison education curriculum is currently under review to ensure continuing relevance to prisoner needs; the recent launch by the Irish Prison Service of the research study cited by the Deputy; and the development by the prison education service of guidelines for quality literacy work in prisons which aims to facilitate prison education units to reach and retain a larger number of prisoners with literacy problems. <Col N="1784" /> Implementation of the guidelines is in progress in all prisons and places of detention.</P>
    <P>The research survey also investigated as to whether or not there was a possible relationship between prisoners' poor literacy skills and certain types of crime. This aspect of the study warrants further examination by the different agencies across the criminal justice system. Arrangements are in hand for the wider dissemination of the publication among these agencies for their consideration.</P>
    <P>Furthermore in relation to the investigation of a possible linkage between participation in education by prisoners and a reduction in recidivism, the Irish Prison Service has recently agreed to support a leading criminological academic body to enable it to undertake a multilevel study of prisoner recidivism. Among variables to feature in the analysis will be data on a sizeable sample of prisoners including offence and offender characteristics such as age, gender, education, marital status, criminal history, offence type, length of sentence served, whether the offender participated in specialised programmes etc. It is intended that the research will begin in the coming months and will run for about three years.</P>
    <P>The allocation in the 2003 Prisons Vote for the day-to-day running costs of prison educational services amounts to &euro;1,077,000, which is a decrease of &euro;101,000 on the 2002 outturn. Notwithstanding this, the 2003 allocation represents an increase of about 25% over the outturn in this area of &euro;864,000 in 2000. The Deputy will note, therefore, that there has been a significant increase in funding of prison educational services since 2000.</P>
    <P>I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has allocated funding of &euro;5.577 million this year to the 64 Garda youth diversion projects and related projects operating in both urban and rural areas at present.</P>
    <P>Garda youth diversion projects are crime prevention initiatives which adopt a multiagency partnership approach to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level. The role of the Garda youth diversion projects is to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order, can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project.</P>
    <P>Project co-ordinators and advisory and management committees are required to regularly review and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the projects to ensure every effort is made to meet the overall aims and objectives of the project. The projects target young people who are likely to drop out of the educational system prematurely, with high quality intervention programmes in areas of acute social disadvantage. The optimum age for participation in the Garda youth diversion projects is 12 to 17 years of age. Participation of young people from the age of ten and those aged 18 will be at the discretion of the referral assessment committees. The target group are likely to be from families where there is a <Col N="1785" /> history of early school leaving; have poor literacy skills; be disadvantaged socially, often as a result of alcoholism, drug addiction, and poor parenting skills; have little or no scope of entering regular skilled employment; be unable to access mainstream education and training programmes; and be at risk of becoming chronically unemployable, with the risk of entry into vandalism, crime, drugs and finally prison.</P>

      <P>My Department has been concerned to have an adequate legislative and financial framework in place within which local authorities, voluntary bodies and Travellers may provide or be assisted in the provision of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework for the provision of Traveller accommodation is set out in primary legislation, the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. Under that Act, each county and city council, borough council and the town councils of Bray and Dundalk were required to prepare, adopt and take any reasonable steps necessary to implement five-year Traveller accommodation <Col N="1787" /> programmes covering the period 2000 to 2004. All relevant local authorities adopted such programmes and are in the process of implementing them.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to provide the necessary funding to meet the cost to local authorities of the provision of Traveller specific accommodation. Total expenditure under this accommodation capital programme during its first three years was &euro;65.46 million. A further &euro;30 million has been allocated in 2003 for Traveller specific accommodation.</P>
    <P>This expenditure is in addition to the expenditure on standard local authority accommodation funded under my Department's local authority housing programme and housing provided by voluntary housing bodies and funded under my Department's voluntary housing schemes which was allocated to Travellers in this period.</P>

      <P>The Department of Public Enterprise engaged a firm of outside consultants to conduct an investigation into allegations of bullying and harassment in Met Éireann in May 2002. Responsibility for Met Éireann was transferred to this Department in June 2002 following the formation of the Government and the reallocation of functions between some Departments. My Department paid for this investigation.</P>
      <P>Since then the same company has been requested to conduct three further investigations, one in Dublin, one in Kilkenny and one in Donegal.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the inception of the plastic bag levy, receipts remitted to my Department by the Revenue Commissioners amount to almost &euro;16 million. Introduction of the levy has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers with a consequent positive environmental benefit.</P>
      <P>Revenues from the levy are paid into the environment fund. It may be used to support a wide range of waste management, litter and other environmental initiatives as provided for in section 74(9) of the Waste Management Act 1996, as inserted by section 12 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations 2001 designate the Revenue Commissioners as the responsible authority for enforcing the collection of the plastic shopping bag levy. In addition, the regulations impose a supplementary requirement on retailers to pass on the full amount of the levy to customers. This regulatory provision is being enforced by local authorities. The relevant enforcement officers have extensive powers to enter any retail premises, to conduct any searches or investigations considered necessary, and to inspect or remove any records, books and documents for the purposes of any proceedings in relation to the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has had few complaints about non-compliance. I recognise the need to ensure that the efforts and commitment of the vast majority of retailers are not undermined by the <Col N="1794" /> non-compliance of a few. My Department wrote to local authorities in regard to the regulations and also met representatives of all local authorities to discuss enforcement and other aspects of the levy, prior to its introduction. A further detailed circular on enforcement was issued to local authorities asking them to pay particular attention to the identification and follow-up of any non-compliance with the law. All complaints received in my Department concerning non-compliance are forwarded to the relevant local authority and the Revenue Commissioners. The operation of the levy is also subject to the normal Revenue Commissioners auditing arrangements.</P>
    <P>While the levy is operating successfully, my Department intends to carry out a detailed review of its operation and arrangements for this are being put in place.</P>

      <P>In October 2001 my Department undertook a public consultation process regarding a potential ban on bituminous coal and petcoke nationally. On foot of this process the then Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Dan Wallace, and the Solid Fuel Trade Group, which represents the principal importers and distributors of solid fuel in Ireland, signed a voluntary agreement on 5 June 2002. It provides for significantly cleaner standards for bituminous coal and petcoke.</P>
      <P>The agreement also encompasses the extension of the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal to four new areas, Bray, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tralee, from October 2003 bringing the total number of such bans in operation nationally to 16. Under the agreement the phased penetration of increased smokeless fuels, rising to 75% of overall solid fuel sales, in Athlone, Carlow, Clonmel and Ennis by October 2004 is also provided for. A first review of its provisions will be undertaken by December and a second review by December 2004. The agreement provides that the later review will have, <i>inter alia,</i> the aim of building on ambition for the period beyond 2005.

Is dúshlán dúinn go léir an ísliú atá tagtha ar líon na nGaeilgeoirí laethúla &ndash; lasmuigh agus taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht &ndash; agus tuar dóchais ag an am gcéanna an t-ardú ar líon na ndaoine a bhfuil sé ar a gcumas Gaeilge a labhairt.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> Agus mé ag tabhairt faoi pholasaithe a fhorbairt amach anseo maidir le ról na teanga sa Stát, beidh sé mar aidhm lárnach agam spreagadh agus tacaíocht a chur ar fáil chun cur leis an méid dóibh siúd a bhfuil deis acu Gaeilge a úsáid go laethúil. Chuige sin, ba mhaith liom a chur i gcuimhne don Teachta go bhfuil Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla ina dhlí anois agus is é príomhchuspóir an Achta sin ná soláthar níos mó de sheirbhísí i nGaeilge a chur ar fáil ón seirbhís phoiblí ar chaighdeán níos airde.  </P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, creidim gurb í an Ghaeilge ceann de na hacmhainní nádúrtha is luachmhaire atá againn agus gur chun ár leasa uilig é í a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt. Tá mé cinnte, leis an gcur chuige ceart, agus le gach uile duine ag obair le chéile, gur féidir linn difríocht an-mhór a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht. Caithfear an Ghaeilge a chothú agus a chur chun cinn lasmuigh agus laistigh den Ghaeltacht agus tá mo Roinnse, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Foras na Gaeilge dírithe i gcónaí chun na críche sin.</P>

      <i>Na Ceantair Ghaeltachta</i>Beidh a fhios ag an Teachta chomh maith gur bhunaigh mé coiste comhairleach i mí Dheireadh Fómhair 2002 le comhairle a chur orm maidir leis na gníomhaíochtaí a theastaíonn chun feidhm phraiticiúil a thabhairt do na moltaí éagsúla atá i dTuarascáil Choimisiún na Gaeltachta. Ag eascairt as obair an choiste chomhairligh, tá tionscadail agus tograí éagsúla idir lámha agus á gcur chun cinn ag mo Roinn. Ina measc tá: staidéar cuimsitheach teangeolaíoch maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Beidh an staidéar seo mar bhunús chun forbairt theangeolaíoch na Gaeltachta mar cheantar labhartha Gaeilge a threisiú agus mar bhunús chun athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar na limistéir oifigiúla Ghaeltachta. Tá tairiscintí i leith an staidéir seo faighte agus á scrúdú ag mo Roinn faoi láthair agus táthar ag súil leis go mbeidh tús curtha leis an staidéar féin go luath; feachtas ilghnéitheach feasachta teanga a bheidh mar aidhm aige comhairle a chur ar thuismitheoirí ionchasacha agus tuismitheoirí pháistí óga, go dtí cúig bliana d'aois, go háirithe tuismitheoirí Gaeltachta maidir leis na buntáistí a bhaineann le Gaeilge a roghnú mar phríomhtheanga an teaghlaigh. Tá bailchríoch á chur leis an bplean seo i ndáil leis an bhfeachtas seo faoi láthair i gcomhar le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta; aighneacht maidir le gnéithe criticiúla a mbíonn tionchar acu ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa chóras bunoideachais agus iarbhunoideachais sa Ghaeltacht curtha chuig an gComhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, atá ag obair faoi stiúr na Roinne Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, thar ceann an choiste chomhairligh i mí Bealtaine; aighneachtaí curtha chuig na comhairlí chontae uilig le ceantair Ghaeltachta faoina gcúram lena n-aird a dhíriú ar na dualgais atá orthu i ndáil leis an nGaeltacht chomh fada is a bhaineann sé le cúrsaí pleanála de go háirithe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> Anuas air seo chomh maith, níos luaithe i mbliana, thug mé treoir dÚdarás na Gaeltachta nach mór dó 20% dá bhuiséad caipitil i 2003 a chaitheamh ar thograí Gaeilge-lárnaithe, chun deiseanna fostaíochta do bhunadh na Gaeltachta agus lucht labhartha na Gaeilge i gcoitinne a threisiú.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a rá chomh maith go bhfuil go leor forbairtí curtha chun cinn sna ceantair Ghaeltachta le cabhair ó scéimeanna mo Roinnse, go háirithe na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin, le cúpla bliain anuas. Tá sé mar sprioc ag mo Roinnse, leis an airgead atá ar fáil faoi na scéimeanna seo, go speisialta an t-airgead a cuireadh ar fáil faoin bplean forbartha náisiúnta, cur le h-inmharthanacht phobal na Gaeltachta agus da bhrí sin an Ghaeilge a neartú agus a bhuanú sa Ghaeltacht. Cuirfidh an maoiniú seo go mór le forbairt theangeolaíoch, chultúrtha, agus eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta. Muna bhfuil an t-infrastruchtúr ceart sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ní bheidh na ceantair sin in ann tairbhe a bhaint as na deiseanna cruthaithe fostaíochta nua-aimseartha atá riachtanach don Ghaeltacht agus do thodhchaí na Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>My Department supported by ADM Limited, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. Plans have been prepared for each of the 45 RAPID areas and proposals from these plans have been forwarded by ADM Limited to the relevant Department for consideration. It is a matter for each of the other Departments to report on the implementation of the programme in relation to proposals that fall within the remit of their Department. I am in a position to comment only in relation to proposals from RAPID plans that fall under the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>Of the plans that have been prepared for the three RAPID areas in Tallaght, five project proposals were submitted to my Department for consideration. These five projects comprised the addiction response project in Killinarden, two proposals relating to funding for drugs rehabilitation and prevention projects and two proposals that are relevant to the young people's facilities and services fund. A sum of &euro;1 million has been allocated to the project in Killinarden under the premises initiative and these premises are now open.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 529 and 530 together.</P>
      <P>The community development programme was established in 1990 in order to develop a network of projects in communities experiencing economic and social disadvantage. Notwithstanding the current economic climate, this objective has been largely achieved with 175 projects established nationwide and a further 15 projects, currently at pre-development stage, scheduled to come on stream in 2004, subject to resource availability. Any future decisions relating to the programme will be informed both by the outcome of the review of all schemes under my Department's remit, which is ongoing, and future resource availability.</P>
      <P>My Department supports a total of five projects in the Kerry area under the community development support programmes. In 2002 two applications were received from Kerry based groups seeking inclusion in the CDSPs, one of which is based in Dingle, and the other in Annascaul. In the case of the Annascaul group, further information was requested in order to inform the application. No subsequent correspondence was received. Given the tighter financial situation currently pertaining the Dingle based group were informed last May that it would not be possible to progress its application further. The priority this year is to focus available resources on existing commitments to established projects and to those projects already approved for entry to the programme.</P>

      <P>My Department supports a range of structures and programmes that recognise the important role of volunteers in the area of community development. These include: provision for the participation of community volunteers on the boards or other governance structures of partnerships, CDPs, Leader groups, RAPID area implementation teams; and funding of measures to address, through voluntary activities, a range of challenges facing communities, including disadvantage and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The national committee on volunteering has reported on a range of volunteering issues, including ways in which volunteering can be recognised, encouraged and supported by the State. Its is extremely detailed and comprehensive. The process of examination and consideration of its recommendations, including the matters raised by the Deputy, is continuing in my Department. </P>

      <Quest>if the Government has plans to make some payment to women who are working in the home full time.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the social welfare system there are already a number of payments which are made to women working in the home.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is normally payable to the mother. Since 2001 there has been a significant investment in the level of child benefit payments. The universal nature of the payment means that it supports those who choose to work in the home and care for their children in that way, as well as assisting those who opt to go out to work and use child care arrangements. With effect from April, child benefit rates for first and second children increased to &euro;125.60 per month with the rate for third and subsequent children now standing at &euro;157.30 per month.</P>
      <P>I am committed to improving the position of people who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives. Measures already introduced, including the reduction in the average number of PRSI contributions required for pension purposes to ten and the extra recognition afforded to pre-53 contributions, are making it easier for people with reduced or broken insurance records to receive a pension.</P>
      <P>Another improvement relates to the Government commitment to increase the rate of the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age to the full old age pension rate. A report of the PPF working group examined the issues of administrative individualisation was published in September 2002. Arrangements are now in place whereby new pension applicants can opt to have part of the pension paid directly to the qualified adult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The homemaker scheme was introduced in <Col N="1801" /> 1994 to protect the pension entitlement of people who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives. It is being reviewed in the context of an overall review of qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pension. I expect to publish a report it shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the plans that the Government has to abolish the means test for carer's allowance as mentioned by Minister of State, Deputy Callely, recently while speaking at the Age Action Ireland international conference.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in successive budgets for substantial increases in the income disregards for the scheme. Last April the weekly income disregards increased to &euro;210 for a single carer and to &euro;420 for a couple. The effect of this increase is that a couple with two children and earning a joint income of up to &euro;24,150 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>The same couple, if they had an income of &euro;39,750, could still qualify for partial carer's allowance, the free schemes and the respite care grant.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to expand the income limits for the carer's allowance so that all those on average industrial incomes can qualify. The arrangements for progressing this will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and are living alone. It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.</P>
      <P>The allowance was last increased in 1996. The policy in relation to support for older people has been to commit resources to improving the personal pension rates for all pensioners.</P>
      <P>At present there are just over 136,000 people receiving the living alone allowance. The majority are over 66 years of age with about 17,000 aged under 66 receiving invalidity type payments. The annual cost of the allowance is about &euro;55.5 million.</P>
      <P>An increase in the allowance would have to be considered in the budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The health boards administer the scheme on behalf of my Department. The information sought in respect of the years 2000 to 2002, inclusive, in so far as it is available, is set out in the following tabular statement. In 2003, 75,730 applications were received in respect of some 150,000 children in the period to 1 October. This is approximately 3% less than the final total for 2002. The number of applications approved in 2003 is not available at this time.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the average length of time it takes to process and decide claims in each of the social welfare schemes; the length of time it takes for each scheme to go into payment once a decision is made; and the average length of time it takes for arrears to issue.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is committed to providing quality customer service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and entitlements issued as quickly as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.</P>
      <P>I shall outline the average clearance times for new claims for the month of August and year to date, including August on a scheme by scheme basis. The length of time it takes to process new claims depends on the work that is required to ensure that all the eligibility conditions are satisfied. These conditions vary from scheme to scheme and may include establishment of the customer's social insurance record, an assessment of means where appropriate or an examination to ensure that medical reports meet statutory criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On average the length of time taken to award claims for disability benefit, the unemployment schemes, child benefit and family income supplement ranges from two to three weeks. Claims <Col N="1804" /> for old age, widowed and invalidity pensions take six to eight weeks to process and complex cases such as carers, one parent family and disability allowance require ten to 17 weeks.</P>
    <P>Once a claim is decided payment is normally made within one week. For the year 2003 to date the average time to issue pension arrears is 2.5 weeks.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the reason new payable order books for disability allowance do not include a payment for the week of 31 December, yet continue on with a payment for January 2004; and when this will be rectified for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest renewal of order books for disablement allowance recipients was intended to cover the 26 week period from 1 October. The order for 31 December was omitted due to a printing error. A problem of this nature has not previously arisen and steps are being taken to ensure that there will not be a recurrence. Arrangements are being made to issue a single voucher to all affected beneficiaries in good time for payment on 31 December. My Department will write to them to explain the position shortly.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if she will consider offering free travel to all persons who attend hospital on a regular basis, in view of the fact that at present, the carer is the only person entitled to same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Children who are registered as blind or visually impaired with either the National Council for the Blind of Ireland or the National League of the Blind of Ireland are also entitled to free travel. An extension to the free travel scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>In regard to travel for people requiring medical treatment, under the provisions of the Health Acts a health board may make arrangements for the conveyance of patients to and from hospitals.</P>
