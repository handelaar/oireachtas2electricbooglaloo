      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Over recent weeks the Taoiseach has resolutely refused to answer as to Ireland's position in regard to a unilateral invasion of Iraq by the United States. I do not wish to waste his time, but I would like to ask him two questions. Has the Government had discussions formally or informally, officially or unofficially with the US authorities in regard to the continued use of Shannon in the event of unilateral action being taken, or are we to assume that America is planning an invasion on the assumption that Shannon will be available to it?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has agreed that he is opposed to war and that he supports the United Nations. He has agreed with the words of Kofi Annan. In the event that Ireland sticks with the Security Council, will the Taoiseach rule out action that would weaken the United Nations and will he state clearly that he is prepared to take action to that effect?</P>
      <P>He said yesterday that he does not want to deal in hypothetical situations and that people are not giving end-line positions. &ldquo;End line position&rdquo; is a term used by business tycoons. I would much prefer to hear words like &ldquo;morality, leadership&rdquo; and &ldquo;openness&rdquo;, but having listened to the New Zealand ambassador this morning, I noted that he gave an end-line position, as did President Fox from Mexico and others. Therefore, they do not deal in hypothetical situations. Hypothesis is also about planning. Will the Taoiseach answer those two direct questions? What is the position in regard to Shannon? Has he had discussions with the US and will he rule out action that would weaken the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's first question, no, we have had no discussions whatsoever with the United States formally or informally, directly or indirectly. The answer to his second question is that our position is, as it has been since last summer and in the nine weeks in preparation of Resolution 1441, which was finally adopted on 8 November, that we will continue to support the United Nations. We played a key and <Col N="1242" />important &ndash; although I do not wish to overstate it &ndash; role in the preparation of Resolution 1441. We have supported the United Nations throughout and we have strongly supported it in our efforts on the Security Council. We have played a consistent role, as we have done since 1955, and we will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>We believe that war can still be avoided. Resolution 1441 and the credible threat of force which underpins it has resulted in progress. The assistance of Shannon in its own small way has helped in that, which has been acknowledged by the European Council and the Security Council.</P>
      <P>I will not do what some leaders have done in this regard. The Deputy was correct in saying that some people have taken categorical positions. Many of them also did that last September. The position of some of the leaders and some of the countries the Deputy mentioned was that they believed that the United States would go ahead without a resolution. They discounted Resolution 1441 as a non-event that would not happen, but that proved to be incorrect.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that we will be consistent in our position. We will stand with the Security Council and not do anything to undermine it. We do not accept the view taken by some that a second resolution is not required. Perhaps legally and technically that argument can be made, but we do not accept it. We believe the correct thing to do politically, for the world to see how the system works, is to introduce a further resolution before there is action, but we are more interested in ensuring that there is no need for action. Therefore, all our efforts at this stage should be pointed towards avoiding war and conflict and, most importantly, keeping our focus where it should be and should remain, namely, on Saddam Hussein and his cruel regime, under which he has used weapons of mass destruction against his own people and his neighbours. He has followed a system of crime against his people and we must ensure that system is defeated and that Resolution 1441 and the principles of the other 17 resolutions prior to it are adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is an extraordinary man to split another hair. He does not agree with some of the leaders who say that a second resolution is not necessary. Is he talking about the United States and Britain? The Taoiseach does not want to deal in hypotheticals, yet on &ldquo;Six-one&rdquo; on Monday, the Minister for Defence did deal with hypotheticals, and real ones. He said that this country had upped its security at all its airports, that we were in constant emergency committee session, that he was liaising with medical personnel and the Department of Health and Children and that he was to report to the Taoiseach yesterday morning on the possibility of any outcome, including germ warfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this mean? Is this another debacle like the factsheets and iodine tablets? Are the people to understand that, on the one hand, the Taoiseach is dealing with hypotheticals while, on <Col N="1243" />the other hand, the Minister for Defence is planning for what might arise in the event of unilateral action? Those hypotheticals are the men, women and children who marched last Saturday and who live in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the events of 11 September 2001 have not slipped Deputy Kenny's mind. All of the actions taken subsequently in relation to security and the efforts put into dealing with the potential for biological and chemical warfare have arisen from 11 September and do not have anything to do with Iraq. The Minister for Defence has co-ordinated his efforts with the health agencies. The Minister for Health and Children has put in place many different initiatives to deal with various medical difficulties that could arise from biological or chemical attacks. We have implemented such measures throughout the last 18 months or so and will continue to do so. We have put additional resources into looking at the anthrax scare, at the smallpox scare and at what would happen if there was an attack in Britain. Of course we have heightened security. The Government would be inept, to say the least, if it did not take account of what is going on all over the world. That is the reason we have heightened security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The public will be amazed to hear the Taoiseach say that his Government has had no discussions, formally or informally, directly or indirectly, with the American Government. I wish to return to the discussion I had with the Taoiseach during questions to the Taoiseach yesterday about the millions of euro his Government is spending on promoting its own image, and to return specifically to the communications unit. The Taoiseach said that the purpose of this unit is to communicate matters from the media to Ministers and himself. I wonder whether the open letter in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner</i> from the young mother of two who is a progressive MS sufferer was brought to the Taoiseach's attention by the communications unit.</P>
      <P>This young mother of two cannot cook, cannot use the bathroom independently and cannot be transferred from her wheelchair to her bed or her car. Her two young children, aged 12 and 13, have to care for her. She lost her home help from 11 November 2002 until 9 January 2003. The bureaucratic obstruction she encounters from the health board means she is again in receipt of 90 minutes per day of assistance. Did the Taoiseach's communications unit bring this matter to his attention and that of the Minister for Health and Children and, if it did, is it acceptable to his Government?</P>

      <P>The answer is the same anyway. I am only joking, I just wanted to see what the reaction would be. I did see the sad letter from Lorraine Leake in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner.</i> As I recall, she outlined the difficulties she had with her two children&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My information has nothing to do with the communications unit. I read the newspaper myself. Lorraine Leake &ndash; who is from Cork and probably from the Minister for Health and Children's constituency &ndash; stated that she felt the public services had not reacted quickly enough to her and that it was a bureaucratic system that had not responded to her letter. Public services should respond in the first instance and deal with cases such as this. It would not be proper for me to give the background to an individual case. Each case has its own individual circumstances. It was certainly a heart-rending letter, however, from an individual who needs support. On the general point, the carer's system&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Either we have a rule that the leaders ask the questions and I answer, a Cheann Comhairle, or we do not. Deputy Rabbitte and I read the article, but there are others here who do not know what they are talking about. I am trying to answer the question in relation to the plight and circumstances of Lorraine Leake and to try to assist that case if that is what Members want me to do. If they want to just play games and use Lorraine Leake as a reason to do so, that is very sad. I would like to try to help in the case of Lor<Col N="1246" />raine Leake. I know, of course, that the Minister for Health and Children will endeavour to help also. I make the point again, however, that additional resources have been made available for the carer's allowance scheme and the home help scheme.</P>
      <P>In a case like this, it is a matter for the health board to deal sympathetically with the individual concerned. Lorraine Leake stated that there had been no administrative dealing with her letter, and that should of course not be the case. It is wrong of an agency not to answer a letter and deal with a case. I do not have knowledge of the background circumstances, however, or of the other side of the story.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is remarkable that the Taoiseach does not have the background to the case given that he knows the name of the letter writer although I did not mention it. The funding for home help has been cut. The Minister tried to mislead the House on this matter last night but the hours have been cut back. There are 6,000 people suffering from MS in Ireland, of which about 1,000 are progressive sufferers. All of them encounter bureaucratic obstruction in being assessed for home help or a personal assistant, yet nothing is being done about it. This harrowing case is typical of the cases that exist. If the communications unit is so effective that the Taoiseach knows the name of this letter writer, why does not he know the details of the case and tell the House what he is going to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The communications unit had nothing to do with me reading the letter &ndash; I read it in the newspapers last night. It is a sad letter and, if I recall correctly, I think the writer said it was a voluntary agency and not a health board that had not replied. Deputy Rabbitte said nothing has been done but that is not true. We have made a significant investment in carers, home helps, respite carers and carers benefit schemes all of which were designed to assist people with difficulties like MS. I am well aware of MS and its progressive nature and I know many people who suffer from it. I am also well aware of the efforts made by the health boards and the aid given to organisations to assist them and we will continue to do this.</P>

      <P>The letter dates from 2002, not 2003. These issues are being dealt with and there has been a considerable expansion in care and treatment. There are 4,500 additional patients receiving home help, but that does not take from what Deputy Rabbitte first asked about the sad case involving this individual. I will ask the Minister, who has probably already taken up the case, to do what he can to assist her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Taoiseach's previous reply that he has had contact with the Bush Administration in the United States regarding the Iraqi crisis. Will the Taoiseach outline who he has contacted, who has been in contact with him and what discussions have taken place?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. David Andrews, Mr. Sean Donlon, the former Irish ambassador to Washington and spokespersons for the IDA, who said they do not believe there will be any negative economic consequences for Ireland if the Government takes a strong stance in opposing a pre-emptive strike on Iraq or unilateral action? Will the Taoiseach outline his position on Resolution 1441 given that other members of the United Nations are voluntarily &ndash; presumably without pressure from their opposition parties &ndash; outlining what they see as the extent and limitations of the resolution? The people took to the streets in their thousands on Saturday and given that other countries have no problem in outlining their positions, will the Taoiseach outline the Irish position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I previously reported to the House, I discussed this matter with Ambassador Haass a number of weeks ago. This is the only discussion I have had but we did not discuss what might happen if there was unilateral action by the United States or if Resolution 1441 was not moved on. The ambassador was aware of the Irish view from a previous meeting. Ireland believes there should be a resolution and does not believe war is inevitable. We believe in the European position outlined earlier in the week and the statement of Kofi Annan, speaking on behalf of the Security Council. We will continue to do all we can to assist in this matter.</P>
      <P>We have said at every opportunity that we must preserve the Security Council as the body with primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Ireland has always been, and will continue to be, a committed supporter of the system of collective security of the UN with the Security Council at its centre. On Monday the EU's leaders pledged their support for the Security Council in the discharge of its responsibilities. It is now up to Iraq to discharge its responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the issue. However, there are 591 American companies in this country and total American investment in Ireland stands at over &euro;40 billion. American industry in Ireland is bigger than either agriculture or tourism. These are facts and considerations. They are not the key issues and do not influence the Government but neither should they be ignored. I am not a hypocrite and when I go to the United States to meet the economic advisory council, support the IDA or seek changes in American tax law, I am looking to a friendly country. My interest is not in finding excuses to criticise the United States. I support the primacy of the Security Council and will remain balanced, unlike the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach still has to tell us if he agrees with Sean Donlon and David Andrews and spokespersons for the IDA that there would not be negative economic consequences. I agree with the Taoiseach that investment is important but it is not the only issue in the serious humanitarian crisis that is unfolding. Austria has similarly friendly relations with the United States but it has said that as a neutral country, it cannot allow over-flights or troop trains to go through its territory. Will the Taoiseach tell us if he will go this far?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach provide the House with information on the cost to the taxpayer of the huge increase of flights going over this country? Judging by air traffic control statistics from last Saturday, the largest aeroplanes in the world passed overhead every 20 or 30 minutes carrying tanks and military equipment to the Middle East.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has never charged for over-flights and I have no idea what the cost is. The Deputy can table a parliamentary question to ascertain those costs but he will have difficulty getting this information. Nevertheless, it is a matter for the relevant Department.</P>

Some 18 resolutions have been passed in the past 12 years to ensure that he co-operates with the inspectors and complies with what the world's governments have asked him to do.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Section 11(1) of the Public Service Management Act 1997 makes provision for the appointment of special advisers to my office. As provided for in section 11(3) of the Act, the terms and conditions of these appointments are subject to determination by the Minister for Finance. The appointments are subject to the Civil Service Regulations Acts 1956 to 1996 and any other Act for the time being in force relating to the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Under the requirements of section 19 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 I am obliged to lay details concerning my political appointees before the House on an annual basis. Deputies will therefore have been aware for some time of the arrangements that apply in my office. Inevitably, there are changes in personnel and structure from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political advisers appointed to my Department since the recent general election remain broadly the same as before with some changes in personnel. Dr. Martin Mansergh and Mr. Peter MacDonagh have resigned and Ms Barbara Jones, who carried out speech writing duties, has returned to the Department of Foreign Affairs. On 6 June 2002 I appointed Mr. Joe Lennon, for<Col N="1250" />mer Government press officer, and Mr. Brian Murphy, former special adviser to Ministers of State, as special advisers. I re-appointed Mr. Gerry Hickey as my programme manager and special adviser and Mr. Gerard Howlin and Ms Una Claffey as special advisers. In addition, Mr. Carl Gibney has been appointed as special adviser to the Government Chief Whip to replace Mr. Frank Lahiffe. The programme manager for the Tánaiste, Ms Katherine Bulbulia, is based in my Department. A list of current special advisers was printed in the Official Report on 15 October last.</P>
    <P>The role of my political appointees is to assist me in dealing with the complexities and volume of Government business. Their terms of reference and job description are no different than those of their predecessors. My political appointees advise me on a wide range of matters, including administrative, business, financial and economic issues. Under the direction of my programme manager, their primary function is to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the Government's programme. In this regard, each of my advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my Department for Ministers and their advisers. They also liaise on my behalf with organisations and interest groups outside of Government.</P>
    <P>My programme manager meets ministerial advisers on a weekly basis and reviews the papers for the Government meeting of that week. With his colleagues, he monitors and reports to me on the programme for Government. In the course of their duties, my programme manager and advisers attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to the Departments with which they liaise. In addition, a number of my advisers have specific responsibilities in the drafting of speeches.</P>
    <P>There has been no increase in the number of special advisers working for the Government compared with the rainbow Government. Under the current Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, 33 politically appointed programme managers, special advisers and press secretaries assist the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers across all Departments. Of these, seven are civil servants. This compares with 31 under the previous Government, seven of whom were civil servants, and 55 under the rainbow Government, of whom one was a civil servant.</P>
    <P>A list of other non-established civil servants or contract staff in my Department appointed since the general election follows:</P>

What is the number of advisers appointed by the Government for Ministers and Ministers of State and the cost of same?

      <P>Regarding the cross-departmental team and Cabinet committee on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships, 11 meetings are planned for this year with the most recent meetings having taken place on 11 February and 28 January respectively. The next meeting of the team is scheduled for 12 March.</P>
      <P>The team has agreed a work programme for the year, the overarching aims of which will be developing priorities under the various national development plan infrastructure headings for the remaining lifetime of the plan; working to secure better value for money outcomes, especially against the background of significant reductions in construction and tender price inflation; exploring the potential for greater use of non-Exchequer sources of funding, including PPPs, in the roll-out of national infrastructure priorities; and assessing the scope for the speedier delivery of outputs. I am confident that the agreed work programme for this year will contribute to building on the significant progress already made in implementing the infrastructure agenda set out in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cabinet committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process. Questions about the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The <Col N="1254" />reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality. As always, questions on particular policy issues should be tabled to relevant Ministers.</P>

      <P>Questions Nos. 3 to 12, inclusive, are being taken together. Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, relate to infrastructure and Questions Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, deal with the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs. The Taoiseach said he will not answer questions on Cabinet committees because their proceedings are confidential, yet the cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public private partnerships is not a Cabinet committee, rather a team of civil servants chaired by the Taoiseach's Department. Similar questions used to be answered by the Taoiseach and it is grossly unfair to lump Questions Nos. 3 to 12 together, along with questions on infrastructure. It is just not right and makes a mockery of being accountable, open and fair, which is what we are trying to do here. The Taoiseach can answer that along with my question. Can I ask&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question about procedure. Previously we had very useful exchanges during Taoiseach's Question Time, when the Minister of State responsible for the social inclusion and drugs policy deputised for the Taoiseach when these questions came up. Useful information was elicited and valuable contributions by way of question were made by Opposition Members who have experience in dealing with the scourge of drugs. Can we revert to that? The Taoiseach should now just take the questions about public private partnerships and leave the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs for separate questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>We should acknowledge that there has been a mistake here. Questions on the work of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs are quite separate from those on public private partnerships. The issues are so serious they should be separated. Can the Taoiseach acknowledge that there has been a mistake in grouping them together? The Taoiseach should respond accordingly and deal only with the PPPs <Col N="1255" />at this time and let the people, who are expecting to have the issue of drugs dealt with separately, given the opportunity to get into the House. Some of them were not expecting the questions to be grouped as they are.</P>

      <P>I do not have responsibility for the grouping, nor do I ever get involved in that. However, I see the point that Members are making. The only answer I would give to Questions Nos. 9 to 12 would be to give the date of the meetings. I do not answer questions on the details. Deputy Joe Higgins is absolutely right. In the last Government the then Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, used to come in. We stopped using that time because for two years, unfortunately, I took up all of the time and the Minister of State never got in. I know Deputy Gregory and others rightly said they never got an opportunity to ask any questions.</P>
      <P>Those questions moved to the new Department under the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív and Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. I was only answering Questions Nos. 9 to 12 to say when the meeting took place. I was not going to answer any other detailed questions. However, I see the point. If Questions Nos. 9 to 12 were dealt with under the old system, they would never be answered during Taoiseach's Question Time, because, unfortunately, I take up the hour and a half every week.</P>

If they are grouped with Taoiseach's questions, they will not get in at all. They will sit here but never get answered.

      <P>I assume the Taoiseach is not speaking hypothetically in saying he will be here anyway. I am sure the Taoiseach has taken note of the comments made by Members on how serious this is. What work has been done by the <Col N="1256" />cross-departmental team in respect of a revision of the national development plan given that the original costings are grossly out of line with the assessed cost now? Is it true that in order to save money the National Roads Authority is proposing to narrow the width of motorways, which will eliminate central reservations from those motorways? As a consequence of not having central reservations, many fatal accidents have occurred when people have travelled on the wrong carriageway. Is that a cost saving measure related to escalating costs in the plan in general?</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Kenny's question, the work programme for the year has been agreed. In the weeks ahead, there is a particular focus on financing for the infrastructure priorities over the remaining lifetime of the programme. Key to that will be the aims and overall thrust of the national spatial strategy. In relation to the road priorities, possible non-Exchequer sources of finance are being examined by the sub-group, chaired by the Department of Transport. I understand that work will be completed shortly. A cross-departmental team is working on a paper on public transport, which is also due by the end of March. It is looking at priorities, targets and non-Exchequer funding options for 2003. There are other priorities in the areas of waste management, broadband and energy. If Members want, I can give an outline of what is being done in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that investment in infrastructure is key to regaining the competitiveness we had until recently? Can the Taoiseach comment on statements by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, reported in the newspapers today, that we may have to cut back on infrastructure funding because of the stability and growth pact we have signed with the European Union? Has the Cabinet committee met the board of the National Pension Reserve Fund to discuss the possibility of investment being diverted into roads and infrastructure projects? In relation to public private partnerships, have any alternatives to tolling roads been considered? Is anyone on the sub-committee considering utilising the existing capacity within our road and rail networks, for example Operation Freeflow and rail lines in the north inner city of Dublin that are lying idle? With that in mind why is the Dublin metro proposal missing six and a half inches? The metro proposed for Dublin is based on the European gauge, which means that we cannot run DART carriages on it. Does that not sound ludicrous?</P>

      <P>I will answer a good few of the Deputy's questions without going into detail. With regard to his last question, the project is still at design stage and has not yet proceeded to tender. At this stage, none of the many groups involved is prepared to get into detail until it has seen details of the planning process, which would <Col N="1258" />still be some years ahead. The preliminary costs have to be discussed by the group which will be given a presentation on the metro project when it meets today or tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree it would make sense to have one standard rail line throughout the country, rather than different gauges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do. We had a presentation on the rail issue at the committee a few weeks ago at which a detailed report, which, I understand, has not yet been published by the Minister for Transport, was presented. The report contains a full examination of rail projects as they currently stand and also looks at rail in the long-term. There are short-term, medium-term and long-term priorities, with which the Minister must deal. It is a comprehensive and detailed report.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked a question on roads. A report is being prepared by the cross-departmental group, which is looking at all non-Exchequer sources of finance for infrastructure projects, not just tolling. The group must produce a report on whether alternative financing mechanisms have been found. As the Deputy will be aware from one of my previous answers, tolling is the mechanism which keeps coming up as it provides a stream of finance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the new National Development Finance Agency may set up companies. These will only be effective if they can raise money and generate streams of money from projects. The committee has not had meetings with those responsible for the national pension fund. If the NDFA has financial proposals which would be of benefit to the national pension fund, it is a matter for it to explore them. I have given my view on this matter previously. There is no reason the national pension fund should not finance some of the long-term capital projects. It is a matter for the NDFA to present a proposal which would be a good investment.</P>
      <P>This year some &euro;5.3 billion is being spent on infrastructure here, around twice the GDP ratio of other European countries. The only other EU state which spends anywhere near what we are spending on infrastructure is Luxembourg, which spends about 1% less than us. In GDP terms, we are spending about twice the European average on infrastructure. As we are investing significant resources, the question of the growth and stability pact does not arise. While it prevents countries spending more than the specified figure, we are already spending double what everybody else is spending, with the exception of Luxembourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into detail, the main issue now facing the cross-departmental committee and the committee is that tender prices are returning to more realistic levels, which means we can get better value for money. Our problem in recent years has been that although we spent about &euro;300 million more than projected on the roads programme by the end of its third year, we did not <Col N="1259" />get the output we wanted due to construction price inflation in the first three years, which was about 38%. We also lost significant time due to the long delays caused by foot and mouth disease, threats by farmers not to comply with CPOs and archaeological surveys. There was an astronomical increase in costs from tender prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifications on the original tenders were also changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. When the NDP was being drafted, many projects could only be specified in outline, as the Deputy correctly states. As these progressed through detailed planning, considerable re-specification took place, especially in the case of the national roads, which led to higher costs in all the projects. It never works the other way for some strange reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the cross-departmental team done an assessment of the economic cost of the traffic congestion directly attributable to the West Link bridge, especially at peak times? Can we expect proposals to do a deal with the toll bridge company to throw open the barrier at least at peak times in the morning and evening? The position is intolerable. The tailbacks are directly attributable to the barrier across what is now a distributor road and tailbacks stretch for miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Without breaking the rule by going into detail, the matter has been discussed at length and the Minister and his officials have done an amount of analysis on it. The Minister would be glad to provide the Deputy with details.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that the barrier is creating major difficulties. The State has invested hundreds of millions in the M50 to date &ndash; I think the figure is &euro;1 billion &ndash; yet the stretch of road in question, which is the part on lease that does not belong to the State is creating enormous difficulty. The Minister has examined the legalities of taking action. However, he has not come to a conclusion for obvious reasons, namely, cost factors and the fact that there are a number of years left on the lease. He has done a full assessment of this matter of grave concern to the cross-departmental team. While we are now close to finalising what is an excellent road and extraordinary piece of infrastructure, the part of it which is not in the hands of the State is creating a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To put the question in a nutshell, does the Taoiseach agree that the point of the frustration and suffering experienced by motorists for hours every morning and evening at the West Link toll bridge is simply to produce a massive profit for National Toll Roads? Is that not the principle of public-private partnership? For what, in the Taoiseach's view, does public-private partnership stand? Does he agree, for example, that the deal the Government made with regard to five post-primary schools, which handed over their running and construction to a private company for the next 25 years, does not make economic sense from the point of view of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the rush to public private partnership is because the Government wishes to dance to the tune of IBEC, which has called for transport and energy markets, and as many Government services as possible, to be out-sourced to the private sector, in other words, privatised? It does not make sense for the Taoiseach <Col N="1261" />to commit &euro;244 million to this post-primary school project, only &euro;60 million of which is for capital with the remainder covering operation and maintenance costs for 25 years. Will the Taoiseach agree that that company has to get a substantial profit from that but if the money was maintained in public management it could go towards further improving the maintenance of those schools or even upgrading some of the schools that are disgracefully neglected in the State? How can the Taoiseach say public private partnerships will give us better services when it is resulting in less money being made available for those services?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going outside the ruling, in the case of the M50, I was in the Department of Finance at the time that was proposed. There is a difficulty now, which Deputy Rabbitte has described and which we understand, but at the time that road was proposed the view was that nobody would build it. Local authorities were happy at the time to get somebody to take on the risk but in the early period the concern was that it would not be used. That is almost funny now but the concern at that time was that it would not be viable because the large tracts that have been opened up now did not exist. The risk the individuals took at the time was a substantial one, although obviously that is not the case now. As the Deputy knows because it is his area, it was a major and costly engineering feat at the time and there was a risk involved. Who was to know that the State would build all the other roads, including the road to the airport, the one to Tallaght and the road to the south-eastern motorway. I assure the Deputy that was the issue, and it is well recorded. The issue of public private partnerships is to transfer the risk.</P>
      <P>Deputies from all parties in this House ask me every day why can we not complete more of the schools programmes under PPPs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The five schools are built and if the Deputy goes to Tubbercurry or to the other locations and asks the people involved if they were prepared to wait for the capital programme to include them in the normal way or get public private partnerships to build the schools, I know what they would say. They would say that was a good system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said here before, and this is the point of principle, within the context of a comprehensive framework of PPPs, the central PPP unit and the Department of Finance have stated that they will develop the projects in consultation with the interested people and give detailed guidelines on all aspects of PPPs to State authorities. Those <Col N="1262" />guidelines will provide a clear, consistent and coherent process of State authorities' development projects under PPP arrangements. In cases where the risk can be transferred, PPPs are of benefit. In other cases, the State can do it cheaper. It might not do it quicker but it can do it cheaper, and that is the issue. The Minister for Finance and the unit are prepared to look at PPPs where there is a risk that is passed on to the private sector.</P>
    <P>In regard to other cases, the Deputy is right, we will not see too many projects like schools completed. Some pilot schemes were carried out but the Department of Finance will argue they are costly. They get the job done efficiently and achieve a higher standard, but it costs an amount of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask some brief questions and I hope I get brief answers. First, given that spending on the national roads programme is greater than spending on health and education combined, is the Taoiseach concerned that there has been no independent economic or transport analysis of the &euro;22 billion roads programme, particularly as it goes against the NRA's recommendations in its 1998 roads study? Second, is the Taoiseach concerned about the current public private partnership process, where contracts are being signed almost as we speak? Despite the wasting of enormous amounts of public money by the NRA over the past five years, there is no public scrutiny of the nature of the public private partnership contracts currently being signed nor is there access from the Oireachtas or elsewhere to the details of that contract.</P>
      <P>Third, in relation to the Taoiseach's comments about having one committee analysing priorities in the roads programme and a separate committee analysing priorities in the public transport programme, will he not agree it would make more sense to have the one committee analysing our transport priorities and trying to redress the balance where we are spending six times more on new roads as against public transport? Fourth, to assist the Taoiseach, I caution him against arguing against the introduction of European gauge rail lines given that that is what are being laid as we speak on the Luas lines which will form part of the metro. It is a bit late to change Government policy on the type of rail track we should use.</P>

      <P>The argument about the NRA was put here before. It is public money and the NRA is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.

Deputy Gregory is correct and I will pass his views on to the individuals concerned. If they need to meet as a full committee more often that would not be a problem but the drugs group meets very regularly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of a local authority which is becoming involved in public private partnerships. I was advised by officials at a meeting that the property involved would be licensed to the authority rather than leased. In other words, if the State is investing money in public private partnerships and the development reverts to the local authority after 25 years, why is it being licensed rather than leased? Will the Taoiseach explain the difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the questions in reverse order. Not every public private partnership is on the same basis and the one Deputy Sherlock refers to is a licence arrangement where the investor takes responsibility for the project and for the area, giving it back to the State at the end of the agreed period. The investor carries the risk and the benefit involved is based on the risk factor. There are different types of public private partnerships but the assessment is based on the risk factor.</P>
      <P>This leads to the questions of Deputies Stanton and Allen. There is no difficulty involved with this issue as it is a factual position. The Department of Finance contends that the cheapest way to borrow money is for the State to do so and, therefore, unless the area involved is one where the risk can be quantified and one can say that that is a risk the developer is taking, a public private partnership should not be attempted. That is the bottom line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the NDFA and pension funds being invested in projects is slightly different. Under new legislation the NDFA can have companies where it can secure an income stream into those companies; that is slightly different but the <Col N="1266" />same point. The idea of the State using a public private partnership to carry out a project it can do cheaper is opposed, as there is a significant mark-up involved. The State can do it cheaper and that is what causes confusion. People want public private partnerships to be used to get the job done because the State does not have a capital programme but it does not work like that. EUROSTAT has long realised what other countries are doing in this regard and Portugal got into grave difficulties through using this mechanism. When doing the figures on public private partnerships, unless the risk factor can be proved the figures come into the general Government balance. Maybe Members do not get confused but many involved with this system get confused. However, the idea that a public private partnership is an alternative system of getting money is not true. It is part of the general Government balance unless there is a clear risk factor to remove it from the balance and even then EUROSTAT determines that for all countries. That is done very rigidly so that countries cannot have items off the balance sheet.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Sargent's question, the Minister has made presentations to the committee on this and it is untrue that there is not a cost benefit analysis of every project and that each project is not scrutinised as to whether it is being done properly. The technical staff of the NRA give advice and projects are scrutinised. The Minister made a presentation to the committee recently on that issue.</P>

Every project is assessed on its merits and regarding the benefit analysis. That is done professionally, both on an overall basis and on an individual basis.</P>

      <P>The land Bill 2003 is a short Bill with eight heads. It regularises the statutory basis for earlier write-offs and buy-outs of land purchase annuities, upgrading ministerial warrants under the Land Acts, and introduces a further write-offs and buy-outs scheme and regularises the charging of interest on arrears and other ancillary matters related to Land Acts. The Bill was previously published as the Land Commission Bill and the heads were approved in February 2001 but it required further work and discussion between the Department of Finance and the Attorney General. It is hoped there will be a memorandum for Government by the end of the month and that the heads of the Bill will be ready in June.</P>

In view of the expected publication date being in 2005 and the vast sums of money now going into various charities, all of which are totally unregulated, will the Government consider having this Bill drafted by consultants? It is clearly beyond the capacity of the existing apparatus to draft it and there are serious sums of money involved which now attract tax deductions and benefits.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill implements the tax changes announced in the Budget Statement and includes a range of other measures. Many of these are targeted at closing off tax loopholes and updating and modernising the tax system. Deputies will be aware that the annual Finance Bill is considerable.</P>
      <P>This year the Bill runs to 155 sections and six schedules. I propose to outline the main provisions in the time available to me. Committee Stage will provide an opportunity to debate the Bill in greater detail. I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</P>
      <P>Part 1 of the Bill, which runs from sections 1 to 68, deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. In my period in office, I reduced the income tax burden significantly. The average tax paid, including PRSI and levies, by a single person on the average industrial wage has fallen from 28% in 1997 to 17% now. This lowering of the income tax burden has rewarded both employees and employers alike and contributed to our strong employment growth. The period we now face limits the scope for further major reductions in the direct tax burden &ndash; instead we face a period of consolidation. The resources available this year in respect of an income tax package are being targeted on those in the lower income brackets and the elderly.</P>
      <P>When the statutory minimum wage came into effect in April 2000, less than 64% of the minimum wage was exempt from tax. On foot of the tax measures I took in budget 2002, 90% of the minimum wage became exempt from tax. I am pleased to confirm that section 3 provides for an increase in the employee tax credit which maintains this 90% even with an increase in the minimum wage in October 2002 to &euro;6.35 per hour. It also increases the entry point of the tax system for all employees from &euro;209 per week to &euro;223 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other priority this year in the budget income tax package was to assist the elderly. Section 2 increases the exemption limits from income tax for persons aged 65 and over to &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;30,000 for a married couple &ndash; this represents an increase of over 15%. When combined with changes last year, the <Col N="1276" />limits have increased in value by almost 40% over the past two years. When I came to this job, I set a goal of removing large numbers of elderly taxpayers from the tax net. I am glad to say that I have seen this policy through and I will continue to pursue this target for the future.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the direct application of PAYE to many of the currently taxable benefits-in-kind. This will facilitate the application of PRSI, including the training and health contribution levies, to these benefits. From next year. employers will deduct and pay over to Revenue the appropriate PAYE income tax, PRSI and levies from wages paid to employees at the same time as the benefit is being provided. While tax has always applied to these benefits, hitherto they have not been subject to PRSI and levies. Application of PRSI and levies to benefits-in-kind is the norm in most EU countries. Share options are not being included in this treatment because of practical issues that apply specifically in their case, but revised procedures for their taxation are being introduced in section 8.</P>
    <P>Section 6 also provides for a major simplification of the calculation of the benefit-in-kind taxable charge in respect of cars and vans. Deputies will be aware of my record of introducing simplification into the tax code wherever it is possible. From next January, a simple five rate structure will apply to cars, replacing the current system where up to 17 different percentages and categories can apply. Many thousands of those paying BIK on cars and vans will see their BIK income tax charge reduce as a result.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 deal with the tax treatment of share options under unapproved share option schemes. I am making a number of changes to ensure that in future the income tax liability is settled at the time the share options are exercised, while providing some relieving measures for those currently in difficulty where the tax charge on their share options exceeds the value of the shares.</P>
    <P>The seven year deferral facility introduced in 2000 is being abolished and from 30 June this year, a person exercising share options must pay the tax due within 21 days. The tax payment will, of course, be taken into account in calculating the person's final liability to income tax for the tax year concerned. By way of concession to taxpayers whose income tax liability may be higher than the value of the shares, such taxpayers will have the choice of making a payment on account capped at the value of the shares. The balance of income tax will become due for payment where the taxpayer makes a gain on the disposal of these or other shares. If a taxpayer wishes to avail of this provision, he or she must notify the Revenue Commissioners by 1 June this year.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives effect to the increase in mortgage tax relief available to first-time buyers. The current annual ceiling on the amount of interest that can be allowed will be raised by over one quarter from &euro;3,175 for a single person and &euro;6,350 for a married couple to &euro;4,000 and &euro;8,000, <Col N="1277" />respectively. In addition, the period for which the relief is available will be extended from the current five years to seven years in all. Some 45,000 first-time buyers will benefit from these changes.</P>
    <P>Maintaining a broad tax base with low tax rates has contributed successfully to our economic development and strong employment growth. While one can admire the ingenuity of tax advisers in exploiting particular aspects of tax legislation in a way that was never intended, it is essential that tax avoidance schemes and loopholes are tackled vigorously when they come to attention. I have a proven record in this respect. A range of provisions throughout this Bill are designed to put a stop to such schemes or to tighten up legislation to ensure that reliefs are focused on the intended objective.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is designed to counter schemes whereby tax reliefs available to a trading company are transferred to individuals who, although nominally trading, are in practice passive investors. The effect of the section is to ring-fence the tax reliefs arising from certain specified trades carried on by an individual in a passive way to the actual income arising to the individual from that trade. The trades covered are the generation of electricity, oil and gas exploration and the film and music industries. These new provisions complement changes made in the case of limited partnerships in 1998 and 2000.</P>
    <P>Section 13 closes a loophole in regard to the transfer of capital allowances on buildings from companies to individual investors. Where a building in respect of which a company has claimed capital allowances is sold to individual investors, those investors will only be entitled to set the capital allowances related to the building against their rental income from the building concerned instead of against a wider range of income.</P>
    <P>Section 14 makes a number of changes to the tax regime governing various pension products. In summary, the main items provided for include: first, the alignment of contribution limits for personal retirement savings accounts or PRSAs with those applicable to other personal pensions and occupational schemes; second, the abolition of the facility to obtain excessive tax relief by making last-minute additional contributions just prior to retirement; and, third, new rules that will prevent approved retirement funds being used for investment in assets or property for private or family business use, for example, the purchase of a holiday home by the fund for personal use.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for a number of changes to ensure that the BES and seed capital schemes continue to apply as intended. These schemes are due to expire at the end of this year and I will be reviewing them before next year's budget. Section 16, another anti-avoidance measure, counters contrived arrangements between spouses in relation to mortgage interest relief for investors.</P>
    <P>The question of repayments of overpaid tax and the application of interest to such repayments has been the subject of considerable discussion in <Col N="1278" />recent times arising from the Ombudsman's report on this issue last November. The provisions in existing legislation have grown up over time for different purposes and vary both within and across tax heads. There is no general right of repayment of tax or general entitlement to interest. In reviewing this issue I considered it essential that a new general provision be introduced which was coherent across different taxes and different situations. Of course it is also essential, as I indicated in my response to the Ombudsman's report when it issued, that whatever scheme is put in place takes account of the potential Exchequer costs of any new general scheme. I consider the proposals in this Bill represent a balanced approach to these objectives.</P>
    <P>Section 17, together with various other sections in the Bill, provides for a general right of repayment of tax in relation to valid claims made within a four year period. These replace existing provisions on repayments where they exist. This will apply across all tax heads except customs duties which are a direct EU tax. The right of Revenue to make assessments to tax and to pursue inquires will also be limited to four years unless Revenue has grounds to suspect fraud or negligence for earlier years.</P>
    <P>These sections also provide for a new general entitlement to interest on overpaid taxes. This provision will apply from six months after the date on which the claim is made by the taxpayer. However, where Revenue misconstrues the law, interest will be paid, in general, from the date the excess tax was paid, subject to the overall time limit on repayments of four years. This new scheme will replace all other existing arrangements, including those provisions dealing with interest paid on refunds of overpayments of preliminary tax. The rate of simple interest on repaid tax is being reduced from 0.0161% per day to 0.011% per day or from approximately 6% to 4% per annum. Such interest is tax-free. These measures provide a fair and transparent scheme for the refund of overpaid taxes and interest on such refunds in the future. They also address the issue raised by the Ombudsman in relation to the need for a general scheme. All of these provisions are subject to a ministerial order and will come into effect after the orders are signed.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 provide for an extension until 31 December 2004 of the existing schemes of stock relief for farmers in general and for certain young trained farmers. A commencement order will apply to the young trained farmer scheme, given potential EU State aid implications. Section 20 provides for a tightening-up of the type of capital expenditure covered by capital allowances for the purchase of transmission capacity rights. Section 21 relates to tax relief on donations. The section provides for a maximum limit on the amount of donations that can attract tax relief where the donation is made by an individual who is directly associated with the organisation, for example an employee or certain members of the body. In these cases, where the aggregate of <Col N="1279" />donations in a year of assessment is greater than 10% of the individual's total income, the excess will not attract tax relief. Tax relief for donations in all other situations will continue, as currently, without any ceiling.</P>
    <P>Section 22 gives effect to the increase from five years to eight years in the write-off period for allowances for capital expenditure incurred since budget day on plant and machinery. As I indicated in my budget speech, I consider it appropriate in present circumstances to seek an equitable balance in raising revenue from all sectors of the community. This is one of the measures which will raise revenue from the business sector. Section 23 provides for the reduction of the annual rate of write-off for capital expenditure incurred on hotel buildings to 4% per annum, while the annual capital allowances for holiday cottages are being abolished. Subject to transitional arrangements, both these amendments apply to construction or refurbishment expenditure incurred on or after budget day. The transitional arrangements provide that these changes will not apply to such capital expenditure incurred by 31 December 2004 if a full and valid planning application is received by the relevant planning authority by the end of May. These dates should cater for the vast majority of cases that have been brought to my attention since the budget.</P>
    <P>Section 24 sets out the expiry dates for a number of tax incentive schemes. Those affected are the urban renewal scheme, the town renewal scheme, the park and ride scheme and the student accommodation scheme. Sections 25 to 28 make various minor changes to these schemes. I have always held the view that targeted, well designed tax incentive schemes can be a useful instrument in achieving desirable public policy objectives. However, the value of such schemes must be balanced against the important objective of ensuring a wide tax base if we are to maintain low rates. It must be borne in mind that such schemes usually also mean that higher earners can reduce their tax bill substantially. Given the current and prospective budget situation and the objective of broadening the tax base, I consider it necessary to finish these schemes and others by the end of next year. I will be keeping all tax expenditures and incentive schemes under review. This is not to say that I will not consider introducing tax incentives where I see the potential benefits as outweighing the other factors I mentioned. For example, we wish to encourage research and development expenditure by companies to safeguard our location as a base for new manufacturing and other activities and a tax incentive is one of the possible options being examined by relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>Section 30 closes off a loophole relating to tax avoidance schemes involving contrived financial arrangements in relation to a relief available to lessors in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the provision of student accommodation. I <Col N="1280" />announced last July that I would introduce legislation to close this loophole. This section requires, among other restrictions, that any loan involved for the lessor must be taken directly from a financial institution instead of from the third level college. Relevant contracts tax is the tax that principal contractors are obliged to deduct at a rate of 35% from payments made to certain subcontractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry industries. Section 31 contains provisions to tackle certain administrative problems that have arisen regarding underpayments and late payments of this tax as well as tightening up the procedure for the issue of payment cards to principal contractors. These cards effectively authorise principal contractors to make payments without deducting tax.</P>
    <P>As I have just said, all tax incentives and reliefs are subject to ongoing review. In the case of some of these incentives, there are no legislative provisions regarding a return of the exempt income or gains. The relevant legislation is now being changed in section 33 to provide for the return to Revenue of the details of the exempt income or gains arising in connection with three of these tax incentives, namely, the exemptions for stallion fees, profits from forestry and greyhound stud fees. This will enable a further assessment to be carried out of the actual costs and benefits involved in these three reliefs. The legislative change will come into effect at the commencement of the next tax year, 1 January 2004. I will be putting forward an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that losses as well as profits are captured in the returns to be made so that the full effect of any potential future change in taxable status can be assessed.</P>
    <P>Section 34 closes a loophole under which the sale by an individual to a company of a rent roll from a building can facilitate tax avoidance. This loophole has been used to ensure that the rental income that should be charged at the 42% rate of income tax is charged instead to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate through the sale of the rent roll to a financial institution. Section 36 permits the Government to enter into tax information exchange agreements with the governments of other jurisdictions. Double taxation treaties already provide for exchange of information but this section facilitates agreements with any jurisdiction specifically on exchange of information. Deputies may be aware that a range of states that might be regarded as tax havens have undertaken to the OECD that they will be prepared to enter into such agreements. Section 39 provides for the introduction of a pay and file system for corporation tax. This will require a company to submit the balance of tax within nine months after the end of the accounting period in question. This will align the corporation tax return filing and final payment deadlines.</P>
    <P>I recently established the National Development Finance Agency to assist in providing cost-effective finance for public investment projects by advising State authorities on the optimal means <Col N="1281" />of financing and in some circumstances providing finance or forming companies to secure finance. Sections 40, 68 and 134 confer exemptions from tax on the NDFA in the performance of its statutory functions. Sections 41, 43 and 44 are further anti-avoidance provisions. Section 44 is designed to counter tax avoidance schemes involving a balancing charge, that is, a claw-back of capital allowances following the disposal of machinery or plant. These schemes seek to avoid the charge or to pass the balancing charge arising from an individual to a company, which would be taxable at a lower rate.</P>
    <P>Our capital city has become a significant player in international securitisation transactions and it is important that we continue to compete successfully for this business. In order to achieve this, Irish tax law must keep pace with international developments. Securitisation involves the creation of tradable securities, traditionally from existing assets or future income streams. It is used to raise finance in a manner more efficient than traditional borrowing. By its nature, the securitisation business is constantly evolving and producing more sophisticated transactions. Section 45 updates our tax regime in order to bring more of this high-value business to Ireland. Accordingly, the overall effect of these changes is to greatly increase the types of financial assets which can be securitised. Ireland has also become a successful international centre for fund management. A feature of this sector in Ireland is that a high proportion of the business is fund administration. Our strategy is to build on this by encouraging more fund promoters to locate their investment management function here in addition to their fund administration operations. In this regard, section 47 removes a technical obstacle to achieving this goal by providing that a tax liability on a foreign fund will not arise solely because of the activity of the Irish agent acting on its behalf.</P>
    <P>Section 49 amends the taxation regime that applies to &ldquo;gross roll-up&rdquo; collective funds and their investors. Such gross roll-up applies tax only when the moneys are paid out of the fund. The changes allow payments to be made without the deduction of an exit tax where the payments are being made to an Irish resident company &ndash; in the case of a money market fund, to a credit union, or to the Courts Service, which administers the investment of funds lodged in court. The Courts Service will be required to operate the exit tax on payments made to it by the collective fund when they allocate those payments to the beneficial owners.</P>
    <P>Section 58 amends the scheme of tonnage tax for shipping companies introduced in the Finance Act 2002 to conform more fully to EU requirements. Tonnage tax is a scheme whereby, as an alternative to charging corporation tax on certain profits of a qualifying shipping company, a tax charge is levied each year instead on the tonnage of the ships operated by the company. The European Commission has given state aid clearance to the scheme of tonnage tax, subject to amend<Col N="1282" />ments being made to certain provisions of the legislation as enacted so as to make the scheme conform more closely to the Commission's tonnage tax policy. The amendments to the scheme include confining the tonnage tax regime to profits derived from shipping activities and a requirement for separate accounting where a company engages in tonnage tax activities and other activities.</P>
    <P>Section 59 amends the definition of a close company. A close company is one with five or less participators. Companies owned by the State are excluded from the definition of a close company. This exclusion is now extended to companies owned by EU member states and any countries with which Ireland has a tax treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 60 adds a number of organisations to the Schedule of non-commercial State sponsored bodies granted exemption from tax, other than DIRT, in respect of non-trading income which would otherwise be chargeable to income tax or corporation tax. The organisations are Tourism Ireland Limited, the Occupational Safety and Health Institute of Ireland, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the National Qualification Authority of Ireland and the Irish Sports Council.</P>
    <P>Sections 61 to 63, inclusive, make significant changes to the capital gains tax regime to remove some relieving provisions which are less necessary now that the tax rate is set at 20%. These changes will also spread the burden of the revenue raising measures needed in the current budgetary situation. Section 61 gives effect to my budget announcement that indexation relief will not apply for years after 2002. Section 62 removes the facility to defer capital gains tax by the issue of debentures, loan stock or other similar securities. Section 63 abolishes roll-over relief. This relief allowed for the indefinite deferral of a capital gains tax charge on gains accruing on the disposal of certain assets where the proceeds were reinvested in certain other assets. This change is effective for all disposals from 4 December 2002 onwards.</P>
    <P>Section 64 contains a number of amendments to legislation providing relief from capital gains tax where an individual, having attained the age of 55, disposes of certain business assets or shares in his or her family company. The amendments provide for the situation of widowed spouses in farming, for updating the relief by reference to the latest EU early retirement scheme for farmers and to provide for company restructuring situations. The opportunity is also being taken to round up the limit for the relief to &euro;500,000.</P>
    <P>Certain tax rules which, at present, allow individuals to avoid a capital gains tax charge by selling assets during a period of temporary residence abroad are being changed. Section 65 accordingly imposes a capital gains tax charge in such circumstances. Section 66 is another anti-avoidance measure that ensures that someone who is paid for agreeing not to compete in business is taxed on the payment. Section 68 adds certain persons <Col N="1283" />to the list of those who are entitled to exemption from capital gains tax. These additions are sports bodies and registered trade unions, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled. This is consistent with the income tax exemptions already available to such bodies.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill deals with excise duties. Sections 69 to 82, inclusive, relate to alcohol products tax and include provisions to consolidate and modernise excise legislation covering the various alcohol products in order to make it more accessible to users. Much of the existing law in this area dates back to the 19th century and is obsolete in the modern excise context. It has been supplemented and amended over time to the extent that it has become fragmented and disjointed. These provisions are being replaced by a structure of law which is based more closely on the EU law relating to alcohol products. The opportunity is also being taken to streamline existing provisions and to make some minor changes in the area of offences. Sections 83 to 86, inclusive, are restatements of existing provisions on foot of the consolidation and modernisation of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 87 confirms the budget night increase in the rates of excise duty on auto diesel which, when VAT is included, amounted to 3 cent per litre. Section 88 confirms the budget increase in the main rate of excise duty on spirits which, when VAT is included, amounts to 20 cent on a standard measure. The lower rate of duty which had applied to low strength spirit alcopop drinks is also abolished.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware from media coverage of Revenue's efforts, successful in many instances, to tackle significant cases of evasion of excise duty. The legislation is being strengthened to assist these efforts. Section 89 provides for an updated offence of selling, delivering or keeping for sale any spirits on which excise duty has not been paid. Hitherto Revenue has had to rely on 1830s legislation in this area. It also provides for a presumption, in any proceedings for an offence involving counterfeit spirits, that excise duty has not been paid on those spirits.</P>
    <P>Section 90 introduces an offence of keeping for sale as auto fuel any mineral oil on which excise duty has not been paid at the appropriate rate. Section 91 introduces a presumption, in proceedings for certain mineral oil tax offences, that diesel used as a propellant which exceeds the maximum sulphur content allowed for auto diesel has not been taxed at the appropriate rate. Section 92 confirms the budget increase in the rate of duty on cigarettes which, when VAT is included, amounted to 50 cent on a typical packet of 20, with <i>pro rata</i> increases in respect of other tobacco products. Section 93 provides for the charging of interest on the late payment of excise duty in line with the rules for other taxes.</P>
    <P>Sections 97 and 102 make an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;crew cabs&rdquo; for VRT purposes. Such cabs have the capacity to act as both domestic <Col N="1284" />and commercial work vehicles. This will ensure that smaller domestic type crew cabs, currently classified as category C vehicles which are liable for a flat VRT of &euro;50, will be reclassified as category B vehicles which are liable for VRT of 13.3%. The Bill also includes an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;pick-ups&rdquo; to ensure that certain genuine small pick-up trucks will continue to be classified correctly as category C and not category B. These changes will be effected by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Section 98 provides for the issue of a single vehicle registration certificate, to be issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, incorporating both the vehicle registration certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners and the licensing certificate issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Section 99 confirms the budget change that the 30% VRT rate will apply for vehicles over 1.9 litres instead of two litres as heretofore. Section 101 extends to 31 December 2001 the schemes under which hybrid electric vehicles are rebated 50% of the relevant vehicle registration tax.</P>
    <P>Sections 103 to 106, inclusive, deal with definitions of gaming and amusement machines and the rules relating to licences for amusement and gaming machines and gaming premises. Definitional changes are needed to deal with certain new machines to ensure that they are classified as amusement rather than gaming machines. There are many different licences in this area and, to simplify administration, the number is being reduced. Section 107 provides for time limits for Revenue to raise assessments of betting tax consistent with the approach to other taxes.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with VAT. Two important EU directives are being transposed into EU law. The electronic commerce directive provides for changes in the rules concerning business to business supplies, new rules regarding supplies of services to private customers in the EU from outside the EU and a special scheme for such non-EU suppliers where supplies are made to private consumers. There is a series of sections in this part of the Bill which transpose this directive. The VAT invoicing directive aims to simplify, modernise and harmonise the conditions laid down for VAT invoicing and to remove barriers to electronic storage and transmission of invoices across the EU. The Revenue Commissioners have issued regulations which partially give effect to the directive. However, it is necessary to transpose the remainder of the directive in the Bill in section 118 and follow-on regulations.</P>
    <P>Three changes are proposed to the VAT treatment of property in the Bill. Last year's Finance Act introduced the concept of economic value into VAT law. Economic value means the cost of acquisition and development of a property and identifies the full amount on which the developer claims input VAT in respect of the development of a property. This concept was introduced to <Col N="1285" />prevent avoidance schemes. Section 110 ensures that the meaning of development in the definition of economic value includes expenditure such as architects' and other professional fees.</P>
    <P>Short-term letting of property is usually exempt from VAT. However, it is possible to waive the exemption on short-term letting and charge VAT at the standard rate. In some cases prior to short-term letting, individuals will have claimed input VAT on the development of the property with the intention of entering into long-term leases which did not materialise. The change in section 113 allows the Revenue Commissioners to take this into account when calculating what the taxpayer needs to pay if he then cancels the waiver. Section 117 creates a requirement to maintain records as long as the property is in the VAT net and for six years thereafter.</P>
    <P>Section 114 makes the local business responsible for paying VAT on the supply and installation of equipment where the supplier is not established in the State. Section 115 confirms the budget night increase in the 12.5% VAT rate to 13.5%. This was part of the budget's revenue-raising measures.</P>
    <P>Where car dealers pre-register certain cars for their own use prior to sale, for example, replacement vehicles for breakdowns and courtesy cars, it gives rise to an anomaly whereby more VAT is chargeable than if the vehicles in question were sold to customers without pre-registration. Section 116 provides for the introduction of a new VAT-based mechanism to correct this anomaly which will apply to all pre-registered cars. An existing VRT refund scheme for pre-registered demonstration cars will therefore become redundant and will be discontinued. Section 123 extends tax-geared penalties for VAT to cases where a return is not submitted and brings VAT into line with income tax and corporation tax in this regard.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill deals with stamp duties. The tax code exempts from stamp duty the transfer of shares and property between associated corporate bodies, subject to certain conditions. Section 131 amends these conditions to include certain situations where the companies are clearly associated but would not meet the existing conditions. Section 132 confirms the budget night extension of the stamp duty exemption for young trained farmers. Section 133 extends the existing stamp duty provisions which exempt foreign national Government loans and securities to loans and securities of foreign local governments and foreign local authorities. Section 135 confirms the budget night increase on stamp duty on cash cards and credit cards.</P>
    <P>Section 136 gives effect to the announcement on budget day that a specific contribution to the Exchequer is to be obtained from the financial sector for the three year period 2003 to 2005. The targeted contribution is &euro;100 million per annum for each of the three years. The required amount for 2003 is to be obtained from each relevant financial company or group by reference to the <Col N="1286" />amount of the tax payable on deposit interest by it to the Revenue Commissioners in the calendar year 2001, excluding arrears relating to earlier years. The payment will be in the form of a special stamp duty which will be due for payment in October 2003. This duty will be levied at a rate of 50% on the amount of the tax on deposit interest referred to. However, there will be an upper limit on the amount payable by each relevant financial institution or group. This upper limit will be equal to 0.0015 of the institution's or group's average deposits from residents in 2001, excluding Government deposits and inter-financial institution deposits. The same amount will be payable for 2004 and 2005. Section 138 confirms the budget night increase in stamp duty on cheques and non-residential property.</P>
    <P>Part 5 deals with residential property tax. The threshold for a residential property tax clearance certificate is being increased from &euro;382,000 to &euro;1 million. This increase will reduce administration costs and free up resources to carry out more audits in this area so that the yield in back tax can be maintained. Sections 142 to 148 deal with Revenue Commissioners' powers and administration. Section 142 enables an additional estimate to be raised where a previously estimated amount has been paid and a return showing the correct liability has not been made or where the Revenue Commissioners have subsequent information indicating that the original estimate was too low.</P>
    <P>Section 144 allows the Revenue Commissioners to carry out an on-site audit of accountable persons in relation to professional services withholding tax. Section 145 increases the maximum fine for summary offences from &euro;1,900 to &euro;3,000. Section 146 contains a number of provisions to facilitate the investigation and successful prosecution of revenue offences. It is proposed to allow for the creation of certain evidential presumptions in relation to proof of books, records and so on in court proceedings for tax evasion cases. A provision is also included creating an offence of falsifying, concealing or destroying documents relating to a Revenue investigation. A judge hearing a trial on indictment will now be able to make information available to the jury to assist them in their deliberations such as charts, transcripts, summary information and so on. Section 147 allows unpaid penalties to be pursued in the District and Circuit Courts as well as the High Court. Section 149 is an enabling provision that will allow the Revenue Commissioners to oblige certain categories of taxpayer to file returns and pay tax electronically.</P>
    <P>Section 150 provides for the revocation of minor annual payments from the central fund. These payments relate to Marsh's Library, King's Inns and the Lord Mayor and citizens of Dublin and are provided for under legislation which, in some cases, is over two centuries old. Section 152 provides that the Exchequer may be reimbursed from the small savings reserve fund for amounts transferred to the dormant accounts fund which <Col N="1287" />represent accrued interest on the national savings schemes.</P>
    <P>There are no capital acquisitions tax provisions in the Bill as published because of the new CAT Consolidation Bill. However, I will be putting down several amendments to CAT on Committee Stage after the CAT Consolidation Bill has been enacted within the next few days.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I have managed in successive budgets and Finance Bills to create a low tax rate environment across all tax heads. It is a position from which our economy has thrived. The task is to build on what we have gained. This Finance Bill recognises that this is the case. It provides for targeted reductions in income tax where they are needed. It also targets additional revenues that can be put towards improved public services and it closes off various tax loopholes and limits or curtails a number of reliefs which will protect the tax base and secure our low tax rate environment for the future. I hope the House has benefited from my outline of the provisions in the Bill. I look forward to the debate on the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had billed that this was the start of his second book &ndash; the first chapter in the second series of five budgets which he hopes to present to the House. However, he must realise he is producing a horror story. The most forlorn notion to emerge from the recent partnership negotiations was the hope among employers and unions that the Minister would contribute to stabilising inflation. That is surely a triumph of hope over expectation &ndash; it is a bit like asking a pyromaniac to take charge of the fire brigade. Here is a Minister whose Finance Bill's central theme is the use of price rises, imposed by the Government, to pay for the mismanagement of public spending that has occurred in recent years.</P>
      <P>The vast array of price increases that the Minister for Finance has imposed in recent weeks add up, for a typical family, to almost &euro;1,500. If the Minister doubts that, I can give him the figures. VAT is up &euro;182 per household; motor tax, &euro;30; hospital charges, &euro;133; drugs refund, nearly &euro;200; VHI, &euro;66; cigarettes and alcohol, &euro;187 and bank card charges, &euro;83. Bin charges vary but are up to nearly &euro;50 in many parts of the country, ESB bills, &euro;72 and college fees, &euro;275. These are all administrative price increases which have come directly from the Minister's budgetary provisions. Most of these have dribbled out under cover because Ministers were afraid to face the public honestly and say this is how they are paying for the misspent revenue of the past few years.</P>

    <P>Another clever device has been to short-change agencies like local authorities and health boards that are at arm's length from Government so they, rather than the Government, take the heat for increases. It is particularly evident in rates increases which, in some local authority areas, are up 12% &ndash; thankfully it is only 7% in <Col N="1288" />my area &ndash; rents are up 10% and bin and parking charges have also been increased by up to 25%. This is a direct consequence of Government policy. It is enough to make a cat laugh for the Government to claim it is undertaking an anti-inflation campaign when it is the main driver of inflation through its services. We will, no doubt, hear from the Tánaiste about how the Government proposes to introduce a more competitive environment and new aggressive approach to competition from which consumers will benefit.</P>
    <P>However, this comes from the Government that has used the near monopoly powers of the ESB, the VHI and CIE to increase charges this year by two, three and four times the rate of inflation. The Government is using State-owned near-monopolies to jack up prices for ordinary consumers, although the partnership programme no doubt will contain highly ambitious words about how the Government will address competition issues. It is using these companies to push up prices and increase costs rather than face up to the issue of reform of public spending, which is clearly needed. Not content to dip into consumers' pockets in the way I outlined, in this Bill the Government is not making any provision for increasing tax credits or the basic tax thresholds. It may be a sleight of hand that this area was passed over in silence in the budget and a section in this regard was left out, but the consequence of that for ordinary households is that an extra &euro;400 will be collected by the hidden tax collector before the end of year. The Government is using inflation as its tax collector this year.</P>
    <P>It is also going beyond that. In the case of business tax, not only is the Government saying that it will use inflation to collect tax through capital gains tax, but forever more we will see paper improvements in the value of property being taxed by the Minister. This is a decision he is making to do away with a fundamental basic principle of fair tax, that one does not tax paper gains which do not represent any real benefit to a person. The Minister is cementing into our capital gains tax code a provision that inflation forever more will be one of his tools for gathering tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has elevated to a fetish the issue of the capital gains tax rate. He has made that a totem and is sacrificing basic sound tax principles on this altar. He has set himself up and now we are seeing the consequences of this narrow, blind commitment to tax rates above all else. It is producing anomalies in the tax code going forward, as are other ways in which he is dismantling prudent approaches to taxation.</P>
    <P>In short, the Government is bedding in a vested interest in inflation for itself over the coming years. It will use inflation to increase revenue, it will fail to index and it will undermine people's positions by unfair taxation using the erosion of inflation to benefit the Exchequer. This is the sort of approach that undermines the sound economics of years gone by. I am amazed at the Minister taking this approach to the operation of the tax code.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" />This approach has potentially catastrophic effects for a small open economy like ours. The key issue we must keep in mind is competitiveness. If the Government pursues a pro-inflation policy then, as sure as night follows day, the cost will quickly come in job sacrifices. We are already losing jobs on a weekly basis. I am sure the Acting Chairman has witnessed that in his part of the country recently.</P>
    <P>A figure that was passed over in remarkable silence was contained in a report by Forfás last week. Its report showed that in the past two years 61,000 jobs were lost from companies supported by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. These companies are the productive core of the so-called Celtic tiger. There was a loss of 61,000 jobs in those companies, which represents more than one in five of those types of jobs being lost in the space of two years. Those job losses were not compensated by job replacements elsewhere. However, there was job creation and, therefore, we did not experience the full impact of that meltdown, but it highlights how vulnerable we are when in the past two years, which people would say were relatively stable years, there was that level of attrition.</P>
    <P>If the reputation of Ireland becomes one of an economy that is no longer competitive and we do not continue to attract jobs at the level that we have in those IDA and Enterprise Ireland-backed areas, we will quickly see those 60,000 people who lost their jobs in that two year period going directly on to the unemployment list. We will see a meltdown in employment if we continue to pursue a policy that undermines basic competitiveness in the economy. The Government has lost sight of the crucial importance of competitiveness in a small open economy. Instead of assisting enterprise in this difficult time to deal with these challenges, the Government, for short-term reasons, is using inflation and undermining competitiveness for purposes that were entirely foreseeable and which prudent management of finances would have avoided.</P>
    <P>The Bill also directly damages the climate for investment. It introduces a series of short-term measures based on short-term thinking about the needs of this economy, which will undermine the confident climate we need for investment. I will single out a few of these measures. I mentioned capital gains tax, but the Minister has gone further in regard to that tax. Apart from abolishing indexation, he has also decided to abolish the relief that was afforded to businesses which decided to sell under-performing assets in order to replace them with other assets that would better serve the future of such businesses. This is the relief that has been commonly known as rollover relief. That relief was based on the sound principle that when the owners of a business decide to take money out of their business, they should be hit in respect of capital gains. However, where they retain it in their business and replace under-performing assets with assets that can better serve the business, we should allow them to keep those <Col N="1290" />resources within the company and continue to support its employment performance.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has had a post bag full, as have I, of letters from the owners of small businesses who will be seriously caught by this measure. Some of them will be caught because there are in transition. They had made business decisions based on the expectation of rollover relief which will now be withdrawn without any transition provision that would allow them to deal with its removal.</P>
    <P>The Minister must remember that one of the basic tenets that has been so strong in our economy was certainty for business as regards the way the tax system would work for them. In this Bill the Minister is pulling out important pillars of certainty in relation to the tax treatment of business. This very much represents short-term thinking built on the Minister's perception that mechanisms such as tax rates are crucial and that the way the tax system works in its actual mechanics does not matter. We need a much more far seeing approach.</P>
    <P>For crude cash flow reasons, the Minister has pushed out the period over which businesses can get tax relief on their investments. He has extended the period from five to eight years. I am no expert in business, but I do not believe that there is much equipment that has an endurance of eight years. Most equipment technologies are changing rapidly. We hear that five years is a minimum survival rate for technology. The IDA would say that five years is the maximum period for investment, but the Minister is saying that, to meet his cash flow needs, he will not allow business write-off in five years, even if that is the need, but will seek to extend it to eight years. That measure undermines the business climate for investment. Again it represents short-term thinking in that it sacrifices long-term needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also imposing a 50% increase in tax on people who invest in business assets by way of an increase in stamp duty. I find it difficult to understand the rationale for this measure. If people want to invest in Irish assets to create businesses here, why has he decided to increase by 50% the levy imposed on them. It represents a levy on new investment, which is difficult to rationalise.</P>
    <P>I noted in this morning's newspapers that the tourism industry is in trouble. I am sure that problem affects the Acting Chairman's part of the country more than it does mine. However, the main measure the Government has given to the industry this year is a 1% increase in its charges. We are aware that the industry is already struggling with charges and is uncompetitive in many of its products. I do not lay all the blame for that by any means at the Government's door. There are problems in a competitive tourism package being provided by pubs, restaurants and so on, but I do not consider that the appropriate response is to add an increase of 1% to their costs. We will rue that later in the year.</P>
    <P>This approach is part of a deeper failure by the Government to keep its sights on the important <Col N="1291" />principle that a small open economy must be competitive. We have also witnessed that in many other ways. Elements of the competitive package that are in the charge of the Government are the ones that are most seriously undermining our performance. The way we underpin Irish jobs is by having quality transport, telecommunication and waste management systems, quality energy supply, access to decent child care and keen insurance costs. These are all heavily influenced by Government. I do not believe the Minister could put his hand on his heart and say that Ireland under this Government has managed its responsibility shrewdly in relation to those areas.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the slide down the world rankings that Ireland has suffered in recent times, it has been as a result of factors like failure to roll out broadband, congestion costs and slow delivery of parcels &ndash; with Dublin second only to Calcutta in that respect &ndash; and problems in terms of capacity and price in electricity. We are not at the races in terms of provision of child care support for women who choose to work outside the home. Our policy on waste is a total shambles. The Ministers responsible should have used the good times of recent years to get policy right in these areas. Those years were undoubtedly squandered.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the first casualties of the Government was the concept of prudent planning. This trend was led from the top &ndash; the Taoiseach was the most profligate of all. His approach to the whole Campus and Stadium Ireland project was marked by absolutely no sense of prudence in relation to planning. There was no effort to look at what the actual revenues were likely to be, what the actual costs were likely to be or how successful or viable the project would be. None of those things mattered. They were just dismissed. The project was a political objective. It was about getting back into power or satisfying certain friends the Taoiseach thought would support him, and prudence just went out the window. Careful project evaluation, tight control of project costs and focus on value for money were foreign concepts to Ministers in the Government and we are now paying the price.</P>
    <P>Even when it came to putting up election billboards to say how successful they had been, Ministers measured their success in terms of the amount of money they had spent, not in terms of actual improvement in the quality of services delivered. They boasted of increasing spend on health by a sum I cannot even recall &ndash; it could have been 100% or 120% &ndash; but they could have claimed 150% for all people cared because it did not deliver any improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was not content to sit on his hands while this profligate approach went on. He got in on the act as well by undermining the tax base. He tried to lure voters through initiatives that deliberately undermined the tax base. This is evident in his Estimates volumes and his budget statement. In the past two years, he <Col N="1292" />allowed spending to grow at over six times the rate of growth in tax revenue. That is a recipe for disaster in anybody's language. One cannot travel down that road and survive in the long-term. The Minister, above all, should know that.</P>
    <P>Since the election, the Minister has sought to rebuild his credibility and curb spending, but the same short-term practice is flowing over into this period also. Instead of restructuring spending programmes, looking for value for money, reassessing programmes &ndash; and dropping underperforming ones &ndash; and delivering quality services, large bureaucracies have been left intact in the State sector and the people who are suffering are the people who get the crumbs that fall from the table in the form of discretionary spending. We see this left, right and centre at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority could not commit to nursing homes and had to reduce its number of contracted beds. What happened? Those same patients occupied &euro;1,500 per week beds in the Mater Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. This, in turn, impacted upon their accident and emergency departments and they could not admit patients. Thus, a very short-sighted economy resulted in absolute chaos in accident and emergency departments and left hospitals unable to cope and with nowhere to turn.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of pruning of spending the Government has engaged in. It has been short and sharp but has also been very short-sighted, and we will see that type of impact manifest itself throughout the year ahead. The figures are there to show this. The public pay side of the Minister's budget this year is going up by 11.5% but the non-pay side is going up by a mere 1.5%. The consequence is that the actual delivery of services will be tightened in every walk of life. Social workers will be unable to visit people because they do not have a petrol allowance and so on. We will witness these types of narrow-minded, short-sighted savings that impact upon ordinary people. The home help service, as Deputy Rabbitte pointed out earlier, is being squeezed, another very easy target because it is not part of the main bureaucracy. It is the people on the ground who get hurt. That will be the real legacy of the Government.</P>
    <P>Ominously, the January tax returns suggest that the Minister's undermining of the income tax base has still not come to an end and that we may face more of this. The Dáil, which ultimately gives the Government authority to spend, must reassert its insistence upon fiscal responsibility. It must insist that Ministers who introduce new initiatives present to the Dáil the long-term costs of them and outline what they mean for year one, year two, year three and so on. When Ministers present their Estimates, they must also present the performance indicators by which they believe they should be judged during the course of the year. When it comes to the appropriations accounts, the Minister should present details not only of the funds he has spent but of how he fared in relation to the targets he set when introducing <Col N="1293" />the Estimates. This is basic management but we do not do it here. This House needs to change the way it approaches these matters so that the Government cannot continue to spend in the way that it has without reporting to the Dáil on the quality of what it is doing.</P>
    <P>Real people are suffering the flaws of the stop-go approach to public spending of the past two years. Another example that has been discussed at great length is the first-time buyer. The main Government party promised in its manifesto that it would protect the first-time buyer from being squeezed out of the housing market. That was a solemn commitment, although maybe people did not regard the contents of the manifesto as a commitment. What happened? Just 12 months ago the Government gave massive relief to investors. Typically, they get the full interest relief of 42% and a concession on stamp duties. This year then the Government, having pledged to protect first-time buyers from being squeezed, tightens the screw on them further by abolishing the first-time buyer's grant and imposing stamp duty on sites and 1% VAT on the house price. The Minister's minuscule concession on mortgage interest relief is of no value.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill 2003 cements a typical penalty on first-time buyers of about &euro;6,500. The concession the Minister gives in terms of mortgage interest relief is &euro;330. This is completely contrary to the commitments that were made in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. To crown the Minister's contempt for young families struggling to buy their first home, he hit them immediately from 1 January with the 1% VAT increase, even if they had already signed contracts. By contrast, the impact of the restrictions imposed upon those buying holiday homes or investing in hotels is being lessened. If they get their planning applications in by May 2003, they will not have to suffer the new restrictions. Thus, a very generous transition arrangement is granted to people investing in holiday homes and hotels, but those trying to get on the first rung of home ownership are hit immediately from 1 January, with no transition phase. When it comes to the equity of tax measures, there are no prizes for guessing who has the ear of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill 2003 consolidates the anti-family features of the Government's tax policy. The tax penalty for a family in which one spouse stays at home to care for the children has grown under the Minister from &euro;384, which was the PAYE allowance, to &euro;4,210. That is a massive wedge being taken from people who opt to stay at home. No effort has been made to increase the home carer's allowance since it was very hurriedly introduced in the wake of an outcry from the public and a Government backbench revolt. No help has been given to persons who have caring obligations in the home, whether chosen voluntarily or involuntarily. That is anti-family. We need to allow supporting options and also to support options for people who go out to work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" />If spouses go out to work they should get support. There was not a word about child care in this year's budget, but child care costs are spiralling. It costs in the region of &euro;200 to &euro;250 a week per child in my area, and it is commonplace for people to pay that much money. That is a massive burden and the tax code should reflect the fact that this is a real life cycle problem. Then there is the cost for families trying to fund education. The registration fee has been increased and the Government is edging towards the reintroduction of fees but there is no provision for tax relief in this regard. It is time for a fresh look at the entire tax code to ensure that it is sensitive to the pressures on families at different stages in their life cycle. There are real problems for young families and later in life for families that must support relatives in old age. The Government sees people in a narrow economic role and this philosophy is doing serious long-term damage to the proper functioning of our community.</P>
    <P>No one ever doubted that the Minister has a hard neck but reports in yesterday's newspapers took the biscuit &ndash; he will have to get a brass neck award. Yesterday, I read that the Minister was lecturing the EU and blaming it for the threatened cutbacks in public spending. I do not know if the Minister recalls that he increased public spending by 40% in the past two years. When the EU timidly asked the Minister if this was prudent it was contemptuously brushed aside. Telling the Minister how to run the economy was regarded as an assault on our man in the green jersey. We are now trying to deal with the consequences of the profligate approach to public spending and the Minister has the gall to blame the EU as if it was the EU who would impose cuts. It is the Minister's foolish approach to public finances and his undermining of the tax code that will impose problems on us.</P>
    <P>The Minister sat on his hands while his colleagues decided to indulge in chequebook electioneering. This is what has us up against stability pact constraints, so that we are finding that we cannot even fund our investment needs. It is not because the stability pact was excessively burdensome. The Government promised us it would protect us from the euro rip-off; 200,000 additional people would be given medical cards; hospital waiting lists would be ended in two years; the &euro;10 billion health strategy would be started immediately; no child would attend a sub-standard school; and 2,000 additional gardaí would be on the beat. One by one these promises were dropped into the bin as the Government told us it could not deliver them. Why? The Minister brandished a phrase he had tucked into the manifesto &ldquo;We will maintain the budget close to balance or in surplus in accordance with the stability and growth pact&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Minister is turning to Brussels saying the stability pact is killing us and <Col N="1295" />that it should be changed. The Minister's credibility is even further shot through. He is either standing by the need for prudence and is using a sensible stability pact to tell his colleagues that we need to manage public spending prudently, live within our resources and meet our international obligations, or he is blaming Brussels and hopes to go there with the begging bowl so that the EU might take this yoke off our back. It is crazy. The EU should be extremely wary of changing the goalposts for a Government that is not delivering value for money or delivering its projects either within budget or to schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they do. Having made promises he cannot deliver, having spent the money and having said the stability pact is the bedrock on which we stand, the Minister has dropped the election promises. These words means nothing to him, he will blame the EU. The underlying theme will be to shift the blame on to the EU and blame it, for example, for the inability of a woman in Cork to get home help. That is the subtext and it requires a brass neck.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister did not advert in his speech to the new spending obligations he is undertaking in the new partnership agreement. Some of the newspaper reports suggest these are substantial. The so-called productivity deal he got in return for benchmarking is pretty thin gruel. I am surprised we did not see the Minister addressing these crucial issues.</P>
      <P>We will have a lengthy Committee Stage debate when we will have the opportunity to go through the details of this Bill. I cannot understand the measures regarding the Ombudsman's report. Having read the Minister's provisions, I understand a number of people about whom the Ombudsman has made a report will not benefit from this change. The widows who had moneys mistakenly taken by the Revenue Commissioners will not benefit from the interest repayment tax relief the Minister is proposing. People who carry illnesses and have to withdraw will be penalised with no interest relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister needs to make clear that he will direct the Revenue Commissioners to make the provision for those to whom the Ombudsman has adverted. The Ombudsman is the last line of defence against the system for ordinary people. He has reported to the Dáil that the actions of the Revenue Commissioners are unfair, unwarranted and unprecedented. He has asked the House to be the court of appeal and the Minister should rule in his favour. The Minister has dealt with the longer-term issue and it can be done for the cases of clear injustice I have highlighted. I will table an amendment to the Bill so that we can debate this. The Minister could do it by simple indication. The Ombudsman told us last week that a previous Minister for Finance had indicated that <Col N="1296" />the Minister would respect findings of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I am also surprised about the provisions for the bloodstock industry. I agree with the Minister and think we should establish the benefits and the taxes forgone and make a balanced decision. There are obvious advantages but the bloodstock industry is mobile and could move elsewhere and there is significant employment in the sector. I cannot understand why the Minister is pushing out the declaration of this income. As I understand it returns will not have to be made until the tax year 2005, it would not be able to be assessed until 2006. I do not think the Minister is making a realistic attempt to allow the public interest to be properly evaluated. The date should be brought forward and the Minister should make provision for it to take immediate effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continually tells us it takes tough decisions. Now we have proof that the Government means what it says in its purposeful determination to eliminate waste and give value for money to taxpayers. The eagle-eyed Minister spotted an opportunity for major savings. In section 150 he proposes to revoke payments under the Irish Charges Act 1801 to the under-keeper of Marsh's Library and the Lord Mayor and citizens of Dublin. He is also revoking a payment to the Society of King's Inns. If these payments merit the attention of senior officials in the Department of Finance and Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, presumably these earth-shattering decisions involve major savings. The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. In the case of the Lord Mayor and the citizens of Dublin, the Bill brings to an end two payments established by Charles II to the city of Dublin, one for a total of &euro;351.63, dating back to 1662 relating to the pay attached to the captaincy of a company of foot, the other for a total of &euro;555.73 granted on 12 July 1665 in recognition of services to Charles II and his father. The overall total is &euro;907.36. Taxpayers can sleep easily in their beds and, once again, the intrepid Minister for Finance leaves no stone unturned.</P>
      <P>St. Augustine was a great man who enjoyed an occasional bout of temptation. He is eternally remembered for his plea to God to make him pure, but not just yet. The Minister of Finance is obviously a disciple of the Augustinian school. He always announces his steadfast determination to dismantle the bewildering edifices of tax shelters but is never quite ready to do it, and it is a case of &ldquo;not just yet&rdquo; in the Finance Bill. Perhaps he will do it next year, but it is more likely that he will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill is a key part of the State's budgetary process which gives legislative effect to the measures announced on budget day. It provides the Government with an opportunity to introduce additional measures or make changes to budget day proposals. God knows the budget of last December is in need of review. It is so flawed in content and intent that the Minister, on <Col N="1297" />mature reflection, ought to have decided to quietly scrap its more obnoxious defects. Regrettably, there was no chance in this instance of such a conversion. Whatever else he may be, the Minister is not a candidate for conversion of the St. Paul or St. Augustine variety.</P>
    <P>This is unfortunate because since budget day much has changed on the national and international fronts and the experience of this short interval is enough to require a change of policy and direction. Alas, there is no sign of this in the Bill and, regrettably, the country and its citizens will pay the price for this style of obduracy which does the Minister no credit. Fortunately, if public opinion is a guide, the Minister and his party will also pay a heavy price &ndash; no change, no chance. I suspect his colleagues, perhaps even the Taoiseach, know this, even if the message has not yet got through to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, the Governor of the Central Bank observed to journalists that European economic conditions had changed course dramatically in the first weeks of the year and that the outlook for growth was much more limited than the original forecast for the year, even though that forecast was laced with a tough dose of pessimism. We know since the threat of war that those situations and that outlook have become darker. How can a responsible Minister for Finance obdurately persist in budgetary measures that add to the inflationary pressures in the economy at such a difficult time and in such a hostile environment? If ever there was a time for taking stock and calmly reviewing policy, it is now. The Finance Bill, which is a heavy tome, is barely worth the value of the many sheets of paper on which it is printed and is a lost opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill demands that the Government puts up or shuts up and that it spells out the detail of what it proposes. It can no longer hide behind generalised statements of intent. Unfortunately, this Finance Bill is all too faithful to its partner, the budget. It sticks closely to the misguided economic policies set out on budget day. It also shows up the Government for what it is. After all the bluster about closing off loopholes, the Bill does not deliver. Once again, the wealthy interests in society, resident and non-resident, are let off the hook. The Minister promises action in the long run. Keynes once observed that in the long run, we are all dead. We will certainly all be dead and gone before the Minister and his party tackle this issue seriously.</P>
    <P>One of Keynes's books has the title <i>How to Pay for the War.</i> It could have been called, &ldquo;Who will pay for the mess.&rdquo;  The answer is simple. Working families will pay for the mess the Minister has created and will carry the can for his failures, misguided policies and refusal to listen or adapt to the dramatic change in circumstances.</P>
    <P>Ireland's inflation rate is the highest in the European Union and is twice the EU average. This did not happen by accident. It is the direct result of overheating of the economy by the Minister. Despite all the advice to the contrary, he <Col N="1298" />persisted in pursuing a reckless set of policies. At the height of the boom when interest rates were falling, he threw oil on the fire by skewing tax reductions towards the better-off while failing, despite his rhetoric, to bring tax credits up to the level of the minimum wage. In a monetary union, there is only one way for an economy to adjust to overheating and that is through higher inflation and falling competitiveness. That is why we experience higher inflation and a growing number of redundancies. It is nothing other than sheer mismanagement and the effects are evident everywhere, not least in the glaring failure to meet the targets in the national plan.</P>
    <P>Now the Government is making matters worse by ensuring that there will be no let-up in price rises. It has adopted a twin-track approach to driving up inflation. The Finance Bill copperfastens the first element in the plan. The Minister has made a deliberate decision that wealthy interests will not pay for his mistakes. He has failed to find adequate compensation measures from the corporate sector to balance the loss of income from the reduction of corporation tax. Bank levies are justified and the results from the AIB confirm this.</P>
    <P>In our stint in Government, we established the framework to reduce corporation taxes when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance. We have no problem in principle with this policy now that the crunch time has come to implement these reductions. However, we feel that balancing measures are needed to deliver an equivalent return from the corporate sector in a situation where many sectors enjoyed windfall profits in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Minister has insisted on and is proud of treating capital gains more favourably than earned income. He refuses to tackle realistically tax loopholes for high earners and persists with a notorious obduracy in allowing his favourite sectors, such as horse breeders and their stallion fees, to have tax-free earnings. The cost of his incompetence will be visited on working families. The Finance Bill is based on a strategy of increasing every charge and fee the Government can possibly levy on working families. The Minister does not want to row back on his mistaken policies. He is increasing charges and levies, willy-nilly, for ordinary families, thus increasing the rate of inflation. Last week's inflation figures bore that out once again.</P>
    <P>The Budget Statement listed a series of 12 tax cases and how they gain in the budget. When I resume the debate later, I want to discuss their plight more fully. What the Minister gave them in minuscule tax reliefs, he took back by a factor of five in levies and charges.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>The ministerial air transport service is currently operated by the Air Corps using the Gulfstream IV aircraft, which was leased for a period of ten years from 19 December 1991. It was purchased in December 2001 on termination of the lease. Owing to this country's assumption of the Presidency of the European Union in January 2004 and the proposed enlargement of the European Union in general, it is anticipated that demands on the ministerial air transport service will increase. The service is therefore being reviewed at present with a view to establishing the Government's needs during this country's Presidency of the European Union and its requirements in the longer term. The question of the retention or disposal of the Gulfstream IV will be considered in the context of this review and a decision on the matter is expected shortly.</P>

      <P>We all agree the Government must have an adequate and efficient method of transport to execute its international duties and obligations. Does the Minister agree that one of the main features determining the lifespan of such an aircraft is the number of flying hours? When one considers that the Government jet has clocked up 8,000 hours, which I understand is hardly run-in time in terms of a car, and that the Aer Lingus fleet contains many aircraft with between 30,000 hours and 40,000 hours, the Government jet is relatively new and fresh. Would the Minister not consider the feasibility of having this aircraft completely refurbished at an approved maintenance base? I understand this was previously done in Spain when there was trouble with the aircraft before.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it rather extravagant that we should spend up to &euro;100 million on a luxury plane, as has recently been reported in some newspapers? In these difficult economic times, a plane the size of a bungalow with facilities such as a modern kitchen and bathroom, a queen size bed and a lounge as big as Fagans in Drumcondra would be overdoing it. Would it not be much better to repair the existing aircraft and have it completely refurbished so that it could last for another five to ten years? After all it has only completed 8,000 flying hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for supporting the Government in having reliable transport to meet our obligations in Europe and the world. <Col N="1300" />This enables business to be transacted in a much more efficient way. I agree with him in saying there is no question of spending &euro;100 million on the type of aircraft about which he is hallucinating. We are practical, pragmatic people. We know the limits of the resources available and we will match that to meeting our needs as best we possibly can. That is what the review will do.</P>
      <P>The Gulfstream IV has completed 8,400 hours. As the Deputy says, this is not unusual, but it underwent a major refurbishment programme a year and a half ago. It has regular maintenance and is entirely airworthy. However on a number of high profile occasions there have been problems affecting the Taoiseach's travel, which we very much regret. Some of those occasions were extremely embarrassing for the Taoiseach. The review group will take into account all these considerations, but I can assure the Deputy we are not in the business of extravagance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to put our priorities in order. Last July, the Minister was obliged to cancel a helicopter deal which was in the region of &euro;40 million. We do not have the necessary aircraft to protect our airspace at the moment, in spite of the great difficulties throughout Europe and the world. If we have the &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million, depending on the newspaper one reads &ndash; one of them even mentioned &euro;100 million for a Boeing business jet &ndash; our priority should be to provide these facilities for our Defence Forces, as I am sure the Minister will agree. With proper refurbishment, the Government jet could last for another four, five or ten years given that the Minister has admitted that 8,000 miles is comparatively low when we consider some of our national fleet has completed over 40,000 miles. There seems to be a huge campaign, generated by the Government and its spin-doctors, in conditioning the Irish people to believe this jet has to be purchased now to carry out our international duties. It can be done adequately with the present jet if it is properly refurbished. I hope the Government will not try to mislead the people by saying it is dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add. The review group is examining this and will report very shortly. There is no question of going down the road the Deputy is suggesting. I have just signed a contract for &euro;60 million to acquire trainer aircraft for the Air Corps, so there is no question of neglecting any aspect of the Defence Forces in the context of meeting the transport requirements of the Government and its successors. The lifespan of an aircraft like this is considerable. The Government has an enormous volume of business at the moment and will have even more when we have the Presidency and as enlargement takes place. The people are best represented by having efficient, quick transport to carry out the national and international business of the Government.</P>

      <Quest>the rules of engagement of the Defence Forces currently deployed to protect Shannon Airport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 100 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The roles of the Defence Forces, as assigned by Government, are set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in February 2000. Among the assigned roles is to aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, which has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required in duties, which include the protection and guarding of vital installations.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the terrorist events of 11 September security at Shannon Airport is under continuous review. The Garda, which undertakes threat assessments for Shannon Airport on an ongoing basis, requested the Defence Forces to provide assistance in securing the airport. Such assistance has been rendered by the Defence Forces since 5 February 2003, and liaison between the Garda and the Defence Forces in this regard is continuing. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me, for reasons of security, to indicate the number of Defence Forces personnel involved in such operations.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces annual training plan provides for training in a broad spectrum of activities, including riot control and the policing of demonstrations in the aid to the civil power, ATCP, role. However, the primary responsibility for the maintenance and restoration of the public peace rests with the Garda Síochána, with the Defence Forces acting in support of the Garda. The issue of powers of arrest for members of the Defence Forces does not therefore arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" />The role of the Defence Forces currently deployed at Shannon Airport is to assist the Garda in carrying out its security duties. The Defence Forces have not been issued with non-lethal weapons or ammunition.</P>
    <P>In relation to rules of engagement, Defence Forces Regulation CS1 sets out the rules under which the Defence Forces may act. Regulation CS1 provides that any force used should be the minimum necessary to achieve the required objective. In addition, no action should be taken by the officer commanding in the absence of prior consultation, where practicable with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>On the use of lethal force, members of the Defence Forces may only discharge a live round of ammunition in the following circumstances: in protecting the military party and its individual members; in saving the lives of others; in preventing a criminal outrage of a serious nature, such as the burning or destruction of any building or the commission of any crime likely to cause loss of life; or the breaking open of a prison. However, the use of lethal force, may only be where there is no alternative and the Garda Síochána has been consulted as to the appropriate course of action. It is not expected that such circumstances will arise in Shannon.</P>
    <P>The estimated weekly cost of allowances paid to Defence Forces personnel on security duty at Shannon Airport is &euro;40,000. Other costs incurred, such as catering, transport, etc., would arise in the normal course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify an issue? He mentioned the number of troops stationed at Shannon Airport. Are they present on a 24 hour basis and what is the total likely cost of this presence to the Exchequer? Is it the &euro;40,000 figure to which he referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I mentioned covers security duty allowances. Other associated costs would also be incurred in the normal course of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the troops carry weapons with live ammunition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In what circumstances would the troops use live ammunition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, very strict training modules in the use of lethal weapons in any context are provided for members of the Defence Forces. The Deputy will recall that the Defence Forces have been exposed to dangerous circumstances on may occasions. They include Border duties, duties in the Lebanon and other duties on the international front. Members of the Defence Forces are and must be subject to special control mechanisms for managing circumstances in which the use of lethal force arises. We are fortunate that there have not been incidents in this regard <Col N="1303" />to date, apart perhaps from one event many years ago. The country can be assured that live ammunition is used as a last resort when soldiers' lives or those of others are threatened, which is highly unlikely in the context of the current circumstances at Shannon Airport. I have complete confidence in the ability of all members of the Defence Forces to act prudently and justly, even in the most dangerous circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister provided a figure of &euro;40,000 for the cost of the operation at Shannon Airport. What is its overall cost to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the details to hand. Suffice to say the Defence Forces are paid regardless of where they are operating and transport and maintenance costs are similar whether they are in the Glen of Imaal, the Curragh or elsewhere. The additional security costs arising from the maintenance of a 24 hour service are not substantial and are in the order of the figure I provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>My question referred to the daily cost of the operation. If the figure of &euro;40,000 refers to the daily cost for the past three weeks, one arrives at a substantial sum when it is multiplied by 21. It should not be dismissed so quickly.</P>
      <P>If, as the Minister states, non-lethal weapons or projectiles have not been issued and it is not expected that lethal force will be used, what would the soldiers do if, for example, protesters took over the runway? Would they sit on them? What rules would apply in such circumstances? Would the case of a protester sitting on a runway in a manner that was likely to endanger life in terms of planes landing constitute grounds for the use of lethal force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given some details as to the responsible approach of the Defence Forces. I utterly reject the implication that members of the Defence Forces would be reckless in any circumstances. They are totally dependable, as they have proved time and again. They have faced extraordinarily difficult circumstances in the Border region. When the Troubles in the North were at their worst and atrocities of a most brutal nature were being carried out on innocent people, the Defence Forces were there to assist the Garda.</P>
      <P>In this instance the Defence Forces have been made available at the request of the Garda Síochána, which is responsible for security in Shannon Airport. They will act in accordance with Garda requirements. Like anybody else dealing with this question from a reasonable standpoint, I can envisage no circumstances in which it would be necessary to use lethal weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF" hpid="Aengus Ó Snodaigh Aengus Ó Snodaigh">
      <NameTxt>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to suggest troops would be reckless. What level of <Col N="1304" />Garda support is available to ensure they operate properly and are in a position to be directed as to the course of action they should take? Is a superintendent on duty in Shannon Airport 24 hours a day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, a superintendent is always in charge although he may not necessarily be on site all of the time. Thanks to modern technology and the investment the Government has made in modernising communications for both the Defence Forces and the Garda, it is possible to receive instructions from superior officers at a distance. In general, officers at all levels know what action should be taken. However, in times of doubt they may require to have redress to a senior officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his statements today appear to contradict previous statements he made on this issue. For example, <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21 January reported him as saying the following during an address at Collins Barracks in Cork:</P>
      <P>It is unfair to Shannon to have it down as a potential target. We have no reason to believe there is a threat to us.</P>
      <P>He appears to be saying something completely different today.</P>
      <P>On 4 February RTE reported the Minister as saying that while troops were entitled to protect themselves if their lives were at stake, this did not extend to firing on people attacking property. I did not fully hear the four criteria he set out for using lethal force, but I understand one of them referred to the destruction of property. If, however, destruction of property is not a criterion, what would happen if al-Qaeda launched an attack solely against aircraft with machine guns and explosives? Would our troops stand by and allow them to do this? This issue needs to be clarified, as there have been contradictions in the Minister's responses throughout this episode.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no contradiction between anything I said in Cork and my earlier comments here. If I were to be asked whether there is a credible threat to Shannon Airport or any part of the country &ndash; a question I have not been asked &ndash; I would rely entirely on the security forces who have consistently indicated that there is no credible threat. It is important to realise, however, that that position can change quickly. Unfortunately, we do not have control over these matters but prevention and detection by intelligence sources is the way to deal with them. There is no contradiction between what our Defence Forces do in Shannon and my indicating, as the Deputy and the country are aware, that there is no current credible threat to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of what the Defence Forces would do in the circumstances the Deputy outlined, which are entirely different from what has happened up to now, people engaged in what we understood <Col N="1305" />was to be a peaceful protest. However, their actions and the weapons they carried takes them out of the category of people who are peaceful. Nonetheless, dealing with that type of circumstance is entirely different, and Deputy Gormley knows that. From what he has described &ndash; al-Qaeda or some of its cohorts trying to damage an aeroplane or property in Shannon &ndash; both of us know what would happen in those circumstances&mdash;</P>

That was repeated by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. Is it not the case that it is necessary to do that under the Constitution and that a clear signal is being sent that Irish troops, in protecting Shannon, are part of the American war effort?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important responsibilities of any government in a democratic society is to protect its people, institutions and installations. It is wrong for Deputy Gormley to suggest that we should not care about what is done to property at Shannon Airport, or who is involved in that, and that the State should stand idly by. A large number of people use Shannon and the many people employed there depend on Shannon for their living. It would be nonsense not to fully protect that airport. We are not prepared to stand by and let that happen. The airport is being secured. The Defence Forces were requested to assist in the effort of making the security more formidable. That has happened. It is an exercise in how we should protect an instal<Col N="1306" />lation of that kind which is an extremely valuable employer&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State.</P>
      <P>While the threat of terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, there is no reason to believe that Ireland is a direct target. Notwithstanding that, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken and that matters are kept under continual review.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Government established a task force on emergency planning. The objective of the task force is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency. As chair of this task force, my objective is to ensure that such responses continue to be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.</P>
      <P>The office of emergency planning, OEP, which operates under my remit in the Department of Defence, is taking the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threats from global terrorism, including co-ordination of Government emergency planning and responses by various agencies. Review and updating of existing emergency plans is ongoing to ensure a co-ordinated and effective response to large-scale emergencies. The major emergency plan is the framework for the immediate response by the emergency services &ndash; gardaí, health, fire service, etc., &ndash; to any major incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An urgent and detailed review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military auth<Col N="1307" />orities following on from the events of 11 September. It included, <i>inter alia: </i>an update of the threat assessment; intensive contacts with other State agencies; a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems; the Army Ranger wing, ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search; and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. Guidance documents pertaining to aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authorities were also re-assessed. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required.</P>
    <P>In relation to equipment, as Deputies will be aware there has been a significant investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces over the past number of years. This investment is continuing apace, notwithstanding the changed economic circumstances. In the past few months alone, I have signed contracts for 25 additional APCs and eight trainer aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with the varying nuclear, biological and chemical threats identified from time to time. A programme for the purchase of nuclear, biological and chemical &ndash; NBC &ndash; equipment is ongoing and the requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continual review by the ordnance corps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in a previous reply to my first question that he recently signed a contract for the purchase of training aircraft to the value of &euro;60 million. Is the Minister confident that those aircraft will be sufficiently versatile to provide the necessary air cover for our air space? Is it true that these new aircraft are slower than a commercial aircraft? If that is the case, their effectiveness may not be 100%. Does the Minister agree that terrorists are usually attracted to soft targets and, in addition to Shannon Airport, there are a number of regional airports in various parts of the country from Donegal to Kerry? Will he indicate if any steps have been taken to provide security at some of our regional airports?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, we have a limited ground-to-air defence capacity. That has always been the position. The trainer aircraft which are being purchased have a limited defence capacity. They are primarily trainer aircraft. Bearing in mind that the training of pilots is the essential job of the Air Corps, that would be the primary consideration in terms of the type of aircraft required. That is based on the technical analysis done by the expert groups which recommend to me the type of aircraft that are most suitable for our purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the Deputy's question is extraordinarily difficult and it is an issue that is being addressed by governments throughout the <Col N="1308" />world. It concerns the impossibility of being able to provide air defence from the ground in the kind of circumstances the Deputy is outlining. In terms of coping with information we receive, and taking into account the fact that aircraft may only have 15 minutes to travel the hundreds of miles to their destination, it is a science beyond me in terms of the technical capacity required to address the problem. I am aware from talking to colleagues around the world that it is a concern which is not easily addressed to our satisfaction or the satisfaction of the people we represent. I want to be as honest as possible. We do not have substantial resources in this area, nor are we likely to have such resources in future. To answer this question as I have answered others, one has more or less failed in one's security work when a terrorist has secured an aircraft and controls it. Defence must occur before that if one is to secure the public; that is what examples of such activity teach us.</P>

      <P>If the Minister got a phone call this afternoon that an aeroplane loaded with explosives was headed towards a target here, what would be our capacity to intercept that aeroplane? Would we have to call on some of our neighbours to do the needful?</P>

      <P>I have already answered the question in one sense but I do not want to go into any detail regarding the exceptional circumstances outlined by the Deputy. The security services have planned for such events and it would be improper to discuss those plans in public. However, it is clear that outside assistance would be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The work-up, training and familiarisation period for the introduction into service of the EC 135 has been completed and the aircraft is now fully operational. The EC 135 is a welcome addition to the Garda air support unit, GASU, which also comprises one twin-engined AS355N Squirrel helicopter and one Defender 4000 fixed-wing aircraft. With the introduction of the EC135, the Air Corps assumes responsibility for the flying of this aircraft, while the maintenance is contracted out. However, the Air Corps will continue to be responsible for all matters relating to the flying and maintenance of the existing aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" />The issue of night flying capacity has been the subject of ongoing communication between the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There are no restrictions on the Garda helicopter for night operations in the greater Dublin area, where the greatest number of night call-outs has occurred. Cover is also provided on request in urban areas outside Dublin. Recent operations in this regard include missions in Killarney, Shannon and Galway. The demand for night time air support in non-urban rural areas is relatively small. That said, it is obviously desirable that the facility for air support in such areas would be available should it be required, while having regard to the absolute priority of the safe operation of the aircraft. The Air Corps is continuing to develop its night time flying capability within the available GASU resources and in this regard an ongoing training programme for night operations is being developed following on from the recent introduction into service of the new EC 135.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's answer hard to understand. This problem has existed since 1999 and every time the question is asked more or less the same reply is given. The Minister told the House that options for the provision of night flight training are under active consideration in the Department, something which has also been stated previously. What is the problem? Is there a dispute between the Department and the Garda? Is nobody prepared to sort this out? Also, it is unacceptable that the Garda helicopter is unavailable at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, the bulk of call-outs are in the Dublin area. That covers day and night services. The Air Corps has also dealt with cases in Shannon, Galway and other urban centres during the day. There have been very few call-outs for night flights in rural areas.</P>
      <P>What is my first priority? That must be the safety of the aircraft and its personnel. Most of the activity has been in the Dublin area and training is ongoing to equip personnel to handle other demands. Regarding rural flights, there are mountain ranges, quickly descending fog and other hazards to take into account. The experts will decide how much training in these areas has to be done and then report to me. I will not dictate to them.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of plans for major changes. This is primarily a matter for the Military College but I do not have proposals before me along the lines suggested by Deputy Stanton. There may have been times when, considering the numbers attending third level courses, management wanted to examine other options and I am happy to facilitate that. The world is ever-changing and there is much to take into account. It may have arisen at a time when we were losing substantial numbers after they completed their college training. We lost young recruits when it would have been to the advantage of the Defence Forces if they had stayed. That exodus has stopped so the pressure no longer exists.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, in response to a Government decision of Tuesday, 2 October 2001, I set up the Office of Emergency Planning in the Department of Defence. The Office of Emergency Planning continues to take the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat from international terrorism and from any escalation in international tensions. It co-ordinates the responses by the various agencies involved and continues to exercise an oversight role in relation to peace-time planning to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements.</P>
      <P>The existing lead roles of Departments in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements continue and a review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is ongoing. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large scale emergency. As chairman of the task force on emergency planning, my approach is that such responses should be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all response arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report to this House that there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and agencies through the task force, the Office of Emergency Planning and the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning.</P>
      <P>The Office of Emergency Planning provides key support to the Government task force and co-ordinates the work of the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning to meet the new threats arising from international terrorism.</P>

      <P>Threat assessment is continuously carried out by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. They have reported to each meeting of the task force that there has been no credible threat to this country, but planning for emergencies to deal with international terrorism must go on because the situation can change and <Col N="1313" />every country is vulnerable to modern terrorism. Resources required by the task force have been made available. The report to Cabinet outlined the emergency plans, the need to be vigilant and how to sort out problems that might arise in Departments.</P>

Exercises simulating a nuclear emergency were carried out last year and others have been conducted by the fire service. This is done on a regular basis because only practice will enable us to cope when faced with a real problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gormley asked about an attack on Sellafield. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland provides a control room for Cabinet Ministers to plot and assess the plume, the direction it is travelling, the radiation threat and where it will land. That is the preparatory work. The public would then be alerted through television, radio and sirens. Deputies will appreciate that some people handle fear better than others. An exaggerated position can upset many people, as has happened in other parts of the world where words were not considered before statements <Col N="1314" />were released. We must be careful how we let people know but also bear in mind that some communications systems are turned off at certain times of the day. We must be able to work on a 24 hour basis.</P>
    <P>I would be the last person in the world to say we have done everything but we have made a conscious effort to be as effective as we can in meeting any problem.</P>

The Department is in the process of effecting first registration on the title to this property in the Land Registry and the contract of sale is expected to be finalised shortly. Pending signing of the contract of sale it would not be appropriate to comment on the details of the sale.</P>
      <P>Florence Properties issued a press release in November indicating that it had agreed to purchase the property in question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I was very anxious that this site would have been purchased by the city council for that purpose. However, that body decided, perhaps wisely from its point of view, that that was not a consideration for it. From my knowledge of the potential of the site, I believe there is adequate potential for affordable housing. However, in selling on the open market, there is a limit to the extent one <Col N="1315" />can dictate what a new owner will do with the site, especially when the offer is considerably higher than that of any other tender.</P>

Has access been guaranteed to the railway platform at the rear, in line with future plans by CIE to develop on that side of the site? Is the Minister saying that Dublin City Council made no attempt to buy the site from the Department, or was it that the Department's figure was too high?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To be honest, I am not really sure. In the first instance, it was placed on offer to the city council exclusively. After negotiations had got under way, which looked very positive, they ended rather abruptly. I then put the site up for sale and the city council made an offer which was considerably below the valuation placed on the property by the Valuation Office, on which I rely in selling property on behalf of taxpayers. Negotiations then commenced with a number of other companies, culminating in the Florence purchase at a price considerably above what the city council was prepared to offer. For State property, as the Deputy will appreciate, we have an obligation to secure value for money. If I did not succeed in getting a return in that way, I would have to look to the taxpayers for it. The proceeds of the sale have been greatly instrumental in facilitating developments in the Defence Forces.</P>

It is fortunate that this procedure applied because I usually spend the money before I receive it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 140 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The Gulfstream IV aircraft was leased for a period of ten years from December 1991 to December 2001 for use as a ministerial air transport aircraft. It was purchased in December 2001 on termination of the lease.</P>
      <P>Owing to this country's assumption of the Presidency of the European Union in January 2004 and the proposed enlargement of the European Union in general, it is anticipated that demands on the ministerial air transport service will increase. The service is therefore being reviewed at present with a view to establishing the Government's needs during this country's Presidency of the European Union and its requirements in the longer term. The question of the retention or disposal of the Gulfstream IV together with the lease of a ten to 12 seater executive jet aircraft will be considered in the context of this review and a decision in the matter is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>Since the Gulfstream IV aircraft was acquired in December 1991, it has flown a total of approximately 8,400 hours. The jet has broken down three times in the past 12 months as follows: 15 December 2002 at Baldonnel; 17 January 2003 in Mexico and 30 January 2003 at Baldonnel. The aircraft completes an annual maintenance inspection at a manufacturers approved maintenance facility. A 72-month maintenance inspection is scheduled to take place this summer. This is routine maintenance in accordance with the manufacturer's maintenance schedule. The aircraft is currently fully airworthy.</P>

There are enormous pressures on Government in terms of travel. This aircraft gives flexibility in that regard as well as providing a degree of privacy and facilitating travel at times when scheduled flights are not available. That is an important facet of the operation of Government. If many relatively small entrepreneurs in this country and elsewhere can afford this facility, the Government should be enabled to do its business quickly and effectively.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister guarantee that the present aircraft is safe, given that it has broken down on so many occasions? It is a difficult question to answer, but if there are any doubts about the aircraft perhaps it should not be flying. Would the funding for the acquisition of a new aircraft come from the Minister's Department or from general Exchequer funds?</P>

      <P>The Gulfstream IV is perfectly air-worthy. There have been a few high profile let-downs and they definitely cause a worry, but I have to rely on the technical advice I get from the specialists in that area. The specialists say it has run about half its lifetime at 8,400 hours flying time and possibly has had too many short flights. We are not sure what kind of pressure that can bring on, but it is perfectly air-worthy and has been flying perfectly.</P>

      <P>The new aircraft type to be supplied is the Pilatus PC-9M, manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft Limited, Stans, Switzerland. The cost of the aircraft is approximately &euro;60 million, inclusive of VAT. Delivery of the aircraft will take place during 2004.</P>
      <P>Modern trainer aircraft were identified by the Air Corps as being their main equipment priority. These aircraft will allow for the continued training of young cadets to the highest standard and is a realistic response to the needs of the Air Corps and the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society, and while there have been relatively few instances of drug-related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirror the community at large. The implications of drug abuse in an organisation in which personnel have access to firearms are too obvious to require elaboration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" />A compulsory substance testing programme was introduced on 1 February 2002, following a long consultative process with the Office of the Attorney General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General and the Defence Forces representative associations, as part of a Defence Forces substance abuse programme. Prior to the launch of the programme, an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. All personnel were issued with a booklet devised to inform them of the purpose of the new testing programme, the administrative procedures involved and the sanctions for those who test positive. All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing and monitoring and sanctions, will be taken to maintain a drug-free environment within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of compulsory random drugs testing is deterrence. In order to provide a credible level of deterrent, the testing programme has been devised to maximise the possibility of random selection for testing. A trained drugs testing team will be responsible for taking the urine samples for compulsory random testing throughout the Defence Forces. Testing commenced on 14 November 2002 and it is envisaged that 10% of the Defence Forces will be randomly tested per annum. A member, randomly selected, may be required at any time to provide a urine sample, which will be used for testing for evidence of use of controlled drugs or the abuse or misuse of other substances, or for the detection of the metabolites thereof. A member who refuses to provide a urine sample or provides a urine sample which tests positive shall be liable to retirement, discharge or relinquishment of commission or withdrawal of cadetship, as appropriate under the provisions of Defence Force regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was talking about how hard the Minister's budget has been on working families. In pages 24 to 26 of his Budget Statement, the Minister provided us with details of how various hypothetical families would benefit from his limited tax changes. He was anxious that we should know how much these couples, Liam and Georgina and John and Stephanie, would gain from the budget. The answer I have is that they will not gain very much. The Minister, unsurprisingly, chose to ignore the downside of his measures and so conveniently forgot to measure how much they would lose if budget measures, and the price increases intro<Col N="1325" />duced on a daily basis since the Government was returned to office, were taken into account.</P>
      <P>Let us take the example of Duncan and Mary. Who is Duncan? When I first heard of him I thought he sounded like the star of a boy band, but he is actually an information technology technician earning &euro;40,000 per year and is married, happily or otherwise, to Mary, who works in the home. They have two children, God bless them. We are told that they will gain &euro;95 from the Minister's budget. Is that not great? This is because the tax credit was increased very slightly. However, what the Minister left out is what happens to Duncan and Mary and their two charming children when it comes to all the extra taxes, charges and so on that they will have to pay. For instance, if they have a child in college they will pay an extra &euro;274 in college registration fees. If both their children are in college, they will pay twice that. If any of the family requires medication they will pay an extra &euro;200 per annum for prescription drugs. Their average ESB bill will go up by &euro;78. They will pay an extra &euro;178 in VHI charges. It is reasonable to assume that somebody on an income of &euro;40,000 is probably on one of the VHI schemes, because he or she would be in difficulty otherwise. They will pay an extra &euro;30 to tax their 1.4 litre family car. If they have a credit card and a Laser card each they will pay an extra &euro;69.50 in stamp duty. If their two children are in college and need to have a card, they will also pay extra stamp duty. These are only some of the increases that Duncan and Mary, an average family, will have to pay. This list goes on. Last week's inflation figures show&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government is driving most of the inflation with which people are being assaulted each week. Last week's inflation figures showed that inflation is now being driven by areas under Government control. They include inflation in education costs, such as the registration charges for students, which are up 10.2% in the year to January. Water, refuse and other service charges are up 19.3%, hospital service costs are up by 19.3%, motor tax has increased by 11.9%, bus fares have increased by 10.1% while postal services are up 8.8%.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste said in the election campaign, like George Bush, that there would be no more tax increases. They did not say anything about the price increases with which they would hit us as soon as they got back into Government.</P>

      <P>This is not an accident. This is deliberate policy. Duncan and Mary are not my creation. They are the creation of the Minister for Finance and he is relentlessly raiding their family budget at every turn with taxes on this, charges on that and levies on the other. The Government is willing to tolerate this level of inflation. It is not prepared to introduce any balancing measures to address price increases in other areas.</P>
      <P>After five years of this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and endless old guff from the Tánaiste about competition, the consumer need not expect any comfort from that quarter. It is one thing to talk about competition but quite another to take on the wealthy interests and deliver for consumers such as Duncan and Mary and their children across a range of sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The other main area of neglect is investment. The boom in the 1990s was stoked by tax cuts and then it was choked by bottlenecks in the economy. Try to move on any of the roads in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because we have improved the economy so much. Everybody is working now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can give it but he cannot take it. Sustained, non-inflationary growth requires investment to tackle bottlenecks but the Government is not delivering. The national <Col N="1327" />development plan is hopelessly behind schedule. It is being starved of resources and is grossly mismanaged by the Government.</P>
      <P>Look at the roads programme. The Government has admitted that its roads programme, due for completion in 2006, will not be completed until 2009. The Construction Industry Federation believes 2012 is a better guess, at current levels of funding. However, the Government refuses to borrow funds to invest in the economy. There are 22 major National Roads Authority projects ready to proceed. All they need is funding but only seven have been given the go ahead so far this year.</P>
      <P>The other projects offer significant returns. One of the standard measures used in cost benefit analyses of road projects is the internal rate of return. It is analogous to the rate of interest which investment in road projects yields in time saved and deaths averted. The internal rate of return on the Monaghan bypass is estimated at 16.6%. The return on the Ashbourne bypass is estimated at 15.95%. These are attractive investments and returns &ndash; the return on bank deposits is negligible at present &ndash; particularly when compared with the cost of Government borrowing. The Minister, however, refuses to make these investments. He is happy to blow &euro;743 million of the national reserve fund on the stock market but he will not invest in projects with a guaranteed rate of return to the economy.</P>
      <P>There is an even bigger return from these projects, the benefit of non-inflationary growth. Investing in infrastructure frees up bottlenecks that drive up prices and choke off competitiveness but the Minister refuses to do it. It is ironic that a Government committed to Boston rather than to Berlin can be criticised by the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland. However, in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> we read that infrastructure is now top of the agenda for the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland. The Government's failure to tackle bottlenecks is putting costs under pressure and making Ireland unattractive to US investors. It is ironic, too, that they should point to insurance costs as a major concern. The chief apostle of the Boston model, the Tánaiste, has had ministerial responsibility for the insurance sector for five years. Once again, however, there is plenty of waffle about reform but no delivery. We can expect to live with higher inflation for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Austin McCabe, the new president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland gave lengthy interviews last week to various media organisations. He is the managing director of Symantec, a major and good employer in my constituency. It is the type of employer we want to encourage to come to Ireland. He said with regard to basic infrastructure:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are programmes in place to alleviate congestion in Dublin but they're just not coming on stream. All the plans are in place for the <Col N="1328" />country but we just need to plough ahead and implement them. I know that might mean increasing national debt, for example, but I think if we don't, we're going to be constantly playing catch-up and we've been doing that already for the past few years. The government says it doesn't have the money but I think if construction means shoving up borrowing so be it. If we don't have the infrastructure we won't get the foreign investment.</P>
    <P>If we do not have the infrastructure, we will lose competitiveness. Hence the bleeding of jobs that we have seen in the first two months of this year and for much of last year. This phenomenon is set not only to continue but to grow in the future, unfortunately for the workers involved.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCabe also said that staff coming to live in Ireland from the US and other countries</P>
    <P>&ldquo;often find it unbelievable that they cannot get high speed Internet access in Ireland when they are used to dialling up late at night in their home countries when inspiration suddenly hits them. Others are paying [this will interest Deputy Harney] five times the car insurance costs they would at home, just for basic cover. It's certainly not an advert for attracting highly qualified technical staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland says about this Government's policy. It is a plea to the Minister and the Government to act sensibly in relation to investing in the infrastructure we need.</P>
    <P>The Bill also brings into force, in great detail, the proposal to increase the VAT rates which was implemented on 1 January 2003. Like other spokespersons on finance, I have been inundated by submissions, particularly from people in the tourism industry &ndash; a major employer, essential to our economic growth &ndash; which has been knocked for six by the increases in VAT rates. I have received many letters from family hotels which are having difficulties in the post-11 September downturn, which are worsened by the threat of war that hangs over the global economy. Family-run hotels and restaurants in the tourism sector are taking a major hit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>These businesses are trying to retain their competitiveness, yet the Government has significantly increased the basic rate of VAT which has knocked them for six. That is not the way to improve competitiveness in a tourism industry which is already under huge pressure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in corporation tax which, by the way, was negotiated and introduced by Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance, affects <Col N="1329" />companies which are profitable. Many of these companies will not be profitable so they will not be able to avail of reduced corporation tax. The point they make is that by increasing the VAT rate on services like hotels and restaurants, the Government is taking from them the little profitability they had.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that the Minister for Finance, in section 150 of the Bill, changed some tax arrangements and payments from the public purse which dated from the 17th century and I complimented the Minister, the parliamentary counsel and the Department officials in paying such minute attention to legislation, but what about the really important areas? The Minister for Finance and his Department have not done as well in estimating the costs of the SSIAs &ndash; there has been a series of different figures. It is a pity the same powers of financial acumen were not applied to the deal between the religious congregations and the Government. This deal has opened up the State to enormous financial obligations which we cannot yet calculate and is letting the religious orders off the hook. It is a pity the same Government was not alert when we lost &euro;743 million of the national pensions reserve fund on investments on falling stock markets around the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Stocks are going through a bear market, which may last for ten years or more. The notion that &euro;743 million will flow back to us soon is misplaced. If one's pension is maturing now, rather than if and when the stock market readjusts itself, that is just bad luck. The Minister's policy seems to be to watch the pennies &ndash; like the grant of &euro;600 to Dublin Corporation from the 17th century &ndash; while the State incurs liabilities of billions of euro on the special savings scheme, the deal with the religious orders and the investments of the national pensions reserve fund. The Minister is suddenly shy to talk about these matters.</P>
      <P>The material the Minister gave me in answer to a parliamentary question a month ago showed that 400 high income earners got an incredible deal on their tax liability and many paid no tax at all. According to the Revenue Commissioners, between 31,000 and 53,000 taxpayers earn more that &euro;100,000. One of the most fundamental questions which the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have not tackled is how we get information on who pays tax and whether tax is applied evenly to all citizens. This is an essential component of the contract of taxation. At the weekend, the Minister probably saw the march in Dublin which was an attempt to stop the war and dissuade the Government from being involved with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget does nothing for fairness. The papers released by the tax strategy group show how little is known by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department about the cost of tax breaks in the economy. It is extraordinary that massive amounts of money are given away in tax breaks each year without the most basic up-to-date information being available about how much they cost and who benefits from them.</P>
      <P>There is now a clear case for the implementation of a minimum effective tax rate to be put in place for all high-income earners. This would mean that taxpayers with high incomes would have to pay a minimum percentage of their income tax, irrespective of what schemes they were in, to avail of tax relief. I approach tax policy with one simple guiding principle, set out some time ago by the report of the tax commission after the marches by PAYE workers in their hundreds of thousands, that taxes should be simple and easily understood. We should keep tax rates as low as possible but they should be paid by everybody across the board with as few exemptions as possible. This principle has been flouted and the problem for the Government is that the ordinary taxpayer has no confidence in the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Finance Bill. One of the defects of the House is that we have few opportunities to discuss the shape of the economy or the assumptions that guide economic policy. The slight opportunity we have is this discussion on the Finance Bill. This is an important point because as one listened to the budget debates over the past few years, it became increasingly difficult to try to elicit from the Minister's speech what assumptions guided the casting of the budget and the framing of the Finance Bill. This point has been illustrated by the publication on 13 February 2003 of the EUROSTAT survey on social protection in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Across a set of chosen indicators, it considers the concept of social protection, that is the kind of life available to people in member states of the European Union. One can note the purchasing power standards, which is the measure, in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain and Ireland. EUROSTAT found it necessary to include an introductory paragraph in its publication. It states that the relevant importance of social protection varies considerably from one member state to another. It states that in 2000 the <Col N="1331" />lowest shares of gross domestic product attributable to social protection were 14.1% in Ireland and 20.1% in Spain. It goes on to state that the figure was highest in Sweden at 32.3%, followed by France at 29.7% and by Germany at 29.5%. What that is really saying, in a straightforward way, is that to advocate a policy rather like the one Progressive Democrats advocate &ndash; that all money is one's own money and, therefore, one should not put anything into the public space or enrich it &ndash; is a backward notion.</P>
    <P>The absence of an opportunity to discuss the assumptions under which the Minister for Finance operates and has operated under for several budgets does not allow some fundamental questions to be asked. Is it his intention to be regressive or progressive in regard to taxation? Is it his intention to be redistributive in any way? The only conclusion anyone can draw from examining the effect of Finance Acts over several years is that they have neatly, consistently and openly transferred wealth from the poorest to the wealthiest. It was fascinating to hear the Minister give a list of closures of tax loopholes in his speech on this Finance Bill, when one considers that these thickets in which people hid their speculative money were created by him. The vast thicket of speculative money has been created out of the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil and PD parties.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider how rent rolls can be sold to finance companies and the income taken off them reduced from the 42% income rate to effectively a 12% rate. This tells us that our economy was rank with speculation in the good times. In the times of economic growth, instead of making anything secure in terms of infrastructure or the surplus being used as an opportunity for redistribution or extending social protection, it was fired away into a vast speculative miasma. At about every fourth paragraph in his speech the Minister said he is the kind of person who likes to close these loopholes. I find that absurd.</P>
    <P>I will deal with one or two of the main assumptions, the points that I said are rarely discussed. I was at a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs about two weeks ago at which we had a visit from the Croatian Foreign Affairs committee which is preparing for entry into the European Union. I asked its members two questions, one of which is relevant to what we are discussing. I asked one of its members how had the people managed the adjustment between social protection, by which I meant the social floor below which people would not fall by way of pensions, housing and health, the many public provisions that were provided under the old state system, and their preparations for the market economy as required in their negotiations with the European Union. The man looked directly at me and said that they had imposed upon them a 19th century model of economics and they have no choice. As they prepare for the elections, they <Col N="1332" />have had a general strike preceded by a strike of health workers and the entire social space is disrupted by the imposition of a harsh economic regime that they were not allowed to mediate. In answer to why that is the case, he suggested that it was imposed upon them by the IMF and they have no choice. I felt like saying to him that he has come to the IMF's best friend, he had come to the right place. I do not know where we will find the opportunity of discussing this ever.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes from this country with his retrograde and backward view of the economy and he delivers support for an even more vicious retrograde version of the economy in the IMF, the World Bank and the other international institutions of which we are members. The Minister likes to conduct himself as some kind of folksy commentator on one level in the sense that he is galloping along with the figures and the next minute he gets an old fashioned rush of blood to the head, but then I remind myself that I am not fair, as he has described himself as the happiest right of centre Minister of Finance in Europe, and that he is, but the people are paying the price for that. How else could one find such an old fashioned notion which used to be discussed in the 19th century, the distinction between the effect of direct and indirect taxes on poor classes and poor people?</P>
    <P>Indirect taxes introduced by stealth in this Finance Bill, particularly through changing the basic rate of VAT, fall on those who are most vulnerable in relation to the proportion of their income that they have available to expend. Put in plain terms, it affects people who want to buy bottled gas, briquettes, coal and so forth and who are aware that on the other side there has been a shrinkage in the public provision as a result of which their fuel allowances will not rise. Therefore, people find they are squeezed in every direction. There has been a series of rises in university charges, which are really university fees. There have been increases all around. People with the largest necessity in various areas in terms of their disposal income have no choice but to spend and suddenly they find they are on the receiving end of a plethora of indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>This is somehow or another regarded as new economic thinking, as it is described. There is not anything particularly new about it. Most economic theorists writing now look at the period following Keynes when capitalism was saved from itself by Keynesian interventions and the 40 years which followed that. Then one comes to the 1980s where there is a leap back to the previous century, naked tooth and claw individualism is brought forward and people are told quite clearly that they should not be paying tax to provide for public housing, public health, public space, public parks or anything that is enjoyed in public.</P>
    <P>I note from a EUROSTAT table on social protection that the greatest neglect is in Ireland in comparison to other European countries, particularly the Scandinavian countries. This neglect is in relation to the care of the elderly. An older <Col N="1333" />person moving out of the workforce in Sweden can look forward to a set of state provisions that are automatically taken for granted and provided. People pay tax during their working lives in the knowledge that there is a certain level of social security and social provision. What is happening in our case? In addition to acceptance of the speculative core of the economy which tore the heart out of it, what we are really saying is that those who were gambling did best when the economy was doing best and those who earn and have to spend most of their direct income must pay most in the poorest times when the economy is in a downturn. This leaves aside altogether the sheer economic illiteracy of trying to run an economy, even if one was not any kind of a left progressive or left of centre person, on a simply inflate and deflate basis, which the Minister is trying to do in relation to the overall fiscal policy he is following.</P>
    <P>An ordinary person would ask the Minister how does it make sense that we could lose a &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.5 billion in relation to the stock market in forward provision for pension funds and at the same time be short of capital expenditure for infrastructure that is needed for schools, hospitals, roads and housing? The answer is rather like what I heard the Minister of State say &ndash; what if the stock market goes up again? The most bankrupt of investment advisers associated with the banks who have drawn large sums at scandalous levels for hopeless performances in one form of bond after another tracking different investments suggest that maybe now is the Minister's chance, that he could stay in the market for another five to ten years and buy at a very low level.</P>

It is also extraordinary that when there is such a clear social need, such an enormous gap between what our citizens receive and what citizens may expect in every other country, that the country that boasted of the fastest economic growth in Europe and of becoming one of its richest states ends up at the bottom of the heap in Europe in terms of social protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In good times we went gambling, and when the bad times came, the people who were hammered were those who were poorly provided for already. <Col N="1334" />That is the story of the tricky kind of financial management we are getting. The only thing left to support it is the brazen hussy kind of economics we get from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. Her attitude is that she is brazen enough to say anything she likes and that we must put up with it. At least the Progressive Democrats were never anything else but right-wing people who did not care about anybody but themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Joe Higgins and Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin. The introduction of a Finance Bill gives the Minister for Finance the opportunity in good times to embellish a popular budget, to pull further rabbits out of the hat and to ingratiate himself to a grateful public. In bad times, it offers the Minister the opportunity to counteract any bad feeling that has followed any particularly unpopular measure. In the Finance Bill 2003, the Minister for Finance has done neither of these things. Either the Minister for Finance has become tired, stale and past his sell-by date or the current economic situation in which we find ourselves is a constraint that prevents him from doing anything in his Ministry.</P>
      <P>This is being presented as a Bill containing many reforming measures for which we are meant to be grateful. It contains the closure of many avoidance measures. The question we should be asking the Government, however, is why, in a period of tax freefall, many of these avoidance measures existed at all. Why were they allowed to persist and why were many of them even introduced by this Minister for Finance? A Minister for Finance who claims credit for reversing policies he should never have introduced is a Minister who is scraping the barrel.</P>
      <P>In his speech opening the Second Stage debate, the Minister sought further credit by claiming that 90% of the income of those on the minimum wage is exempt from income tax. Everyone on the minimum wage is still liable for tax on 10% of his or her income. This includes people who earn &euro;223 a week, or £185 in the old currency. The introduction of the new currency has given a psychological advantage to Government in that the &euro;200 figure for minimum weekly earnings has been surpassed. It may be a higher figure but its value has not changed one iota. The Minister is playing tricks with figures and is not dealing with the reality of people's everyday lives. The fact that anyone on a minimum wage is paying income tax is an indictment of this Government, and the fact that no real measure of reform has been introduced either in the budget or the Finance Bill 2003 shows that the Government cares little about this sector of society and is not prepared to offer any incentive towards changing the situation in which these people find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the anti-avoidance measures I spoke of earlier, it is interesting to observe the tightening up that is going on. The Minister is not introducing this series of measures in the interests of reform. This is a Minister who is desperate for <Col N="1335" />any means he can find of achieving additional revenue in the years to come. It is obviously all over for good time Charlie. Every avoidance opportunity in the tax system is being scrutinised and closed if the effects are not too damaging to those who have benefited most from the previous McCreevy budgets.</P>
    <P>I go back to the minimum wage example and the fact that 10% of the income of everyone on a minimum wage is still being taxed. The Minister boasts of bringing that 10% figure down from 36% when the minimum wage &ndash; which is still only £5 per hour in the old currency &ndash; was introduced. The Minister, through his tax policies, however, has produced a greater percentage decrease and a bigger sum of money for those on the highest income level. The Minister seeks to make these types of boasts while ignoring the more obvious boasts he could make but of which he should be ashamed. This is a Minister who is past his sell-by date.</P>
    <P>Many of the avoidance measures related to capital allowance schemes, and we will now see the potential closures of the urban renewal scheme, the park and ride scheme and the student accommodation scheme. These schemes were sometimes introduced without much thought. They were introduced to influence and to benefit a certain sector of the population who were grateful for the money and ran. Many of the buildings constructed were put up without thought, were of poor quality and introduced living arrangements in communities that were not of a proper type or mix. The Minister must take responsibility for introducing taxation measures that have not been of benefit to society.</P>
    <P>Some of these schemes have been contradictory in policy terms. For instance, the park and ride scheme, which continues until the end of 2004, was contiguous with the scheme introduced by the previous Government giving tax incentives for building car parks in city centres. Thus, Government policy was to give tax incentives to build car parks in the middle of urban areas so that people could drive their cars and park them in city centres while, at the same time, giving tax incentives to create park and ride facilities on the outskirts of cities so that people could park their cars and take public transport into city centres. That kind of double-think may be typical of Fianna Fáil Governments but in terms of economic logic it is a nonsense, and the Minister does not deserve credit for bringing an end to these types of schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talked about favouring certain sectors of the population, and he referred in particular to reduced taxation on the elderly. It is true that many elderly people were being taxed unnecessarily, but this measure, along with several other measures the Minister has introduced, takes a broad brush stroke approach that has seen people over 70 getting medical cards and pension entitlements being treated differently, not because of the need of the people involved, but <Col N="1336" />because they pass an arbitrary age level. As a result, people who did not need the benefit and who are quite wealthy have been rewarded by this Government.</P>
    <P>One of the more insulting aspects of this Bill is how it deals with the concern about the nontaxation of certain industries in certain ways, including the bloodstock industry, the greyhound industry and forestry. There may be a case for assisting and benefiting each of those industries, and I have talked to several of their representatives. However, the Minister's approach is to rule out any taxation this year, next year or even the year after that, and to merely request that people involved in these industries submit a statement of earnings. If anything is more calculated to anger ordinary taxpayers who pay without the benefit of such scrutiny of their weekly income, it is that type of activity, that type of kicking into touch, that unwillingness to deal with the tax system in its totality. Many of us will challenge the Government strongly on this issue when we look at the Finance Bill 2003 on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, in a Finance Bill that seeks to close tax loopholes and avoidance measures, the Minister has slipped in a new one while nobody was looking. He has said that capital gains tax exemptions will be applied to sporting bodies and trade unions. This might help some sports clubs and it might even help the new partnership agreement to be passed, but the sole attempt of this exemption is to bring the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; back into play. It is another attempt to use public money in a wanton manner as the Government has done through the special savings scheme, the national pensions fund and the open-ended agreement for residential institutions redress. The Government has shown itself to be one that loosens the purse strings when it wants to, does not care for the consequences and makes other areas of society pay for its indolence and inability to have a proper sense of control.</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeated many of the boasts he made in the past about the effect of the reduction of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. Yet he is telling us that he is only now getting rid of the additional, supposedly ameliorative, measures to help people pay this tax. Why did opportunities exist for people to write off capital gains tax when it was reduced so substantially? The increase that was brought about in a one or two year period was merely an exercise in asset stripping. People with capital are being taxed at less than half the rate of income tax. It is a double standard and can be ill afforded in the times we live in.</P>
    <P>Opportunities in terms of excise have been missed. If the Minister wanted to be thought of as radical from an environmental perspective he could have introduced different levels of excise, or even exemptions from excise, for products such as bio-fuels. The Minister talked about an indication of introducing a carbon tax in the next budget but I will believe it when I see it. If it happens, I suspect he will introduce it in the <Col N="1337" />wrong way. If a carbon tax is introduced &ndash; the Green Party believes it should be &ndash; it will be introduced as an additional tax. The Green Party has argued for years that it should be introduced as a substitute tax in concert with reductions in other taxes. Given the times we live in and the current behaviour of the Minister for Finance I do not believe this is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>There is something of a gimmick in trying to blame the excessive use of alcohol on one product, namely, alcopops. I would not encourage people to use this product. People will not give up consuming excessive levels of alcohol because of the way in which excise is structured, they will just change products. If this is supposed to be part of a co-ordinated holistic campaign the Minister for Finance has worked out with the Minister for Health and Children &ndash; if they are still talking to each other &ndash; it does not seem to work well on paper.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of stamp duties that encourage people to trade down their properties. Mark FitzGerald of Sherry FitzGerald recently proposed that people should be encouraged to move out of the city centre and take to Castlepollard or other points west to free up housing stock. The Green Party does not agree with that. There is, however, an argument for building smaller units within existing urban areas where older people live and encouraging them to move to those units. Restructuring stamp duties can do this. My party will make proposals on this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the days after the budget was delivered the social and family affairs committee met the Combat Poverty Agency. The agency described the budget as &ldquo;<i>slightly distributive</i>&rdquo; in its effect &ndash; the term was italicised to stress the sense of irony. The actual effect for the most poor in our society as opposed to those who have the most was a factor of 0.2%. It was the only budget from this Minister in which that direction was taken. That effect will be eaten up by all the increases that have been made subsequently. The Combat Poverty Agency only measured the effect of the social welfare increases as opposed to the tax reductions. Everything else neutralises the effect of this.</P>
    <P>In the conclusion of his introductory speech on this Bill, the Minister gave a sense of a Finance Bill building on a coherent Government policy that is aiming to achieve certain things. It may be all those things but I believe it will achieve more of the same. It will give more benefits to those who already enjoy advantages in our society. It will create a greater gap in leaving behind those who have always been left behind, who have always been thought less of and have been forgotten about by the Government in successive budgets and Finance Bills.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance previously acknowledged that he read with interest what Sinn Féin had to say in its pre-budget submission about the profiteering of <Col N="1338" />banks and financial institutions and the need to tax them in a real way. I welcome the Minister's interest and attention to the argument I have presented over the past six years. Perhaps it was a nod in our direction when he announced a &euro;100 million per year levy on financial institutions up to 2005. However, my temptation to claim some little credit for this is tempered when I see the pre-tax profit of Allied Irish Banks in 2002 was &euro;1.375 billion. It has taken the shine off this levy somewhat. AIB's profit is the highest recorded of any Irish company and the directors of AIB will not lose a wink of sleep over the Minister's levy. On the contrary, they will have pleasant dreams about how they will benefit from the slashing of corporation tax from 16% to 12.5%.</P>
      <P>In this context, the levy can only be described as cosmetic. It is public relations in what I regard as a futile attempt to address the widespread resentment felt by citizens at the gross profiteering of banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. It does nothing to harness those profits for social benefit. The tax regime implemented by the Minister over six budgets has rewarded the greed of these institutions and culminated in the cut in corporation tax.</P>
      <P>What is the practical result of this policy? It means less money for the repair and building of schools, for people with disabilities, health services and housing. The untaxed portion of these massive profits enriches a privileged minority in our society while our infrastructure suffered and the marginalised stay, as always, on the margins. After six years in the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has no excuse and no one other than himself to blame because he has presided over not only the most inequitable tax regime, but also the most unfair allocation of Government resources. He has also presided over budgetary decisions that have widened the gap between the wealthiest and the weakest&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would you, a Cheann Comhairle, be interested in correcting the interruptions? I am sure if they came from the Opposition benches, you would be quick to claim that the speaker should be allowed to proceed without interruption. Perhaps the same ruling might apply to the Government benches. We might return the courtesy to the Minister of State when he has a chance to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" />The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has stayed firmly on course with tax cuts and kickbacks that have overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy in society and overlooked the low income earners and, worst of all, those on fixed incomes such as pensions and welfare payments. We have a rich business elite who enjoy tax breaks unparalleled anywhere else in the European Union. If that is not enough, they can become tax exiles and expect no penalty.</P>
    <P>The Minister's philosophy is well known and apparently simple: put the money back in people's pockets, keep taxes low and everyone will benefit. However, if one takes a closer look, the approach is far from simple and definitely not what it seems. One quick snapshot of the unequal Ireland the Minister has created is that many of the lowest paid workers are still in the tax net despite years of promises to take them out. One in three PAYE workers pays tax at the top rate of 42%, even though the Minister's target is to have this figure at one in five. However, the real inequality has been uncovered not by the Department of Finance but a Revenue Commissioners survey of the highest earners in society conducted last December which found that one quarter of the highest earners in this jurisdiction pay no tax.</P>
    <P>The other side of the equation is the fact that the State has a low overall tax take as a direct result of the failure to tax wealth. The State's total receipts from tax and social insurance after the budget for 2003 are the lowest in the European Union when measured either in gross domestic product or gross national product terms. This means we have a higher than average EU <i>per capita</i> income but much lower social provision and infrastructure quality. The outcome of the Minister's hard cash in the pocket philosophy is that the community suffers because the Government failed to develop the infrastructure and the social services that benefit us all, especially those who do not have the cushion of wealth. The hard cash in the pocket approach works well on the race course but is no basis for social and economic planning.</P>
    <P>We should not be too hard on the Minister. He has surprised us once or twice. He can make some progressive and just decisions and I instance the Finance Act 2001 as an example. In it he cut mortgage relief for speculators and investors who used the tax break to subsidise housing investment. The purchasing power was raising house prices to such an extent that they were out of the reach of ordinary workers and their families. The Minister rightly acted on the recommendations in the Bacon report on housing and cut this relief.</P>
    <P>However, like the cow that gives the best cream, he kicked the bucket over at the doorstep. In 2001, the first year in almost a decade when house price rises eased and it appeared the endless saga of annual double digit rises had evaporated, the Minister made his plans to reintroduce the relief in the Finance Act 2002. It is no surprise, therefore, that there has been another year <Col N="1340" />of house prices racing well ahead of not just inflation but the wage increases of workers. The annual cost of the tax break to the Exchequer was a mere &euro;50 million. The cost to the households who must pay monopoly money prices for houses is incalculable.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister returned to the housing market with renewed purpose. He needed to cut the fat from Government expenditure, which had swelled by more than 20% as the coalition prepared to face the electorate in the general election. The &euro;50 million lining the pockets of speculators, investors and landlords was safe. Instead, the Minister cut the &euro;40 million allocated as grants for first-time buyers who were to be doubly discriminated against. House prices rise continually. I understand the increase last year was 20%. Now the small sum in the first-time buyer's grant that was an essential part of the deposit for many new house owners has been abolished. These are facts.</P>
    <P>In the 1999-2000 tax year, tax revenue in the Twenty-six Counties topped &euro;30 billion, an impressive sum. However, total tax revenue could have approached &euro;40 billion if it had not been for the &euro;8.5 billion written off that year in tax reliefs and allowances. Most of the reliefs offered lucrative tax breaks to the wealthy. A Revenue Commissioners report last November showed that more than 22,000 people in the Twenty-six Counties earn more than &euro;100,000 annually. It is these earners who escape tax payments through Government avoidance schemes.</P>
    <P>One of the largest write-offs was the &euro;1.629 billion lost in capital allowances. This write-off was initially created to help businesses that invested in plant and equipment but over the years was extended to include airports, hotels, nursing homes, private hospitals, convalescent facilities, student accommodation, third level colleges and the maintenance and repair of significant buildings and gardens, wherever they might be. It is one of the injustices of the tax system that one can avail of tax relief for building a child care facility, but not for the substantial costs borne by many workers who must pay exorbitant child care fees. Other property-related schemes, such as the resort allowance scheme or the double taxation relief cost the State hundreds of millions of euro.</P>
    <P>The system of capital allowances needs to be reviewed. Those that are of no social benefit should be eliminated and that is the bottom line. Many are being used as tax avoidance measures and should be abolished. The Bill merely tinkers with the tax system and brings us no nearer to the creation of an equitable tax regime. That said, I welcome the crackdown on last minute pension top-ups and the exercising of stock options. Work remains to be done on the fair treatment of ordinary workers who have received share options or have partaken in profit sharing schemes as distinct from high-flying speculators. Likewise, the ending of the seaside resorts scheme and other property-based allowances is welcome because <Col N="1341" />they had, in many cases, lived long beyond their sell-by date.</P>
    <P>The failure to deal with the issue of stallion fees is shocking given that it is only this year that those who benefit from the scheme must make returns on their tax exempt income. Did it never occur to the Minister in his frequent visits to the race track and his many appearances in the winner's enclosure &ndash; I am not speaking electorally in this sense &ndash; that none of his friends, either the horse owners or the trainers, had to provide details of their tax-free income? It strikes me as strange and is all the stranger when we consider the Minister, the Department and the Revenue hounds would rather chase to ground the mná tí of our Gaeltacht communities, who open their homes each summer to children from the broadly non-Irish speaking community thereby offering an important educational experience. Shame on the Minister.</P>
    <P>Many of the Minister's proposals can only be described as ill thought out and this may account for the surprise he sometimes expresses when people object. Let us consider for example the proposed abolition of rollover relief and the effect it could have on farmers whose land has been subject to compulsory purchase orders. This is a major issue for people in farming to which I intend to return on Committee Stage. I hope the Minister will address the issues with me in a more dignified manner and with respect. This measure has clearly not been thought through and the Minister needs to think again. It is a serious issue, which I urge the Minister to address on Committee Stage. It is having a devastating effect on landowners adjacent to proposed bypasses and other such infrastructural developments. It is very important to that sector and to many others.</P>
    <P>I intend to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage and I look forward to the opportunity of further engagement with the Minister.</P>

      <P>If I were a speculator, landlord, millionaire stud farm owner, multi-millionaire tax exile or a wealthy backer of the Fianna Fáil Party who regularly appeared in the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway Races, I would congratulate the Minister for Finance on this Finance Bill as a job well done in protecting the interest of my class. However, representing as I do working people and working class communities, there is nothing here for us to celebrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance regards each budget and each Finance Bill he presents as a monument to himself and his right wing ideology. The Finance Bill 2003 is no exception. In implementing the provisions outlined in the budget last December, the Minister is continuing the policy of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Coalition. This is a general policy that calculatedly causes wealth to be transformed to the capitalist class in our society, from waged and salaried workers to the owners of capital, land and property. The Minister for Finance will protest and in <Col N="1342" />his speech he referred to the reductions in PAYE taxes that he has effected in recent years from the penal levels of the past. However the reductions in income taxation are absolutely useless to workers if the money accruing as a result is immediately soaked up by other demands or other agencies. For hundreds of thousands of Irish workers this is exactly what has happened in the economy under the stewardship of the Government for the past six years.</P>
    <P>Let us consider young workers in particular. While their PAYE tax was reduced somewhat, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats did absolutely nothing effective while the price of a home &ndash; a fundamental need for people &ndash; doubled and trebled in many cases. For the half million families and individuals who had to buy a home in that time, concessions on income tax went straight to the housing building speculator, the banks and the building societies. It was enough of a scandal when penal taxation was levied on the ordinary PAYE worker while the multi-millionaires escaped &ndash; which was the regime of the past &ndash; and those taxes went to the State to finance the services of the State and of course an enormous amount went to enrich the international and domestic bankers. However, that the tax concessions go straight to enrich the land speculators, building contractors and developers &ndash; the friends and backers of the Government &ndash; is an absolute outrage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there would be some small consolation for those purchasing a home. At least some day they will have ownership of the home albeit having paid the banks and building societies two or three times the cost of the house in interest. However, there is a substantial and increasing sector of workers who now depend on landlords in the private rented sector. Every penny they gained in tax concessions from the Government went into the maw of the landlord class. Low paid workers may not be able to afford to purchase a home even with the shared ownership schemes and the affordable housing programmes. Tens of thousands of low paid workers, many of them civil servants and other categories are affected in this way. The Government is utterly oblivious to the struggle of such workers to survive.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister for Finance lives in a very plush mansion in County Kildare. The journalist, Frank Connolly, exposed another string of mansions owned by the wealthy backers of Fianna Fáil in last weekend's edition of <i>Ireland on Sunday.</i> Workers in Dublin pay &euro;600 per month for a bedsit that is not much bigger than a dog box. That is at the lower end of the costs. A one bedroom flat begins at around &euro;900 per month and, for a three bedroom house in working class communities, &euro;1,500 per month is a common price. It is therefore obscene to hear the Minister for Finance boast today about the fact that he has reduced the tax burden somewhat on workers in receipt of the minimum wage. It is incredible that workers facing the type of costs of accommodation alone &ndash; let alone all the other price rises <Col N="1343" />and demands &ndash; should be subject to taxation at all. Workers on the minimum wage of &euro;254 per week could pay &euro;150 in accommodation alone.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in the budget debate, I pointed out how this transfer of wealth was systematic, continuous and was also Government policy under the misnamed partnership deals. I gave the figures showing how between 1987 and 2001, the share of national production going to working people in salaries and wages reduced significantly as a percentage, while interest, profits and dividends rose dramatically. In other words, this Government and previous Governments presided over a systematic transfer of national wealth from working people to the privileged minority, the capitalist and landlord classes.</P>
    <P>The Socialist Party has always understood that this is the nature of capitalism, the system under which we live. I was gratified to see an article by Mr. David McWilliams in the most recent edition of <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> for which he writes a column. He also presents &ldquo;Agenda&rdquo; on TV3 and the &ldquo;Morning Show&rdquo; on NewsTalk 106. Mr. McWilliams is neither a revolutionary nor a socialist, but he can be perceptive in analysing economic trends. I will cite the conclusions he has drawn:</P>
    <P>We have seen an unprecedented transfer of wealth, unparalleled in peacetime. The property boom has resulted in the transfer of billions of euro from workers to landlords.</P>
    <P>Historically, it would take a war and the consequent forced expropriation of assets to result in such a transparent and blatant movement of wealth from the majority to the minority. Yet this is precisely what we have seen in Ireland..</P>
    <P>All discussions on the economy, pay, income, immigration, tax and so on should be seen in light of the land-inspired transfer of wealth. The property boom has acted like an extraordinarily regressive tax, imposed on the working population of Ireland by the state to the benefit of a small, powerful class of landlords..  [I would add house builders and speculators]</P>
    <P>I am not contending that this was absolutely intentional or pre-planned, but that is the outcome. Rising land prices have indebted the productive sector of the society and enriched a modern class of unproductive drones who live off exorbitant rent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and undoubtedly the Government spokespersons who wait in line to speak on the Bill will be silent on these issues if possible. This is the reality for working people in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>The tax concessions of recent years must be set against not only the surge in accommodation prices, but also the whole range of increases in charges for various services for ordinary people, including RTE, VAT, ESB and excise on those unfortunately addicted to nicotine. The bin tax, <Col N="1344" />also called household refuse charges, is rapidly becoming a parallel tier of local taxation. It costs &euro;350 to &euro;400 a year and Sligo Corporation could charge &euro;520 for it this year. The Minister for Finance also wants the return of water tax and a local income tax has been mooted. It is clear the Government is in the process of setting up a parallel tier of taxation levied locally so that Ministers for Finance can preen themselves on budget day, pretending to be doing the devil and all for the PAYE worker while, at the same time, imposing the dirty work of raising money locally for crucial services on local authorities and other local agencies.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have had massive tax concessions for big business. It is incredible that the effect of reductions in corporation tax and employers' PRSI in the last two budgets alone will, according to the figures we were given, return just under &euro;1 billion this year to the corporate sector. This comes at a time when it has never been more profitable. The current Finance Bill continues this approach and is full of provisions to suit various wealthy interests.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for the reduction of the annual rate of write-off for capital expenditure incurred on hotel buildings. Originally the Minister planned to introduce this measure immediately. Now, however, he has introduced transitional arrangements which provide that these changes will not apply to such capital expenditure incurred by 31 December 2004 if a full and valid planning application is received by the planning authority by the end of May. Which special interests, developers and Fianna Fáil Party supporters approached the Minister and asked for a further six months to allow them to get planning permission for projects they had in the pipeline and thus avail of the tax break? The Minister, of course, obliged. Who approached him and who is being facilitated by this measure? It contrasts with the approach taken to first-time house buyers who watched as the grant they desperately needed was scrapped and the pleading of the majority in society to change the provision was not entertained.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues to favour the super wealthy in our society. The stallions continue to sleep peacefully in Kildare by night as they need not worry that their owners will tear their hair out over large tax bills and rock stars in their mansions do not have to worry about making tax returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to make a contribution on the Finance Bill 2003. Deputy Ó Caoláin stated that capital allowances need to be reviewed and the tax avoidance measures therein should be addressed. I agree with him.</P>
      <P>Section 24 extends the expiry date for the urban renewal scheme until 30 June, provided 15% of the total project costs have been expended. A number of projects in integrated area plan areas, such as the Liberties, the Coombe and Inchicore, could be commenced before 20 June. I ask all the principals involved to proceed to do the necessary work in order that these areas are improved and brought up to a standard we all want.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that section 25 provides that the areas which can be designated for urban renewal relief will now include the refurbishment of the facades of certain buildings. This will help O'Connell Street in particular, as well as other Dublin streets and streetscapes in the major cities. In addition, the relief will apply to the owners of the buildings, not speculators and high income tax earners.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton appropriately raised the study by the Revenue Commissioners on the effect of tax rates on high earning individuals. The number of high earning individuals paying very little tax is not right. Of the top 400 earners, 117 individuals had an effective tax rate of less than 30%. An examination of their tax returns found that the losses generated from multi-storey car parks, hotels and miscellaneous property for this group of 117 people amounted to &euro;68,243,068. That is nearly &euro;1 million in income per earner on which they pay less than 30% tax. Some 51 of the top 400 earners paid less than 5% tax. That is not sustainable. Those 117 individual earners also got relief on their heritage homes of &euro;4,105,355 and whatever the tax relief, they got it from a position of comfort. The ordinary people of Ireland will not accept that in the future.</P>
      <P>Tax schemes are devised by taxation specialists and a number of taxation specialists are former inspectors of taxes. If inspectors of taxes, particularly those involved in strategy and policy, go into the private sector, there should be a three year moratorium on getting involved in tax avoidance schemes or developing various taxation systems for the private sector. The gamekeeper turned poacher scenario is not helping the current situation.</P>
      <P>Under section 39, capital gains tax is now payable much earlier than was previously the case. There are many shareholders in the country, many of whom did not do well from Eircom.</P>

      <P>A number of insurance companies went private. Anybody who had over £100 in the Irish Permanent Building Society got 300 shares. <Col N="1346" />A large number of Irish residents who have shares are now in the position where they will have to pay capital gains tax if they decide to sell those shares. Previously they would have, on average, up to 18 months to pay the tax but they now have to pay it within three to six months. On that basis they will probably hold on to the money to pay the tax whereas previously they would have spent it all. That is a welcome measure in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 61, which deals with capital gains tax, refers to indexation on the cost of assets. There has been much confusion about this in that people were of the view that if an asset is sold after 31 December 2003, no indexation will accrue on it but it should be advertised that there is an indexation table available which is equivalent to the indexation that would accrue up to the end of December 2003. In terms of an item acquired in 1974, therefore, which I understand was the year capital gains tax was introduced, indexation of five or six times the actual cost for a sale in 2004 will accrue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal whereby roll-over relief is no longer allowed in relation to capital gains tax. The proposal does not apply to sports clubs, which will continue to benefit from roll-over relief. As Deputy Boyle said, this measure appears to benefit the provision of a stadium. I hope a stadium will result and that this measure will help in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that in the case of people who sell pubs, large blocks of apartments or buildings for millions of euro, the tax is paid at the time of those transactions and not later.</P>

In the past, on the death of a person who worked in a business for 20 to 30 years and developed it to the extent that it is worth, say, &euro;500,000, the widow was not allowed to get an exemption for the first &euro;500,000 but under this provision, she can have that exemption. Previously only the owner of the business or the shareholders were entitled to it. That is an excellent provision.</P>
      <P>Section 86 gives Revenue officers the power to break into any part of a premises being used for excise related purposes to search for concealed pipes or other equipment which may be used to evade alcohol products tax.

    <P>On the question of vehicle registration tax, measuring engine capacity is a difficult task and regardless of whether an engine has 1,900 or 1,850 cubic centimetres of capacity, Revenue should be careful in that regard.</P>

      <P>No. The provision in section 117 for retaining the records of the VAT life of a property from beginning to end, plus a further six years, is important. In the past records were disposed of after six years and enormous problems arose not only for the owners of properties but for Revenue. It is reasonable, therefore, that somebody who is paying VAT on a property would retain full records of the property.</P>
      <P>Under section 152, the Exchequer will be reimbursed from the small savings reserve fund for amounts transferred to the dormant accounts fund which represent accrued interest on national savings schemes such as savings bonds, savings certificates and instalment savings schemes. I would be interested to know the number of accounts in the different savings schemes, the total individual amounts and the efforts that have been made to contact these people. That is important.</P>
      <P>To go back to the start of the Bill, section 2, I congratulate the Minister for Finance on the way he has looked after senior citizens over recent years. Not only has the old age pension increased significantly but a commitment has been given that by the end of our term in office, the old age pension will be &euro;200 per week. The tax exemption limit is &euro;30,000 for a married couple. In the area I represent, Walkinstown, there are a number of electoral districts in which there is a large proportion of elderly people who are extremely happy with the Government.</P>
      <P>On the question of the application of PAYE and PRSI to benefit in kind from 1 January 2004, we have to be careful that tax avoidance schemes are not established in that regard. One area I suggest we watch is companies setting up car rental companies so that employees would rent the car and be reimbursed rather than owning the car. Regarding short-term hire, car rental companies can write off 40% of the value of a car in the first year. Has this issue been addressed? If a Mercedes is bought new in 2000 for &euro;60,000 and then a second hand 2000 Mercedes is bought for &euro;30,000 three years later, what is the original market value? Is it &euro;30,000, as in the case of the second hand car? Is the value the same for both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repayment of tax was an issue in the Ombudsman's report in November that caused <Col N="1348" />much discussion. The care and management of this matter was given to the Revenue Commissioners according to the legislation and the Ombudsman suggested the Revenue Commissioners were obliged to make repayments of tax, particularly when the Ombudsman directed it. I am delighted this is now being inserted in legislation. There is a four year limit on claims of repayment and interest; will that reduce record keeping from six years to four? The amount of invoices and other records businesses must keep is a huge burden and it would be helpful if it were reduced.</P>
    <P>The budget was a balanced one and will consolidate the growth and advances we have made in the past five years. It has steadied the ship and when the world's economy turns around Ireland will be in a position to benefit from that and to go forward to the advantage of all our citizens.</P>

      <P>This is the most important legislative measure to come before the House each year. The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, is present and he is responsible for the forestry industry. Those involved in that industry have expressed concerns to me regarding the reduced expenditure and funding available for the forestry sector and the Finance Bill indicates possible changes in taxation for that sector. Those working in forestry appreciate the Minister of State's efforts in working alongside them to achieve the planting targets set out some years ago. The Minister of State is confident that a substantial programme will be achieved in 2003.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One group in the forestry sector asked me to express to the Government their concern that the value of forestry to the economy is not given due consideration. The group points out that afforested land is removed from the area of agricultural subsidy and other schemes which eat up much public funding while contributing surplus foods to the marketplace. The forestry sector argues that its contribution to the economy is very important when one considers the reduction in imports and the production of raw material for downstream industries in Ireland. There is also the argument that forests absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide and will go a long way in assisting Ireland to reach its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. The forestry industry states that one hectare of forest fixes 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. If the Government achieves its stated <Col N="1349" />target of 20,000 hectares then our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol would be 24,000 tonnes less per annum, so the industry is keen that the major planting programme continues and that the generous financial incentives be left in place, allowing the industry to grow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ardagh spoke for all of us regarding the need to remove tax anomalies, particularly the loopholes allowing higher earners to dramatically reduce their tax burdens. There have been tax scams in the past and I am glad the Minister for Finance tackled them in the last few Finance Bills; he is also addressing them effectively in the present Bill. Deputy Ardagh also referred to the improved incomes of senior citizens. The Minister referred to section 2 of the Bill, which increases the exemption limits from income tax for persons aged 65 or over to &euro;15,000 if single and &euro;30,000 if married. This represents an increase of over 15% which, when combined with the changes last year, means the limits have increased by over 40% in the last two years. In effect, the Minister is removing large numbers of elderly taxpayers from the tax net through these legislative measures. No Member could quibble with that.</P>
    <P>An Opposition speaker referred earlier to the need for tax relief on child care. The Government is going the right way about this, as did the previous Administration, by substantially increasing child benefit payments in recent years. Deputy O'Donoghue, when Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, introduced the equal opportunity child care programme, which contained both a staffing grant element and a capital element to assist in providing more child care places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is working but it should be expanded, which I suggested to Deputy O'Donoghue, when he was responsible for this area, and also to the current Minister. Assistance must also be given to private child care providers. Such providers in rural areas argue that their margins are very tight if they are to meet the criteria that are rightly laid down by the health boards. There are substantial staffing grants going to community organisations and non-profit groups which are providing child care places but the programme was originally designed to assist those from less advantaged areas. However, as we know, it is not just people from less advantaged homes who are availing of this facility. I welcome the mix of people from different social backgrounds in the same child care facilities but in many rural areas undue pressure is put on private child care providers to offer the level of care needed at a cost parents can afford. This area should be revisited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is not present but he referred to the cost of housing, both to rent and to purchase, with particular reference to Dublin. Those of us from rural areas have argued for the decen<Col N="1350" />tralisation of Government services to the regions. I hope Deputies representing the greater Dublin area who continually complain about traffic gridlock and the pressure on housing will support the efforts of rural Members.</P>
    <P>I have always argued, irrespective of the make up of the Government, that there should be more decentralisation. Public private partnerships offer the Government the opportunity to provide facilities in provincial areas. The substantial programme of decentralisation initiated by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 could not have been undertaken without provision of Government offices by the private sector. With the improved public finances, the Government was able to buy those offices back. They were provided on a lease-back basis enabling decentralisation that would not have taken place if we had been waiting for Government financing.</P>
    <P>We have made substantial economic progress. The best way to measure that is the number of people in work now in comparison with ten years ago. There is, however, an economic imbalance between the east and the north-west and Border regions. There is much to be done to ensure the BMW region achieves the necessary economic development. We must expedite the infrastructural programmes under way. The Government is providing substantial funding through the National Roads Authority for the upgrading of the N2 and N3. I argued along with Senator Diarmuid Wilson with the Minister for Transport that routes that service parts of the country where there is no rail network should be given priority in the provision of new roads. I am not taking away from the need to upgrade the N4, N5 or N6 but all of those have rail services that are unavailable to those using the N2 and N3. The N2 and N3 should be given greater priority because those routes are the only way to transport people and goods to Derry, Monaghan, Donegal, Cavan and Fermanagh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to attract the inward investment we need to generate employment in the Border area, the necessary infrastructure must be put in place. The former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy <Col N="1351" />Noel Dempsey, made exceptional progress in the upgrading of water and sewerage schemes. If we are to reduce pressure on housing stock we should avail of the newly serviced land in towns and villages in rural areas. An Taisce, which is unfortunately in receipt of State funding, is now objecting to housing developments in rural towns and villages. It argued in the past that it only opposed single dwelling houses in rural areas. That organisation now objects to housing schemes in villages and towns, a ludicrous situation. Unfortunately, in some instances An Bord Pleanála has made decisions that are contrary to proper planning and development and to the Government's policy of developing rural areas and ensuring a better spread of population.</P>
      <P>Public private partnerships present an opportunity to undertake a major programme of infrastructural development. The national pensions reserve fund contains exceptional amounts of money put away to meet the future pension needs of the State. However, there should be a mechanism in place whereby some of those funds can be invested in the provision of schools or roads and not in building up the asset base of other countries. It cannot be beyond the ability of those in the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency to ensure that those funds are available to Government and private developers to build up the asset base of the State. Every day that we are waiting for a new road, scheme or school, we are losing the use of that asset.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has indicated that he is anxious to provide new school facilities through public private partnerships. I welcome his decision to initiate a pilot scheme devolving decisions to local boards of management. That will speed up projects and we will not have to continue with the present farcical situation where projects pass to and fro between boards of management, consultants, architects and back to the Department. Some professions want to retain that system because there are fees of 11% but I would like to see those fees going into the provision of facilities.</P>

Deputy Brendan Smith will doubtless send the section of his speech on forestry to interested groups and say how he raised the matter in the Dáil. He pointed out that the Minister of State in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, is not providing enough funding for forestry this year and hopes more will be done. He will not include in the letter to those groups that when it came to voting on Second Stage of the Finance Bill that put in place the restriction, he voted to reduce forestry in this State. The people who get the letter will say that the Deputy is fighting for them. When the crunch arrives, however, he will sup<Col N="1352" />port the Government. We have heard this time after time.</P>

      <P>Is it any wonder people become somewhat cynical about politics and what politicians do and say? The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is very proud of what he has done in his budgets over the past six years. However, it should be remembered that he inherited a very sound economy when he took over as Minister for Finance. The Celtic tiger era has been hailed as a great achievement. The reality is that the Celtic tiger has been pursued, harried and wounded by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who chased the unfortunate animal at every opportunity until he eventually cornered and slaughtered it. He did this by allowing public expenditure to grow grossly out of proportion. In the past two years, public expenditure has grown by 40%.</P>
      <P>The Minister has allowed a savings scheme to rob the economy. No doubt, all us have availed of it &ndash; we would be very foolish not to do so &ndash; but it is costing the taxpayers &euro;500 million per year to service that scheme. Some of that money is being borrowed to give people like me a 25% return on savings. Is that not a mad scheme? Money is being borrowed to go into the pensions fund. As Deputy Brendan Smith said, that pension fund should be used for investment in this country's infrastructure. However, the Government will not use it for infrastructure in our own country but will give it to others for investment elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the last election, the Fine Gael party advocated the use of the pension fund for infrastructure investment but, of course, the Government did not accept that. At that time, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, issued letters stating that no significant overruns were projected and no cutbacks whatever were planned, secretly or otherwise. Since then, there has been an increase of 26% in the cost of hospital casualty services &ndash; that is if the Minister allows the hospital to remain in operation. Deputy Brendan Smith will be conscious of that issue in his area. There have been increases in VHI charges and ESB charges, college fees have increased by 69% and the drugs refund scheme has also suffered. The list of issues on which the Minister has reneged is endless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although he claims to be a reforming Minister, he has not implemented reform. There are many basic problems and anomalies in the taxation system. Let us take the example of two families living next door to each other in Westmeath, Cavan, Wicklow or wherever. Each family has three children and an income of, say, &euro;15,000 per annum. That is not a great deal of money by any standard. Let us suppose one householder is self-employed <Col N="1353" />in running the local post office and the other is a PAYE worker. The latter, by virtue of being a PAYE worker, will get a top-up of about &euro;80 per week from the Government to help that family survive. That is excellent and I applaud it. However, in the case of the family next door, on the same income as verified by the Revenue Commissioners, there is no top-up of &euro;80 per week to support them. Is it fair that they should be excluded from that scheme because they are self-employed? I say it is not.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy Mary Wallace is in the House today. In a previous incarnation, she participated in a committee in which I was also involved and was very much in favour of allowing the self-employed to benefit from FIS &ndash; family income supplement. Regrettably, nothing has happened in that regard during the intervening period and self employed people are still excluded despite the fact that their incomes are verified by the Revenue Commissioners. I hope Deputy Wallace still adheres to the same view of this matter and that, when it is put to the test in a vote in the House, she will not abandon the principles she supported in the past.</P>
    <P>Higher education grants are also subject to a two-tier system when income returns are submitted to the local authorities for assessment in that regard. A PAYE worker with an income of, say, &euro;20,000 per annum will submit a P60 for verification. Let us compare that with the treatment of a self employed person, such as a taxi driver. In that case, the local authority will demand the production of full tax returns and will insist that, since the taxi is leased, the relief allowed by Revenue in that respect must be added back to the net income figure. In other words, the local authority will not accept the income figure as determined by the Revenue Commissioners but will argue that the applicant has a higher income. Is it fair that, although two families have the same level of declared income, one will qualify for the higher education grant and the other will not? What has the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, done about that situation? Absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister has embarked on a system of individualisation of the tax code. In this case, let us compare the position of two fairly well-off families living next door to each other in County Wicklow, each earning &euro;56,000 and with no dependent children. The family with just one income will pay a net tax of &euro;11,600 if they are self employed or &euro;12,340 under PAYE. Their next door neighbours, with the same total income from two people at work, will only pay &euro;6,840 in tax. In other words, the single income family is being penalised to the extent of &euro;5,500 if they are self employed or &euro;4,840 if they are in the PAYE system. Does the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, wish to be remembered as the Minister who introduced such inequality to the Irish taxation code? Are Deputies on the Government side of the House content with that situation? They will support it by going through the lobbies when the <Col N="1354" />time comes. Are they happy that that is how the situation should be?</P>
    <P>In this budget, the Minister abolished new house grants. I have seen mean moves but that is one of the meanest. I never cease to wonder at the degree of stupidity or brass neck, as the case may be, of certain people. Members of this House have defended at public meetings the abolition of the new house grant and have said that what has been put in place is better than what was there already. I will outline some figures. The new house grant stood at &euro;3,800, paid up front. The system which has now been put in place provides for tax relief on &euro;3,300 per annum, spread over seven years. As one who was always fairly good at sums, I calculate that the tax relief on &euro;3,300 over seven years amounts to &euro;2,310. How can anybody claim that &euro;2,310, spread over seven years, is as good as a system which gave &euro;3,800 up front?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return to a couple of issues raised by my constituency colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, and use the opportunity to support him in this House on those issues. As the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will be aware, the cut in forestry grants is having a serious effect on those who want to get out of ordinary farming and make use of their land for profit. When one considers that in 1995-96, at a time when there was not as much money available, there were 26,000 hectares being planted and this has fallen to less than 16,000 hectares, it gives some idea of how the Celtic tiger has been passing away slowly but surely. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, wishes he would get the money to make sure that those who want to utilise their land for planting would get the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support those who highlight the need for proper roads infrastructure in the Border regions. Deputy Brendan Smith stated clearly that there is a need for moneys towards the N2 and N3. I am proud that even at this late stage there has been a reasonable injection of funds towards the N3. I hope it will be the first of a number of years where realistic funding will be made available which will bring that up to a proper standard, however I was disappointed that significant funds <Col N="1355" />were not made available for the N3. While a good job was done near Cavan town with the bypass, a small sum of money would allow for the through road towards Longford, which is a major handicap at present.</P>
    <P>We all heard the Minister trumpeting about the great job he did with the budget and the moneys made available to the different sectors. When you look at the health budget of &euro;9.2 million, for instance, one must say that is a lot of taxpayers' money. It is not the Government's money, it is the recycling of money of which the Minister has control. Yesterday I listened to Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin spelling out the problems with home care and home help in Kerry. I did the same last week regarding the position in Cavan-Monaghan. What saddened me most was that one of the cases I raised in this House was visited by a health board official who advised the family that if they had written a quiet letter to the health board the problem would have been solved, that they went the wrong way about it by going to a politician. You would think that this was only an incidental matter, yet the district nurses in the system are being ordered by the health board to cut 28,000 hours from the home care system in 2003. If anyone says that is not a cutback affecting the people at the lowest level of the spectrum, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>I appreciate one small bit of good news in the Bill for young farmers, that the stock relief is granted, but there is very little else. While my colleague, Deputy Timmins, will deal with the agriculture area in more detail, there is a major problem in the cutbacks in that overall structure. On top of that, last year there was an agreement between the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and none other than the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, when he was leader of the IFA. Mr. Parlon trumpeted the great deal he had got, an increase in prices for land under CPO, the road building to which I referred and the roll-over opportunity for those who needed to purchase other land or whatever else they wanted to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister came into this House only a few months later and completely ignored the fact that a deal had been written in stone with the farm organisations and property owners, and did away with that roll-over tax relief. At this late stage I beg the Minister, if he wants to bring the farmers and other people into the national agreement, to honour that commitment and let justice be done. People do not give up land for road building for the sake of the country. They give it up because it is being taken from them under compulsory purchase order. It is not only landowners who are affected, it is property owners in my constituency in Carrickmacross, Monaghan town and Castleblayney. These people were given promises. I hope this can be solved before those promised projects are held back by some protest. I certainly hope that will not happen and I plead with the Minister to have common sense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" />This matter affected not only the farmers. I received an interesting, but very difficult, letter from one of my constituents. In it he spells out how he built up a retail business down through the years. He took over a site in one of our larger towns and built a brand new structure to centralise his business and give a better service to the public. He is an Irishman. He is competing against those from outside this country who come in on a greenfield site and get all possible help and encouragement to build shops and supermarkets. To finance the project, this man will sell off existing property, draw down savings and borrow money from the bank. That was agreed last year. It took him a number of years to get the project through planning.</P>
    <P>Now he finds that the Minister for Finance, in one fell swoop in this House, has cut the ground from under him. His letter states, in bold type, that in such circumstances he now finds that he has a substantial capital gains tax liability without the funds to discharge that liability. This man employs 50 people and intends to employ another 30. He has specifically asked me, as one of his local Deputies, to raise this in the Dáil. He has political affiliations &ndash; that is no secret &ndash; but he has found himself on the wrong side of the car this time.</P>
    <P>There is one other issue I will raise, although I would like to have the time to raise more. As one of the stealth issues in the budget, the Government removed subsidies of &euro;45,000 in the meat and bonemeal area and I want to make a couple of short comments in that regard. Two thirds of the poultry of Ireland is produced in my constituency. As a result of this measure, imported poultry product will gain a stronger foothold in the Irish market. Product produced in the EU is still subsidised, creating an uneven playing field for Irish poultry. The withdrawal of the subsidy will result in an increase of 5% in the price of Irish poultry product and it will result in increased costs of &euro;8 million to the industry. The large retail multiples, who currently support Irish poultry products, could be forced to import products, given the significant price differential. Some 1,500 people are employed directly and 3,000 indirectly.</P>
    <P>This industry has been put at risk by a Government which is taking money out of the system through the back door. If that had been done in an organised fashion rather than with a hatchet, there might have been some hope for the industry. That is what has happened to the poultry industry. The same has happened to the pig industry and the beef industry as a result of the withdrawal of funds, which was not mentioned in the budget, the Book of Estimates or anywhere else. This Finance Bill, budget and Book of Estimates will be remembered long after the Government is forgotten.</P>

Over the last number of years I have sat here and watched <Col N="1357" />those on the Government benches, every budget day, clap their hands in glee at all the goodies that were being given out. Some day the history of the past few years will be written. The Government has spent money like a drunk at a wedding. Perhaps we will some day establish where it went, because no one really knows.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry a question last week. I notice that he took on 600 extra employees between 1997 and 2003 &ndash; an inordinate amount for a Department which deals with falling farm numbers, according to the Minister, where red tape is being cut back and the systems are being made more useful. I must table a question to the other Departments because I am sure the figures will be even more frightening. This must have helped the Government by contributing to the rise in the number of people employed.</P>
      <P>It is a fact of life that Irish people do not like paying tax. No constituent of mine likes doing so. Maybe we still have a colonial hangover and think our taxes are going to the king or queen and that we are pulling the wool over the eyes of the imperial power by not paying. More pertinently nowadays, we may feel we do not all pay our share. If people felt they were being treated fairly, they would willingly pay their share, but we are always looking over our shoulders at people who are not paying what we think they should be. From one point of view, I welcome the fact that the Minister has set out to close off the loopholes used by some very wealthy people. I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is gone because I know he was not fond of the Progressive Democrats in times past. Perhaps he is singing from the right hymn sheet now; I did not hear him say anything about it during this campaign. Maybe he got his just deserts, or experienced a Pauline conversion. The Minister for Finance talks about bringing the standard rate of tax down to 20%, the higher rate to 40% and capital gains tax to 20%. That is fair enough, but he should acknowledge the stealth taxes that were brought in to compensate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Crawford, covered most of the topics I intended to discuss in relation to agriculture, but he did leave some scope for me. Rollover relief does not only pertain to agriculture. I acknowledge that it is good to close off loopholes, but this relief could have been used to reinvest in industry or property. It is inherently unfair that somebody who unwillingly disposes of a capital asset in the common good, to assist an infrastructural project, should have to pay tax on it. Everybody would agree that this is most unfair. In addition, with regard to business in general, it is a difficult change. I am aware, for example, of a factory that recently relocated from Dublin to County Wicklow. The owner is in the process of selling his premises with a view to reinvesting in Wicklow and he will also suffer. It can be seen that it is not only the farmers who suffer, although it is particularly difficult for them because they do not willingly enter into the trans<Col N="1358" />action. Fine Gael will be opposing this section of the Bill on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge some of the measures introduced by the Minister. He extended stock relief for farmers, which was not flagged during the budget but appeared in this Bill. However, as a result of the floundering and the waste of money over the last number of years, certain measures have been imposed upon the agricultural community that should not have been. I mentioned the 600 additional staff in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. I recently looked at the report of the three wise men, in which four or five recommendations were made, such as doubling disease levies, testing for BSE and pulling back from subsidising the disposal of meat and bone meal. All of these recommendations have been carried out. Why do we need the Department of Agriculture and Food? Why did we not just hire these three wise men? Whatever they decided to do was implemented.</P>
    <P>One of the groups that will suffer is Teagasc, which met today to examine the possibility of closing 20 centres around the country. It has delayed its decision, but I think it is terrible that an area involved in research and development should suffer as a result of Government cutbacks. Farm incomes are down by 8.5% and there is a lot of despondency out there. Farm groups have not gone into the partnership because, as Deputy Ellis knows, they see nothing for themselves therein. Last week the Minister said there was a package of &euro;300 million for the area. In a 16 or 17 page document, he is the only one who actually sees that. I do not expect the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, to know the details of that, although I know he has an interest in agricultural issues, but I would like the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, if he gets the opportunity, to explain.</P>
    <P>Housing is about supply and demand. I am totally in favour of zoning as much land as possible in an area as long as a time limit and population limit are implemented. If we are afraid to zone land because of the tribunals, we are abdicating our responsibilities. If we were to follow the planners blindly, house prices would be far greater than they are. I am not condoning some of the zoning decisions that were made, but I would never be afraid to propose a rezoning against the advice of the planners if I thought it was for the common good. We must zone more land than we need, because if there is a limited amount held by a small group of people they will not release the land until it suits them. They can operate a cartel.</P>
    <P>I take the opposite view to Deputy McGrath on the first-time buyer's grant. I have always felt it was a bit of a gimmick. If it was index-linked it would be around &euro;14,000 or &euro;15,000. We call it a first-time buyer's grant, but it only went to about a third of first-time buyers because two thirds of them bought second-hand houses. I stated here during the Estimates that I did not disagree with the Minister. I thought it was a good idea to abolish the grant if it was compensated for with mort<Col N="1359" />gage interest relief. However, he did not do that. He increased it a bit and extended it from five to seven years. What he should do is front-load the relief. Instead of having it extend over 20 years or the lifetime of the mortgage, he should put it all into the first ten years of the mortgage. I am at the ten-year stage: I do not know what I get in mortgage interest relief every year, but it might be &euro;600 or &euro;700. It is not important to me or to other people who have had a mortgage for ten years or more. It would be more beneficial to people to receive it during the first five or six years, which is the difficult time. I ask the Minister to investigate this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has extended the town renewal scheme until 2004. This excellent scheme applies to towns with a population between 500 and 6,000. There are five or six towns in most counties, except the upper Shannon region. The one regret I have is that many people who have properties eligible for the scheme are not aware of this. I ask the Department of Finance, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities, to go on an educational tour, informing people that their properties are eligible. The more innovative people in these areas are having the scheme put in place but as time goes on it will be too late for people to obtain maximum benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is specifically responsible for tax relief on cars for people with disabilities. There is a review group sitting on this at the moment. One of the conditions for this relief is that the applicant does not have the use of a limb. I have come across a person who was severely handicapped with Down's syndrome and was not allowed to participate. This is something the Minister should investigate. The N81, a secondary route, is probably one of the busiest roads in the country, yet it is the most dangerous and in the poorest condition. The national development plan states that it is to be upgraded from Blessington to Tallaght, but there is no funding for major works on it. It is in terrible condition. I regret I have so little time to speak on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ellis and Mary Wallace.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a responsible and balanced response to the current economic situation, as was the budget that preceded it. We need to look carefully at the significance of the income tax burden. It has been reduced from 28% to 17% of income for a single person on the average industrial wage. That is a substantial reduction. It has an enormous impact on the amount of money directly available to somebody in employment at that level. Deputy McCreevy has made it clear since he took office that one of his objectives was to reward those who are working. That has been to the benefit of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another part to the equation. The reduced taxation burden has enabled employers <Col N="1360" />to be more competitive and, thereby, to maintain employment. We need to bear in mind, particularly at present, that a number of employers, in some cases significant employers, are just about surviving. The significance of these elements of taxation is substantial and makes a major contribution to maintaining maximum numbers in employment. When the minimum wage was introduced in October 2000, 64% of people on that wage were exempt from tax. By the budget in 2002, that had increased to 90%. Despite the difficulties in the interim, and there have been many, the Minister ensured in the budget that the 90% level was maintained. That happened despite the fact that last October there was a substantial increase in the minimum wage to &euro;6.35 per hour. Of all the areas that come within the remit of the budget and finance legislation, this is the one that is most significant and far reaching. I commend the Minister for the progress he has made in this area.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that some Deputies continue to begrudge the benefits extended to older people. The Green Party spokesman today attacked the additional benefits made available to people aged 70 years and over. This is difficult to comprehend with regard to people who have made a lifetime contribution to the country in economic, social and other important terms. It is extremely small minded.</P>
    <P>I query the Minister about income tax on shares, a matter I have raised with him on a number of occasions. It is dealt with under section 8 but I am not sure what the effect of the provision will be. There are some people, many of them elderly, whose only income is from the sale of shares or dividends paid on shares. Many of them sold farms or businesses to go into retirement and they depend on this source of income. In many cases, and I am familiar with some, it debars these people from qualifying for the old age non-contributory pension. It becomes, in fact, their only source of income.</P>
    <P>Until recently, income tax relief did not apply to income from shares, even where that is the only income. That is a double burden on elderly people because apart from debarring them from getting the old age pension it is also a heavy tax burden. A number of exemptions are outlined in section 2. The exemptions in that section for elderly people are generous, relative to the provisions for other members of the population. However, I am not clear if they apply to the cases I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I welcome the anti-avoidance measures. They send the right message. The Minister has always acted swiftly when he has become aware of avoidance measures and, on this occasion, he has introduced more new provisions. I also welcome the changes introduced in section 15, which ensure that BES and seed capital schemes apply as intended. There were some fears that the schemes might be discontinued. That would have been a retrograde step and I welcome the introduction <Col N="1361" />of provisions which allow the schemes to continue and ensure that they are utilised as intended.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the repayment of tax overpayments if they are claimed within four years. I have a quibble with the time scale. I am aware that it arises in part from the Ombudsman's report on interest on overpaid tax and it is a first step in the right direction but it will need to be revisited in the future. I also welcome the changes in the arrangements announced in the budget for the write off of capital expenditure incurred on hotel buildings. This will allow people who had entered into contracts or who were at an advanced stage of planning to proceed with their projects. I am familiar with some of these cases and I raised them with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 24 allow for the expiry of certain tax incentive schemes. I had great hopes for the town renewal scheme and I was disappointed with the uptake and many elements of that scheme as it operated in County Clare. I always believed Lisdoonvarna would have been the most suitable town. I made that judgment partly on the basis of the relative success of the resort scheme. That scheme has been subject to an enormous amount of unfair criticism but it worked extraordinarily well in providing additional accommodation, both hotel and self catering, in resorts. Unfortunately, the town renewal scheme did not have the same success. It is difficult to know why, but I am glad that although the Minister believes the appropriate move is to remove some of these incentives, he has also indicated that he has not closed his mind entirely to incentive schemes. I particularly welcome his mention of research and development, an area which has an enormous impact on the quality of jobs which might be available in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides for exchange of tax information and is connected with international criminal justice measures. That is to be lauded. I hope the undertaking to OECD from certain countries which have been regarded as tax havens will be acted on quickly. There is also provision for the National Development Finance Agency to get exemptions from tax in the performance of its statutory functions. This agency has the potential to have an enormous impact on the development of infrastructure here. In the aftermath of the publication of the national spatial strategy, I look forward to this agency playing an active role in ensuring the roll out of infrastructure. Naturally, I am anxious to see it happen in my constituency but I welcome the fact that the strategy points to the importance of the Galway-Shannon-Limerick-Cork axis and route. I hope the Ennis bypass and other projects in that area will qualify for funding from the agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also indicated his support for the international financial services industry in Ireland, particularly for investment fund management. We have been doing well in fund administration but there is a huge area of management and international services in which we have <Col N="1362" />become involved to some extent, but to a much lesser extent than is possible. The Minister's indication of his commitment to this is welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 68 adds sporting bodies to those exempt from capital gains tax. Deputy Boyle found fault with this. I welcome it. I made strong representations to the Minister about this issue. It will substantially benefit the GAA in County Clare in terms of investment over the next few years and I thank the Minister for taking my views on board.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Government's commitment to public private partnerships. A huge number of schools, including Ennis national school and other schools in my constituency, are awaiting announcements. I understand there are difficulties arising from the EUROSTAT definitions and provisions in this regard. What progress has been made in this area? We need clarification and movement on these schemes in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The extension of the existing stock relief scheme for farmers in sections 18 and 19 is welcome, as is the section 132 provision for stamp duty relief for farmers. Forestry has been mentioned. We have obligations under the Kyoto agreement, among others, and this issue will have to be revisited. I particularly welcome the provisions of section 136 which provide for a contribution from the financial sector, in view of the wonderful results for AIB shareholders announced today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>In my early days in this House, we had problems with the State finances. Since Deputy McCreevy became Minister for Finance, he has continued the work begun by one of his predecessors, former Deputy Ray MacSharry. When he came into office in 1987, the national debt had doubled during the lifetime of the previous coalition Government. He set about trying to remedy the situation and we now have balanced budgets.</P>
      <P>While we might all like to see further expansion in expenditure, we must also realise that it must be kept under control. In doing so, we must also be careful that we do not hurt the weaker sections of society and that has been the approach taken in this Finance Bill. In the tax changes, the Minister has addressed the most vulnerable groups, namely, those on low incomes and pensioners. The Minister has singled out these groups for extra assistance. Some 90% of people on the minimum wage will now be tax exempt, a measure we all welcome. The changes in the income levels for persons aged 65 and over is also to be welcomed because these people made a tremendous contribution to our country. They have worked all their lives and, in many cases, have paid substantial amounts into pension funds to supplement their social welfare pensions. It is only fair they should be rewarded for having done so because the money they have paid in will have been used in the development of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Timmins's point on mortgage interest relief because, in many cases, the <Col N="1363" />first-time buyer's grant had surpassed its usefulness by not having changed for some years. Instead, extra mortgage interest relief has been given which will be more beneficial to recipients than the grant because the number of applicants for the grant had dwindled significantly because many houses were outside grant size. The number of applicants in each county was far more limited than we dreamed of. I was shocked to see the figures for my own constituency &ndash; remarkably few applicants qualified because of the house size.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is the source of the funding for many of the capital projects we want to see put in place. I welcome the &euro;200 million spend on broadband which will help to bring more rural areas into the economic loop at a much higher level. At the risk of being parochial, two towns in my locality &ndash; Carrick-on-Shannon and Manorhamilton &ndash; have been included on the broadband network. It is a positive move and one which shows that the Government wants to have balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation must be rolled out because it will free up Dublin traffic and homes. In many cases, civil servants will find they can sell their homes in Dublin, pay off their mortgage and buy a house in a rural town that will leave them with money which they can use to educate their children. They will live a healthier, better quality life in a rural town than in Dublin's urban sprawl. The time spent by people travelling even short journeys by car demonstrates the need for further investment in transport systems such as Luas.</P>
    <P>We must look at the roads infrastructure and I am delighted to see that the NRA will this year commence a number of major projects which will help access into and out of the city. The N4 is something Deputy Connaughton and I will welcome, even if it is to be tolled, because of the severe pressure on people who have to drive on the roads. I pity people, especially truck drivers, when I see the problems they face trying to get in and out of Dublin every morning. Every day we see the need for further investment in infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There are a number of towns that could service sections of Departments. Nobody would like to see 1,000 civil servants being sent to one town but, if some 300 or so were dispatched and offered the opportunity of moving to a rural town, we would see major progress. Carrick-on-Shannon ought to be considered because it offers a way of life and opportunities to people that may not be available in other applicant towns.</P>
    <P>I have a different view to other speakers on forestry in that the tax proposed for forestry may encourage ordinary farmers to remain in farming and give them an opportunity to expand. Otherwise pension fund investors and others buy up the land, taking it out of agriculture and preventing farmers becoming viable in the area. This deserves to be re-examined. Pension funds and some of the banks that Deputy Killeen mentioned are investing in forestry but their mainten<Col N="1364" />ance needs to be monitored because, in many cases, trees are planted only to be abandoned in a dilapidated state so they are of no commercial value when they mature. This is an annoying reality of much forestry development.</P>
    <P>Everyone welcomes stock relief. There may be time to look at roll-over relief in the context of compulsory purchase orders, provided that the money is re-invested in the activity of the business of the person concerned. Farming organisations have pushed for this for some time. If someone is to re-invest what he or she has had to accept as compulsory purchase payment in a business, he or she should be allowed to do so. The question of roll-over for other businesses is something that should be looked at. If someone is re-investing money into a project that will create employment, it can be the difference between its being successful or unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>The town renewal scheme is welcome and will do good, although the upper Shannon renewal scheme has probably done more to develop that area than anything done by Government for 50 years. The initiative taken in that project has brought about a new sense of growth and has encouraged people to invest in the area. Therefore, perhaps an extension of the scheme could be examined as most of the area did not have the necessary water or sewerage infrastructure to benefit from it fully. The scheme could be appropriate for other parts of the country where rural development has been stagnant. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has done his best to ensure that we maintained a balanced position. I hope that by the end of this year we might see a change in the world economy which would allow matters to be a little freer next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Ms M. Wallace Ms M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who shared their time with me. Most reasonable people would accept that in the past six years the Government has reduced the income tax burden significantly. There is no doubt that lowering the tax burden has made a major contribution to strong employment growth and to the economy. As the Minister said, the period we now face is one of consolidation, which is important for all of us.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his budget speech the importance of a broad tax base if we are to maintain our low rates of direct taxation, which have been an obvious factor in our economic success. Under this Bill he introduces a number of changes to ensure that tax relief schemes work as they are intended to. These schemes are important and must be properly focused to deliver the desired objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many provisions in the tax code allow different types of income to be exempt from tax. I note the changes in terms of stallion fees, forestry and greyhound and stud fees. The Minister is anxious to ensure that people in these areas make the necessary return of information. These changes are merely about the return of information as dis<Col N="1365" />tinct from taxation. I welcome this especially as there is no change in tax free status in these areas.</P>
    <P>In terms of modernising the tax system, the Minister has a good record of continually examining issues. I welcome the new general provision covering the refund of overpaid taxes and interest on such refunds. Many self-employed people pay their tax in advance and may make an overpayment on their preliminary tax liability as a result of endeavouring to get a tax clearance certificate which they might urgently require for a licence application or for subcontracting. It is to be welcomed that this taxation aspect has been dealt with in a humane fashion. We are frequently reminded of the importance of keeping the tax system under review and modernising it. This Bill yet again underlines that.</P>
    <P>I support the issue raised by Deputy Brendan Smith regarding the N2 and N3. As the Deputy said, in the absence of a rail service to Cavan-Monaghan it is essential to maintain road improvements, especially in the case of the Dunshaughlin bypass on the N3 where people often find they have to queue in traffic for distances of up to two or three miles and in the case of the Ashbourne bypass where motorists experience similar delays. I welcome the &euro;13 million allocated this week to keeping work moving on that project.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the changes in the Bill with regard to sports. Under the Bill, sports bodies will not face capital gains tax bills on the sale of land provided the money stays in the organisation and is used for promoting sports. This is an excellent measure. It will enable groups to retain more money to invest in clubhouses, playing fields, gyms and training grounds, which will give our young people outlets through which to channel their energies.</P>
    <P>Any help from the Government in this area is welcome. Sporting facilities are needed in areas of south County Meath and other areas where there are new housing developments. People who move to a rural area are surprised that unlike the rate base in Dublin where sports facilities can be provided by the local authority, this is not the case in places like south County Meath and north Kildare. Facilities in these areas are provided on a voluntary basis. Clubs have to fundraise to provide facilities and they are highly dependent on any grants or support they get from the Government. I commend the Minister on the measure introduced in this regard and appreciate that there is a national dimension to this in terms of the IRFU and the FAI. This move has been welcomed by Sean McCague from the GAA in terms of its being consistent with the Minister's record of investment in sport. It is a welcome measure at national level and it is also particularly welcome for the thousands of young people who play sport in rural areas, especially in places such as those I mentioned, where there are many new housing estates to which many people have moved form the city and where there are no sports facilities. I strongly underline the import<Col N="1366" />ance of anything the Government can continue to do in regard to sports.</P>
    <P>It is important to take account of the needs of people on lower incomes in the Finance Bill. In last year's budget, 90% of people on the minimum wage were exempt from liability to tax. The minimum wage was set at &euro;6.35 per hour in October 2002 and it is important that the necessary changes are made in this Bill to maintain that level of tax exemption in respect of 90% of people on the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>The budget provided for increases in the exemption limits from income tax for persons aged 65 and over to &euro;15,000 for single people and &euro;30,000 for a married couple. In this Bill, as in the budget, the Minister has sought to work towards his goal of removing large numbers of elderly taxpayers from the tax net which is an important objective.</P>
    <P>I welcome the simplification in the benefit-in-kind taxable charge in respect of cars and vans. It is almost unbelievable that under the current system there are 17 percentages and categories. From next January a simple five rate structure will apply to cars replacing the existing 17 rate system. Many thousands of people paying benefit in kind taxable charge in respect of cars and vans will find that charge reduced as a result of this change.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in respect of share options in the Bill. Some constituents have raised this matter with me in the past. It is incredible that people would be taxed in a case where they have lost money. It is a positive step that under the Bill there is an emphasis on paying tax when one makes a gain. However, it is disastrous when people have to pay tax on a loss in respect of shares, especially when the tax liability is higher than the value of the shares at that time. While people do not like paying tax, nobody likes paying it on a loss. The increase in mortgage tax relief available to first-time buyers is welcome. Some 45,000 first-time buyers will benefit from this scheme.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the changes proposed under sections 24 to 28, inclusive, particularly as they affect the park and ride scheme. We understood that this tax incentive scheme would continue up to 30 June 2004, but under the Bill it is being extended to 31 December 2004. Perhaps it is the Minister's intention to expedite matters in terms of providing such facilities before the incentive scheme expires. If that is the case, that is fine. However, whether through the provision of tax incentive grants or other measures, the Government needs to do a great deal more in terms of the provision of park and ride facilities.</P>
    <P>To prevent people from parking their cars all day in the car parks of shopping centres, urban district councils and shopping centres within a 30 mile radius of Dublin are using a parking disc system to ensure that car parking spaces are kept for customers. The Government encourages people to use the public transport system to commute to <Col N="1367" />work in Dublin, but it is not providing sufficient parking facilities for them to do so.</P>
    <P>On the Dublin side of Navan, cars are parked along the N3 for a long distance. That road is just outside the disc area and fair dues to commuters for finding a free car parking space along the national primary route, but they have done so at their own initiative. More needs to be done to provide for the parking needs of commuters. I am glad to underline that the Minister said that he considered it necessary to keep all tax expenditures and incentives schemes under review. I highly recommend that the park and ride scheme should be kept under review in terms of its effectiveness in making a difference between now and when it is due to expire on 31 December 2004. The Government must also consider what else it can do to encourage people to use public transport rather than sit in their cars, as motorists on the N3 do for two hours travelling to and from work in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I support the point made by Deputy Timmins concerning the disabled drivers and passengers regulations review which was concluded earlier this year. Some action is needed in this area by the Department of Finance. One of the critical difficulties is the primary medical certificate issue in respect of which I wish to highlight two points. There is no difference in the primary medial certificate between an adult and a child and no difference between a driver and a passenger. If there were differences in these areas, it would make matters much simpler. There is also a confined board of appeal with an 18 month waiting list and some incentive needs to given to help expedite matters for all the disabled drivers and passengers who need support around the country. It has been good work in terms of tidying up the various schemes, modernising the system and keeping the show on the road. With the two provisos I raised in regard to park and ride and disabled drivers, I am very supportive of what the Minister is doing in the Finance Bill 2003.</P>

      <P>I shall confine my remarks to two aspects of the Finance Bill, section 115, which deals with the increase in VAT from 12.5% to 13.5%, and section 27, which deals with the town renewal scheme. We read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today that tourism is experiencing a crisis as fear of war impacts upon travel. The article states that the tourism industry is facing its bleakest year for a decade, with holiday bookings from the US slowing to a trickle over the past three weeks. This relates to concerns and fears about a potential war in Iraq. Americans are putting their travel plans on hold. This will have serious repercussions for Ireland because a collapse in the number of American visitors similar to that <Col N="1368" />caused by the last Gulf War would cost shops, hotels and tour operators an estimated &euro;1.4 billion. During the Gulf War, travel from the US fell by 20%, and a repeat of this would reduce the number of US visitors by 180,000, to under 700,000.</P>
      <P>We hear from the likes of the Irish Hotels Federation that US bookings and inquiries for hotels have almost stopped since President Bush's State of the Union address. CIE Tours International, which brings tens of thousands of Americans into Ireland every year, says that there has been a dramatic slowdown in US bookings over the past few weeks. The fall-out from reduced bookings has also hit car hire operators. One operator who had just returned from a roadshow in the US said that the phones had almost stopped ringing. Paul O'Toole, the chief executive of Tourism Ireland, stated that the industry is very concerned because it is trying to operate in a very uncertain environment.</P>
      <P>It is in this context that I refer to section 115 of the Bill. In 1992 and 1993, when there was a similar hike in VAT rates &ndash; from 10% from 12.5% &ndash; businesses that had completed contracts before the budget and had already sent out their promotional literature and so forth were granted a derogation. It is very important that a similar derogation is granted on this occasion. The travel industry, by its very nature, is currently engaged in promoting its product for next year, and most of its promotional material is distributed in April and May. A number of the incoming tour operators, whom this will mostly concern, will be abroad on St. Patrick's Day, alongside Ministers and everybody else, promoting their product.</P>
      <P>The problem is that they cannot go back and increase their charges. The only way they can absorb the VAT increase is by paying for it themselves. As they have, in many cases, already entered into contractual arrangements, they cannot go back to their clients at this stage and say that their costings have now changed. If there is no derogation, this will cost incoming tour operators about &euro;1.5 million. Incoming tour operators are small or medium-sized companies, and many are family-run operations. The only way they can absorb this deficit and survive is by cutting back on marketing for next year or by cutting back on staff levels. It will certainly result in job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to put down an amendment to the Finance Bill 2003 on Committee Stage and I would like the official present to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister. A derogation should be given to contracts that have been agreed upon, as was done in 1993 when the then Minister recognised the problem. It would certainly be welcomed by the tourism industry. There has already been strong lobbying of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism on this issue. The precedent is there, and the Minister would not be extending a derogation to any other sector. It is this sector that is most affected so I appeal to the Minister to look at that very <Col N="1369" />positively. I signal my intention to bring forward an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other issue I wish to raise is the town renewal scheme, dealt with in section 27 of the Bill. The urban renewal scheme is being extended. The date by which 15% of the total project cost must be incurred is being extended by six months, from 31 December 2002 to 30 June 2003. The period for completion of projects has been extended to December 2004. I am sure the same provisions would apply also to the town renewal scheme, and I would like to have that clarified. I call upon the Minister to extend the date whereby 15% of the total cost must be incurred to December. In many cases, particularly in Kerry, there has not been a great take-up of this scheme, mainly because of the absence of an intensive public awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>People did not understand the scheme or the benefits that accrued from it because they were not told about it. There should have been far more public consultation and more public briefings in various towns. The scheme is only now about to take off so I appeal to the Minister, through the Minister of State here and his official, to consider extending the date whereby 15% of the costs must be incurred until the end of December. I see no reason this should not be done. It will not change the scheme dramatically and would be a very welcome provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall first try to put this debate on the Bill into context. This has been the third instalment in a three-part series of financial bad news. The first was the shock of the Estimates in November 2002, which, we were told, made the necessary financial adjustments to Government spending. For everybody else, it spelt cut-back time in a very dramatic way, following all the promises we heard in the build-up to the May 2002 election. Then we had the budget, which confirmed the cut-backs and outlined how the Government intended to make ordinary people pay for its financial mismanagement by taxing and increasing costs in almost every sector of expenditure. VAT has increased, resulting, in turn, in increases in the cost of building houses, house prices and home fuels. Motor tax has increased, increasing the price of some cars by up to 12%. Hospital charges have increased by up to 26% in certain cases, the drug refund threshold has increased by 31% and ESB bills have increased by 13%. College fees are up by 59%, parking fees have increased by 25%, bus fares are up by 9% while the television licence fee has increased by 40%. The cost of buying a house continues to increase with no real assistance for first time buyers. The Minister made a token gesture to try to counteract the adverse publicity arising from the removal of the first-time buyer's grant. Bin charges are up by 29% on average but it will be considerably more in County Cork as we need a source of revenue because of cutbacks in the revenues granted to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We run a very serious risk of dramatic inflation <Col N="1370" />because of these increases. Although the most recent inflation figures do not suggest this, let us not be fooled &ndash; the cost of living in Ireland will continue to increase in the coming 12 months. Ireland is becoming one of the most expensive countries in Europe to live in and that may well have serious implications for our competitiveness. Deputy Deenihan spoke about the serious consequences for tourism because of the impending crisis in Iraq but there is a much quieter threat to tourism in the shape of increased inflation. The high cost of living here is driving away many low-budget tourists. This will also have implications for foreign investment.</P>
    <P>With limited resources available we needed to target and prioritise certain areas in both the Estimates and the budget but this has not happened in an effective way. We have seen cutbacks in forestry that have led to a dramatic reduction in planting for next year. This will have long-term consequences for the forestry industry in Ireland and this country has the most suitable climate for forestry in Europe. Research in the maritime sector has been cut back at a time when we need to be putting tax incentives and money in place, particularly for research on the conservation of fish stocks. Our communications infrastructure is the most important issue for Irish competitiveness over the next five years. We are making some progress through policy initiatives, but not from a financial point of view. Finance has been cut back in research projects in wireless broadband technology.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms much of what was announced in the budget. It is important to recognise that it contains some elements that are to be welcomed. The Minister has made an effort to close some loopholes in the tax system. I welcomed Financial Resolution No. 1 in the budget that aimed to close off the loophole whereby tax refunds can no longer be gained and used outside of a business by individuals for business activity unless that person is an active trader in that business, meaning that the person works in the business on a day-to-day basis. The Minister has sensibly made a number of exceptions to this in the areas of electricity supply and generation, oil and gas exploration and in music and film-making. The closure of other tax loopholes is also to be welcomed. I am pleased with the closure of the loophole relating to the effective transfer of capital allowances and buildings from companies to individual investors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of expiry dates to the end of 2004 on both town renewal and park and ride schemes. It is very disappointing, especially in the area of park and ride, that no new incentives exist for new projects. Little or no progress has been made on the provision of park and ride facilities in most of our major cities. Further incentives are necessary and we had an opportunity to introduce them.</P>
    <P>Regarding student accommodation, the expiry date for the tax incentive scheme provided under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is being pulled <Col N="1371" />back from 30 September 2005 to 31 December 2004. What is the reason for this? Perhaps it can be changed on Committee Stage. It makes no sense to me that this date is being pulled back when many projects are planned to finish in early 2005. Now they will miss the expiry date and be ineligible.</P>
    <P>I have a specific interest in renewable energy but an opportunity has been missed in this Bill. There is a real need to encourage and promote renewable energy sources in this country but we have failed to take the opportunity to do so in this Bill through tax incentives. The only way the Government can be proactive in encouraging the construction of wind turbines or research in wave energy, tidal energy or biomass is by offering tax incentives for that type of investment. We have not done this. We are missing an opportunity to comply with the Kyoto Protocol. Instead we will introduce carbon taxes that will only serve to increase inflation.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that inflation is killing this country. Inflation in Ireland is running at 5.5% to 6% while it is approximately 1% all over Europe. There is no way this country can sustain this level of inflation. It is having an affect across the board. Despite the pious platitudes we heard earlier about protecting older people, inflation is hitting them hard. Their bills are rising by up to 8%. It also affects younger people. Students have told me that they find the cost of living in Dublin to be prohibitive. Inflation must be tackled but this Government has caused much hurt by not doing so. In the mid-1980s one of the sources of our economic problems was the high rate of inflation.</P>

      <P>It is said that wonders never cease. Last weekend we saw provos marching for <Col N="1372" />peace which we obviously all agree is a welcome development. Would that it had happened 30 years ago. Now we have the truly bizarre situation of the political wing of an illegal military organisation calling on Parliament to amend the Constitution to include a new wording on neutrality.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate. It provides us with an opportunity to engage in a serious discussion about neutrality and a chance to talk about its rationale, nature and extent. It also provides us with an opportunity to dispel some of the humbug that surrounds the issue. It is worth considering a number of home truths before we legislate for neutrality. It is also worth being clear about exactly what we mean so that there is no scope for confusion about the great issues at stake.</P>
      <P>Let us begin with the word &ldquo;army&rdquo;. When delegates at the Progressive Democrats national conference speak about &ldquo;our army&rdquo;, we have in mind the Defence Forces, the Irish Army, the organisation charged under Bunreacht na hÉireann with responsibility for the defence of the State. The same is true in the case of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Sinn Féin, unlike every other party represented in the House, is inextricably linked to a military organisation. The provisional republican movement embraces both Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA. I for one have no way of knowing where one organisation begins and the other ends.</P>

      <P>Sinn Féin has an electoral mandate in both parts of the island. Politicians of all parties welcome its participation in the democratic process while competing vigorously with it for public support. However, the provisionals are not content to rely solely on their electoral mandate. With great arrogance they reserve the right to maintain an army, presumably to attend to their military needs. This means the provisionals form the only political organisation in the State which arrogates to itself the right to execute our citizens without due process. This is hardly a trivial issue and is one that might be addressed by Sinn Féin Members in the debate.</P>
      <P>Arrogance manifests itself when it comes to the question of military alliances. It is generally accepted by most commentators and observers that Irish neutrality can be defined in terms of non-participation in military alliances. It is also accepted that we are not neutral in the moral sense when it comes to issues like 11 September, nor are we neutral when it comes to supporting United Nations action in conflicts throughout the world. The question of alliances is key. We are not part of a military alliance. The Sinn Féin Bill would solidify that position in constitutional form, yet the provisionals arrogantly reserve to themselves the right to enter into military alliances as it suits them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" />The affairs of the provisional republican movement are not an entirely open book. There is evidence to link them with the regime in Libya, with the Spanish terrorist organisation, ETA, and with the murderous FARC group in Colombia. The thrust of the provisional position seems to be that, while the Government should not enter into military alliances, the provisionals will enter into them whenever it pleases them to do so. That hardly seems like a consistent position to me.</P>
    <P>The provisionals are not noted for their attachment to the Constitution, the document under discussion. They appear to have difficulty accepting our Defence Forces and police force. They also appear to have problems accepting the validity of the State. The Constitution is an open, public document voted into existence by the democratic will of the people almost 70 years ago.</P>
    <P>The provisional republican movement which seeks to amend that Constitution is governed by a constitution which is anything but open or democratic. The provisionals appear to live in something of a parallel universe of their own making. They have a constitution which is a secret document, a general army convention which meets in secret and elects an army executive which, in turn, chooses the all-powerful army council, a type of permanent politburo which, quite literally, calls the shots in the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is called the Ard-Fheis for Sinn Féin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, I have never received a polling card for an election to the army council, yet this body, which dominates the provisional movement, believes itself to be the legitimate Government of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate it if the Sinn Féin Members used the opportunity presented by the debate to clarify these matters. Will they address a number of specific questions? What is the relationship between the army and the party? Does the army council still believe itself to be the real Government of Ireland? What alliances does the movement maintain with armed groups in other countries? These are pertinent questions in the context of the debate.</P>
      <P>Everyone welcomes the fact that the provisionals are on ceasefire, that they have played a key role in the peace process and that they have entered mainstream politics on both sides of the Border. That does not mean that the provisional movement or its Sinn Féin component enjoys special political privileges not accorded to the rest of us. How can an organisation with a secret constitution credibly seek to amend the Constitution? How can an organisation that maintains international military links preach that the State should not do so? How can an organisation that arrogantly believes it is the real Government of this country expect to be taken seriously in a parliamentary democracy? Do the provisionals not have any sense of political embarrassment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" />I certainly accept that the provisional movement is unique. Its political wing, Sinn Féin, is, to the best of my knowledge, the only socialist party in Europe funded by donations from American businessmen. I suppose it deserves our grudging admiration for that because it is a remarkable achievement. Unique or not, the provisionals must begin to abide by the same standards as the rest of us. The people have been very tolerant and understanding of the movement in recent years because they wanted the peace process to succeed and did not want to see a return to armed conflict. Time moves on and the patience of the people is not limitless.</P>
    <P>It is time for Sinn Féin and the republican movement to complete the transition from militarism to mainstream politics, to abandon the secret and shadowy world of army councils and army conventions and embrace democracy in a clear and unequivocal fashion. If the provisionals fail to do that, I do not see how they can hope to be taken seriously when they participate in major debates on the affairs of our State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill. The Constitution of 1937 for the first time gave full effect to the conduct of Ireland's foreign policy as a sovereign, independent, democratic State. It was with considerable wisdom and foresight that we committed ourselves then in Article 29 to the pacific settlement of international disputes and international law as the rule for our conduct with other states. This was a statement of fundamental policy that was courageous and determined on the part of a people who had so recently endured desperate loss of life in the First World War, the War of Independence and the Civil War. Our commitment was for the peaceful settlement of conflict and the rule of international law, something quite different to neutrality as a political or even military concept.</P>
      <P>The constitutional principle guiding our foreign policy pre-dates neutrality. It predates the Second World War, the founding of the United Nations, NATO, the Warsaw Pact, the non-aligned movement, the entire Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall. It has been enduring and sustainable across many years and through many circumstances.</P>
      <P>The policy as distinct from the principle of neutrality followed two years after Bunreacht na hÉireann was approved. It was a policy, as we know, made in response to the specific national and international circumstances of 1939. The principled stance had been taken earlier in 1937. The pragmatic response at the outbreak of the Second World War was neutrality. Neutrality was implemented in a pragmatic way to secure our interests during and after the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we stood back from joining NATO, it was because the Government of the time believed this was incompatible with partition on our island, not because neutrality was a fundamental principle. The evolving and pragmatic policy of neutrality, like the constitutional precept of the <Col N="1375" />pacific settlement of disputes, has enjoyed the widespread support of the Irish people &ndash; with the notable exception of Sinn Féin. Some 60 years ago in this House, Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh said it was his opinion that it was &ldquo;absolutely undeniable, that there is nothing since the Free State was founded, in which the people have taken a deeper interest than in this Constitution.&rdquo;  This is still the case. Debates on our Constitution and amendments thereto have always provoked great interest, precisely because it is our Constitution, the basic law to which we give allegiance and which supersedes all other laws.</P>
    <P>However, Sinn Féin held itself superior to the new Constitution, to Dáil Éireann and to the State. It contributed nothing 66 years ago to the construction of our Constitution and has contributed very little since 1937, not least in its Bill today. What mattered to Sinn Féin back then, and what still seems inordinately important to it, are its ideology and its paraphernalia, the self-styled army convention, the army council, etc.</P>
    <P>The initiation of this Sinn Féin Bill to amend the Constitution has raised a few eyebrows. The same party has for years, and with great ferocity, sought to subvert the 1937 Constitution and all it stands for, including Article 29. It worked actively against the policy of neutrality by collaborating with the Nazi regime against the State and the Government of Ireland, as well as against the democratic Allied forces. Latterly, it pursued its alleged commitment to international peace through arms deals in the Libyan desert, and in fostering fraternal links with ETA terrorists in a fellow EU member state. Its claimed commitment to the de-militarisation of Europe apparently excludes the tonnes of semtex in its own republican hands. Its claimed commitment to the rule of law does not extend to co-operating with police investigations into the Omagh atrocity. We all know its alleged belief in neutrality allowed republicans to shoot members of our legitimate Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Since the Second World War, the policy of neutrality has been tested and stretched by many people, but never so cynically hi-jacked as by today's Sinn Féin under the guise of peace-loving neutrality. In 1937, Sinn Féin ignored the will of the people when we approved the Constitution. In its Bill today, it also ignores the referendum we held, as recently as last October, in which the Irish people voted to amend the Constitution so as to reserve to themselves the power to decide whether or not Ireland would enter a common European defence.</P>
    <P>This was the most recent way we dealt with the issue of defence and military neutrality. The Government brought forward the proposal on European defence having listened to the people's concerns in the first Nice referendum. We had a protracted, democratic debate and all sides had their say. The opponents of Nice claimed last October that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote still allowed the Government to enter a non-European defence <Col N="1376" />arrangement, such as NATO. This spurious argument was well aired and was well refuted too. The people made up their minds in favour of the constitutional amendment and did not accept the conspiratorial claims about other defence pacts.</P>
    <P>The result of that referendum is that our policy is a consistent whole, at each level. Constitutionally, we have never wavered in our fundamental commitment to the pacific settlement of disputes and the rule of international law. We maintain the power of Dáil Éireann to decide on each deployment of Irish Defence Forces outside the State on a case-by-case basis. The Government exercises day-to-day responsibility over defence and foreign policy. The people themselves have the power to decide directly on entering any automatic defence commitment in a European defence.</P>
    <P>None of this implies pacifism. None of it implies moral ambivalence. None of it implies inaction in the face of abuse of human rights or threats to international security. None of it means we are politically neutral. There is no part of our constitutional or political tradition which means we cannot agree with our partners in the EU and with the UN Security Council that the threat of war is valid to achieve compliance with international law and that the use of military force is a valid last resort. It is not part of our foreign policy tradition that we would make ourselves unable to agree with and actively support the United Nations Secretary General when he articulates these very points.</P>
    <P>We recognise that our commitment to international law means we are bound to uphold and vindicate that law. Neutrality does not mean we should neuter ourselves in upholding international law. When the Security Council and international law is being defied, as Iraq has done since 1991, then we should play our part in whatever way we can to uphold international law and the primacy of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill would introduce passivity, pacifism and impotence into Ireland's ability to uphold the international law that is at the centre of our foreign policy and of our constitutional commitments. We have a representative, responsible and directly elected Government, charged to act in the national interest in the foreign policy of the State. However through this Bill, Sinn Féin would shackle the State and the Government's legitimate management of our security and our international obligations. It would undermine our ability to act in support of our constitutional commitments. Such a disabling of our democratic institutions and of our constitutional principles has obvious parallels with the republican movement's failed attempt to subvert the State by violence over many years. How ironic that what Sinn Féin failed to achieve by violence, it now seeks to achieve by law.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will agree with me that the best contribution Sinn Féin can make to peace in Ireland &ndash; and peace internationally &ndash; is to get on and deliver on decommissioning republican <Col N="1377" />guns and semtex, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement and mandated by the people; to co-operate with legitimate police forces; to participate in policing in Northern Ireland; and to discontinue its dubious international networks and activities. Most people would agree that Sinn Féin has some nerve lecturing constitutional parties in Dáil Éireann on neutrality and peace.</P>
    <P>Having been involved in the peace process, I feel strongly when I say all of us welcomed the republican movement's embrace of democracy and its move from the margins to the centre of government in Northern Ireland. That is what the peace process is all about. It has brought all of the energy, which sustained 30 years of war, into its political activities and good luck to it. I believe this is the first Bill Sinn Féin has sought to enact under the Irish Constitution. This is a welcome and overdue recognition of the legitimacy of this State, of our Parliament and of the Irish Constitution. What a pity its first effort is a genuine masterpiece of irony.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Killeen. I oppose this Bill, not because I do not believe strongly in this country's policy of neutrality &ndash; far from it. I am firmly committed to the policy pursued by this and previous Governments of non-membership of military alliances, which has formed the bedrock of our foreign policy over many decades. Ireland's long-standing and honourable policy of military neutrality is not in question. There is no question of Ireland seeking membership of a military alliance. Successive Governments have held this position. The people voted last October for a constitutional amendment, passed at the same time as approval for the Treaty of Nice, which states clearly that Ireland may not join an EU common defence. That will not and cannot change unless the people so decide in a referendum.</P>
      <P>If this is the case, why do we have this Bill before the House at this time? If the people have spoken clearly on the question, surely the Bill is unnecessary, unless its purpose is to create the impression that the position is not clear and the decision of the people last October was somehow insufficient and not to be trusted. Ireland's policy of neutrality is not to be cashed in like a political chip, it is there because the people want it. However, they also recognise that our military neutrality has never meant that we are neutral in support of the United Nations or in the face of challenges to the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I issue a challenge across the floor to Sinn Féin. If it is found by the inspectors that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that Saddam Hussein is refusing to co-operate, would Sinn Féin support military intervention by the United Nations to put an end to the matter? When Shannon Airport facilities were used during the lawful military action in Bosnia, there was not a peep from the likes of Sinn Féin. The party is trying, in the most cynical fashion, to ride the tiger of <Col N="1378" />populism and curry favour with public opinion through this pathetic Bill.</P>

As a small state, it is in our interests that the rule of law govern international relations.

      <P>Let us remember that the members of the United Nations have vested this responsibility in the Security Council. These members include Ireland and other neutral countries, among them Switzerland which last year became a member of the United Nations for the first time. In doing so, it accepted the coercive and far-reaching provisions contained in the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>If a state defies the authority of the United Nations, there are provisions in the charter through which, as a matter of last resort, military action can be authorised by the Security Council. This is the sanction which enables the United Nations to maintain its primacy in terms of international collective security. It is in Ireland's interests that it continues to do so.</P>

Would we be able to honour our commitments to the United Nations if the Bill were adopted or would we have to first await a ruling from the courts?

      <P>Since 11 September 2001 the world has faced new threats and challenges which most of us had never anticipated or expected to have to face. The current threat and other possible sources of threat are significant. This country has always acted in accordance with the wishes of the United Nations. Ireland played an active and central role in framing certain resolutions in response to the 11 September atrocity, a role of which I am particularly proud and which is only natural for a country which has traditionally prided itself on its commitment to the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Our response to the changed international environment has also been framed by our participation in the European Union. Many people will have been surprised and no doubt impressed by the performance of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their EU counterparts in the summit meeting on Monday last. Europe emerged as a political entity which clearly defines itself in terms of its participation in the world in a manner which those of us who do not want a war very much welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" />There are differences in the House as to how best to avoid war. Unfortunately, there are also differences on the nature of the current situation in Iraq. I confess I am confused by some of the sentiments and speeches emanating from some of those involved in the peace movement. While I believe that the vast majority of them are genuinely committed to world peace, I find it difficult to understand the distinction a great many of them make between what they claim to fear are the intentions of the United States and what they, like the rest of us, clearly know of the reality of, for example, the regime in Iraq.</P>
    <P>Most of the Opposition speakers stated they are committed to our involvement in the United Nations. They did not explain how this can be squared with the continued defiance of the United Nations by the current Iraqi regime. It is inevitable that the United Nations will emerge from the current conflict equally as impotent as the League of Nations did in the 1930s unless some means is found to ensure that a number of resolutions spanning many years have an effect.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the reason Members of this House and others have shown scant regard for the lives of 500,000 Iraqi children who are believed to have died over the past ten or 12 years. Although it suits some to argue their deaths were due to United Nations sanctions, which undoubtedly had an impact, the leadership in Baghdad also had a role to play. I am particularly surprised that the deaths and torture of political activists opposed to the regime and the treatment of the Kurdish people warrants less interest, hullabaloo and commitment to peace than the apparent threat of a US attack on Iraq.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I want to indicate immediately <Col N="1381" />that the attitude of my party is to support the Bill on Second Stage. We find serious flaws in the text of the Bill but we believe it is important that this principle be discussed, particularly at this time. I wish to share my time with Deputy Costello and I suggest a 15 minute to five minute division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify a few matters that have arisen in the debate. In 1988 in this House, I condemned the use of mustard gas, supplied by western European countries, against the Kurds by the Iraqi regime. Unfortunately, there was not much interest at that time in the Kurdish minority in Iraq. I still condemn the abuses by that Government that continue to take place but I can provide information on what is likely to happen in the event of a military attack on that country.</P>
      <P>In 1991, 90,000 tonnes of explosives were dropped on Iraq. According to <i>Jane's Defence Weekly,</i> between 55% and 70% missed their target. A total of 72% of the population is urbanised. The population of Baghdad alone is between four and a half and five million. When we discuss topics such as this we should remember the history of warfare. In the First World War, 5% of the casualties were civilians. In the Second World War, 50% of the casualties were civilians and according to the international peace index, in most of the conflicts of the 1990s, the figure for civilian casualties was about 75%. When we speak easily of military strategies in relation to the solution of any conflict, we should bear in mind the immediate and future consequences on humankind.</P>
      <P>I want to explain why I welcome the debate on this Bill. Much of the confusion has arisen by the rather narrow and negative use of the concept of neutrality. When I was first elected to the Dáil, it was not always restricted to military neutrality. This is a fairly recent usage. From this narrowing came the suggestion that we would not take actions that would contradict our neutrality but what was missing was a concept of positive neutrality. If Second Stage is passed, we can then discuss precisely what we mean on Committee Stage, including the challenges and problems that lie within the Bill. Positive neutrality, for example, means an active, informing principle of foreign policy. I use these words carefully because they have been used in the formulation of other countries' foreign policy. An active, informing principle of foreign policy means that one has a particular view in relation to armaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much confusion in the contributions so far between, for example, defence and security, which is one of the paradoxes of our time. For example, the current United States defence budget is $396.1 billion. The combined budget of the remaining next nine countries is just about $180 billion and the armaments budget of the axis of evil countries is $16 billion. In other words, the budget of the lead country is twice that <Col N="1382" />of its allies and 25 times that of all its enemies. The difficulty, as some Deputies have suggested, is that the threat is now international terrorism and, unfortunately, this is what has happened in relation to the rather extreme ideological thinking currently guiding defence planning, particularly associated with people like Donald Rumsfeld, who has held the view since 1997 that a rogue state is needed to exhaust one's misplaced expenditure on defence.</P>
    <P>Turning to the principles of the Bill, positive neutrality, as an act of informing the principle of foreign policy, means working for disarmament, on which there could be agreement, but it means much more. It means addressing the basis of true security in issues like the deflection from expenditure on armaments to tasks of development. It is sobering to think, for example, that in the huge figures I quoted, two weeks' armaments expenditure would provide clean water for every man, woman and child on the planet or that the basic needs of the planet could be met for $28 billion in terms of the different UN statistics.</P>
    <P>I visited countries where I saw extreme militarism including, for example, Somalia, which I visited during the famine. In Somalia, the Soviet Union had provided $270 million worth of arms in the 1970s until the sides were switched. The United States then took over and it supplied $154 million worth of armaments. Italy provided $520 million worth of armaments to a country that is now hardly a state and which has a population of eight million.</P>
    <P>In debating what we mean by positive neutrality, and this is part of the difficulty in the Sinn Féin Bill, we also need to highlight some important distinctions. Neutrality does not mean impotence, nor does it mean standing aside from conflicts but we have to realise that currently there is a fundamental cleavage between two concepts in the United Nations. Arbitrary lines drawn around colonial borders led to states that in turn joined the United Nations. They then had their borders crystallised, as it were, and they invoked a concept of sovereignty. What are we to say to ethnic minorities and others faced with genocide behind these borders? When action has taken occurred has used the concept of humanitarian intervention, a concept used by Hitler in Poland, Mussolini in Ethiopia and so forth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>And by Britain here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. What is needed now, and this is interesting in relation to the new thinking that is beginning to emerge, is the concept of sovereignty as responsibility and protection. For example, if we turn the problem upside down and consider people's inalienable rights, and then consider the capacity of states to deliver those rights or the proclivity of states to deny them, what we are speaking about is the responsibility to protect. From that we could invent new principles and begin an international dialogue. By investing the United Nations with additional <Col N="1383" />authority, we might expand this protection of rights, the concept of sovereignty as the responsibility to protect. We must remember the distinction, which is defined by the needs of those who need protection rather than by the intentions of those who are seeking to intervene, which changes it entirely in relation to sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Another part of that concept is to accept the responsibility to prevent conflict as well as the responsibility to rebuild after conflict. This use of neutrality as a positive and informing principle of foreign policy will enable us to seek a new path beyond the threshold of sovereignty and vindicate those rights. People are correct to ask if we can invoke neutrality as a moral principle to stand aside when there are threats of genocide or ethnic and so forth. We cannot but we can lay down precautionary principles in relation to the implementation of this measure such as, for example, right intention and proportional means. These have been developed by, among others, Gareth Evans and Dr. Mohamed Sahnoun, whom I met in Somalia. It is for that reason we are better off accepting a Bill on Second Stage, discussing it and making our contributions. We can then get over the problem that affects the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The strengths of the United Nations are the universality of its membership and the universality of the fall of its obligations. No country has the right to put the United Nations at risk through pre-emption. Not one international legal scholar supports the principle of pre-emption. Regarding references to the League of Nations, the United Nations must be respected but it is the UN's charter which makes the universal bind. The United Nations is neither the plaything of the most powerful nor the consequence of power relations. For those reasons it is very important we use it to the full.</P>
      <P>In the spirit of the Taoiseach's comment on the need for a second UN resolution, it would be interesting to know how he worked out the first resolution had been concluded in its remit. The first resolution must work through to its end and its results must be evaluated. That is a function of the Security Council. It is cheap to speak of how a resolution will facilitate certain parties; even when a resolution is made I remind the Taoiseach of the United Nations charter. The UN is there to prevent wars, not to authorise wars. It has authorised the use of force 14 times but it is not there to facilitate wars, nor is it there to do so <i>ex post facto,</i> except at great damage to itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach stayed silent on another issue. Ten times in the history of the United Nations a process known as uniting for peace was followed. This means that where the Security Council is divided and cannot reach a conclusion, a process can be initiated through the General Assembly which enables initiatives to be taken to break that impasse. This was done in the cases of Korea in 1950, Egypt in 1956 and the Congo in 1960. These are the possibilities if we decide to stop feeling that neutrality is some great burden upon us but <Col N="1384" />define it positively and responsibly in relation to our international obligations.</P>
    <P>I find the Bill flawed textually and I am sure Sinn Féin will accept this criticism. One could not accept the principle, for example, that a policy of neutrality could be stated in a constitutional document. That lacks constitutional precision. What if the policy changed? There are also other problems in relation to the Bill and it would be better if it were clear in its definitions. I am using the term &ldquo;positive neutrality&rdquo; and I am then going on to refer to that as an active, informing principle of foreign policy, but these are matters which can be discussed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, suggested last night that our concern for security has become diffused and now largely rests with the EU. That argument is flawed. The issues of defence and security are separate, as he knows, but when it comes to the balance between the United Nations and the EU regarding foreign policy, there is a great advantage for a country like Ireland in making more of its United Nations relationship &ndash; this is something we can do.</P>
    <P>A speaker suggested last night that our neutrality began in 1937 with Eamon de Valera's Constitution or with the Second World War, but it most certainly did not. The Irish Neutrality League and other voices advocated neutrality at the beginning of the last century. The interesting point is that they were inclined to express their wishes, as Connolly did, in a precisely humanist essence. They spoke of the cost of war for ordinary working people and it is the same now for the youngsters of some poor state who will have to die in any forthcoming conflict. They saw war as a waste of ordinary people's lives &ndash; that was their motivating principle. Those early writings on neutrality were highly ethical and international.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I cannot see why people are afraid of a debate on this legislation to improve its text. I have no difficulty in supporting it on Second Stage and I look forward to contributions from others on this topic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have no difficulty in supporting the Bill. I welcome the chance for debate as there are many issues to be teased out. The House should not divide on the Bill but allow it to proceed. It is important to debate issues such as war and neutrality because we stand on the brink of war. The greatest power in the world is threatening to invade Iraq with or without a United Nations resolution. The wonderful march last Saturday was a great boost to everyone. Some 100,000 people marched in Dublin and others marched in different parts of the country. The people of Ireland stood up and were counted &ndash; they spoke with their feet and their presence. That sends a message to the Taoiseach and the Government and also to the United States and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed and dumbfounded to hear the Taoiseach take credit for the march. One would <Col N="1385" />swear he was chief marshal of the march. At the moment the march set off from Parnell Square at 3 p.m. the Taoiseach was in Oxmantown in our constituency, knocking on doors, looking for votes. When the biggest march in a long time, on the biggest issue one could imagine &ndash; war and peace &ndash; took place, the leader of the country was knocking on doors for votes. He could have given his support by standing up to be counted and if he could not turn up he could have at least sent a message. However, he was a couple of hundred yards away, doing something only a huckster politician would have done in the circumstances. That was unconscionable.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party put forward a proposal before the Nice treaty referendum, which was accepted and incorporated into the text, that the State should not become involved in any European common defence. Previous to that the Taoiseach made a commitment that if we did engage in the Partnership for Peace, there would be a constitutional referendum. It is a shame he did not honour that commitment because it would have given us an opportunity to discuss these issues of alignment and neutrality.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Michael D. Higgins. It is high time we looked at where we stand on this issue. In 1932, when Taoiseach Éamon de Valera was President of the League of Nations, he made a statement outlining the form of neutrality under which we operated during the Second World War, saying that if the great nations were to behave irresponsibly, the small nations should not assist them. James Connolly and James Larkin, when they said they would serve neither king nor kaiser, were stating that Ireland would not be party to any imperialist military alliance that would cause the deaths of people in war.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to allow this Bill to continue past Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last Dáil the Green Party produced a Bill similar to this to insert an amendment enshrining the concept of neutrality into the Constitution. This Bill embellishes that because it takes into account discussions that have since taken place in this House, particularly at the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It offers a useful starting point to discuss the concept of neutrality, its importance and value to many in our nation. The role of Dáil Éireann in seeking to bring about any change in the Constitution is purely facilitative. We do not exist to change the Constitution but to put forward proposals the people then debate and decide upon. On those grounds, despite the reservations of Government speakers, and those of the Fine Gael party, which is close to enunciating a position in favour of Ireland's participation in military alliances &ndash; a perfectly valid position with more honour than the position offered by the Government parties &ndash; even parties that believe Ireland should play an active role in military alliances can <Col N="1386" />vote for this Bill because it will allow the citizens to discuss the issue.</P>
    <P>When the Green Party published its own Bill to insert a clause on neutrality into the Constitution we published a parallel Bill on changes to the Constitution. The Green Party believes in open and participative democracy. A flaw in the Constitution is that the sole proposal rights for change rest with Dáil Éireann. It is a feature of many other democracies that citizens, through petitions and campaigns, can put forward proposals and, if necessary, change the constitution of their nations. There are many who fear such an eventuality because they fear the concept of real democracy. If, however, we look at Bunreacht na hÉireann as a living document, the idea of the people really owning it should be embraced. I hope to have an opportunity to reopen that debate in future.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been criticised because the Government is satisfied with the nod and wink approach to neutrality. It claims that it is unnecessary to put it down on paper. If neutrality is not enshrined in the Constitution, the nonsense we have seen the Taoiseach engage in every day this week will continue. He has refused to tell the House whether he is prepared to back unilateral or pre-emptive action or if he is prepared to seek a second UN Security Council resolution. When the pressure is high enough, when 100,000 marchers have an effect on his party and Government, he makes statements to the national broadcaster about people's support for the Government line. If neutrality was enshrined in the Constitution and there was a legislative base to our foreign policy, the Taoiseach would not be able to engage in such shenanigans. In spite of the Taoiseach's statement this evening, where he said there were certain circumstances in which the Government would not support action in Iraq, he still refuses to spell out those circumstances. Our lack of a constitutional base allows him, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government to do this. If recent events have demonstrated anything, it is a contemptuous attitude towards the active foreign policy role this State should play and that its citizens want it to play, as we saw last Saturday.</P>
    <P>There are those who ask what neutrality stands for. They want a pedantic, dictionary view of neutrality. Neutrality, as my party and most people in this State understand it, is about giving an endorsement to how we already play a role in the world through our very valuable involvement in United Nations peace keeping efforts, where we act as a buffer in warring zones. It is about avoiding going down the slippery slope where we become peace enforcers. Support for peace enforcement means signing up to the doctrine of George W. Bush. The country does not want to go that way but I am unsure about the way this Government wants to go. That is why it is important that we have this debate and let Irish citizens decide.</P>
    <P>Government ambivalence on neutrality has seen us act differently from other European <Col N="1387" />countries, such as Austria, Sweden and Finland, that are certain of where they stand on neutrality. One of the applicant countries, the small island state of Malta, has a constitutional provision on neutrality. If it is possible for Malta to enter the EU with its constitution, why can we not change our Constitution to allow such a firm statement of policy?</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello mentioned the changes effected through the Nice treaty. That was only a partial exemption that meant a referendum would have to take place for a European Union defence force. We could still become involved in other military alliances without a referendum. The Government could decide to join NATO, although given the current state of that organisation, it might be a good time to join. It is constitutionally possible for us to do that but it is not what the Irish people want and it would not be in their interests.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Government, particularly Fianna Fáil, has chosen to refuse to debate neutrality on this and previous occasions in recent years. I believe that is not only against the interests of Fianna Fáil and the country, but also against the very nature of Fianna Fáil and its history. Reference has been made to Eamon de Valera's role in the League of Nations. The House is indebted to the excellent work of Frank Aiken as Minister for External Affairs. As the Minister representing Ireland in its first participation in the United Nations in the mid-1950s, he was always willing to take a strong, independent, strident line that made Ireland look well in the eyes of other countries, particularly small developing countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did tens of thousands of Irish people take to the streets last Saturday? Was it to approve of Government policy by saying &ldquo;We are right behind you in support of your policies and stance&rdquo;? No, it was not. All of us know that people marched because they are worried and anxious about the inexorable slide towards war. They also have grave reservations about the role Ireland is playing in this situation. Many are concerned about Ireland's neutrality, some holding stronger views than others. There is uncertainty over the whole issue.</P>
      <P>What does neutrality mean in practical terms? In peace time, we need not worry or even think about it, but when the shadow of war looms, it exercises our minds greatly. That, of course, is part of the problem. We need a reasoned debate on neutrality. As a people, we need to take time to reflect on the role we can play as a sovereign state, as part of the UN and in a world that is changed forever by the threat of international terrorism. We need a debate about our responsibilities in the wider global context. How do we distinguish between peacekeeping and peace making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is our role, if any, in conflict resolution in other parts of the world? If tomorrow, next <Col N="1388" />week or next year, our peace and security were threatened by a terrorist group, either acting alone or with the backing of a particular country because, for example, it considered that Ireland's geographical position was strategic <i>vis-à-vis </i>Europe and the UK, would we expect others to come to our aid? Would we be screaming for the UN or the EU to intervene to defend us or would our neutrality protect us? That may appear far-fetched, but who would have thought that just over ten years ago, thousands of innocent Muslims would be butchered in Srebrenica in the heart of Europe? We watched it nightly on our television screens and we were helpless. Would it be any different if it were Ireland instead of Kosovo? These questions cannot be ignored even if they are difficult. If, as politicians, we duck the difficult questions, we do no service to those whom we represent.</P>
    <P>However, that debate is for another day. Tonight, we must face the difficult question, where stands Ireland's neutrality in the shadow of a war on Iraq? Nobody knows and that fact alone brought many people onto the streets last weekend. We need leadership. We need our leaders to take a stand and to work within the framework of Irish neutrality as it now stands. The debate we must have is for another day. Now, we need to know where our Government is leading us. It is not enough to be told that a decision will be made when and if a particular situation arises. If one does not know where one is going, one can end up anywhere. That is what people are afraid of.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach promised us a referendum on Partnership for Peace. Irrespective of whether we needed it, he promised it and he did not deliver. People are losing trust in the Taoiseach on this issue. Ireland's neutrality is like a piece of elastic. It is being stretched to the point where some of us are afraid it will snap. The Taoiseach must make a clear, unambiguous statement as to Ireland's intentions in the event of unilateral action against Iraq. If we remain as we are, hopping from one foot to the other, waiting to see which direction the wind blows and hoping somebody else will take the hard decisions for us, we will lose all credibility at home and internationally.</P>
    <P>The Irish people deserve better. We must be able to trust our Government. Unquestioning acceptance of the US stance is not good enough. Those of us who watched the &ldquo;True Lives&rdquo; programme on RTE last night were riveted to our television screens as we watched on camera, as if we were there, the failed coup against President Chavez in Venezuela. The shadow of the CIA was there, just as it was when General Allende was ousted in Chile in the absence of the cameras. We cannot be unquestioning. We have hard decisions to take now and in the future.</P>
    <P>We lack decisive leadership. When we have the debate on neutrality, as we must have, the Irish people must decide because they are the supreme <Col N="1389" />authority and will ultimately have to live with the consequences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Too often the Government presents neutrality in a negative way as a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; philosophy. I noted the hysterical reaction of three Deputies on the Government side of the House to a debate on neutrality and their personal attack on Sinn Féin. Was that an effort to avoid the issue or was it a display of fear due to the fact that tens of thousands of people came out on the streets last week to show the Government and the establishment of Europe that they are wrong and are afraid to face up to the reality that they have made terrible blunders which are leading us into a cul de sac of war?</P>
      <P>We in Sinn Féin want to articulate the positive aspects of neutrality. At its core, this must mean being a positive force in arguing for not just nuclear disarmament but a massive scaling down of the international weapons industry. We have legitimate fears that the current US Administration and, indeed, the British one spends more time acting in response to lobbying by the arms industry than listening to millions of voters protesting about the military build-up and spiral into conflict in Iraq. A study by the World Policy Institute shows that before joining the Bush administration, 32 high-level appointees served as executives, paid consultants or major shareholders of the weapons industry.</P>
      <P>We in Sinn Féin believe that neutrality can be a tool, not to ignore international conflict but to resolve conflict and tension between states, regions and cultures in the modern world. For a practical example of this in action, one need look no further than the unparalleled record of Irish personnel on UN peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. This Twenty-six County State is uniquely placed on the international stage. While counted as one of the industrialised so-called &ldquo;first world&rdquo; states, we have an experience of colonial occupation and exploitation that makes us all too aware of the situation facing the less developed states in central and South America, Africa and Asia.</P>
      <P>Our unique perspective of international politics is an asset that can promote understanding and dialogue. We have a responsibility to wake up the EU, the UN leadership, the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank to the reality of global politics today and make them tackle international problems more effectively and efficiently. We can be a bridge between the global haves and have nots, between the exploiters and the exploited. We should have used our membership of the UN Security Council as a campaigning member in favour of debt cancellation and renewed investment and aid for less developed states. We should have been lobbying for cheaper medicines to be made available to combat AlDS, TB, hepatitis and other treatable ailments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have presented plans for reform of the UN. We should have been able to stand up to the US arms industry. Do we want to live in a <Col N="1390" />world where, since 1992, the United States has exported more than $142 billion worth of weaponry and supplied arms or military technology to more than 92% of the conflicts under way in 1999 and, in the period from 1998 to 2001, over 68% of world arms deliveries were sold or given to developing nations? As a neutral state, we are not advocating pacifism. We are advocating global justice and when necessary will support a just war. For example, we will support a war on poverty. We will support stopping the arms trade and replace it with fair trade. Ireland is a small state but that does not mean it has to dilute its ambitions or fail to articulate its principles.</P>
    <P>Why, for example, has the Government in each of the past five years refused to meet its own meagre commitments on overseas aid? The simple act of sharing our wealth internationally could be a powerful signal to other wealthier states to show that we are willing to fight global poverty. This Government will bend over backwards to let arms and soldiers get moved through Shannon and expend resources policing the airport, yet they will not spare small change from Government spending for overseas aid. Is that what it means to be neutral? Here, again&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has actively participated in, and carefully listened to, this detailed debate, both today and yesterday. Many disparate arguments have been raised and the scope of the contributions that have been made illustrates the complexity and wide-ranging nature of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of the neutrality issue that most Members of the House share in common. There have been many voices that question what is, in my view, the highly significant role that Ireland's policy in this area has played as a core value in our foreign policy. This has been the case since Irish neutrality became practically possible with the return by Britain of the treaty ports in 1938. Neutrality has since been a policy adopted by successive Governments. It has as its core defining characteristic the non-membership of military alliances. This central aspect of Ireland's approach remains as valid now as it ever was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be absolutely clear in response to some points that have been raised. There is no question of Ireland joining a mutual defence alliance such as NATO. To suggest otherwise is a complete red herring. What is more, the people already voted last October for a constitutional amendment, passed at the same time as their approval for the Treaty of Nice, which precludes the State from <Col N="1391" />entering a common defence in the European Union without a further referendum.</P>
    <P>What then is the point of the proposal in front of us to put neutrality into the Constitution at this time? Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains as viable as always. In a post-Cold War situation the emerging defence and security challenges have moved away from traditional defence towards crisis management. Nevertheless, our attachment to military neutrality remains undiminished.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Government wants to continue what we have been doing for decades and continue to play an active role in preventing conflicts and peacekeeping. This is an area where we have particular strengths and where we have, and can, make a real difference. The contribution of the Defence Forces to UN missions since 1958 has been a source of pride to successive Governments and to the Irish people. They have earned an excellent reputation as peace-keepers in many diverse locations and I want them to play a prominent role in other crisis management missions. This role is entirely in keeping with our commitment to collective security that has been pursued through the United Nations. A clear and ongoing tendency has been greater UN reliance upon the resources and capabilities, not only military but also civilian, of organisations like the European Union.</P>
    <P>An aspect that really concerns me about this proposal is the reality that the incorporation of a specific reference to neutrality in the Constitution could have a serious impact on the capacity of the Government to support the United Nations. Where would this leave us? It would raise questions as to whether we could fulfil our obligations under the UN. How, for instance, would a constitutional amendment relate to the enforcement provisions of the UN Charter? Could we fulfil our obligations under the charter should these be invoked?</P>
    <P>Recourse to the courts would be a clear implication of these proposals for amending the Constitution and this is not an appropriate area for judicial interpretation. These are not matters to be settled in the Supreme Court rather than by the duly elected Government which, under Article 29 of the Constitution, is responsible for the external relations of the State.</P>
    <P>I heard several speakers refer to the militarisation of the European Union. This assertion simply does not stand up to scrutiny. I would have thought that these concerns had been well and truly put to rest with the declarations made at the Seville European Council last June. At Seville, the 15 EU Heads of State and Government put on record beyond doubt that the Union's capacity to conduct humanitarian and crisis management tasks does not involve the creation of a European Army. Does the solemn word of the 15 Heads of State and Government of the EU not stand for something very significant?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" />No practical purpose is served by the proposals now put forward by Deputy Ó Caoláin. They would instead only result in Ireland withdrawing from our international responsibilities. This runs contrary to Ireland's perspective on our commitments under the United Nations and our strong track record of engagement on international issues.</P>
    <P>I am firmly of the view that military neutrality on its own is not enough to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally. We need to be constructive in seeking to play our part in preventing and managing conflicts. This includes peacekeeping, notably through the UN and now also through regional organisations such as the European Union. For this and previous Governments, military neutrality has never meant sitting on our hands and shirking our responsibilities to the international community. We are not, for example, neutral in the face of the threat posed by international terrorism, nor were we neutral in response to the shocking atrocities we all witnessed in the Balkans only a short decade ago. I do not believe for one moment that the Irish people would want to stand aloof, ostrich like, in response to these horrific situations which have appalling humanitarian consequences. That is not in our nature.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a backwards step. It would do nothing to enhance the protection of military neutrality that is already there and I reiterate the Government's opposition to it.</P>

      <P>Some of the contributions to this debate, both inside and outside the Dáil, were worthy of walk-on parts in comedy shows like &ldquo;The Office&rdquo; featuring David Brent. What would Ireland's position be, we were asked, if an EU state were occupied by a foreign invader? First, one is currently occupied by a foreign invader. It is called Ireland and it is NATO troops who are doing the occupying. For the less well informed Deputies, and there are many on this issue, they are British troops who are part of the NATO alliance.</P>
      <P>What would we do in such a situation, we were asked, if we had enshrined neutrality in the Constitution? That is the wrong question. The question is: what could we do &ndash; throw stones at them? Besides, it is a bogus scenario. If some of the EU warmongers get their way, European troops are much more likely to be active outside the borders of the EU, rather than defending them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have really managed to call the Government's bluff on this occasion. All through the Nice I and Nice II debates the Government told the Irish people that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in favour of neutrality. Now the cat is well and truly out of the bag and <Col N="1393" />people know exactly where they stand. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael backbenchers have one last chance, in about 15 minutes' time, to save some of their integrity by voting for this Bill and I ask them urgently to do so.</P>

      <P>The Government professes to support neutrality. When he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan stated:</P>
      <P>Ireland's policy of military neutrality is premised on our intention not to become involved in hostilities between other states . . .  In Peacetime this calls for non-membership of military alliances and the State accordingly does not propose to join a military alliance.</P>
      <P>Mar Thaoiseach i 1992, dúirt Albert Reynolds:</P>
      <P>The policy and tradition of neutrality in the military sense has served Ireland well. [It] has served as a symbol of sovereignty and independence . . .  [and] helped us play a constructive role in UN peacekeeping.</P>
      <P>Sa bhliain 2001, dúirt Aire Cosanta an Teachta Micheál Mac Gabhann:</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy of military neutrality, the Government has made clear that Ireland would only participate in operations authorised by the United Nations in accordance with the appropriate legislation and subject to Dáil approval.</P>
      <P>The same year, the Progressive Democrat Deputy and then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, indicated the Government's &ldquo;firm attachment&rdquo; to military neutrality and claimed that &ldquo;we are not interested in joining military alliances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the second Nice treaty debate, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, stated that non-membership of military alliances was a core characteristic of Irish military neutrality. However, the strongest statement on this issue from Fianna Fáil came from Deputy Roche, now a Minister of State, who said in 1999:</P>
      <P>It is bizarre that Ireland is willing to talk endlessly about our neutrality but we have never sat down and determined in clear terms what we mean by neutrality . . .  We should possess within our law a clear and unambiguous statement of how we determine our neutrality as a nation . . .  to bind this and every future Government on the issue of neutrality . . .  we should give the people the opportunity to express their views on neutrality at the earliest possible date . . .  They should be given the opportunity to write into their Constitution their commitment to neutrality in clear and unambiguous terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on those words, the Government should welcome this Bill with open arms. Regrettably, it has not done so, and that is because it fears <Col N="1394" />exposure. Since 1997, the Fianna Fáil-led Government has systematically pursued a policy of abandoning neutrality by stealth. It has joined NATO's Partnership for Peace, despite promises to the contrary. It has refused to seek a legally binding neutrality protocol to the Nice treaty, despite public outcry. It has set the precedent of ministerial authorisation for war complicity without the assent of the Dáil in the case of the US-led war on Afghanistan. Sa chruachás atá ann faoi lathair, níor úsáid an Rialtas a shuíochán ar Choiste Slándála na Náisiún Aontaithe ná a sheasamh san Aontas Eorpaigh chun tacú leis na tíortha sin atá i gcoinne an chogaidh san Iaráic. Ina áit, tá an Rialtas tar éis ligint d'fhórsaí Stáit Aontaithe Mheirceá aerfort na Sionainne a úsáid ar a mbealach chuig an chogadh. Má ghlactar leis an Bhille seo beidh an gníomh sin agus gníomhartha eile dá leithéid mídhleathach agus míbhunreachtúil.</P>
    <P>The Sinn Féin amendments would disallow participation in standing military alliances and restrict overseas military involvement to UN peacekeeping missions. Ireland needs this Bill. Neutrality is a cornerstone of independence in foreign policy. Up to now it has only been constitutionally implied. At the moment, there is no clear constitutional barrier to this State's joining a military alliance. Contrary to what is claimed, the Seville declaration does not constitutionally enshrine neutrality and non-participation in military alliances. Tá Sinn Féin ag iarraidh go mbeidh an neodracht lonnaithe go soléir sa mBunreacht.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some of the misinformation that was given yesterday about the Sinn Féin Bill and what it does and does not do. It seeks to enshrine permanent military neutrality in the Constitution. We have opted for a minimalist formulation that relies upon the canon of international law, the 1907 HAGUE CONVENTION RESPECTING THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF NEUTRAL POWERS IN THE CASE OF WAR ON LAND, as referred to by Deputy Gormley earlier. Sinn Féin has a fuller concept of neutrality, which is reflected in this Bill. We want to see that reflected in supporting legislation in future. In particular, we support the concept of positive neutrality as a significant force for good in the world, one whose potential has not yet been fully realised.</P>
    <P>There is nothing inward-looking, backwards or narrow in Sinn Féin's proposal. We have expressed our vision of positive neutrality in action. The proposed amendment must be read in the context of the other provisions of Article 29 regarding commitment to peaceful resolution of dispute through dialogue, international co-operation and compliance with international law. Is gá dúinn a ghlaoch ar an Rialtas deireadh a chur leis na pleananna slíbhíneacha atá aige a fháil réidh den neodracht. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé sásta teacht anseo agus a rá go soiléir an bhfuil sé ag cur deiridh leis an neodracht nó ag tacú go huile is go hiomlán leis.</P>

I include the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, and Deputy Killeen of Fianna Fáil, who were among the Deputies who contributed to this timely and enlightening debate. It has been enlightening on a whole range of levels.

      <P>The Bill is timely, but it was signalled some time ago. In April 2001 I stood here as the lone member of my party and presented this Bill before the House. I could only bring it to First Stage at that juncture, but I made it very clear that we would revisit this at the first opportunity, and that is exactly what we are doing. This is the first Sinn Féin Private Members' time of this Dáil. I am not only grateful to my colleagues but also to the Independent and Green Party Deputies who spoke in favour of the Bill. I also welcome the support of the Labour Party. It has some differences with us on some elements of the Bill, but it is giving its support to its progress through Second Stage. Cuirim fáilte ar sin.</P>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Michael D. Higgins when he speaks of a policy of positive neutrality and he will have noted that my colleague, Deputy Ferris, actually used that phraseology. The Government side has argued strongly against this Bill, as have their colleagues on the Fine Gael benches. That is a telling point because the real lines of demarcation in this Chamber have been exposed by this debate as never before. People in this House, and especially outside it, should recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government claims it has a policy of non-membership of military alliances, yet it will not agree to put that into the Constitution. It claims it would tie its hands. Why does it believe that? About what issue does it not want its hands to be tied? The only conclusion I can reach is that it wants to carry on with its shameful erosion of <Col N="1396" />neutrality and move this country forward towards participation in military alliances. There can be no other explanation for the position it adopts. There are Deputies here on the Government benches and the Fine Gael benches who agree with the general principles of this Bill. I reiterate our appeal to their party leaders to allow for a free vote and allow Deputies to vote with their consciences.</P>
    <P>The leaderships of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have abandoned neutrality. If they wish to challenge the Bill, they should allow it to proceed to Committee Stage so that the debate may continue, but they are intent on killing it off tonight. The only reason they want to do so is because they have seen the evidence of popular support for the vision and the thinking behind this Bill, as demonstrated in the streets of this city only last Saturday. They know very well that the Government, if it is to allow this Bill passage, will not win the real debate when the referendum to enshrine positive neutrality in the Constitution is put before the people. They may very well win this evening's debate, with the numbers here tonight, but they know that when they go before the people they will lose, and the people know that also. The Government no longer trusts the people, but it should make no mistake, the people no longer trust Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government. That is what they fear.</P>
    <P>This Bill requires and demands the support of all who uphold independent foreign policy and a policy of positive neutrality. I urge Deputies to vote with their consciences and to recognise the clamour of public opinion in their respective constituencies, as demonstrated on the streets and articulated through local radio, newspaper coverage and on the national airwaves. They should acknowledge and catch up with the opinion of the Irish people by voting tonight in accordance with the views of those who put them here to represent them. I urge Deputies to vote &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; to the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2003. I hope Members will have the guts to vote and that they will stand with the Irish people for a vision for the future of which we can be proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will go down in history as having failed to control inflation and I have already referred to those people who will be hardest hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The doubling of disease levies in the budget was the final blow which drove farmers around the bend. Up to that point, farmers knew it had been a bad year with wet weather and so on, but the increased levies were the killer blow. People <Col N="1399" />are only now beginning to realise the huge impact of these levies on agriculture &ndash; they will kill any spirit of enthusiasm left in farmers.</P>
    <P>The cut in forestry grants is also regrettable because the industry was beginning to develop and people had come to accept that it had the potential to provide a living for them. At the stroke of a pen, the grants were abolished.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues which needed to be addressed in the budget and were not. For example, the local authority in south Tipperary has applications for the disabled person's grant that would take five years to fulfil. The scheme has benefited many people who are ill or have been injured, giving them an improved quality of life, yet there was no increase in the grant.</P>
    <P>While the Minister announced a 2% or 3% increase in roads funding, the reality is that inflation will eat up that increase. In August and September of last year in a number of counties, no money was left to pay for filling potholes. This year, that situation will be reached earlier in the year. Wages must be paid and material must be paid for, but there will be no funding left to do so.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance is responsible for decentralisation. Other Members have addressed the issue but Tipperary South is the only constituency that has not been given a Government office and I appeal for one tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food is present to hear my contribution. This Government will be known for years to come as the only Government in recent history which has managed to drive the farming community out of the national partnership talks.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's senior Minister and the Government designed a route with malice aforethought to prise the farming community out of the partnership talks. I was sick and tired during the run-up to the last general election listening to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats talk about an inclusive society. The first chance they got after the election, they decided to ensure they would pressurise our largest industry, in which 160,000 farming families are engaged, as a result of which its members will not be involved in the partnership talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I genuinely believe that the Government created obstacles farmers could not overcome. I will outline three such instances. This approach had to be premeditated; it could not be a co-incidence. Between the publication of the Estimates and the introduction of the Finance Bill, the Government decided to double the disease levies. I do not have the time to outline the historical background to this. A deal was done in this House five or six years ago to the effect that if farmers paid for the first round of TB testing, the annual test, the disease levies would be halved and would remain at that level. The Minister of State knows exactly what I am talking about. The <Col N="1400" />Government reneged on that promise. We now have the remarkable situation, which I have not seen in the 25 years I have been a Member of this House, that under certain conditions it costs almost &euro;40 to sell an animal to one of the factories. I do not have time to give a breakdown of that figure, but that is the case.</P>
    <P>The Government spent a year negotiating with the farming community to purchase land for the new roadways. A deal was done, in good faith, in respect of the roll-over relief. I will never forget the evening that deal was done. The Government shook hands on it with the farming community, but what did the Minister for Finance do? He decided to renege on that promise. The Minister of State has his ear to the ground in his community and he knows this is something the farming community will never forget. Once one takes land off a farmer, land from which farmers make their living, any deal that is welshed on in respect of land will be remembered forever. If the Minister of State wants to be re-elected in years to come, he had better do something about this issue.</P>
    <P>The final stroke came when the Minister decided through the financing of the grant system for the only industry which is environmentally free &ndash; the planting of trees &ndash; that only half the number of hectares that were planted last year would be planted this year. We have a planting target of about 20,000 hectares. That is the target to which we aspire and which this nation should plant over the next 20 years. Farmers want to plant trees but they are not being approved grant aid for this purpose.</P>
    <P>However, worse was to come in the Finance Bill. A decision was made about 15 years ago to help farmers overcome the psychological barriers many of them faced to devoting their land to forestry. If one uses one's land for timber production, the trees will be there for generations. Forestry is a lifelong investment. Apart from grants, successive Government decided that whatever income would accrue from such investment would be tax free, but what did the Minister for Finance do? He decided, in his own cunning, clever way, the other day that farmers would not have to pay tax on such income but would have to declare it. I do not have to tell the Minister of State that there is not a farmer who has devoted his land to forestry who is not as sick as a parrot as a result of what the Minister for Finance has done. I can guarantee that the amount of land that will be committed to forestry over the next five years will fall far short of what was committed in the past five years unless the Minister changes the headlines in respect of those two particular matters. I am not talking about the conglomerates in forestry; I am talking about farm forestry. The Government is after stabbing those engaged in forestry in the back, which is something for which many of those people will never forgive it.</P>
    <P>As if all that was not bad enough for farmers, the Government decided to take &euro;15 million out <Col N="1401" />of the Teagasc budget in case it would be able to provide the sort of help and assistance farmers need. As in the case of forestry, the Government decided to have a go at the organic farm enterprise in Athenry. I do not know what happened at the Teagasc board today, but all I know is that the Government has had a go at anything that appeared to be a modern way of doing things. That is the reason farming organisations cannot enter the partnership talks. They could not sell what is proposed to their members. No farmer worth his or her salt would take the sort of treatment the Government is dishing out. The Government will have no trouble voting this Bill through the next night, but the day of reckoning will come and it will be based on the impact of these measures and what Government had done to the farming community.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is a principle of our society that those who are well off contribute, through the Exchequer, to helping to look after those who are less well off. In that regard, I commend the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, on his budget last December and on this Bill. The money that has been gathered by this exercise will go, in no small way, to ensuring that the economic success the State has enjoyed during the past five years will continue. This success has been based, to no small extent, on low personal rates of tax. To make sure that happens, it is important that there should be a broad base of tax.</P>
      <P>I wish to briefly allude, in general terms, to the Bill, the thrust of which is to close off a considerable number of loopholes in our tax system. It is no secret that many wealthy individuals pay virtually no tax. An industry has been created by accountants and skilled financial experts purely to drive the income tax of certain individuals down to a very low level. This Bill seeks to close off 11 or 12 of those loopholes, something I welcome.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the State will refund in full those individuals who have paid more tax than they should have &ndash; a considerable number of people &ndash; and, in addition, will pay the interest which such tax would have accrued. That is a fair and just move by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the moves he has made in relation to land used by sporting organisations. The GAA, the FAI and the IRFU, through their various clubs and communities, own land throughout the country which in recent years has become infinitely more valuable than the price for which it was purchased many years ago. It is an asset which is lying there and which, in this current economic climate, they should be allowed to use. The fact that the Minister is now letting <Col N="1402" />them sell that land and the money accruing from such sales will not be subject to capital gains tax is a measure I warmly welcome. On a national level, that measure will help the IRFU and the FAI to look forward to the building of a national stadium.</P>
    <P>I had the honour many years ago of representing my province as a schoolboy. I took part in the successful &ldquo;save the Connacht rugby team&rdquo; appeal. I am glad the IRFU took the time to listen to the people when they spoke. One of the arguments put forward by the IRFU was that it had a financial crisis. This move by the Minister will make it realise that the assets it holds can now be used in a much more positive way than that in which they were used in the past.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly allude to a number of sections. In section 2, I welcome the fact that the exemption limit for people who are over the age of 65 has been increased to &euro;15,000 per annum. This again is a reflection of the Government's commitment to looking after those who are most vulnerable in our society. In section 3, the PAYE tax credit has been extended to &euro;800 per annum. This again recognises that those who pay PAYE are, by and large, earning salaries at the lower range. Section 5 deals with short-time workers, to whom special exemption has been extended until December 2004. This is recognition that most people in this sector are earning low levels of income.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the first-time buyer's grant, and we can all reflect back to budget day and the howls of derision that emanated from the Opposition benches. The Minister promised, and is now delivering on that promise, that the benefits of the first-time buyer's grant would actually go to first-time buyers and not to developers. In the past, the grant simply went into the pockets of the developers and pushed up the price of houses. Now, first-time buyers will instead get tax relief, not just for five years but for seven years. In addition, the ceiling upon which that tax relief will be available has been increased to &euro;4,000 per person. The net effect is that first-time buyers will be better off as a result of the Finance Bill 2003.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome section 23, in which the Minister extends until December 2004 the tax benefits which will accrue to those who invest in hotels. In the west and north-west, we have a fledgling tourism industry. It is nothing compared to that which exists in the south and east coasts. There are signs that the tourism industry is beginning to develop, and developers in my county have sought planning permission for at least three major hotel and tourist developments. They would have been in severe difficulty had this exemption not been applied, and I am glad the Minister has listened and brought that in.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill deals with student accommodation. The Minister brings the definitive date for the closure of that tax loophole back to December 2004. That is a very worthwhile development. I had the pleasure of being chair<Col N="1403" />man of the Sligo Institute of Technology over recent years, and we have seen a huge growth in high quality student accommodation in the town. The benefits of the tax allowance have been realised and the student accommodation that is available, not just in Sligo but in most towns that have institutes of technology, is on a par with that which pertains in towns that had a university previously.</P>
    <P>There are three specific requests I ask the Minister to consider as the Bill goes through the House. The first is in relation to the roll-over relief which applies to farmers. Where land is sold to a person who is engaged in farming, I ask the Minister to consider allowing the roll-over to exist for two years. It is important that farming, which has been undergoing a very difficult time over recent years, is allowed this break.</P>
    <P>On the taxation of new cars, a couple of constituents have told me that they purchased new cars on 1 January but were not issued with their tax certification for three or, in once case, four weeks. Given the new laws in relation to penalty points in particular, those people could have been stopped at any time and fined or possibly had penalty points put on their licence for not having a tax disc displayed. I am not sure who is at fault, whether it is the local tax office or the insurance companies, but I ask the Minister to look at this and ensure that once people purchase a new car, they are issued with a tax certificate immediately, not three to four weeks later.</P>
    <P>On student accommodation, it has been traditional in universities to have student accommodation on campus. Many of the institutes of technology have high quality student accommodation, as I have said, but in most cases it is off campus. I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of some financial incentive to encourage the development of on-campus student accommodation. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill is always the cornerstone of any Government's policy and the standard by which it is tested. It is the policy core of any Government, and it is clear to anybody assessing it that the cornerstone of this Government, and of our economic success in recent years, has been a policy of low taxation, both in income tax and corporation tax. Another cornerstone has been a policy of budgetary stability and sustainability. Those policies have been carried through in the Finance Bill 2003, and I commend the Bill to the House for those reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of the criticisms attracted by budgetary measures are comparative criticisms. They are based upon comparisons of what has gone before and what is the case at the moment. A lot of the context is lost in those criticisms, and the context for this extraordinary economy that we all live and work in is that it is the most open economy in the world. Some 93% of our produce is exported, which is an extraordinary figure. That context is hardly ever referred to in criticism and debate on <Col N="1404" />the performance of the economy, but it is the crucial factor.</P>
    <P>Some of the statistics over the past few years are very impressive. Expenditure on social welfare has almost doubled since 1997. Old age pensions have increased, to the surprise of many, and few economies have laid such solid groundwork in terms of pension provision into the future. These pension funds will not accrue political benefits to the Government. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will not be able to boast to the people who receive the benefits of this fund that he created it for them because by the time the fund is paid out, I am sure the Minister will be in receipt of a pension and, I hope, in full health &ndash; I might even be in receipt of a pension myself by that time. This is forward-thinking by the Government, and the Opposition should be generous enough to recognise that the Government does not always do things for short-term political gain and sometimes has its eye on future issues.</P>
    <P>The average increase in the old age pension year-on-year is four times higher than was the case prior to 1997, and it opens up the whole debate about public expenditure. The Opposition is naturally critical of our failure to control public expenditure, but at the same time, it wants spending increases and a reduction in the disease levy. I do not know a whole lot about agriculture. I am from Dún Laoghaire, where we have a lot of big gardens but no farms&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton will forgive my failure to be fully informed on that particular area, but the Opposition is always looking for increases in spending, whether on schools, hospitals or wherever. This is all very worthy and noble, but on the other hand, out of the other side of their mouths, the Opposition criticises increases in public expenditure. There has to be recognition of the Government's difficulty. The Government has addressed this and has controlled public expenditure in 2002 so that we ended up with a surplus at the end of the year of &euro;95 million. It would be an opportune moment for the Opposition to be generous enough to acknowledge that this has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question concerns what we are going to do in 2003. It is clear that the Government has committed itself to managing expenditure as well as it can. For example, each Department will have to provide a monthly spending profile to ensure that spending trends are controlled. It is an effective way of controlling and monitoring spending, and I hope it will serve the benefit of the entire community. The Minister for Finance also proposes the introduction of monthly expenditure management reports to be delivered to Government to ensure that spending trends are kept within the targets set by him in the Estimates. A range of measures are to be introduced, such as <Col N="1405" />risk assessment measures in new Government spending proposals. There is a tighter management of demand-led schemes, particularly in health care. Departments are provided with incentives to improve efficiency. These things provide the value for money that all taxpayers rightly insist on. The Government has control of this vital area and the Opposition does not have a leg to stand on in the criticism it provides.</P>
    <P>Child benefit payments have increased by &euro;105 million. In 1997, child benefit was &euro;38 for the first and second children, but that has more than trebled to &euro;125 since the Rainbow Government disappeared. A further 37,000 people have been taken out of the tax net making a total of 417,000 since 1997. I agree that Fianna Fáil is not entirely responsible for the benefits that have accrued to this economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael is only sorry that it was not in power from 1997 to 2002. It is trying to have its cake and eat it.</P>
      <P>The question of low taxation has been raised in the debate. Members have asked whether we should increase taxes or if stealth taxes have been introduced. A full-page advertisement was taken out in a New York newspaper by 300 economists, including some Nobel laureates, saying that Bush's tax cuts are wrong. A few days later 105 economists, including other Nobel laureates, took out an advertisement with an opposing view. It is very difficult for economists to agree on anything. We do not know if low taxation is serving this economy well or if it would be better served by an increase in taxation. We know the evidence of the past few years has told us that low taxation has served the economy well. Other countries aspire to having an economy like ours and are trying to reduce their level of corporation tax to compete with us. Our low corporation tax is a decisive element in the high level of foreign direct investment here.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposals regarding benefits in kind are to be broadly welcomed. There are some who will pay more, but the simplification of the system has been broadly welcomed. There was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that acknowledged some people would suffer but the simplification is welcomed.</P>
      <P>I understand young farmers are affected by a two-thirds reduction in stamp duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case. There is no equivalent provision for young people in urban areas to purchase property in a similar way. I would like to see the Minister work on this. Hopefully he will provide some relief for young people trying to enter the housing market. It is crippling for any young person to buy a house in Dún Laoghaire. I hope this problem will be reflected in a stamp duties consolidation Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has endeavoured to close tax loopholes in this Bill. Criticisms have been made of him claiming this is the first time he has addressed this issue. Anti-avoidance measures have been a constant theme of the Minister's budgets. A raft of anti-avoidance measures is included in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and elsewhere. For example, section 806 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 deals with the transfer of assets abroad. Friendly societies must show their bona fides and bond washing has been dealt with in previous Acts. Limited partnerships that were taking advantage by setting off losses now have to prove that the losses are not avoidance measures. The Revenue Commissioners can form a view that a transaction has been carried out for the purpose of tax avoidance and the burden is on the person carrying out the transaction to show this is not the case. The Revenue Commissioners have a range of powers that allows them to require the production of documents. Those powers show that anti-avoidance did not come down in the last shower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Connaughton is right. I remember returning to Ireland in the early 1980s to set up a business. At that time there was a high level of emigration; many of my generation had emigrated to England or America. The income tax rate was 68%, while bank interest rates were up to 19%. Investment in Ireland was minimal. Many things have changed since then. The establishment of the CLÁR programme has done wonders for rural areas that have suffered population decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that roll-over relief for farmers and small to medium size business was abolished. It could have an adverse affect on compulsory acquisitions of land for road building and other purposes. I urge the Minister to look at this area again. It was very useful, for example, for a person with a small garage who wanted to <Col N="1407" />expand his business. That this relief has been discontinued will be a disincentive for such a move.</P>
    <P>Others have spoken about the huge benefits the elderly have received in the past six years. While I was canvassing on the peninsulas and islands of west Cork the elderly appreciated the significant increases they received and I hope the increases continue.</P>
    <P>I feel the top rate of stamp duty of 9% is very severe.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the highest such rate in Europe. My worry is that the rate will not encourage people to invest in commercial or other businesses. It may lead to people looking at investing in properties in Britain and elsewhere. It would be a pity if that were to happen. While I accept the decision has probably been made on the 9% rate, I hope the Minister will look at this on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>Capital allowances on hotels have been increased from seven years to 25 years. The western part of my constituency does not have too many hotels. I urge the Minister to revisit this for hotels in CLÁR areas. In the interests of encouraging tourism, a lifeline for these areas, perhaps the Minister for Finance will review the position on this soon.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was brave enough some years ago to reduce the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, he did so on the basis that land for building houses and other developments would be freed up to come on the market. It was a resounding success and, instead of the tax yield being reduced, it increased five-fold. That speaks volumes.</P>
      <P>The Minister promised that this tax would be kept under review. I would have had no difficulty if on this occasion he had increased the rate to 25% or 27.5%. The turnover of property, which has been on a roll in recent years, would have continued and the Exchequer would have received an additional benefit, something with which I would not have had a problem.</P>
      <P>I am aware that public private partnerships are subject to a European ruling which may affect the scope the Minister and his Department may have for taking decisions in this area. Without PPPs, the development of infrastructural projects such as schools, roads, sewerage systems and sports complexes will slow considerably. If public private partnerships are not allowed to continue or develop, many of the projects that were envisaged would be developed in peripheral areas with small populations will not take place. That is a serious issue and I hope the Minister examines it positively and sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Members referred to decentralisation, which is a major issue. The Minister should proceed with the roll-out of this. We have discussed it for the past 20 years and it is time it was put into action. Soon, almost two thirds of the <Col N="1408" />population will live within 20 to 30 miles of Dublin which will place a great strain on the infrastructure and public transport and result in social and housing problems. It is time we realistically tackled the decentralisation issue and relocated Departments to the regions and not 30 to 50 miles from Dublin. In my constituency of Cork South-West, Dunmanway has been starved of jobs for years and is ripe for decentralisation, as are Skibbereen, Bantry and other towns in the west, south-west and north-west. These towns deserve a boost.</P>
    <P>Significant sums of money have been invested in recent years in assisting the intellectually and physically disadvantaged, and it is right that this should have been done. The Minister must ensure that funding for such people is ring-fenced. Many voluntary organisations, such as Co-Action West Cork in my town of Bantry, have done wonderful work in this area over the past ten to 20 years. Such organisations and the intellectually and physically disadvantaged need significantly more funding. Whatever else happens in this or future Finance Bills, funding for these people should be protected and enhanced. Parents, siblings, friends and neighbours have assisted for decades those with physical and mental disadvantages and there should be no let-up in spending on them. We have done a great deal in the previous ten years, but much more remains to be done and not before time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill and am glad of the opportunity to speak on it. There are many other areas with which I would like to have dealt. Deputy Connaughton referred to the problems facing farmers and I am aware that they have experienced certain difficulties. He referred specifically to the doubling of bovine disease levies. Since I was a child growing up on a rural farm we have spoken about the need for TB eradication and the cost involved. Some 40 years later, money is still being spent on it and it has never been more prevalent, certainly in my area. We are getting nowhere. Perhaps it is time for a public inquiry to discover where the money has gone over the years given that we have not had the expected results. If it were invested in another area, there would have been an outcry and uproar. I do not wish to appear to criticise my good friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, but something has gone radically wrong given the amount of money that is obviously being misspent. Despite this, money continues to be allocated to this area. We have not succeeded in eradicating TB in my area, and I imagine that is typical of rural areas in general. We have not won the war and, instead, appear to be regressing.</P>

      <P>I will not be hypocritical. The budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1409" />Deputy McCreevy, some weeks ago has been roundly and justifiably condemned by many people and organisations for its inequitable and unjust provisions, especially in so far as they affect the poorest people, namely, the unemployed, the underprivileged and the socially excluded. These are fellow citizens who are the most in need and deserving of social support.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when in opposition in 1997, criticised the rainbow coalition Government budget strategy and said that when cutbacks in Government spending are necessary, it is always the poorest who suffer most. He has amply demonstrated his belief and perhaps even his commitment to that principle. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has the job of introducing the social welfare provisions of the budget. These will spell out in detail the extent of the injustice being inflicted by the Government on the weaker and disadvantaged sections of society.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to note the paper presented to the tax strategy group which effectively highlighted the extent of the Government's broken promises. It vindicated some of the points we have made, which have been contradicted. It is a pity some of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers are not present to hear the facts. The paper, presented to the tax strategy group by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, detailed the increases in social welfare required to meet the Government's many commitments under the programme for Government, the revised national antipoverty strategy and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Comparisons of these figures with the increases announced in the budget show the full extent of the Government's breach of faith. The Department of Social and Family Affairs calculated that the weekly increase for old age pensioners that would have been necessary to have met the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats promise was &euro;13.20. The weekly increase granted was &euro;10, which was the smallest breach in that the extent of the broken promise was about 24%. The increases in the lowest rate of supplementary welfare payment would have to have been between &euro;10.10 and &euro;15.40. The weekly rise granted was &euro;6, which meant the extent of the broken promise was 41% to 61%. The increase in child benefit that would have been necessary to fulfil the commitment and promises given by the Government was &euro;31.59. A weekly increase of &euro;8 was given, which is a breach of promise to the extent of 75%.</P>
      <P>These are the facts, the Government's figures, and I do not make them up. The contrast is stark and proves what we have said since budget day and what I said during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill on 10 December 2002, that the Government was making the poor pay for its economic mismanagement, and shows that the revised NAPS, like all the Government's promises, is a dead duck. This is the Government's internal position.</P>

      <Col N="1410" />A EUROSTAT document published last week shows Ireland at the bottom of the European Union league in terms of social protection. It states that Ireland's spending on social protection as a share of national income, at 60% of the EU average, is one of the lowest in the EU. If we are at the bottom of the league for caring, we must be at to top of the league for meanness. We live in what is supposed to be one of the richest countries in the world, but I am afraid the old Celtic tiger, in which I never had much faith, was battered to death by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. Our Government spent the least in Europe on social protection even at the height of the boom. The Government will probably now put a tighter squeeze on social spending. It blends in with the view of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, that centre right axis of the Government.</P>
    <P>I see the results of the Government's actions every week at my clinic. A widow, who has been caring for her handicapped son for 30 years, rang me today. Her husband died a few years ago and she is getting a pension. As she is in receipt of a widow's pension she cannot get the respite care grant. We have to change the bureaucratic thinking. She should be able to get the respite care grant. Neither can she get the carer's allowance. I heard the Taoiseach this morning spouting on about the carer's allowance. Does he know what it is? Does he know the eligibility criteria to qualify? It would be easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle than get carer's allowance of &euro;129. It is an absolute scandal and is a great indictment of us all in this House.</P>
    <P>Those people are saving millions for this country and we do not recognise it. Many carers are providing 24-hour care for loved ones in the home where they want to be cared for and eventually die. Many people give up work to look after an elderly uncle, aunt or parent. However we want to means test them. We do not provide the necessary homes. The nursing home subvention is in absolute chaos. We will not give them the &euro;129 that would at least give recognition to the carers. We do not even know how many of them are in the country because we do not want to know. The way we have treated them for the past two decades is a shame on us all over and it annoys me. Prosperous country be damned.</P>
    <P>If Labour was in Government and did not do something for the carers, I would vote against it and people in the party know that. Maybe that is why they are a bit worried about me. Every day I see the work those people do and yet only 20,000 of them qualify out of about 120,000 and there could be 150,000; we do not know. Figures were gathered at the last census and I hope the Government will act on them. I do not make this as a political point but as one for us all to deliver on. Let us pull together to cut out the bureaucracy that states it is not possible to get two payments. Let us reduce the payments and give some recognition to the carers. There is no use talking <Col N="1411" />about things like income disregards as a way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>When we listen to the carers' association and CORI's report yesterday, it is clear we have not done a good job. The way we make social welfare decisions affecting families, children and older people is not just an abstract matter to be discussed in the sheltered environment of Leinster House. It bears on the lives of ordinary people and particularly the poor and disadvantaged. When we hear of cases such as the one I just mentioned, we realise the importance of ensuring they are protected and recognised for the excellent work they do. They need respite grants, which are very important. A widow who looks after somebody all day, should not be refused the respite grant because of some technical regulation. The attitude should be how can we help, not how can we stop or inhibit the person from getting help.  If somebody is looking for something, the first thing we do is to raise the bar instead of lowering it to see if they can be included. This is bureaucratic thinking that should be shaken out for once and for all.</P>
    <P>I had to suffer a wry smile when I heard Deputy Andrews because he is right in saying the Minister should do something to help people get houses. I was spokesperson on the environment for a couple of months. There are 50,000 families who will never get a house. That represents about 300,000 people. The Deputy spoke about stamp duties etc., which is all very well, but where was he when the Minister scrapped the first-time house buyer's grant? Taxation relief of &euro;350 given in the budget is not the same as the £3,500 which is about &euro;4,700. Considering the 1% VAT increase, the average house price has increased by &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews quite fairly and correctly said that people in his constituency in Dún Laoghaire, particularly young people, some with dual incomes, are not able to buy a house. Deputy Cassidy can confirm it is the same in Westmeath and throughout the country. If we want to help those people the Minister will need to put the money where his mouth is. It was a retrograde step to abolish the first-time house buyer's grant. I know the Government argued that the builders were able to subsume it and it was not as high a percentage of the purchase price as when it was introduced some years ago. It is difficult to tell that to young people, who are trying to buy houses in affordable housing schemes involving local authorities.</P>
    <P>The grant often represented a critical deposit to participate in a scheme. I know of people in my county whose names went off that list as soon as that grant was abolished. Those people now go on to the local authority housing list directly and increase the number thereon, reducing the chances of getting a house for everybody. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, should reconsider that. I applaud the Minister for having his own <Col N="1412" />mind, but he saved peanuts by abolishing that grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy is a businessman involved in the tourism sector, who knows much more about the area than I do. The 1% increase in VAT seems to have an impact on tourism, hotels and food. It also feeds into inflation. Tourism is very important for the midlands. Westmeath is the lake county of the midlands and we invite everybody to send people there. We hope to have more attractions in the future. Deputy Cassidy lives beside Fore, one of the most beautiful places in the country. We have Clonmacnoise to the south, Belvedere, which we are very proud of as a tourist centre in Mullingar, brilliant equestrian centres, golf clubs and lakes for fishing.</P>
    <P>There were 173,000 anglers of all types in 1994. At a time when we are trying to bring tourists in for angling, this has reduced to about 81,000 in 2002. It is critical to develop the angling product, but the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, which has among its aims to support and develop the angling product and enhance fish stocks, should realise that the customer is king. The information I am getting is there will be a reduction in the numbers of customers coming for course fishing. We need them for our hotels, guesthouses, and bed and breakfasts. Deputy Cassidy is very familiar with Finea. This is critical income. The Deputy shares my view on this matter. Why was a compulsory &euro;30 levy imposed?</P>

      <P>It is one of the biggest own goals in our sport fishing history. The levy will cover pike and coarse angling on certain designated coarse fisheries and will, therefore, affect tourism operators. The peculiar aspect of this decision, about which Deputy Cassidy whose constituency is also in the heart of the BMW region will be aware, is that most, if not all the waters for which a fee will be necessary are located within the BMW region, an area designated by the European Union as severely disadvantaged in economic development and infrastructural investment, compared to the rest of the country and the EU. It is an unjust and unwise decision which amounts to a fishing licence in all but name. I call on the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to reconsider the levy. The issue has received considerable media attention and is being raised with Deputy Cassidy and myself every day.</P>
      <P>Wisdom must prevail in tourism. Agriculture is under threat in all areas. We have to expand into agri-tourism, fisheries and angling tourism, areas which would supplement incomes and keep people in rural areas. Rural Ireland is under threat. The country does not end at the Pale or Leixlip. If they are to survive, rural areas must receive a fair share of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to operate post offices on an agency basis marks a further withdrawal by An Post from rural Ireland. The poor, unfortunate people who were running rural post offices until <Col N="1413" />now received a pittance. It could not be described as a wage as one could not live on it. Having worked long hours for the company, it has decided to change their status to one of agents. The next step will be to open post offices on Friday only to pay pensions. That would suit the agenda of An Post which has shown no interest in rural Ireland. Every measure it takes marks another step towards complete withdrawal from rural Ireland. We have to resist this kind of culture before it entirely pervades economic thinking here.</P>
    <P>It is critical to the survival of rural Ireland that we invest to attract more tourists to hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and guesthouses in the midlands and into the west. This is the reason the railway structure is so important. The opening of the link between Mullingar and Athlone is critical to developing connections and interchange between the capital town of the county and its educational centre with its thriving institute of technology. The Athlone Institute of Technology provides opportunities for young people to acquire the educational skills which constitute such a strong selling point for this country abroad.</P>
    <P>I was confident decentralisation would logically follow the announcements on spatial strategy and the gateway towns. Mullingar has still not been selected for decentralisation. We salute the surrounding towns which received gateway and hub status and are delighted to see them surviving. Everyone in the midlands is trying to pull together. Bord na Móna, one of our great employers, has shed jobs and now the ESB is under pressure with jobs being lost. These industries are vital to the survival of our rural hinterlands and shops and businesses.</P>
    <P>People living in rural areas are sometimes condemned for their attitude to rural housing. We need rural housing to survive and ordinary people, farmers' sons and daughters, who have been reared in the countryside should be given an opportunity to remain in it. We now have technical advances and environmental ways of dealing with sewage disposal. We should ensure they are developed in the countryside to facilitate people to live in rural areas and become part of the community. Many old people who do not have transport need to have people around them to bring them to church or to a doctor. We must be clear on our policy on rural housing and we, in Westmeath, have strongly articulated our view on the issue.</P>
    <P>Agricultural incomes fell by 8% or 9% last year. The Minister foolishly abandoned roll-over relief on CPOs, which was fundamental to efforts to get on board those farmers who did not want their lands interfered with by building new roads. Having worked out a deal after considerable hard bargaining and negotiation, the Minister has decided to withdraw roll-over relief. This is a stupid mistake, akin to throwing petrol on a fire. He should honour the deal the Government made. <Col N="1414" />People place their trust in Government and expect it to honour its commitments.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous to impose additional levies at a time when economic circumstances are tight. Agriculture here is still strangled by bureaucracy. The other day I read an article in the newspaper about people who moved to Canada to buy land, some of them from the midlands. They were able to buy several thousand acres because it costs just &euro;500 an acre. Their motivation for leaving this country was the bureaucracy that surrounds farming here. It is bad enough trying to survive in farming without red tape. The Minister has failed to minimise bureaucracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing time on this important Finance Bill. I agree with most of his remarks on rural Ireland. Many of the issues he touched on are raised in all constituencies which have a strong base in agricultural tourism and fishing. He made some solid points which the Government should consider in the context of amendments on Committee Stage, particularly with regard to the &euro;30 fee being charged to anglers and the 1% VAT imposed on tourism. The latter measure was a retrograde step as hotels have already set their price lists and completed their marketing job for 2003. It was poor timing to levy an increase in VAT of 1% at the end of 2002 as it will effectively remove 1% from the tourism sector's bottom line.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision to extend the urban renewal incentives from June 2004 to December 2004. It is essential to develop the integrated areas which benefited from the urban renewal incentives, many of which are derelict sites for which investment and investors have been lacking. The goal must be to tidy them up and generate economic activity on them that would ultimately create employment.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny city has a very important integrated area around the railway station site, consisting of 14 acres of land. Its status of integrated area was sanctioned by the former Minister of State, Robert Molloy. Now that the decision has been made to extend the urban renewal scheme to December 2004, it is important that the site is developed.</P>
      <P>We should be hard and fast on this issue. Before the next Finance Bill is introduced in 2004, the Minister should seek to establish, through a report, what progress is being made in the integrated areas. It is important the areas covered by the scheme are developed. If this requires extending it for a further six months to ensure the job is done, the Minister should do so in the next Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national spatial strategy was an important announcement by the Minster for the Environment and Local Government, which identified gateways and hubs around the country. I agree with Deputy Penrose that one would have expected that there would be an early announcement about decentralisation. There have been studies over a long period and certain areas might have been upset if they were not the beneficiaries <Col N="1415" />of some largesse coming up to the general election. That is understandable in politics but since the election there has been much toing and froing in regard to when the announcement will be made about the centres that will benefit from decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement of a Teagasc office for Carlow town but I want to put a case to the Minister and the Government in relation to Kilkenny city. We have a number of important sites in Kilkenny and we have made a number of submissions to the Government over the years to have a Department, or part of a Department, decentralised to Kilkenny. I hope the Minister will look favourably on that application. I am aware he is under pressure to keep everyone happy. That is not possible but the sooner he makes the decision, the sooner we will have certainty about these matters.</P>
    <P>On the general fiscal position, it is well established now that there was a great deal of misinformation given out before the last general election about the state of the nation's finances. Since then, we have had a budget a week by way of stealth taxes which all add up to make employment more expensive and lessen an employee's disposable income. The 1% VAT increase will cost a typical household an extra &euro;182 per year. Motor tax on an average car has increased by &euro;30. Hospital charges are up &euro;133 for a typical family. The drug refund scheme threshold is up a massive 31%. VHI is up 18%. Cigarettes and alcohol are up 15%. In respect of bank charges, &euro;83 is the extra cost to a typical household. Bin charges and commercial rates have also increased. ESB bills are up 13%. TV licences are up 40%. That all adds up to an 18% increase in the costs that accrue to a typical family. For every worker in the country that is an average of &euro;35 a week.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is the 40% increase in the public expenditure bill in 2001 and 2002 in order to win the election. When we look back on the nation's finances, the biggest difficulty that arose in 2001 was the foot and mouth disease outbreak which was unfortunate because had that not occurred, we might have had the election out of the way in 2001, the country would be in a better financial position and many of these extra charges would not have been necessary.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Attorney General, who was sitting at the Cabinet table at the time and who had many opinions on various matters, particularly relating to the economy, allowed us as a nation to squander the boom and allowed these additional charges to be levied on people. We have had a tax and spend Government over the past number of years and that has to change if we want to have an enterprising economy and workers in jobs. We are correcting the nation's finances at the expense of employment and that is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>By increasing the cost pressures in the economy, the Government is now directly causing job <Col N="1416" />losses. In the past two years, while the binge on expenditure was going on, more than one in five jobs in the companies backed by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland was lost. That is a significant amount of the core productive base of our economy. The Government has forgotten the basic lesson about a small, open economy. It cannot plough on with tax and spend policies and believe it will not have an impact on the enterprise sector. Surely the Government learned that lesson in the past. It is now time to redress and reverse in this Finance Bill some of the decisions taken that will mitigate against investment and small businesses.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a number of suggestions. The reversal of the roll-over relief, which was mentioned earlier, was a retrograde step, and not just for those engaged in the CPO process for land building. It is also important for capital investment in small business in that people were able to roll over the relief and get significant investment, construction and employment in many sectors, particularly in tourism and the commercial sector generally.</P>
    <P>We must invest in broadband infrastructure and alleviate the bottlenecks in the economy if we want to remain competitive. On the stamp duty increase, I agreed with Deputy O'Donovan earlier when he said that would have a serious impact on investment in housing and in commercial activity both inside and outside of Dublin. Deputy O'Donovan mentioned his own constituency of west Cork where the 6% to 9% increase in stamp duty will have a slowing effect on the level of activity in housing and in commercial property. There are two million square feet of commercial property lying vacant or not committed in the general Dublin region. That is a great deal of property that has yet to be taken up by investors and if they want to purchase that property, the additional 3% stamp duty will make them sit up and think. I have found already, as I declare my interest in the auctioneering business, that people are having second thoughts about investments they might have considered in 2003. They are having a rethink because of the imposition of this additional stamp duty.</P>
    <P>The Government has contributed enormously to inflation but it must now publish its strategy on the anti-inflation measures it promised. It could start by freezing all charges and fees on public utilities such as electricity, gas, waste and telecommunications until a programme of greater competition is introduced. It is only through greater competition that prices will stabilise or reduce but it is not fair on the private sector that the Government can impose, willy-nilly, large increases on the public utilities. That will have an impact on our competitiveness and will ultimately contribute to job losses.</P>
    <P>Small businesses are under pressure. The VAT threshold for small businesses is too low at &euro;50,000. That should be increased to &euro;100,000. Also, in the context of the audit and accountancy Bill published recently, the Minster should assist many small firms which now have a very low rate <Col N="1417" />of turnover while they are subject to audit. With the impositions on businesses arising from the new companies Act that will come into effect this year, the level of turnover, where companies are exempt from audit, should be increased to &euro;1 million.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is the implementation of a much different financial picture than was the case 12 months ago. The Government has created this problem and is now trying to solve it by way of stealth taxes and reductions in expenditure at a time when the economy needs a boost. The imposition of additional taxes on enterprise is not the way to boost economic activity and employment at a time when the economy is under pressure due to increased costs.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I also welcome the Bill. I want to address a number of points in the few minutes remaining tonight and hope to continue my contribution tomorrow morning. In any financial measure that comes before this House, there will be shortfalls and room for criticism but there are many good measures in this Bill. The measures I particularly welcome are the tax incentives to encourage people to contribute to their local sporting organisations and bodies which have charitable status. As I understand it, if one contributes a certain amount it can be off-set against one's tax liability.</P>
      <P>The amount of work being done throughout the country by sporting organisations and community groups which have charitable status is enormous, and they must be congratulated on that. This measure will make it somewhat easier for those bodies to raise voluntary funds. I am aware from my own involvement and from listening to other people that one of the most difficult tasks facing any committee member of any organisation or community group is to raise funds for development or even to keep the show on the road. In the old days we could sell tickets for £1 but now they can cost &euro;20, which can be difficult. I hope this measure will make it easier to ensure the sporting organisations can raise funds more easily. I also welcome the initiative from the Minister regarding young farmers' stock relief which applies for certain young farmers up to 31 December 2004, extending the life of the scheme. When it was not mentioned in the budget many young farmers were worried it would be dropped and they would be unable to continue. I welcome anything we can do to encourage more people into farming.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting my topic.</P>
      <P>I wish to go through my record on raising the issue of Muff Garda station. It is a small village station about three miles from Derry and the village is a big gateway into Inishowen. The village of Muff has historically been small but a huge housing expansion there means it is now a town rather than a village and accordingly, the facilities for local gardaí need to be of an appropriate standard. The building they were housed in was condemned and approximately 20 years ago it was at number 14 on the priority list of the Office of Public Works and the Garda. I have tracked what has happened regarding this small but very important station.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue of Muff Garda station on 4 April 2000 and was told there were plans for a new basic unit station for Muff but that there was no real decision on the date for commencement of work. By 14 June 2000 the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, confirmed that Muff featured on the current Garda building programme priority list as requiring a new station to support the policing requirements of the area. At that stage it was intended to demolish the existing station and to construct a new station on the site. The Minister included the proviso that he did not know how long it would take; he did not know when he could build a new station.</P>
      <P>On 9 January 2001 the Minister wrote again to me and stated the Commissioners of Public Works had entered consultations with Donegal County Council regarding a proposal to provide alternative accommodation for the gardaí at a particular residence in Muff. By 9 January 2001 they had gone from demolishing the existing building and rebuilding to a move to another building in the village.</P>
      <P>On 22 May 2001 I was told that temporary accommodation had been provided for the gardaí because they had threatened not to stay in Muff. The situation was dire at that point. I was also told that negotiations were being undertaken by the Office of Public Works to secure a suitable and permanent new location for the gardaí in the town. The negotiations continued through May to July and by October 2001 those negotiations had been completed. The Office of Public Works was then attending to the legal requirements necessary to conclude matters.</P>
      <P>In November 2001 I was told the Office of Public Works expected to be in a position shortly to sign a contract to allow the gardaí to move from their temporary accommodation to their new permanent location within the town; the Office of Public Works would sign the contract and proceed as soon as certain necessary legal requirements were concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 2002 I was told that the Office of Public Works had signed the contract for the purchase of <Col N="1419" />alternative accommodation for the Garda station and was awaiting completion of the transaction by the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
    <P>In October 2002 I was told by the Office of Public Works that the legal formalities necessary to secure the alternative accommodation for the Garda station referred to by me were completed. Moreover I was informed that the Office of Public Works was asked to carry out the required alterations to the building to facilitate an early occupation by the gardaí.</P>
    <P>It is with great surprise then that on 13 February 2003 I was told that the Commission of Public Works regards Muff Garda station as No. 3 on the Garda priority programme and that it is hoped to have a contractor on site in the latter half of 2003.</P>
    <P>There is patience and there is patience. I understand a house was bought for the purpose of conversion into a Garda station. The process involved was long and arduous as I have shown in the parliamentary question system but if a house was ready to be moved into in October 2002 how are we talking now about putting contractors on site in 2003? I do not understand this and I do not accept it. It is not fair on the gardaí and shows a lack of respect for them from the authorities. It sends out a bad message. I want the gardaí to be visible on the streets but they cannot be on the streets if they do not have an adequate station to work from. I look forward to some clarification of this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The existing station at Muff was in need of major internal and external refurbishment and the Commissioners of Public Works endeavoured to procure suitable premises to be used as alternative accommodation and it was proposed to purchase an existing premises at 3 Dispensary Court, Muff. Contracts were received in February 2001 and protracted negotiations ensued because of the restrictive covenant in the vendor's title restricting its use to that of a dwelling house. It was only by letter dated 5 March 2002 that they were informed of the removal of this stipulation and the matter was then referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office, which advised that the sale was closed on 9 July 2002. In the intervening period between the receipt of the contracts for the property in February 2001 and the acquisition of same in July 2002, the Commissioners of Public Works in accordance with Part XIII of SI 86 of 1994, Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 1994, completed a planning consultation for change of use from a dwelling house to a Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Upon receipt of a report from the Health and Safety Authority, the station party in Muff Garda station vacated the old station on 16 May 2001. In view of the urgent requirement for temporary accommodation, the Commissioners of Public <Col N="1420" />Works arranged for the immediate installation of a temporary portacabin. The temporary accommodation was put in place on 21 May 2001 and continues to operate as a Garda station to date.</P>
    <P>When the purchase of the premises at 3 Dispensary Court was completed, the Commissioners of Public Works agreed a brief of accommodation requirements with the Garda authorities. The preparation of architectural tender invitation documents that will meet with the necessary fire regulations and associated mechanical and electrical tender invitation documents are being prepared at present.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern about what might be construed as a delay but I reiterate that the Commissioners of Public Works have pursued the acquisition of the property to be used as the new station single-mindedly, and when the old station was vacated they immediately put arrangements in hand to house the station party in temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda occupy in excess of 700 Garda stations and other units of accommodation around the country. Many of these were built before the foundation of the State and were designed for a different era. This extensive resource, while invaluable in guaranteeing the provision of policing services to the community, creates its own unique maintenance and refurbishment demands. Consequently, all Garda accommodation is continually under review by the Commissioners of Public Works in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities to ensure that it meets the operational requirements of the Garda. Where it does not, the necessary works are prioritised by the aforementioned parties with the appropriate degree of urgency to ensure, as far as feasible, the ordered, timely and economically efficient construction or refurbishment of Garda stations as policing requirements demand and overall priorities allow.</P>
    <P>I confirm that the Commissioners of Public Works are anxious to expedite the opening of the new Garda station at Muff. In that regard, the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with the other parties involved, in particular the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, hope to have a contractor on site in the latter half of 2003.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Deputy is concerned about the matter and I will convey her concern to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for letting me raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming in to address the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of national importance. There are many students in special needs schools and much good work is being done with them in those schools. It is Government policy, however, to assist and encourage the integration of special needs students, where possible, into mainstream <Col N="1421" />primary schools. This is causing a problem where the policy exists, but there is no support on the ground. I submitted questions on the matter on 29 November 2002 and 29 January 2003. On both occasions the Minister for Education and Science told me that there are issues regarding the concept of dual enrolment but that no decisions had been taken on these matters. I am here to urge the Minister of State to move as quickly as possible to sort out these important issues for special children. The Minister is personally concerned with this and I know his heart is in the right place.</P>
    <P>These children attend primary schools on a wing and a prayer. Grace and favour is involved but they should be able to attend these schools as of right. Procedures should be in place whereby principals of primary schools know how they are to react to and support these children. Capitation, school transport, insurance and staffing must be sorted out.</P>
    <P>If it is Government policy that integration should occur, I challenge the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Science to act. They should start work immediately to sort out the issue. Many special needs children and their parents are under stress without extra pressure being put on them. They do not know from one day to the next if the child will be allowed into the school. I am not blaming the teachers because they are also under pressure when special needs children attend &ndash; they also need support.</P>
    <P>Dual enrolment is vitally important if there is to be integration. It is not possible for a child to be enrolled in two schools at one time and if special needs children are to be integrated this should be Government policy. The Minister must put the procedures in place, issue the circulars and directives and make available the necessary resources to allow this to occur without further delay.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will not just read out a script that has been prepared but that he will put his personal stamp on this.</P>

      <P>I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey. The issues raised by the Deputy are very important and while the reply I will deliver does not add a great deal to what he has said, it is important that the issue has been raised. The Minister is aware of the issues to which the Deputy refers and the potential benefits which a dual enrolment arrangement might afford to certain children with special needs as part of their transition from the special school system to mainstream schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with special educational needs may transfer from special schools to special classes attached to ordinary primary schools or to ordinary classes where they may attend on a fully integrated basis with the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant service. In considering such transfers, it is important to have regard to the professionally assessed needs of the <Col N="1422" />child involved and his or her capacity to function successfully in the more integrated setting.</P>
    <P>The concept of dual enrolment, however, raises a range of practical issues which require careful consideration, as the Deputy has fairly conceded. These issues relate to such matters as the manner in which staffing and funding resources allocated in respect of such children should be apportioned between two schools catering for the same pupil for limited periods. Issues relating to capitation funding and entitlement to special transport services also arise. While no decisions have yet been made on these issues, the matter is under consideration in the Department and I am hopeful that progress can be made to facilitate the needs of the children concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister for Education and Science to explain to this House on what legal basis and when, how and why he decided to hand computer copies of 41,000 files of former residents of residential institutions, such as industrial schools, to a non-governmental organisation, the Barnardo's charity. These are highly sensitive, personal files of residents of residential institutions run by religious orders. Many such residents were treated in an appalling way during their stay in these institutions &ndash; beaten, starved and deprived of family life, and a horrific number were subject to depraved sexual abuse. In light of what we know now, how could the Minister and the Department of Education and Science decide to hand over copies of these files to an NGO without public debate or discussion on the pros and cons of such an arrangement? Not only was there no debate in the Dáil, but former residents and organisations representing them seem to have been told little or nothing of this scheme.</P>
      <P>The current arrangement is that former residents or their legal representatives can access their records directly from the Department of Education and Science. The Department of Education and Science is properly subject to the Data Protection Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Ombudsman Act, and the Official Secrets Act. Will the NGO that received these records be subject to these laws, both to protect the confidentiality of these records and to guarantee all former residents of these institutions access to all their personal records?</P>
      <P>What of former residents who do not wish for their own personal reasons to use the services of the NGO? Have they recourse to the Department? Has a legal arrangement been put in place with Barnardo's? Were the financial arrangements and the moneys paid and those to be paid to the NGO subject to a tender or contract process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Barnardo's is a highly reputable NGO and my concern is not with it but with this extraordinary decision of the Minister. The Minister and the Taoiseach have made much of the State's apology to former residents and their concern to promote <Col N="1423" />redress, healing and closure for former residents. In reality the Government has been more concerned with protecting the concerns of the religious orders that ran and controlled these institutions.</P>
    <P>Much of the abuse that occurred happened because of the powerlessness and poverty of the residents compared with the magisterial authority and power of the Catholic Church in the first 50 years of the State. Belatedly, the State has acknowledged its share of the responsibility for these abuses but now it proposes to again treat former residents as objects without power, where decisions on their personal records can be made by the Department of Education and Science in secret without reference to them, the Dáil or the wider public.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Minister for Health and Children may be exploring similar proposals to give the adoption records of 40,000 people to Barnardo's without reference to organisations representing people who have been adopted, such as the Adopted People's Association, APA. For the State to take unilateral decisions on such sensitive personal information is a scandal.</P>
    <P>A further issue which needs to be clarified is the Minister's transfer of computer copies of the records to the Laffoy Commission and possibly the Residential Institutions Redress Board. I ask the Minister if these include records of convictions in respect of former residents of institutions. In some cases, former residents of institutions were committed to these institutions on foot of having been found guilty as children of a range of often minor offences by District Courts. What are the implications of this for the commission and the redress board in terms of decisions they may reach on the treatment of former residents? Many of those who were convicted of offences as children would seriously question that they were guilty of anything other than poverty and powerlessness. The Government should initiate a full and open debate and dialogue on these arrangements. Outsourcing those records is not acceptable without full consultation and debate with those affected. Can the Minister of State explain why a full State records service is not the most appropriate way of addressing these very sensitive and important issues for the individuals concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has canvassed a wide range of issues in this very sensitive area. The Department of Education and Science maintains archival records in relation to approximately 43,000 former residents of the old industrial and reformatory schools system. These former pupils were placed in the schools by way of court orders. The records are maintained in the Department's offices in Athlone and are in paper form with copies in electronic format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department currently processes requests under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 for access to records by former residents of the old <Col N="1424" />industrial and reformatory schools. However, the FOI Act does not provide a mechanism for ensuring that the often sensitive issues arising in these records or matters such as tracing of lost family members are addressed. With this in mind and in order to ensure that a more comprehensive, compassionate and supportive service could be provided to former residents than is currently available from the Department under the Freedom of Information Act, the Department of Education and Science agreed to support the provision of an information and mediation service by Barnardos for former residents who wish to access their records.</P>
    <P>The Department did not consider a public tendering process appropriate for such a sensitive service and routed it through Barnardos, which had considerable expertise and experience in this area. While Barnardos provides a service in relation to tracing and reunion for adopted persons, there are no current plans in the Department of Health and Children to give them original records which are in the possession of the Department in this regard. A copy of all relevant records held by the Department has been given to Barnardos in electronic format to facilitate the operation of the new service and the training of their staff.</P>
    <P>Access to the records is strictly controlled and Barnardos have given a guarantee that only the records of those who have asked Barnardos to act on their behalf will be accessed. Barnardos will act as agents of the Department and the operation of the service will be governed by a legally binding service agreement, which is currently being finalised. Prior to the transfer of the records to Barnardos, the Department consulted with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and took data protection requirements into account in framing proposals for the new service.</P>
    <P>The Department consulted widely with many of the groups representing former residents of the old industrial and reformatory schools when planning the new service, which is known as &ldquo;Origins.&rdquo;  The response from the groups was generally positive. In addition, the head of the Origins service met informally with the heads of the four main survivor groups who supported the introduction of the service.</P>
    <P>All former residents retain an absolute right to access their records from the Department under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. In any dealings such residents have with the Department, they also retain the right of recourse to the Ombudsman's Office. It will be a matter for each individual to decide whether to access their records through the Department under the freedom of information legislation or through the service now being offered by Barnardos. There is no question of any former resident being denied his or her legal or statutory rights. The service being offered by Barnardos is designed specifically with the best interests of the former residents in mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" />The Department views the service being offered by Barnardos as a valuable alternative method of accessing personal records. It is not intended in any way as a replacement for the legal route under the Freedom of Information Act but as a more focused and compassionate alternative. It takes account of the issues affecting people who receive records of their period of residency in an industrial or reformatory school. Similarly, it assists those who have been unable to trace any records &ndash; which often proves more upsetting for the former resident &ndash; and offers a back-up support in the form of counselling, tracing and mediation which the Department is not in a position to offer.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of a statutory provision for records in this area. The Department of Health and Children is, of course, a creature of statute and is subject to the statutes I have outlined. The establishment of a separate statutory agency would delay the assistance which the individuals concerned require. It would require legislation to be brought before the House and would, in all probability, involve incurring additional expenditure in the establishment of the relevant statutory body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter. In February 1997, the then Minister for Arts, Culture, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, introduced the EU Habitats Directive. The Government press release at that time stated that the regulations would allow for the definition and protection of approximately 400 proposed special areas of conservation, or SACs, occupying 550,000 hectares or some 5% of our land mass. The then Minister further stated that the regulations would not interfere with the practice of traditional farming in the areas concerned. He described all partners in the scheme as working together in a valuable national plan. He said landowners would be fairly compensated for any loss of income and would be advised of their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone was this promise not honoured by successive Governments but the sterilisation of farmers' land as SACs continues relentlessly. The current situation is that 11% of our land area is designated as SAC which, together with 3% designated as marine SACs, brings the total area sterilised by the Habitats Directive to 14%. In County Mayo, over 20% of the land area is designated as SAC, NHA, natural heritage area, or SPA, special protection area. At a public meeting organised by the IFA in Ballina, County Mayo last night, over 300 angry farmers demanded action from Government. The majority view from the meeting was that farmers feel totally let down by the system which has been in operation and the lack of credible and adequate compensation which they had been promised. They are so upset that they are now insisting that their land be de-<Col N="1426" />designated, that the slate be wiped clean and that a fresh start be made.</P>
    <P>People feel they have been robbed of their livelihood and their future. These sterilising statutes have effectively devalued the land, leaving the owners with a bitter taste in their mouths. An asset which was once considered valuable is now virtually worthless. Farmers have held their precious land, which has been defended courageously over the years and coloured by the blood of those who resisted the tyranny of land-grabbing English planters and the vile Black and Tans, dear to their hearts. They now feel totally betrayed at being routed from the very land where even Cromwell was prepared to leave them. What hurts most of all is that they believe they have been sold out by their own Government. This situation will do nothing for the population of an area which has been identified on the basis of census figures as the most economically deprived area in Ireland and where <i>homo sapiens </i>is now an endangered species. I sometimes wonder if we would be treated better if we were an animal species facing extinction.</P>
    <P>The SAC scheme has not worked. The Government should clean the slate and start all over again. The huge resentment and loss of faith in Government on this issue is very real and palpable on the ground. How can people be blamed for feeling let down? They were told the designations would apply to 5% of the country, not 14%. They assumed that upland areas would be affected, not the right to build in lowland areas. They trusted that adequate compensation would be paid, but that did not happen. The proud inheritance for which generations in my area slaved and fought, intending it to be passed on to the next generation of farmers, is now worthless. What use is land if one cannot plant or drain it, let animals graze on it, build on it or enhance it in any way?</P>
    <P>We are totally over-regulated. People can no longer engage freely in sea fishing or angling competitions. A small farmer will now be prevented from supplementing his income from the land by catching a few fish, while a large super-trawler will scour the entire coastal area within a few hours. Farmers are being forced to de-stock their few sheep because of a change in policy. Our youth are being deprived of their rightful inheritance. If our young people depart, what have we left? We will simply have one big national park, devoid of people. That is happening already. In one case of which I am aware, every inch of a farmer's 200 acres is designated. Consequently, he is prevented from giving even one site to his children. They now must go and live in a far-away urban centre, where they do not want to be and where there are already too many people, with all the problems that living in a place with too many people brings. What sort of logic is this? Give us back our future. De-designate SACs.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil don Teachta Cowley as ucht na ceiste tábhachtacha seo a ardú ar an Athló agus deis labhartha a thabhairt domsa.</P>
      <P>The habitats directive was adopted in 1992 and requires member states to propose areas for designation as special areas of conservation, SACs, to safeguard Europe's most important wildlife areas. The Government committed itself to the implementation of the directive in Ireland, both in view of its nature conservation objectives and to meet our EU obligations.</P>
      <P>The process of proposing land and freshwater areas in Ireland for designation as SACs is nearing completion. As the Deputy suggests, the final extent will be close to 11% of our land area, or about 800,000 hectares. The increase over earlier estimates is, however, much less than suggested. As far back as February 1997, when the habitats regulations were introduced, an area of 550,000 hectares was estimated. This has been stated by various sources to be 5%, but was about 8%, of the country's land area. In round terms, of the 11% now estimated, 1% is national parks and other State lands, 1% is large lakes, leaving 9%, or about 650,000 hectares, where lands in private ownership are affected.</P>
      <P>An increase in the extent of habitat designations is part of a pattern across Europe. National proposals for SACs have been subject to international evaluation. As a result of this process, all member states have had to put forward additional proposals, to meet their full obligations under the directive and to ensure consistency of implementation. In terms of percentages of territory proposed, Ireland is close to the middle of the range.</P>
      <P>In general, existing farming activities are fully compatible with the conservation requirements of designated areas. In such circumstances there will be no need to place restrictions on farming activity. These areas attract a higher level of payments for farmers who join REPS, administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food. I remain committed to paying fair and reasonable compensation to landowners for any actual loss incurred as a result of necessary restrictions of farming activity for conservation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" />As the Deputy pointed out, why should farmers be at a loss? It would be tantamount to handing over their land to the State and therefore it is vitally important that there is fair and reasonable compensation. I would be anxious to get details of the cases of which Deputy Cowley has knowledge and certainly would be only too pleased to look at those in conjunction with the officials concerned.</P>
    <P>At all times care is taken to respect the property rights of landowners, and that is absolutely essential. We in the Department want to ensure that necessary care is taken to respect the rights of the landowners. The process of designating land is carried out in accordance with the relevant legislation. That legislation provides for notification of known landowners, public advertisement, and a three-month period for objections.</P>
    <P>There is no general prohibition on new activities or development within SACs. On the reference which has been made by the Deputy to afforestation or to building on lands, I intend that this will be more fully outlined in the updating of relevant planning guidelines. People should have a right to build on their land. Of course there is a great debate about single houses. It is tremendous in rural Ireland, in my county as in County Mayo, to see new houses being built and people coming home and having an opportunity to live in their own areas. The Minister intends that this will be more fully outlined in the updating of the planning guidelines. Of course there will be an opportunity to discuss this matter at a later stage when these guidelines are made available. New development must be subject to appropriate assessment, usually within the planning system, and can proceed except where significant damage would be caused to the habitat. At all times common sense must, and should, prevail.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place with farming organisations on compensation and other aspects of implementation of the directive. The Department is ready to continue these discussions when the organisations involved are available to do so. I look forward to further discussions on this vitally important matter with those organisations which represent the interests of farmers.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 February 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the take-over by the EU of the current NATO-led security operation in FYROM have been ongoing at EU level for some time, as reflected in the conclusions of successive EU Council meetings at Barcelona and Seville. In this regard, the agreement on permanent arrangements reached between the EU and NATO at the European Council held at Copenhagen in December 2002 has facilitated progress. A subsequent key development was the invitation to the EU on 17 January from the Macedonian authorities to take over the mission from NATO.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs and External Relations Council, held on 27 and 28 January 2003, an EU Council joint action was approved which confirmed the EU's decision in principle to conduct the operation in FYROM. Following on from the joint action, it is envisaged that all of the arrangements will now be in place for a take-over by the EU of the operation in early March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint action also provided for the arrangements for the financing of the operation. In this regard, the principles agreed by the EU for the financing of military operations on 17 June 2002 have been followed. Ireland's position in relation to the financing of such operations has been to maximise the extent that participating member states are liable for their own costs. However, in an operation involving multinational contingents, it is inevitable that some costs will have to be met on a shared basis. The joint action has included an estimated reference amount of &euro;4.7 million in common costs that would be met by the EU <Col N="1430" />member states with other participating countries making an appropriate contribution. Ireland's share of this, at approximately 1%, is estimated at &euro;50,000 per six month rotation.</P>
    <P>On 7 February, the GAERC approved by written procedure the appointment of Admiral Rainier Feist of Germany as the operation commander. Admiral Feist also holds the NATO appointment of Deputy Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. The appointment of Admiral Feist as the operation commander is a pragmatic example of the benefits entailed in the conclusion of the permanent arrangements between the EU and NATO. In this regard, the appointment will ensure a smooth transition from the existing NATO-led operation to an EU-led operation.</P>
    <P>Powers of decision in relation to the nature and termination of the operation will be vested in the GAERC, while day to day political control and strategic direction will be undertaken by the political and security committee under the authority of the Council. Ireland's participation in the operation will be subject to our national decision making procedures. At EU level the force generation process has commenced. The question of Ireland's participation is likely to be considered by the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The operation is one of a range of EU support measures aimed at bringing FYROM closer to EU standards and principles in the context of ongoing support to the peace and stabilisation process in FYROM and implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement. The framework agreement, which was signed by the four main political parties in August 2001, brought to an end a period of ethnic violence and instability in the country. The core of the agreement is a series of constitutional amendments designed to safeguard minority rights, strengthen local government and secure more proportionate ethnic Albanian representation in state institutions.</P>
    <P>The United Nations, in Resolution 1371, dated 26 September 2001, welcomed international efforts, including the efforts of the EU, to prevent the escalation of ethnic tensions in the area, and endorsed the efforts of member states to support the implementation of the framework agreement. One of the key tasks of the operation will be to provide support to international monitors and other international actors in FYROM. Ireland already has a significant presence with EU and OSCE monitoring missions in the western Balkans, including the current head of the EU monitoring mission, Ambassador Anton MacUnfraidh.</P>

These aircraft will replace the Siai Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. These aircraft will be delivered in 2004. In addition, two helicopters and one fixed wing aircraft owned by the Garda Síochána are flown by the Air Corps. The two helicopters are currently serviceable. The fixed wing is on scheduled main<Col N="1432" />tenance and is expected back in service by 21 February 2003.</P>

Accordingly, I have decided that Belmont Huts, Cobh, County Cork, will be disposed of by public tender. Arrangements will be put in train as soon as possible in this regard. It would be inappropriate of me to disclose a valuation for the property in advance of the sale.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 126, 131, 133 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>On 15 January 2003 I approved in principle the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board. This implementation board was established to formulate a plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve. The steering group, which I established to undertake a study of the Reserve, reported to me in September 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces Training Centre. The Reserve Defence <Col N="1433" />Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</P>
    <P>Plans are currently being prepared by each general officer commanding a brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of the proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an army reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall army reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve Defence Force, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army.</P>
    <P>I am very mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread. The strength of the reserve on the 31 December 2002 was 13,835.</P>
    <P>As regards the future of the reserve in County Roscommon, no final decision has yet been made. I can assure the Deputy that there will be a reserve presence in Roscommon but it may have a different role in the new organisation than it has at present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 117 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have undergone various reviews and significant change in the past 12 years. This change process has focused on structural, operational, training and manpower issues. The process culminated in the White Paper on Defence in 2000 which lays down a defence management strategy for ten years. One of the main outcomes of the various reviews is that the Defence Forces are significantly different in size and in structure from what they were in 1990. They have reduced in strength from 13,500 to 10,500 with an option of up to 250 in training. Recruitment to the Defence Forces will continue throughout this year to maintain an average strength of about 10,600 personnel.</P>
      <P>In 2002 a total of 4,234 applications were received for consideration for positions in the Permanent Defence Force. Of this figure, 2,750 were applications for general service recruitment. As a result, 500 general service recruits were enlisted, of whom 93 were subsequently discharged. At present, 117 recruits are in training. The allocation by barracks of those who successfully completed recruit training and have remained in service is as set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The number of applications received for cadetships in 2002 was 1,047. Some 143 applications were received for apprenticeships in the Air Corps. As a result of these competitions, 71 cadets and 17 Air Corps apprentices were enlisted during 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Direct entry competitions for appointments for medical officers, engineers, ordnance corps officers, watchkeeping officers, engine room officers, electrical and engine room artificers in the Naval Service and instrumentalists in the Army School of Music were also held. In 2002, a <Col N="1435" />total of 294 applications were received for those competitions. As a result, 27 direct entry officers, 15 electrical and engine room artificers and 8 <Col N="1436" />instrumentalists were appointed. The selection process in respect of some of these competitions is ongoing and it is expected that there will be further appointments this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to update the Deputy on continuing developments in the area of European Security and Defence Policy in so far as my area of responsibility is concerned.</P>
      <P>The breakthrough on an overall EU-NATO agreement at the Copenhagen European Council, 12 and 13 December 2002, has given significant impetus to ESDP. Matters are proceeding in accordance with principles established at the Feira European Council, which provide that there should be full respect for the autonomy of EU decision-making, recognition of the different nature of the EU and NATO, and no discrimination against any of the member states.</P>
      <P>Agreement on permanent arrangements between the EU and NATO, as reached at the Copenhagen European Council, has opened the way for an EU takeover of the current NATO-led, UN-supported &ldquo;Allied Harmony&rdquo; military monitoring and stabilisation mission in FYROM. First anticipated by the Barcelona and Seville European Councils, and with a view to assisting with full implementation of the 2001 Framework Peace Agreement for FYROM, the Copenhagen European Council also provided for the finalisation of work on the EU's overall approach to the operation.</P>
      <P>At the January General Affairs and External Relations Council, a joint action was agreed confirming the EU's decision in principle to act. Considerable progress has been achieved in recent weeks in planning for the EU take-over and member states have been asked for indications of the numbers of personnel they wish to contribute. It is anticipated that the EU-led mission will be similar in size to the current &ldquo;Allied Harmony&rdquo; mission, that is, approximately 300-350 personnel.</P>
      <P>It is expected that Foreign Ministers will be asked to approve a joint action providing for the actual launch of the operation in late February and the operation itself will commence during the course of March. At the Copenhagen Council the EU also indicated its willingness to lead a follow-on operation to the UN-authorised, NATO-led Stabilisation Force, SFOR, in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consultations with NATO and with the Bosnian authorities in this regard are ongoing and it is likely that the EU will be in a position to take over the mission early in 2004. SFOR is a significantly larger military operation than the current NATO-led &ldquo;Allied Harmony&rdquo; operation in FYROM. Although currently being downsized, it is likely to consist of approximately 6,000 personnel by early 2004, when it is anticipated the EU will be in a position to take over the mission.</P>
      <P>Development of military capabilities for crisis management is continuing through implementation of the European Capabilities Action Plan. Member states have been invited to offer more focused contributions to the headline goal or to refine existing ones in order to rectify certain shortfalls. Final reports from all ECAP panels are required by 1 March 2003 and a further ministerial-level capabilities conference is likely to take place in May 2003. Planning is under way for a crisis management operation desk top exercise next November, CME/CMX03, which will seek to validate decision-making processes in the context of an EU-led crisis management operation with recourse to NATO assets and capabilities.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 12 December 2002, amending the Defence Act to allow the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to apply to members of the Defence Forces would be wholly inappropriate. I know that PDFORRA has stressed the concept of the soldier as a &ldquo;citizen in uniform&rdquo; with the implication that the soldier's conditions of employment should largely replicate conditions in the civilian world. However, in a professional military organisation, this approach is simply not practical and this is widely recognised internationally. The position is that when an individual decides to join the Defence Forces, he or she voluntarily accepts, <i>inter alia,</i> a range of obligations and responsibilities which do not normally arise in the course of civilian employment. The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the mechanisms available to the representative association through the Defence Forces' conciliation and arbitration scheme, with its access to facilitation and arbitration and parallel discussion during national pay talks, provide a framework within which issues of concern can and should be addressed. It should be noted that members of the Defence Forces have been offered and have accepted the terms of all recent national pay agreements.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 the Government established a task force on emergency planning. The objective of the task force is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency. As chair of this task force, I am determined to ensure that such responses continue to be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.</P>
      <P>I recently presented a confidential annual report to Government on the work carried out by the task force since its establishment. The group continues to meet regularly to review the various emergency planning and response issues. The task force has met on 21 occasions since its establishment, the last such meeting was held on 22 January 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to report to this House that there continues to be a high level of co-operation between the Department of Defence and all other Departments and agencies working together through the task force. These arrange<Col N="1438" />ments have provided the fora to significantly enhance the emergency planning process within all Departments and agencies and have helped to improve public confidence in the emergency planning process. The Government task force on emergency planning will continue to meet to provide a significant forum to promote a facilitative climate and ensure the continued development of greater confidence in the emergency planning process. It will further ensure that the necessary resources in terms of people, equipment and training are deployed to best effect.</P>

      <P>In the course of discussions on the PPF, agreement was reached with the Defence Forces representative associations on a framework which would facilitate them engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between the social partners at national level. Under the terms of this agreement, representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Defence and the military authorities met collectively and separately with representatives of PDFORRA and RACO. These meetings were supplemented by a number of bilateral meetings involving the various parties. This process ensured that the associations were fully aware of developments at the central discussions while at the same time having a forum to raise matters of particular concern to them.</P>
      <P>Based on the established model, parallel discussions with the Defence Forces representative associations on how the public service benchmarking body's recommendations on achieving modernisation, flexibility and change can be implemented in the Defence Forces commenced on 22 October 2002 and are continuing.</P>

      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, the safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and <Col N="1439" />Naval Service is of paramount importance. To this end, funding is, and will continue to be, available where necessary to improve and modernise equipment and procedures to ensure the safety of Defence Forces personnel. Safety standards in the Air Corps, including those at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, in the first instance are a matter for GOC Air Corps. Since September 2000 an Air Corps flight safety section has operated within the Air Corps reporting directly to the GOC in this regard. The Air Corps flight safety officer and his staff monitor and evaluate all matters relating to flight safety on an ongoing basis. Any issues arising are immediately brought to the attention of the GOC, who will either address the issue immediately or bring the issue to my attention and that of my Department to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999, urgent action was taken by my Department in relation to the implementation of the 25 recommendations contained in it. I would like to inform the House that all these recommendations have been implemented and a final report is being prepared for the air accident investigation unit in this regard. One of the recommendations of the report was that an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps should be commissioned. This was done and I received the final report of the consultants involved in July 2001. The consultant's report was examined by both my Department and the military authorities, following which the Air Corps was tasked to take immediate steps towards implementing the recommendations and this it did as a matter of urgency.  All 23 recommendations contained in this report have been acted upon. Many of them have ongoing implications and these are monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 138, 148, 168 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. While the threat of terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, there is no reason to believe that Ireland is a direct target. Notwithstanding that, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken and the matters are kept under continual review.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Government established a task force on emergency planning. The objective of the task force is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency. As chair of this task force, my objective is to ensure that such responses continue to be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.</P>
      <P>The office of emergency planning, which operates under my remit in the Department of Defence, is taking the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threats from global terrorism, including co-ordination of Government emergency planning and response by various agencies. Review and updating of existing emergency plans is ongoing in order to ensure a co-ordinated and an effective response to large scale emergencies. The major emergency plan is the framework for the immediate response by the emergency services &ndash; the Garda, the health service, the fire service etc., &ndash; to any major incident.</P>
      <P>An urgent and detailed review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following on from the events of September 11. It included, <i>inter alia,</i> an up-date of the threat assessment; intensive contacts with other State agencies; a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army ranger wing, ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. Guidance documents pertaining to aid the civil power and aid to the civil authorities were also re-assessed. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to equipment, as Deputies will be <Col N="1441" />aware, there has been a very significant investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces over the past number of years. This investment is continuing apace, notwithstanding the changed economic circumstances. In the past few months alone, I have signed contracts for 25 additional APCs and eight trainer aircraft for the Air Corps. The Defence Forces has available to it equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with the varying nuclear, biological and chemical threats identified from time to time. A programme for the purchase of nuclear, biological and chemical equipment is ongoing. The requirement for additional nuclear, biological and chemical equipment is kept under continual review by the ordnance corps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 31 non-commissioned officers have been commissioned as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service in the past five years. Potential officers courses are held for non-commissioned personnel from time to time within the Defence Forces. Personnel who successfully complete such courses are commissioned as officers in the Permanent Defence Force. Participants on such courses are selected on a competitive basis. In addition, from time to time non-commissioned personnel who hold appropriate qualifications are commissioned to fill specialist appointments where vacancies arise. Eligible non-commissioned personnel may also apply for the annual cadetship competitions.</P>
      <P>The requirement for potential officer courses and commissioning from the ranks competitions is reviewed from time to time and is being specifically addressed in the context of the integrated personnel management system, IPMS, which is one of the major policy initiatives provided for in the White Paper on Defence. The IPMS will make specific and ongoing provision for the introduction of regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. A proposed IPMS has been prepared by the military authorities and is now being considered by the Department's civil-military strategic management committee. I hope to see the IPMS finalised later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Draft conditions governing the appointment of enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force to be officers of the Naval Service are under discussion with the representative associations. As the discussions with the representative associations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment on any of the specifics of the proposed draft conditions. However, it is the <Col N="1442" />intention that a potential officers' course will be run as soon as these discussions are completed.</P>
    <P>The Feely report referred to by the Deputy was, I understand, an internal military discussion document and was not endorsed as Defence Force policy. It does not form my Department's policy in the area of commissioning from the ranks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimates review committee recommended a net reduction of about &euro;20 million in the Defence Estimate for 2003, to be achieved mainly by reducing the proposed spend on trainer aircraft by 50%, by postponing the second phase of the armoured personnel carrier programme and by reducing expenditure on the building programme.</P>
      <P>The gross provision for defence in the abridged version of the Estimates for 2003 is in line with the overall amount recommended by the Estimates review committee. However, by re-allocating moneys within the overall provision in 2002 and 2003, it has been possible to proceed with the acquisition of eight trainer aircraft and an additional 25 armoured personnel carriers. The amount provided for the capital building programme in 2003 was reduced by only &euro;2 million instead of &euro;6 million as recommended by the committee.</P>
      <P>In the current economic circumstances it is not possible to continue the same high rate of expenditure on equipment and infrastructure as took place in recent years. However, I am satisfied that by a process of prioritisation, key programmes of investment, such as those mentioned, will be maintained.</P>

The statutory authority for the dispatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service overseas is set out in section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act 1960 as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993. Section 2, as amended, provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State as part of an international force <Col N="1443" />or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations. Where the despatch of 12 or more armed personnel of the Defence Forces is contemplated, prior Dáil approval is required under the provisions of the legislation.

      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service, which is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five off-shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels, is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive fishery limit, which covers an area of 132,000 square miles. Of this, Irish territorial waters comprise 15,000 square miles. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. Fishery protection activity accounts for more than 90% of all Naval Service patrol time and I have been advised that there is no undue concentration by the Naval Service on fishery control regarding the Irish fishing effort within Irish territorial waters.</P>

      <P>The Irish Coastguard of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of marine search and rescue, SAR, services in this country. The Air Corps provides SAR services off the north-west coast, while Canadian Helicopters Corporation Ireland, CHCI, is contracted to provide SAR services for the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>I am committed to maintaining the Air Corps role in the provision of SAR services and, in this regard, the Air Corps is in the process of acquiring an S61 helicopter to operate in the north-west region to replace the existing Dauphin helicopter. The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coastguard from CHCI pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coastguard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport.</P>
      <P>Pilot training on the S61, which is being provided by CHCI, is ongoing. The current plans envisage work-up training commencing in the north-west in April 2003, with the helicopter going operational in mid-2003.</P>
      <P>The S61 will be based at Sligo Airport. While the current Dauphin service operates from Finner Camp, the S61 being a larger and heavier machine requires a longer airstrip and appropriate hangarage, facilities which are not available in Finner. The S61 will represent a major improvement in the endurance and capacity of the SAR service in the north-west.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1446" />Personnel on being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force are obliged to vacate married quarters within a short period of the dates of their discharge. There are, however, more than 50 married quarters currently being overheld by former members of the PDF or their families. The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married military personnel have an equal claim on such housing to other members of the community in the same income category.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, in relation to the re-housing of those overholders who would in the normal way be eligible for local authority housing. Co-operative schemes are financed under the terms of the capital loan and subsidy scheme operated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Meetings have been held between officials of the Department and the overholders as well as with officials of Kildare County Council. In cases where houses have been offered for sale to overholders, the Department has requested the co-operation of Kildare County Council in ensuring that mortgages are made available to eligible applicants.

      <P>A draft integrated personnel management system, or IPMS, has been prepared by the military authorities and is now being considered by the Department's civil-military strategic management committee. The IPMS will encompass a new career development plan.</P>
      <P>The requirements, which the IPMS must meet, are set out in chapter 4.5 of the White Paper on Defence. The focus is on ensuring the availability of military personnel with the appropriate skills to undertake whatever tasks the State requires. In this regard, the IPMS will try to ensure that personnel policies and practices keep pace with current best practice to the benefit of the organisation and its people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In simple terms, the IPMS will deal with the broad range of personnel and human resource management and development issues. These include manpower policy and planning, equality of opportunity and treatment and the right to dig<Col N="1447" />nity at work, recruitment, terms of enlistment, induction, training education and development, physical and medical fitness, career guidance management and development, promotion, the regulatory framework, retirement, and pensions.</P>
    <P>Within that broad context, it is intended that there would be a career development plan for all Defence Forces personnel. It is important to note that the issues which the IPMS must address are very complex and that the details, including the details of the career development plan, have yet to be finalised and agreed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pre-empt the discussions taking place in the strategic management committee. However, in a general way a career development plan would seek to ensure that people joining the Defence Forces are aware of the career opportunities available to them and are also aware of the standards to be reached and maintained. The plan would be designed to give to all personnel the right blend of skills training, education, work assignments and experience to equip them to carry out their tasks, to enhance the quality of their work life and to enable them to compete for promotion opportunities.</P>
    <P>There would also be an updated performance management system and performance appraisal and feedback, which would have an appropriate element of career guidance and management built into it. All personnel, whether officers or enlisted personnel, would be covered by the plan.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, the IPMS is being discussed by the strategic management committee. Once these discussions are completed, I expect that a final draft of the IPMS will be submitted to me. Before any final decisions are taken, it is my intention that the Defence Forces representative associations will be fully consulted in a spirit of partnership in accordance with the system of representation. I hope to see the IPMS finalised later this year.</P>

      <P>A contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers, APCs, initial spares, special tools and training courses. The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8x8s, included 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery <Col N="1448" />variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract spread over five years was in the region of &euro;50.8 million, including VAT. The final stage payment of that contract was paid last month. All 40 APCs have been delivered to the Curragh Camp.</P>
      <P>Training of Defence Forces personnel on the APCs has been continuing apace and the first overseas deployment of the APCs has taken place with six APCs in service in Eritrea. I am advised by the military authorities that the APCs are performing exceptionally well in the mission area.</P>
      <P>The original contract contained an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs by Mowag. This option has now been exercised albeit for a reduced number of APCs because of the changed financial situation. I signed a contract on 9 December 2002 for the provision by Mowag of 25 additional APCs. The contract value is in the region of &euro;33.2 million including VAT. Deliveries will commence in March 2004 and are scheduled to be completed by September 2004. Payments under the contract will extend from December 2002 to September 2005 due to the budgetary situation.</P>
      <P>The signing of the contract is another significant boost for the Defence Forces and a further indicator of my commitment to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are fully equipped with modern equipment, which enhances their safety in carrying out their various roles.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 141 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to the House in response to Parliamentary Question No. 39 on 12 December 2002.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have not been involved in PfP joint manoeuvres or military field exercises on the ground with other PfP nations' military units. Participation in Partnership for Peace, PfP, activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation.</P>
      <P>In the context of PfP, Ireland has participated in a number of crisis management exercises and technical workshops. Our participation has been in the planning phases, at a technical level, at observer level and at staff level appointments in multinational headquarters, the main focus being to enhance inter-operability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multinational environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in the context of the EU and ESDP, the ongoing EU exercise programme covers the period 2001-06 and entails a sequence of exercises designed to ensure appropriate readiness and efficient functioning in a crisis management situation. The exercises are designed to ensure that EU structures, procedures, including consultation with the UN, and arrangements are properly <Col N="1450" />tested and validated in order to ensure appropriate readiness and efficient functioning in a Petersberg Task type crises. In effect the exercises test the political-diplomatic and military responses to an emerging crisis. They should not be confused with military exercises which require deployment of troops. The EU does not intend to engage in military field exercises as part of the EU exercise programme.</P>
    <P>Training, personnel and equipment programmes required for the reorganisation and development of the Defence Forces are provided for under the Government's White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, which took account of both the internal and external security environments. The question of participation in military field exercises has not arisen in the context of Ireland's participation in either ESDP or PfP.</P>

      <P>Dr. Doyle and the external advisory committee group presented their completed report to me in March 2002. I accepted the report in full together with all of its recommendations. The action taken on foot of the recommendations of the report follows.</P>
      <P>An independent monitoring group chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle has been established to oversee the implementation of the fundamental reforms which the report has recommended. The monitoring group meets regularly to formulate proposals on how best to proceed with implementation of the recommendations. The most significant development is the genuine and growing collaboration between the military authorities, the two representative associations and the Department of Defence in relation to implementing the recommendations. The first stage of disseminating the findings of the report has taken place. A number of focus groups have been set up by the group to identify appropriate ways of enriching training at all levels in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>An equality steering group has been established and has been meeting regularly. Since its first meeting in September 2002 the equality steering group has been engaged in an equality audit of various Defence Forces regulations and instructions. The group is examining a range of matters including the legislation, regulations and administrative instructions, practices and procedures under which the Defence Forces operate. This examination is to take into account the current legislative requirements, best practice in employment in Ireland, the particular requirements of the military environment and the Challenge of the Workplace report. The equality steering group will ensure that progress is made both in relation to legislative requirements and best working practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The monitoring group has recently appointed a private specialist body to provide the recommended independent confidential helpline and counselling service. This body will provide a 24 hour freephone care line to all serving members of the Defence Forces. A counsellor will be available to answer the care line 24 hours a day and for 365 days of the year. Where a caller wants <Col N="1452" />telephone help only, this will be provided. More structured help from a counsellor is provided as necessary and at a time and venue to suit the user. The monitoring group plans to review the service after six months.</P>
    <P>The monitoring group has also recently appointed an independent body to design, distribute, administer and analyse an exit interview questionnaire for Defence Forces personnel. A questionnaire will be tested in a pilot phase before being administered to some 300 personnel leaving the Defence Forces. Exit interviews will be part of the process and a comprehensive report will be presented to the monitoring group. Total confidentiality is assured in relation to any individual member of the Defence Forces who participates in the work of the project.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached in January 2003 on a new administrative instruction &ndash; A7, Interpersonal Relationships in the Defence Forces &ndash; which sets out policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces including negative workplace behaviours such as bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual harassment. This new administrative instruction has been brought in line with workplace legislation. However, no document will of itself promote trust in the organisation and the need for a parallel structure remains.</P>
    <P>The monitoring group agreed on the importance of training for those who will implement the revised procedures and within the associations who have a crucial role in representation of their members. The success of the new administrative instruction as a formal structure for dealing with complaints, will depend on the people who interpret and implement it. Training in human resource management is crucial. The military authorities have engaged an associate of IBEC to provide initial training on a pilot basis for commanders and senior NCOs. The focus of the training is to be the prevention and resolution of interpersonal conflict aspects that the monitoring group had previously identified as important in organisational change and development. The monitoring group will review this pilot work.</P>
    <P>The monitoring group has agreed that the informal approach to dealing with bullying issues should include contact persons with appropriate support skills. The most appropriate way of identifying and training the contact persons is yet to be considered.</P>

      <P>The former military barracks at Castleblayney was sold to the North Eastern Health Board, NEHB, in 1999. The decision to sell the property to the NEHB took account of the board's needs as well as the long-term benefit to the town which redevelopment of the site would provide. The board proposed to establish a child care project which would provide 45 permanent appointments and a further sum in excess of &euro;1.27 million for investment in the provision of the necessary facilities. It was intended that the facilities, to include a swimming pool, would be made available to the local community when not required for child care purposes.</P>
      <P>I am advised that considerable progress has been made in this matter. A new residential educational unit for adolescents is now operational and phase 2 of the project will provide for sports facilities to include a swimming pool as well as a gymnasium, hard court and outdoor playing area.</P>
      <P>These investments which clearly exceed £1 million pounds demonstrate the State's commitment to the Castleblayney area and I am confident that when the project is complete it will be a welcome boost to the local community both financially and recreationally.</P>

      <P>The decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in July 2002 was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that the level of Defence expenditure had to be reduced.

      <P>The decision to cancel the tender competition was an extremely difficult one for me. I regarded the acquisition of the helicopters for the Air Corps as a priority.

      <P>An inter-departmental working group was established to seek alternate solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions. This work is at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to maintaining the Air Corps role in the provision of SAR services and in this regard an S61 helicopter has been acquired for the Air Corps to operate in the north-west region as a replacement for the Dauphin helicopter. The <Col N="1455" />S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from CHCI pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport.</P>
    <P>Pilot training on the S61, which is being provided by CHCI, is currently ongoing. It was anticipated that the helicopter would go operational in early 2003 but due to a delay in securing appropriate training personnel it is now forecast that the S61 will commence on site training at Sligo Airport in April 2003, with operations commencing in June 2003.</P>

      <P>On 15 July 1998 the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare, Ballincollig and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. A total of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, was sold to Cork County Council for &euro;973,889 for development in conjunction with the IDA. Castleblayney Military Post, Monaghan, comprising approximately ten acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for &euro;761,843. There were seven acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres was sold to that authority for &euro;8,888,167. The balance of the barrack's lands &ndash; one acre &ndash; was sold to Kildare County Council for &euro;380,921.</P>
      <P>Magee Barracks, Kildare, comprising 65 acres, still remains to be sold. At present approximately 15 acres of the property are being used by the reception and integration agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accommodate asylum seekers and a further site comprising one acre approximately is being used by Kildare County Council as a temporary halting site for 20 persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sales have yet to be completed in respect of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, County Cork and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Agreement has been reached for the sale of approximately 91 acres of the total lands comprising 138 acres at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, to O'Flynn Construction Limited and it is hoped to close the sale shortly. A further area comprising more than 27 acres at Murphy Barracks will be handed over to Cork <Col N="1456" />County Council for community use. My Department has accepted an offer from Florence Properties Limited for the sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin, comprising 13.65 acres approximately. It is hoped to have a contract of sale completed shortly. Revenue in respect of the sales at Murphy and Clancy Barracks, when completed, will be in excess of &euro;65 million.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of sales of property by my Department has been to local authorities, other public bodies or, in the case of married quarters, to residents. In addition to the foregoing properties, agreements have also been reached for the sale of the following. Some 6.39 acres, known as &ldquo;Susan's Field&rdquo;, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork, has been sold to Cork City Council for &euro;1.523 million. Approximately 3.4 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, was disposed of to Limerick City Council for &euro;1.162 million. Legal formalities are being completed in respect of the sale of approximately 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks to Waterford Corporation for &euro;0.662 million. Ballyconnell Town Hall is being sold to Cavan County Council for &euro;127,000, while 20 acres of the Curragh lands are being sold to Kildare County Council for &euro;0.273 million, to assist with the construction of the Kildare by-pass. There are 100 married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare and 12 quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, being sold to residents. These sales are expected to realise &euro;4 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Approximately ten acres of land at Renmore, Galway are being sold to Galway City Council for &euro;250,316 and 1.07 acres approximately at Arbour Hill is being transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a consideration of &euro;3.174 million. Agreement has been reached for the sale of a site comprising approximately 0.931 acre, adjacent to my Department's FCA premises in Kanturk, County Cork, to the Southern Health Board for a consideration of &euro;177,763 and it is expected that a contract will be signed shortly in this regard.</P>

      <P>Following the announcement of the decision of the board of IFI to close the company, I met with the IFI unions on 17 October 2002 and again on 22 November. In addition, there have been numerous meetings and other contacts between officials of my Department and workers representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main concerns raised by the workers representatives related to redundancy and pension entitlements. Most workers have now received their statutory redundancy entitlements as well as <Col N="1457" />an interim payment of &euro;5,000 from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund of &euro;24.5 million provided by the two shareholders. It is expected that the basis for distributing the balance of the <i>ex gratia</i> fund will be determined very shortly and that employees will be able to collect any amounts due from the fund in the near future.</P>
    <P>In addition, the employees may, in due course, receive some further payment out of the liquidation in respect of contractual rights to redundancy payments. The amount involved will depend on the outcome of, <i>inter alia,</i> the sale of the company's assets. Thankfully the main pension schemes covering employees in the Republic are in quite good shape and I understand that the actuaries have estimated that there is sufficient funds to meet all of the entitlements provided under the scheme, as well as pensions increases of about 3% per annum. However, employees had hoped that they would receive pensions increases in line with CPI, although payment of such increases in the past has been contingent on the level of funding in the scheme. They had also hoped that they could continue to benefit from a discretionary concession granted by the trustees in the past, whereby pensions paid before normal retirement age are reduced by a preferential discount rate rather than on normal actuarial terms. The trustees have asked the shareholders to underwrite an investment strategy for a number of years in the hope that rising stock markets would enable these discretionary benefits be restored. This proposal is under consideration by the two shareholders at present.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it appears that the Belfast pension scheme will only be able to pay active members &ndash; that is, the employees still working at the time the company ceased operations &ndash; less than half their entitlements under the scheme. The regulations require that existing pensioners are given priority and as a result, they are largely unaffected by the shortfall in the fund. The shortfall involved arises primarily from a combination of stock market losses on investments and the impact of the regulatory regime in the North which provides that pension schemes fund on a going concern basis, rather than on a discontinuance basis, which allows for the additional costs of acquiring annuities, etc. The regulations in the Republic require defined benefit schemes to fund on the more rigorous discontinuance basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years I have made a number of official visits to counties <Col N="1458" />Limerick and Clare in my capacity as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and will continue to do so according as my official schedule allows. Last November I was pleased to visit both Shannon and Ennis, during which I took the opportunity to visit a number of companies in the area, including Halifax Insurance Ireland, Intel, ICE, and Mentor Graphics. I also had a meeting with a broad-based delegation from Ennis in early December 2002 at which Shannon Development and IDA Ireland were represented.</P>
      <P>The issue of job creation is, however, a day to day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one, for which I, as Minister, have direct involvement.</P>
      <P>The recent job losses in County Clare, in which I share the Deputy's concern, arise largely as a result of the globalisation policies of multinational companies on the one hand, and also due to the restructuring process which is going on in indigenous companies in Ireland whereby activities and hence jobs at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context. Both IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, which are the relevant industrial development agencies working in the region, are continuing to work closely in the marketing of Ennis as a location for foreign direct investment and also with existing companies in Ennis in an effort to develop and encourage expansion of their businesses and to further embed them in the area.</P>
      <P>Both agencies are aware of the potential to Ennis in being designated Ireland's first information age town and, more recently, its designation as a hub in the national spatial strategy taking advantage of its relationship with the Limerick-Shannon gateway and its strategic location between Limerick and Galway. IDA Ireland, through its network of overseas offices, is actively promoting Ennis and its information age town status for new and modern business investment specifically in software development and e-commerce activities.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development is actively involved in the establishment of the Ennis Information Age Park. The Shannon Development rationale behind the development of the Information Age Park &ndash; Ennis, IAP, is to provide a new focus for industrial development in County Clare and, in particular, for the town of Ennis. The park will offer the potential investor a world class business accommodation and infrastructure in a managed environment, just minutes from the centre of Ennis. This is a major initiative for Ennis and County Clare in general, and will be the key focus of Shannon Development promotional-development activities in County Clare, alongside its Shannon Free Zone programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the technological benefits accruing to Ennis arising from its status as an information age town and its inclusion as a hub town, will prove to be a catalyst for further <Col N="1459" />development, given its proximity to the Limerick-Shannon gateway and its strategic location between Galway and Limerick.</P>

      <Quest> the number of manufacturing companies which were brought or referred to County Kerry by the IDA in 2002; the total number of all companies brought to Kerry in 2002; and the number of those which have decided to invest in the county. </Quest>

      <P>While the IDA has responsibility for promoting the county as a whole to potential overseas investors, investment and employment opportunities in Kerry are further advanced by the work of Enterprise Ireland in south Kerry and Shannon Development in north Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately decisions regarding locations for foreign direct investment, including what areas to visit as potential locations, are taken by the individual investors. One of the key initial requirements of such companies in determining where they will visit, and consequently where they will potentially locate, is high quality office accommodation located in a suitable environment, which is most often a business and technology park. IDA and Shannon Development are working to ensure <Col N="1460" />that Kerry is made increasingly attractive to investors be they foreign or indigenous.</P>
    <P>There was one site visit to Kerry in 2002, a software company which visited Tralee in September 2002. There were no visits by manufacturing companies. However it should be noted that 2002, with the downturn in the technology sector and the knock-on effects of the tragic events of 11 September, was a particularly difficult year to attract foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>In terms of foreign direct investment Kerry has been traditionally best served by manufacturing, particularly in the engineering and consumer products sectors; existing overseas investment in the manufacturing sector in Kerry include Amann &amp; Soehne, Beru Manufacturing, Tillotson, located in Tralee, and Liebherr Limited located in Killarney.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the national spatial strategy has the potential to create the necessary linkages to enable the region to be internationally competitive. The physical networks of infrastructure such as roads, public transport, energy and communications are at the core of the NSS, improvements in these networks in terms of time and cost will reduce the perceived disadvantage of distance.</P>
    <P>The gateways of Cork and Limerick-Shannon supported by the designation of Tralee-Killarney as a hub for development has the potential to create the counter balance to the east coast and promote the economic development in the region.</P>
    <P>In an effort to further enhance the attractiveness of Kerry as a location for overseas investment IDA has commenced site development works in 2002 on their business and technology park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, County Kerry. The site area totals 4.66 hectares or 12 acres approximately. This site development work involves significant landscaping and site clearance work, all of which will result in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location. The work undertaken will cost in the region of &euro;1 million. In addition, the Kerry Advance Factory Group has commenced building work on an advance unit &ndash; BES factory &ndash; on the estate. This 24,000 sq. ft. advance technology building will be completed in mid-2003 and will then be available for IDA Ireland to market resulting in an alternative property solution to present investors.</P>
    <P>In relation to north Kerry since Kerry Technology Park officially opened in 2001, the number of new technology and knowledge-based businesses has grown considerably. Despite the fact that 2002 was exceptionally difficult for the IT-telecoms sector, the park continued to attract new start-ups and existing companies on the park managed to consolidate their positions. At the end of 2002, there were 13 companies on the park employing 125 people which is a significant development for the north Kerry region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" />While it is ultimately the client company who makes the decision where it will visit and locate, I am confident that given the efforts of all concerned Kerry will be in a good position to compete strongly for inward investment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by me, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target time frame establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, <Col N="1462" />on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB. While EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance, I have made it clear that I expect a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the industry in response to my reform programme.</P>
    <P>I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market. My Department in conjunction with the Competition Authority finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace.</P>

      <P>Existing statutory redundancy rates apply to those being made redundant at present. Changes to the redundancy payments scheme are an integral part of the draft partnership agreement. This agreement has not yet been ratified. Amendments to the Redundancy Payments Acts will be required to implement the increased statutory redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>In advance of ratification of the partnership agreement my Department has prepared heads of Bill to introduce the required changes and other changes, which have been agreed by the redundancy review group which reported last year. Following ratification of the partnership agreement the Government will implement the increased rates at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>Planning for major accidents and emergencies has been ongoing for many years. This has been carried out at local and regional level in accordance with the Government major emergency planning framework. Through the Government task force on emergency planning, all authorities were advised to review their major emergency plans. This has led to the examination and evaluation of emergency plans at local level to ensure that arrangements are current and effective.</P>
      <P>The emphasis of the work of the Government task force on emergency planning has been to ensure that emergency planning challenges continue to be addressed with a view to developing responses to possible threats and to promote co-ordination. It is essential to ensure that Departments and agencies with management roles in large scale emergencies are facilitated to carry out their respective tasks and that all necessary resources in terms of people, equipment and training are deployed to best effect.</P>
      <P>The focus for the future will continue to be on taking the necessary precautions to minimise the risks from terrorist activities, ensuring that the protection available to the Irish people is maximised, putting the mechanisms in place to support the response agencies and co-ordinating for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the various plans developed and reviewed since the establishment of the Government task force on emergency planning have significantly enhanced the response potential of the State in the event of a large-scale emergency. As chairman of the Government task force on emergency planning, I will continue this work and regularly report to Government on these matters.</P>

However, the matter is a foreign relations issue and, therefore, comes under the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>The Governments plans for the future development of the Defence Forces are set out in detail in the White Paper on Defence, the implementation of which is well advanced, and in the Programme for Government published in June 2002. There are no plans to close any existing installations. The White Paper, as endorsed by the programme for Government, provides for a total permanent Defence Force strength of 10,500, plus the option of an extra 250 recruits in training. The 10,500 figure, which represents an overall reduction of 1,000 on the pre-White Paper strength position, is made up as follows: Army, 8,426; Naval Service, 1,144 and Air Corps, 930. As provided for in the White Paper, all payroll savings arising from the reduction in numbers have been reinvested in new equipment and better infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which were considered surplus to military requirements. Included in the six barracks were Devoy Barracks, Naas which has been sold and Magee Barracks, Kildare, comprising 65 acres, which still remains to be sold. At present, approximately 15 acres of the property are being used by the reception and integration agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accommodate asylum seekers and a further site comprising approximately one acre is being used by Kildare County Council as a temporary halting site for 20 persons. It is intended to dispose of this property as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable investment in the Defence Forces training centre at the Curragh, County Kildare in recent years, major examples of which are: combined vehicle workshop &ndash;&euro;9 million; swimming pool/gymnasium &ndash;&euro;8.2 million; technical stores &ndash;&euro;7.05 million; combat support college &ndash;&euro;6.9 million; vehicle garaging &ndash;&euro;4.4 million and dining complex/NCO's mess &ndash;&euro;4.35 million.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary focus of the Defence Forces, when not engaged in operations, is training and preparation. As outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the appropriate training for all Defence Forces' personnel is based on conventional military doctrine to prepare them to fulfil the roles laid down by Government. The Defence Forces training centre in the Curragh has the important role of overseeing the training requirements of all personnel.</P>
      <P>Training in the Defence Forces continues to be conducted in two basic forms: first, that of individual training, where the individual is trained in personal skills; and second, that of collective training, where the team as a unit is trained to accomplish tasks outside the scope of the individual. Training is ongoing to ensure that the Defence Forces can carry out their day-to-day roles, both at home and overseas, as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acquisition of new equipment for the <Col N="1467" />Defence Forces has been a key focus for me since my appointment to the Defence portfolio. Significant investment has taken place which has ensured that the Defence Forces are now well equipped for their roles at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>While much has been done both on the equipment and the infrastructure front, I am aware that more needs to be done. While expenditure programmes will now have to be prioritised due to the changed financial situation, I will ensure that a substantive re-equipment programme will still go ahead to enhance the efficiency, professionalism and safety of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>One example is the position with regard to the acquisition of APCs for the Defence Forces. The original APC contract contained an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs by Mowag. This option has now been exercised albeit for a reduced number of APCs because of the changed financial situation. I signed a contract in December 2002 for the provision by Mowag of 25 additional APCs. The contract value is in the region of &euro;33.2 million, including VAT. Deliveries will commence in March 2004 and are scheduled to be completed by September 2004. Payments under the contract will extend from December 2002 to September 2005 due to the budgetary situation. On delivery, the Defence Forces will have a total of 65 APCs.</P>
    <P>There has been significant investment on new vehicles for the Defence Forces, including specialist transport cargo vehicles and on new troop carrying vehicles and three quarter ton trucks. Over &euro;13 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. Ongoing programmes include the acquisition of additional night vision equipment and nuclear/biological/chemical &ndash; NBC &ndash; equipment.</P>
    <P>Significant investment has been made in the Naval Service. The <i>LE Niamh,</i> which is a sister ship of the <i>LE Róisín</i> was commissioned into the Naval Service in September 2001. As with the LE Róisín, the new ship cost over &euro;25 million. Both ships have proved to be a tremendous asset to the Naval Service in carrying out its various roles.</P>
    <P>The main priority for the Air Corps has been the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft. In that regard, I was delighted to sign a contract on 16 January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propeller training aircraft to replace the Siai Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. The new aircraft is the Pilatus PC-9M, manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft Limited, Switzerland. The cost of the aircraft is approximately &euro;60 million. Delivery of the aircraft will take place during 2004.</P>

      <P>The question of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review. Requests from the UN for Irish participation in new missions are considered on a case by case basis within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangement System &ndash; UNSAS &ndash; to which Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.</P>
      <P>In the context of European Security and Defence Policy &ndash; ESDP &ndash; , Ireland's commitment to the Headline Goal consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to UNSAS. Accordingly, our commitment to the Headline Goal does not have any implications for our commitment to the United Nations. Ireland will only participate on peace support operations subject to specific Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>While individual members of both the Naval Service and the Air Corps have served overseas in varying roles, it is not proposed at this time to deploy the Naval Service or the Air Corps in peacekeeping operations in the future. In the White Paper on Defence, the question of deploying the Air Corps was considered and it was decided that, given the domestic demands on Air Corps resources, it would not be reasonable for it to participate beyond the domestic context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Naval Service, the primary day-to-day activity of the Naval Service is fishery protection. This commitment represents a considerable challenge for the Naval Service, which is working hard to improve performance in this regard. Against this background, it is not proposed to deploy Naval Service elements on overseas peacekeeping operations, which would sim<Col N="1470" />ply serve to divert effort from the important issue of improving performance and vessel utilisation. It should also be noted that here is no commitment of Naval Service or Air Corps resources in Ireland's declaration under the EU Helsinki Headline Goal or the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System &ndash; UNSAS.</P>

      <P>Cases are selected for inspection systematically for both area aid and the livestock schemes. A computer programme selects a percentage of cases randomly and the remainder based on criteria set in EU regulations. The categories for selection, other than random, include the amount of aid involved, changes from previous years, findings in previous years and compliance with the identification and registration requirements. The relevant EU regulation requires that at least 5% of producers are inspected. In the case of livestock inspections, 5% of applications for at least one scheme must be inspected inside retention, and 5% of animals under each scheme must be inspected.</P>

The criteria used in assessing applications for a herd number principally include independent management of the holding, separate housing and fodder, the availability of adequate testing facilities and no possibility of intermixing with any other herd. The general details in regard to applying for a herd number are outlined in application form ER1, a copy of which I am arranging to send to the Deputy. As provided for in Appendix 1, page 21, of our current Customer Service Action Plan 2001-2004, the staff in the local offices aim to finalise an application for a herd number within a 28 day time frame.</P>

    <P>All of these flocks were depopulated under my Department's scrapie depopulation scheme. In addition, 21 flocks diagnosed with scrapie between 1 January 1999 and 1 February 2001 have been depopulated. The depopulation policy was introduced in the absence of any horizontal rules in relation to the eradication of the disease at EU level and against the background of the increased profile of scrapie as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. This is the same family of diseases as BSE, therefore there is a theoretical possibility of BSE in sheep. However, a recently published commission regulation provides for horizontal rules for dealing with scrapie-positive flocks from 1 October 2003. These rules include a number of options, including full or partial depopulation, and my Department is cur<Col N="1473" />rently reviewing the existing regime in the light of these rules.</P>

      <P>Following is a breakdown of the number of BSE cases in each county over the past five years. The BSE control and eradication measures in Ireland are among the most comprehensive in the world. The value of these measures can now be seen in the positive underlying trend in <Col N="1474" />relation to BSE. In the 29 weeks from 30 July 2002 to 13 February 2003, the number of BSE cases identified, at 161, was 33% less than the number confirmed in the corresponding period of 2001 and 2002, which was 240. In addition, the age profile of cases detected continues to increase. In 2002 some 2% of cases were identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed and the declining numbers is a positive indication that the enhanced controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline as older animals leave the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs-Trade Partnership against Terrorism, CTPAT, is a joint US Government business programme which is aimed at increasing the security of the international trade supply chain with a view to combating the risk of terrorist threat to the US. US businesses which sign up to C-TPAT agree to carry out certain activities which improve the security of their operations and, in return, can expect to benefit from a facilitative regime with regard to the customs clearance of their imports into the US. The activities or guidelines encompass the following areas: procedural security, physical security, personnel security, education and training, access controls, manifest procedures and conveyance security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the commitments of C-TPAT is that participating businesses should communicate the security guidelines to other companies in the trade supply chain with whom they do business with a view to building the guidelines into their relationship with those companies. Irish based subsidiaries of US companies and Irish companies exporting to the US are likely, therefore, to <Col N="1476" />be contacted by their US trading partners in this regard and may, as a result, examine their own security procedures with a view to enhancing them if necessary. This is precisely what has happened in the case of the Irish subsidiary of a US company, details of which were supplied with this parliamentary question. Revenue officials have discussed these developments with the company in question and briefed it on the up to date position.</P>
    <P>At present, Revenue, as the Irish Customs administration, does not operate a programme similar to C-TPAT. However, the EU Commission is currently in discussions with US Customs in relation to trade chain security matters and it is possible that at some future date there may be agreement on certain specific security measures to be applied by all member states of the EU. Irish Customs is also participating in the work of the World Customs Organisation, WCO, which is currently in the process of developing security guidelines for its members worldwide. The outcome of that work may also be a factor in what may finally be agreed at EU level.</P>
    <P>The US developments in trade security have been discussed with trade bodies in the customs consultative council, a forum where Revenue meets with trade bodies on matters of mutual interest. If and when additional security requirements are agreed in relation to international trade, these will be communicated by Revenue to trade operators and discussed with them.</P>

      <P>Customs services, both nationally and internationally, are acutely conscious of the importance of coastal surveillance and it is considered regularly at national and international fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Customs and Excise Service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation in Ireland and is well aware of the potential for smuggling drugs along our extensive coastline. The Customs Service operates a number of maritime units for inshore and coastal surveillance and is supported nationally by both the Irish Naval Service and the Air Corps. Over recent years, the Customs Service has had considerable success in seizing large quantities of drugs in maritime traffic. Many of these operations involved collaboration with the Garda Síochána and other national and international law enforcement agencies. The service also maintains close working relationships with other foreign customs and law enforcement services responsible for maritime and coastal surveillance. The appoint<Col N="1477" />ment of a customs officer to the national Europol unit and the secondment of a customs attaché to the Irish embassy in London have served to enhance the flow of information and intelligence relating to drugs smuggling.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the ongoing threat, the Customs and Excise Service continuously reviews the effectiveness of its anti-drug smuggling programmes and how such programmes can be enhanced in combating serious drug smuggling. One such recent enhancement was the promotion of the customs drugs watch programme, which is designed to seek assistance from individual members of the public, particularly those engaged in maritime activities and coastal communities. This programme involves local Customs and Excise officers distributing new drugs watch documentation with contact freephone numbers, enhancing contact with coastal communities and maximising public awareness of the threat posed by drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>In addition, as part of its commitment to the national drugs strategy, Revenue completed its customs drug dog detector acquisition programme in 2002. The service now has nine detector dogs deployed in strategic locations throughout the country. These dogs are used at ports, airports and coastal locations.</P>
    <P>As regards the international aspect, the Irish Customs and Excise Service is represented in the World Customs Organisation and in various EU fora relating to maritime and coastal intelligence and surveillance and takes a pro-active role in enhancing European wide operational effectiveness. This involves Ireland regularly and successfully participating in bilateral and European wide maritime drug interdiction focused activities and operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Correspondence was received both directly from the individual concerned and on his behalf on the issue of tax evasion and a detailed reply issued. Further correspondence was received and a reply will be issued shortly. The main question posed by the person concerned was on the lack of prosecutions of tax evaders in the DIRT context and, in particular, whether the financial institutions that facilitated bogus non-resident accounts would be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply, I pointed out that the administration of the tax system is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with their care and management powers provided under the tax Acts. In addressing any case of non-compliance with tax law, the Revenue Commissioners must decide whether it is more appropriate to investigate the case with a view to prosecution or with the objec<Col N="1478" />tive of arriving at a monetary settlement covering the tax, interest and penalties due. In responding to the revelations of widespread non-compliance in the operation of DIRT, the Revenue Commissioners took the view, having been granted the necessary powers by the Oireachtas in the Finance Act 1999 to undertake on site DIRT audits of financial institutions, that look-back audits should proceed expeditiously in order to recover the substantial liabilities concerned. Revenue received co-operation from the financial institutions in these audits and a total of &euro;220 million or £173 million was paid in tax, interest and penalties in settlement of those investigations. The position is that had Revenue investigated with a view to prosecution there would probably not have been the relatively quick resolution that followed which resulted in payment to the Exchequer of &euro;220 million.</P>
    <P>An investigation with a view to prosecution is a long, painstaking and resource intensive process. The evidence, sufficient to sustain a prosecution, has to be gathered in a manner acceptable to the courts and the rights of the taxpayer cannot be infringed in the process. If proper procedures are not followed, the evidence may be rejected by the courts. A prosecution cannot be initiated unless sufficient quality evidence is available. However, where evidence considered sufficient to sustain a prosecution is available, a file will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Prosecution is a matter for the DPP.</P>
    <P>Clamping down on tax evasion is an ongoing process and Revenue's powers in this regard are kept under ongoing review. In so far as tax avoidance is concerned, I have been to the fore in identifying and closing loopholes where these are brought to my attention. The recently published Finance Bill includes 12 different anti-avoidance measures.</P>
    <P>The person recently raised the findings of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General 2002 which detailed a number of cases of tax evasion. Arising from the report, the Revenue Commissioners have changed their procedures and, further, have brought forward a number of legislative proposals. As these raise significant legal and other issues they require detailed examination by my Department in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners and other relevant Departments. I will consider carefully the outcome of this examination.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. This scheme provides a range of tax reliefs in connection with the purchase and use of vehicles by drivers, passengers and organisations.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for the above relief that the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: (a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; (b) persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; (c) persons without both hands or without both arms; (d) persons without one or both legs; (e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and (f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria as set out above is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate provides for remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax VRT, plus a repayment of value added tax, VAT, on the purchase of the vehicle, plus a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of that vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor <Col N="1484" />vehicle and exemption from payment of annual road tax to local authorities are also provided for. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for the relief without the issue of a valid primary medical certificate.</P>
    <P>There are other State-funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely, a mobility allowance scheme and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards. These schemes may also be of interest to the applicant.</P>

      <P>On 5 November 2002, I indicated to the House that I would welcome an opportunity for my officials to enter a dialogue on this issue with either the relatives of those concerned or their representatives. Accordingly, officials from my Department met in November of last year with the co-ordinator of the Irish branch of the Shot at Dawn campaign. This group is lobbying for pardons for those soldiers who, in their opinion, were unjustly executed while serving in the British Army during the First World War. This number includes 26 apparently born on the island of Ireland. I also requested that our embassy in London look into this matter and it has provided much useful infor<Col N="1485" />mation about the progress of the Shot at Dawn campaign in Britain.</P>
      <P>The question of seeking retrospective pardons so long after the event is clearly a complex matter and the Government is carefully considering its approach to this issue. In doing so we are mindful of the likely sensitivities of the relatives concerned.</P>

      <P>The details supplied are insufficient to determine the eligibility of the person referred to, to take a course under the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS. The general conditions for eligibility are as follows: participants must be over 21 years of age and in receipt of unemployment assistance-benefit, one-parent family payment, disability allowance-benefit, invalidity pension, deserted wife's allowance-benefit, blind person's pension, widow-widower's contributory-non-contributory pension, prisoner's wife's allowance, or signing for credits or a dependent spouse of the relevant categories above. A VTOS student must be in receipt of one of these payments for at least six months, 156 days, immediately before starting the programme.</P>
      <P>A person who had a prior entitlement to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance receives a training allowance in lieu of their unemployment payment, at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit. Participants in receipt of other eligible social welfare payments will continue to receive payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. A weekly training bonus of &euro;31.80 is paid to students who have been in receipt of an unemployment payment for 312 days directly before the course commencement date. Books and materials are provided free of charge and a student will be entitled to a travel allowance if he-she lives more than three miles from the centre.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware of recent reports in the media about the establishment of, Tuismitheoirí-Teagaiscoirí Le Chéile. The Deputy will be aware that I recently published the 2003 school building programme in order to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students and to give an assurance that it is being operated in an open and transparent manner.</P>
      <P>The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, 433 schools will benefit in some way from the building programme and of course all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works. An innovative feature of this year's programme is the introduction of a devolved building initiative for small rural primary schools which will benefit 20 school communities.</P>
      <P>The Government has acknowledged the historical deficit in educational infrastructure and has set about redressing the situation by allocating substantial funding. Redressing the situation will take time but I am determined to ensure that the needs of schools right across the country are met.</P>

      <P>My Department's building unit has approximately 152 applications on hands for the provision of physical education halls in postprimary schools nationwide. The future progression of these projects through architectural planning is dependent on the successful implementation of the template designed halls. The four template halls which form the pilot scheme are at an advanced stage of architectural planning, stage 4/5 the pre-tender stage.</P>
      <P>Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position to allow further large scale projects, including the four template physical education halls, to progress to tender and construction during 2003. A letter will issue to all schools involved shortly outlining the position. These projects will be considered for the 2004 schools building programme.</P>

      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme was established in 1990 and is a key element in my Department's strategy to combat educational disadvantage. The scheme seeks to address the discontinuity between the children's home and community experiences and the demands of schooling by maximising active participation of targeted pupils in the learning process and by promoting active co-operation and collaboration between home, school and community. A national co-ordinator oversees the day-to-day operation of the scheme and promotes its development.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme co-ordinators are employed in schools in disadvantaged areas to work with school staff, parents and relevant community agencies in advancing the educational interests of children. At primary level applicants for co-ordinator positions must be fully qualified permanent primary teachers on the staff of schools in which the co-ordinators will serve. The successful applicant must have an appropriate profile among staff members and parents for work on this scheme and must be deployed to full-time liaison duties.</P>
      <P>The person in question was selected to fill a home-school-community liaison co-ordinator position that is shared between two schools in Tallaght. Unfortunately, the person is unqualified for this position. I regret to inform the Deputy that this person's employment ceases on 28 February. The position can only be filled by a qualified person.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of my Department's four maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance is awarded to eligible students who satisfy prescribed conditions including those relating to residence, nationality and previous academic attainment.</P>
      <P>Under the nationality requirement students must hold EU nationality, official refugee status or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State. It has been the case that students must meet the nationality requirement at the time of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
      <P>My Department accepts that the grants schemes have given rise to difficulties in the case of non-EU nationals who, in the course of their third level studies, become naturalised Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The schemes already contain a change in circumstances clause which provides that a candidate's eligibility may be assessed or re-assessed in the event of a change in circumstances in relation to, <i>inter alia,</i> reckonable income, the number of dependent children and normal residence.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the change in circumstances clause which has now been completed within my Department, it has been decided to implement a revision in the 2002 grants schemes through the addition of nationality, where the candidate becomes an Irish national or the national of another EU member state, to the categories of circumstances which would allow a local authority or vocational education committee to reassess an applicant, arising from a change in the applicant's circumstances.</P>
      <P>The 2002 schemes are effective in respect of the 2002-03 academic year. This revision will allow candidates who acquire nationality during the course of their studies to apply to be assessed or re-assessed for grant assistance with effect from the academic term when the change occurs. My Department is notifying the local authorities and vocational education committees accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 2000 a comprehensive technical and socio-economic review of the infrastructure requirements at the harbour was undertaken by KPMG Consulting in association with Posford Duvivier on behalf of the Department. The review of the harbour identified a range of development options ranging in price from an estimated &euro;14 million to &euro;24 million.</P>
      <P>This year I have allocated funding to engage consultants to commence the examination of options for a new pier development at the harbour. I have also approved funding of &euro;200,000 for safety and maintenance works in the harbour in 2003. Funding of &euro;50,000 and &euro;110,000 will be provided to complete work on the installation of security cameras and road surfacing.</P>
      <P>In late 2001 my predecessor appointed an interim board at Dunmore East comprising representatives of the fishing and marine leisure interests at the harbour, as well as representatives from Waterford County Council, BIM and the Department. In addition, the services of Waterford in Business were engaged to examine the business opportunities at the harbour and to work with the interim board. Much valuable information was gained from this exercise, particularly in respect of how the harbour should be managed and its worth to the local economy and surrounding area. A number of these recommendations have been adopted and more are under consideration in the context of the restructuring of fishery harbour centres generally. The proposals put forward concerning charges at Dunmore East have been taken into account in the formulation of new charges for FHCs. I propose to consult the industry in respect of these charges shortly.</P>

      <P>The total expenditure to date on the cliff stabilisation at Dunmore East fishery harbour centre, which incorporates the expenditure related to Shanooan, Dock Road and Island Lane, amounted to &euro;749,980.04 for the period 2000 to 2002, inclusive.</P>
      <P>Consultants engaged by my Department considered that planning permission was not necessary for the works at Shanooan. This view was subsequently confirmed in discussion with Waterford County Council. Following concerns raised locally and further meetings with county council officials it was decided to lodge a planning application in respect of the works.</P>
      <P>In 2000 consultants were engaged to advise on the necessary cliff stabilisation requirements on the cliffs at Dock Road-Island Lane. My Department lodged a planning application in respect of these works with Waterford County Council in May 2001 after consultation with council officials. The county council requested my Department to provide environmental impact assessments, having particular regard to the preservation of the Kittiwake colony at the Dock Road site. My Department engaged a specialist to advise on the issue. This requirement and various other issues delayed the notification by the council of its intention to grant permission until 19 August 2002.</P>
      <P>An appeal against planning permission was lodged with An Bord Pleanála by local interested parties. A decision was not expected from it until the end of 2002. As works can only be undertaken on these cliffs at the Dock Road site during the months of September to November, inclusive, due to the nesting habits of the Kittiwakes, this in effect prevented works proceeding until late 2003 at the earliest. Accordingly, it was decided to withdraw the planning application and avail of the opportunity to review the proposals and re-engage with local interested parties and council officials about their specific concerns before submitting a new planning application.</P>
      <P>A range of geological assessments were carried out on behalf of my Department. It would be glad to make those assessments available to the Deputy if requested.</P>

      <P>I am committed to developing Ennis General Hospital as part of the acute hospital services in the MWHB region. A briefing document has been prepared by the project team which I established. It sets out the broad scope of the future development of the hospital to be considered in the preparation of a development control plan. The board identified the following areas as priority areas for development on completion of the plan: ward upgrade; accident and emergency; radiology; outpatients; and general infrastructure upgrade.</P>
      <P>The board endorsed the briefing document and requested approval to formally appoint the selected design team to prepare the DCP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present my Department is reviewing the national development plan for the health sector nationally in light of the outturn position for 2002. This process involves providing for existing capital contractual commitments and commencing, where possible, the planning or construction of new projects nationally in 2003 or beyond. The <Col N="1496" />proposed developments at Ennis will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>In 2000 my Department, in conjunction with the North-Eastern Health Board, commissioned Kieran McKeown Limited, Social and Economic Research Consultants, to prepare a literature review of research carried out in other jurisdictions on domestic violence and men. The report was sought to provide a basis for the health services to respond to the needs of male victims of domestic violence and because of the absence of information on this issue in an Irish context.</P>
      <P>The first draft of the review was circulated to the health boards and other official agencies for comment. It was then returned to the authors for amendment. A second draft was submitted to the Department which sent it for independent peer review.</P>
      <P>Since this project was first begun the National Crime Council has commenced a study on domestic abuse which will question women and men and will be nationally representative. Using telephone interviewing the study will seek to estimate the prevalence of domestic abuse in Ireland today, service uptake and service satisfaction by victims of domestic abuse, the knowledge and awareness of members of the public of domestic abuse and knowledge of available services. My Department is contributing towards the cost of the study and the health boards are represented on its advisory group. My Department has passed to the council my Department's work to date on the literature review so that it can inform, where appropriate, the council's work. The following documents have been placed on my Department's website in the interest of openness and transparency: Draft Report, March 2002; Peer Review 1, September 2002; and Peer Review 2, September 2002; and Comments of the Authors on the Peer Reviews, January 2003. Please note that the contents of all documents are the responsibility of the respective authors and not of my Department.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department, through the NEHB, provides funding to AMEN, a voluntary organisation which provides services to male victims of domestic violence. Funding for 2003 is still under consideration within the health board. In previous years the following amounts were made available: 1999 &ndash;&euro;20,315.81 or £16,000; 2000 &ndash;&euro;12,697.38 or £10,000; 2001 &ndash;&euro;63,486.90 or £50,000; and in 2002 &ndash;&euro;20,000 or £15,748.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department looks forward to receiving the results of the national crime council's study. It <Col N="1497" />will inform health board responses to the service needs of male victims of domestic violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 227 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. However, I am aware of concerns about orthodontic services and consequently I have taken a range of measures to improve them nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, following a review of orthodontic services by representatives of health boards and health board consultant orthodontists, the Moran report was submitted to my Department contain<Col N="1498" />ing a number of recommendations on the future strategic development of orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations was the establishment of the grade of specialist in orthodontics that has now been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service: ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment, with &euro;465,000 of this allocated to the Western Health Board. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
    <P>Operational responsibility for the treatment of patients under the orthodontic initiative and the treatment purchase fund lies with the health boards in the first instance. I understand from the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board that a total of 250 cases were referred for treatment under the waiting list initiative in 2001 and 2002.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to secondary care orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me that at <Col N="1499" />the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 18,511 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This is an increase of approximately 4,000 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in 1999. In specific relation to the Western Health Board, the board reported to the joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children that in 1998 there were 4003 patients awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment in the boards area. At the end of September 2002, the chief executive officer reported that there were 1665 patients awaiting assessment and treatment in the Western Health Board area. I expect that the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service will continue to increase as these measures impact further on the service.</P>

      <P>Routine warfarin testing is a service provided primarily in hospitals.

This funding is now exhausted, and while an additional sum is to be made available to meet some unpaid claims under the scheme there are no funds available at present to continue the scheme on a long-term basis. I would reiterate that the limited, once-off nature of this funding was understood by all concerned.</P>

      <P>The health strategy outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services up to 2011. As part of the preparatory work for the strategy my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of the subsequent report entitled, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In 2002, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals. Funding for the opening of 520 of these beds was provided in 2002 and funding is available in 2003 to open the remaining beds.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently addressing the national specialty and regional issues associated with the allocation of the remainder of the 3,000 acute beds. The distribution by region and hospital of these additional beds will be determined in the light of this examination.</P>

      <P>The 2000 report from the national intellectual disability database was published in August 2001. The 2001 report <Col N="1501" />will be published before the end of March and the 2002 report will be available by early summer.</P>
      <P>The annual report is compiled from the regional datasets provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Due to a delay in the submission of one regional dataset, it was not possible to compile the information which forms the basis for the annual report. This was the case in relation to both 2001 and 2002.</P>
      <P>In April 2000, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,711 new residential and 912 new day places were required to meet the identified needs for these services. It should be noted that in addition to the day places required to meet the needs of those awaiting placement in the services as mentioned above, the additional funding also provided for those requiring a change in day services. These include young people leaving school and requiring rehabilitative training places or those moving from rehabilitative training to other areas of the services such as sheltered work, activation or services for older people.</P>
      <P>The initial indications from the 2001 data are that while the impact of the 2000 development programme is reflected in the data, there are still a significant number of persons seeking residential services in particular.</P>
      <P>Demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services even though the numbers of people receiving full-time residential services continue to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>A review of the waiting lists between 1997 and 1999, conducted by the Health Research Board and published in the 1999 annual report from the national intellectual disability database, showed that while 269 people from the original waiting list of 1,439 received full time residential services in the period, the waiting list had grown by an additional 238 places, i.e. 507 had joined the waiting list in the period.</P>
      <P>The health boards have been informed in their 2003 letters of determination that, given the key role which the national intellectual disability database has in the planning and monitoring of service provision, it is vital that the timetable for the compilation and submission of data in respect of 2003 is complied with. They have also been informed that there will be no extension of this timeframe in relation to the export of data to the Department and that they should take whatever measures are required to ensure that this deadline is met.</P>

      <P>The information in relation to the number of autistic people accommodated in psychiatric hospitals is not readily available in my Department. However, my Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for this information and will forward it to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>Following receipt of the report, Diabetes: Securing the Future from the Diabetes Federation of Ireland last year, a meeting took place between officials of my Department and the federation. The federation was informed that the report would be considered in the context of the current health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health <Col N="1505" />System for You, the primary care strategy, A New Direction, and within the limits of available funding. My Department is currently examining how best diabetic services can be improved nationally.</P>
      <P>The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, made a number of recommendations on the prevention of heart disease, many of these are also relevant to the prevention of diabetes.</P>
      <P>The strategy recommends the expansion of primary prevention initiatives to reduce the development of risk factors, and related diseases such as diabetes, in the population. Awareness of the need to adopt a more healthy lifestyle was one of the main objectives of the first phase of the heart health campaign, Ireland needs a Change of Heart.</P>
      <P>A combination of primary prevention in the general population and secondary prevention in those known to have heart disease, as outlined in, Building Healthier Hearts, can be expected to substantially reduce the risk of heart disease, including in patients with related conditions such as diabetes, in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The funding allocated by Government to the health services in 2003 is designed to maintain the existing level of service in overall terms. The economic outlook for 2003 is reflected in the approach taken by the Government to spending Estimates and the budget. Of the overall level of investment in public services in 2003, some two-thirds has been allocated to the health services.</P>
      <P>Service plans have been prepared by each health board, including the Southern Health Board, on the basis of the Letter of Determination issued by my Department. Discussions with each agency on their service plan have concluded and the focus within each agency is now on actioning the various measures proposed and on managing activity, employment and finances over the course of the year.</P>
      <P>While the measures proposed in each case vary from agency to agency on the basis of local needs and priorities, the overall pattern is one of consolidation in 2003, following a number of years of rapid expansion and development of services.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware there is a commitment in the National Health Strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, plus 600 <Col N="1506" />additional day hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson's disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. In addition, the strategy proposed the provision of an extra 800 extended care/community nursing unit places per year over a seven year period which will include provision for people with dementia.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board published its strategy, Older People Ageing with Confidence, in October 1999, which is a blue print for development services in the board's area. The board recognises the necessity to provide extra continuing care beds in its functional area.</P>
      <P>In response to the requirement for additional public continuing care beds in Cork city, the board is proceeding in partnership with St. Luke's Home, Mahon, and my Department with the planned development of 30 additional beds. Work has commenced on this development and it is hoped these beds will be brought into use during the year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may also be aware, public private partnerships (PPP) are currently being piloted in the health sector. PPP is based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially, the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units (CNUs) for older people. It is anticipated that eight new CNUs will be developed in the Southern Health Board area when the initial pilot programmes are complete providing up to a maximum of 400 new beds in Cork. The services offered in these units will include assessment and rehabilitation, respite, extended care and convalescence.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to use public private partnership as a means of providing additional community nursing units in other locations throughout the country following evaluation of the initial PPP pilot programmes.</P>
      <P>Additional continuing care beds will be provided at St. Luke's in the short-term. My Department is in ongoing discussions with the board in relation to the development of services for older people in the Cork city area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, con<Col N="1508" />tinues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</P>
    <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>
    <P>However, responsibility for the provision of funding to services to persons with an intellectual disability in the Dublin region lies, in the first instance, with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the matter and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The parliamentary question referred to by the Deputy would appear to have been answered on 10 December 2002 rather than on 12 December 2002. As I previously explained to the House, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting <Col N="1510" />Committees) Act 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order 1925.</P>
      <P>The function of visiting committees is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee have free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>Members of committees are appointed by the Minister for a term not exceeding three years. At that point they may be either re-appointed for a further term or are replaced by new members.</P>
      <P>Appointments to the visiting committees are made by me on foot of representations, usually either by individuals nominating themselves or from local representatives nominating a constituent. The fact that a nominee is not accepted for appointment to a prison visiting committee at a particular time does not necessarily mean that the individual is unsuitable to serve on a committee.</P>
      <P>I can, however, inform the Deputy that I have recently appointed a person from County Wexford to the visiting committee of Shelton Abbey Place of Detention.</P>

      <P>The Government decided in March 1993 that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to State bodies under their aegis. The Government further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice. The Government decision was issued to all Departments as guidelines which were further extended in March 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Minister is responsible for implementing the Government's gender balance policy in his or her own area. My Department monitors the progress in appointing women to State boards on a quarterly basis and constantly keeps the situation under review. Substantial progress has been made since 1992 in relation to gender balance on boards. Women's representation in all appointments, including external nominations from nom<Col N="1513" />inating bodies, increased from 15% in 1992 to 30% at 30 September 2002. In addition, women comprised 40% of ministerial nominations to State boards made during the three month period to the end of September 2002.</P>
    <P>While significant progress has been made towards the target of a minimum of 40% of both men and women on State boards, I am anxious to close the remaining 10% deficit in overall nominations. The Government is committed to the principle of a minimum target of 40% representation of both women and men on state boards and has declared its commitment to achieving this target in the programme for Government. In July 2002, the Minister of State with special responsibility for equality, Deputy O'Dea, contacted all Government Ministers with a request to review the gender balance of the State boards under the aegis of his or her Department and to take measures to redress the gender imbalances where the 40% target has not been reached. To ensure progress, the Minister of State intends bringing a six monthly report to the Government on the gender composition of boards for each Department broken down between boards newly appointed during that period and boards already in existence. The first progress report is being prepared and will be submitted to Government shortly. I have no plans to legislate in this area at this time.

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that, in accordance with the provisions of the Coroners Act 1962, coroners are appointed by the relevant local authority following selection by the Local Appointments Commission. The conditions of appointment and terms of employment are set out in the Coroner's Act 1962. In relation to remuneration, coroners are paid by the relevant local authority a salary which is fixed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and <Col N="1514" />the Minister for Finance with the approval of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Since 1995, following negotiations on the matter with the Coroners Association of Ireland, coroners' remuneration is made up of a basic retainer fee, related to their workload, and a fee per case which is paid in relation to the work carried out. These amounts are increased in line with increases under the national wage agreements. Under section 11 of the Act, coroners appointed after the commencement of the Act shall, unless he-she dies, resigns or is removed from office, hold office until he-she reaches the age of 70 years. There is no age restriction on coroners appointed prior to the 1962 Act.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I can confirm that I have recently given a commitment to replace, as soon as possible, all traditional padded cells with new safety observation cells which, while soft surfaced so as to protect the prisoner from self-harm, will fully meet the needs and respect the dignity of prisoners in every way consistent with his or her safety. New guidelines for the use of the special cells will be issued to ensure that they are used under strict supervision and only as a last resort. In this context, an implementation group has been set up in the Prisons Service to determine the most appropriate design for these cells and other related matters and to draft revised guidelines for the future use of these cells. I expect that this group will present their recommendations to me in the near future. The issue of whether additional staff training is required will be addressed at that stage.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Probation and Welfare Service have recently commissioned a research project on the number, profile and progression routes of homeless persons before the courts and in prison custody. The project, which will be funded by my Department, is being undertaken by the Centre for Social and Educational Research, Dublin Institute of Technology. The purpose of the project is to obtain accurate information about the numbers and profile of homeless persons appearing before the courts and in prison custody in the Dublin metropolitan area. It is also hoped to track and determine how homeless persons are dealt with by the court and prison system in this area, with particular reference to any involvement by the Probation and Welfare Service. I understand that the project will shortly go before the research ethics committees of both the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Irish Prison Service for authorisation to commence. Given that the project is at a very early stage, the issue of its publication or its release under the Freedom of Information Act does not arise at present.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a Romanian national who was arrested on 6 February 2003 because she had evaded a deportation order made in respect of her in August 2002. That deportation order had been made following her failure to pursue her application for refugee status which she had lodged in September 2001. Following her arrest, information came to hand that she had given birth to a baby girl in Ireland in November 2002. Arising from this new information, I then received a detailed submission in this matter and having fully considered the papers on file, including those relating to the birth of the child, I decided to affirm the deportation order originally made in August 2002. I should add that the legal representative of the person concerned was given a copy of the detailed submission in this case, on which basis I had affirmed the original deportation order. The removal of the person concerned, along with her child born in November 2002, from the State was carried out by the Garda National Immigration Bureau. I am satisfied that the action taken in this case was in accordance with the law, particularly as clarified by the recent decision in the Supreme Court relating to the residency rights of the parents of Irish born children. Procedures to deal with the backlog of cases in this area are still being considered but such consideration does not preclude decisions being taken in respect of individual cases as they arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 to 267, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I assume the references to green taxes in the context of the questions is to taxes addressing greenhouse gas emissions. The Minister for Finance, who has responsibility for taxation and budgetary matters, announced in his budget on 4 December 2002 that the relevant Government Departments had been asked to advance plans for a general carbon energy tax with a view to introducing such a tax from the end of 2004; that given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there would be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax, and that a reasonable period is being allowed for its effective introduction. The final decision on the introduction of a new tax is a matter for the Minister for Finance in a Government budgetary context. My Department prepared comprehensive and detailed proposals for implementing greenhouse gas taxation, across all fossil fuels and sectors using these fuels, for the tax strategy group, chaired by the Department of Finance, in advance of the budget. I will provide the Deputy with a copy of the paper, which may be found on the Department of Finance website at: http://www.finance.gov.ie/ publications/tsg02/tsg0223a.rtf.</P>
      <P>The information requested, in so far as it is available to me, is contained in that paper.</P>

      <P>Rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his-her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;12. The maximum level of rent, which a person applying for rent supplement may incur is determined by each health board in respect of its functional area and is set by reference to local rental values. The legislation governing rent supplements allows health boards to exceed these limits in cases where, in the opinion of the board, exceptional circumstances exist. The person concerned was informed by the local community welfare officer of the Western Health Board that the rent being sought in this case was in excess of the appropriate limit and that her application would have to be refused. She was advised that she should attempt to secure more appropriately priced accommodation or alternatively seek a reduction in the rent. She has not subsequently contacted the officer.</P>
      <P>The administration of the scheme in this case is a matter for the Western Health Board and I have no function in deciding the case. The person in question should return her application form to the board so that a formal decision can be made. If the person is dissatisfied with the decision she may appeal to the health board appeals officer and subsequently, if necessary, the social welfare appeals office.</P>

    <P>These figures represent an increase of 278 persons receiving unemployment benefit when compared with the corresponding week in 2002. This increase occurred in the context of 697 redundancies in County Wexford being notified to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment during 2003. My Department, through its employment support services, in conjunction with other agencies, will continue to assist those persons on the live register to make the transition to work, education and relevant training. In 2002, 57 persons in receipt of unemployment benefit in County Wexford were referred under the employment action plan of FÁS. Of these 618 or 64.6% ceased their unemployment benefit claims during 2002 and a further 99 or 10% have been referred for education or training.</P>

      <P>The day to day administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which provides for the payment of rent supplements, is the responsibility of each health board.</P>
      <P>A health board must satisfy itself that a <i>bona fide</i> tenancy exists in respect of a property for which a rent supplement is sought. The means by which it discharges this obligation is primarily the responsibility of the health board but I am satisfied that it would not be possible to do this effectively without contact with the landlord</P>
      <P>In this regard the first step in verifying the tenancy is the completion of the appropriate application forms on which the applicant supplies details of the household composition and means. The landlord must confirm details relating to the address, type of accommodation and the amount of rent being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" />In addition to the application forms other documents such as rent books-receipts or a copy of the lease agreement may be requested by the health board. It is a matter for the health board <Col N="1524" />to decide on the level of documentation it requires for the purpose of verifying the tenancy.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the process currently used by the health boards to verify tenancies for the purpose of rent supplement is reasonable.</P>
