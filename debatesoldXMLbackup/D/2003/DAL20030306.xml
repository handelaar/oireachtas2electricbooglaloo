      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I must deal with a postponed division relating to the suspension of a Member. Yesterday, on the question, &ldquo;That Deputy Durkan be suspended from the service of the Dáil&rdquo;, a division was claimed and, in accordance with Standing Order 61, that division must take place now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the regionalisation of our hospital services, which acts to the detriment of other general hospitals through the removal of much-needed local services such as maternity and 24-hour accident and emergency services. Cavan General Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, continue to be the subject of ongoing industrial relations problems due to the fact that staff cannot cope with the ever-increasing workload in overcrowded and unworkable situations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 12, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a proposal that section 17A of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 shall continue in force for the period ending on 8 March 2004, back from committee; No. 16, motion re Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003; No. 2, Digital Hub Development Agency Bill 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage; No. 1, Immigration Bill 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 12 and 16 shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 12 and 16 agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There will shortly be a crisis in the agricultural sector in relation to the rendering of meat and bonemeal. I suggest that we have a debate on No. 12 because under EU regulations the Government is entitled to continue subsidies for rendering until the end of the year. I ask the Tánaiste for a debate on how we can avoid the crisis that will erupt in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision for debate on No. 16. This is a consequence of the previous Government's failure, for three years, to list the events that should be broadcast free-to-air. It is appropriate that the House should have the opportunity to discuss the rationale behind which events are included or not and the consequences of the inordinate delay and neglect under the stewardship of the previous Government. Will the Tánaiste provide a minimum amount of time to hear whether the Minister is locking the stable door after the horse has bolted, or whether we have salvaged something from this debacle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party supports the calls for debates on the two motions already referred to. The Government cannot be allowed to adopt an unchanged approach in relation to the disposal of animal products, which seems to be one of burning the problem away, without hearing from the House.</P>
      <P>The broadcast designation of major sports events has already exhibited considerable public debate, therefore there is an onus on the House to debate the matter and we support this call.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Both motions require the careful scrutiny of Members of the House. The proposal to extend the period up to 8 March 2004 in relation to the disposal of diseased animal carcasses is unacceptable and it is imperative that we address the matter.</P>
      <P>The idea that this House is merely a rubber stamp for a proposal or a set of recommendations in the context of the television broadcasting of major events is equally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal relating to the Disease of Animals Act 1966 was fully debated on Committee Stage and agreed unanimously. It is an extension of the provisions introduced to deal <Col N="1401" />with the foot and mouth crisis. It does not apply to the situation regarding renderers referred to by Deputy Kenny.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to have a debate in the House on the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, but the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is not here at the moment. However, if the Whips agree to a time later this morning or this afternoon, we could have that debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>By a decision of this House, the Fine Gael party has been rendered Whip-less. Rather than calling for a division on No. 12, the Tánaiste might indicate if the Government intends to do something about the impending crisis in relation to the rendering of meat and bonemeal, in order to set at ease the minds of those to whom this is causing serious concern, not least, the farmers of Ireland.</P>

      <P>For the past two days, this House quite rightly gave the Taoiseach permission to be absent from the House on account of the important business being conducted in respect of Northern Ireland. Yesterday, I asked if the Tánaiste would clarify whether the Taoiseach might come to the House yesterday or today to give Members a briefing on what has happened as the talks have broken down and because of the importance of this matter to all parties. However, this did not happen. Yesterday, the Taoiseach met with Fianna Fáil councillors from Drogheda to discuss broadband&mdash;</P>

      <P>This morning, the Taoiseach telephoned the &ldquo;Marian Finucane&rdquo; radio programme to congratulate Seán Óg Ó Ceallacháin, which is fine, but he should come to the House today to <Col N="1402" />brief Members. I now find that the Taoiseach is due to be in Tipperary at 1.45 p.m. to present sports scholarship certificates at the Canon Hayes Recreation Centre.</P>

      <P>I have the press release from 6 February announcing the Finance Bill. It is headlined &ldquo;Closing Tax Loopholes&rdquo;. Yesterday, a new loophole was opened which, the Minister for Finance agreed, derived from a meeting in his Department with one of his constituents. However, the Tánaiste sought to give the impression that it had derived from a matter of general policy. I invite the Tánaiste to put the record straight and give an undertaking to the House that the practice, whereby amendments of wide import are being entered at the last minute on Report Stage, will not continue. This practice, which is an abuse of the legislative process, has grown up over the years because of the arrogance and remoteness of the Government. For example, the Immigration Bill&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Immigration Bill 2002, on which my colleague Deputy Costello wishes to raise a point, has been passed through the Seanad, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has since gone back to Cabinet and will now table a raft of amendments to a Bill that has already been debated and passed by the Upper House. This demonstrates a fundamental disrespect for the parliamentary process. Will the Tánaiste restore some respect to this House through the manner in which legislation is enacted?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a need to improve or amend legislation, it is better to do so while the Bill is passing through the Oireachtas, rather than waiting a number of years before amending legislation can be introduced. In the case the Deputy mentions, the matter will have to go back to the Seanad, which is not unusual in the case of major legislation.</P>
      <P>There were provisions in the existing Finance Acts to encourage private sector investment in the provision of hospital infrastructure. That was amended to include day cases too. If the policy is right, which I believe it is, it is not wrong to amend it.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle suggested that Deputy Rabbitte find another way of asking why the Taoiseach is not here to give due account of the negotiations at Hillsborough. However, when I employed another way of raising this matter yesterday, by attempting to table a motion under Standing Order 31, the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order as being inappropriate. The matter is of major importance to every Member. As a representative of Sinn Féin, it is scandalous that the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs are not coming before the House to give a substantive report on the negotiations that have <Col N="1404" />taken place at Hillsborough. It is the right of each Member to have a full and incisive account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill 2002. The main purposes of the Bill are: to establish Digital Media Development Limited, DMDL, the body established by the Government to oversee the development of the digital hub, on a statutory basis as the Digital Hub Development Agency; to provide for the necessary corporate and governance structures for such a State body; and to define the functions and role of the agency in relation to the development of the digital hub.</P>
      <P>These include: to procure, promote and facilitate the development of the digital hub as a location for digital enterprises and related activities; to promote and facilitate the development of the physical and communications infrastructures for the digital hub; formulating strategies to promote the digital hub; preparing a development plan for the hub and estimates of the costs of its implementation; consulting with local community interests as part of the implementation of the development plan; and negotiating agreements, including funding arrangements, with interested parties in order to progress the development of the project. In addition, I am using the Bill to make minor amendments to the Communications Regulation Act 2002.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the Bill in detail, I will outline the rationale for the project, its location, progress to date and significant developments going forward. The digital hub is the area in the Liberties-Coombe around Thomas Street, which has been designated as a centre for digital content enterprises and related activities. Digital content refers to the creation of content which can be manipulated, stored and exchanged electronically. Content includes sound, pictures, text and video available in digital format and embraces sectors such as education, information, entertainment and consumer orientated content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Digital content has emerged as a key growth area from the ICT revolution over the past ten years. ICT has provided significant benefits for this country, in that we have attracted all the big multinational players and have developed a successful indigenous software sector. We now need to build on these successes by moving our economy up the technological value chain. This involves enhancing research and development capacity and ensuring that we create a critical mass of knowledge enterprises. The Government has recognised that investment in R&amp;D is the key to creating the right conditions to foster inno<Col N="1410" />vation and intellectual capital which will be the lifeblood of knowledge enterprises. This is why R&amp;D has been allocated a total of &euro;2.47 billion over the lifetime of the national development plan, with &euro;698 million of this going to improve the capacity of research in the higher education sector.</P>
    <P>The capacity to successfully develop knowledge economy enterprises is also underpinned by a robust regulatory environment and high grade telecommunications infrastructure. A number of actions have already been taken on both fronts. The enactment of the Electronic Commerce Act 2000, which gives legal validity to electronic signatures and documents, and the Communications Regulation Act 2002, which provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the establishment of the Commission for Communications Regulation are important regulatory developments. On the infrastructure side, an indicative amount of &euro;200 million has been provided for the development of broadband infrastructure in Ireland for the lifetime of the NDP. In addition, my Department has also been involved in trials of alternative technologies, including wireless LAN and satellite communications.</P>
    <P>On the broader jobs front, there have been a number of high profile job losses in the technology sector in recent times and there is no doubt that we are not immune to the international downturn in this area. Arising from this, it is reasonable to ask if the Government is placing too much faith in technology to deliver high quality sustainable jobs going forward. I believe the sector has the capacity to deliver significant growth and, therefore, it is important that we now invest in research and infrastructure so we are well positioned to reap the benefits when the international outlook improves.</P>
    <P>Turning to digital content itself, I will now focus on our digital content blueprint, which is set out in a recently published Forfás report. The scale of the opportunity to be grasped is clear from the growth projections outlined for the industry. This report estimates that the digital content industry which was worth $178 billion in 2001 is expected to be worth $434 billion by 2006. Building on our previous successes in the technology sector, a significant opportunity now exists to build critical scale in the digital content sector before the industry enters a high growth phase. Our relative size means that it is not possible for us to compete in all market segments. However, a number of sectors have been identified, such as e-learning, where we already have a significant reputation, games and digital libraries. In the development of any new industry Government support is vital and the report recognises that Government commitment to this sector has been visibly demonstrated by its support for the digital hub and Media Lab Europe.</P>
    <P>The key to the growth of the industry is the widespread use of electronic access devices such as mobile phones, PDAs and PCs. Deputies will be aware of the high penetration rate of mobile <Col N="1411" />phones in this country with ownership running at approximately 80%, although Internet penetration is not as high. Indications are that 34% of the population use the Internet at home. A significant factor impeding increased Internet usage is the associated phone costs. In order to stimulate increased use of the Internet, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has issued a policy direction to the new Commission for Communications Regulation, requesting the commission to use its powers to bring about the provision of flat-rate Internet access by market players. The Minister has asked the commission to report to him on progress on this matter.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the project itself, elaborate on the background and outline progress to date. The collaborative agreement between the Government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology establishing Media Lab Europe as a third level research faculty in technology, represented the first phase of the project. The Liberties-Coombe area was chosen as the location for the hub, mainly because MIT was anxious to locate the Media Lab Europe facility in a down-town location, with residential, cultural and entertainment facilities nearby, so that students and faculty members would live, work and socialise in the locality.</P>
    <P>In order to leverage the maximum benefit from the location of the Media Lab in Dublin, it was decided to cluster a digital media village &ndash; the original name for the hub &ndash; around Media Lab Europe. In addition, it has been demonstrated often that one of the critical success factors in the creation of a new industry segment is the clustering of similar enterprises together so that ideas and knowledge can be easily exchanged.</P>
    <P>The competitive advantage which arises from the clustering effect must also be enhanced by the provision of necessary support services, such as training, telecommunications and marketing, so that high-potential start-ups can make the transformation to viable long-term enterprises. The Guinness complex of buildings around Thomas Street represents an attractive setting for the type of ambience the project is aiming to create.</P>
    <P>The institutional framework for the project was put in place in April 2000 when the Government approved the establishment of Digital Media Development Ltd. to develop a digital media village around MLE. A funding package of &euro;81 million was approved in April 2001, with the bulk of the funding ear-marked for property purchase for both Media Lab Europe and the hub, while the remainder was allocated to cover operational expenses for the development company to the end of this year. In addition, it was decided that refurbishment of property would be funded by the private sector.</P>
    <P>On the property front, a number of buildings have been purchased, mainly from Guinness, and it has been decided that private sector investment will be leveraged using a PPP model. DMDL has <Col N="1412" />started this process and has invited expressions of interest from interested consortia. After a short-listing process, four consortia have been selected from which a preferred bidder will be chosen. It is envisaged that the PPP will deliver 500,000 sq. ft. of space which will be used for residential, retail, educational and community uses. The scale of the development means that it will be some time before the PPP process delivers space which can be used.</P>
    <P>To facilitate those enterprises that are anxious to move into the area as soon as possible two initiatives are under way. The first, which aims to provide short-term space for companies in the first quarter of this year, involves the refit of a building fronting on to Thomas Street. Six companies have already moved into the building and more are expected in the next few weeks. A more ambitious project involves the refurbishment of the Printworks building as a joint venture between DMDL, Enterprise Ireland and Dublin City Council, for high potential indigenous digital content firms. This building will be ready by the summer. The Printworks building is a good example of the partnership approach which has existed from the inception of the project. A project such as this which has so many strands cannot be undertaken by a single entity and this has always been recognised by DMDL. Partnerships have been established with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA as a mix of local and international projects is critical to the success of the project.</P>
    <P>Another key element is a high-grade telecommunications infrastructure. My Department has provided more than &euro;2 million for a broadband ring in the hub. Using this funding, Dublin City Council has built the required infrastructure and will be in a position to offer open access to telecommunications companies in the first quarter of this year. This will facilitate the delivery of competitively priced broadband services to enterprises in the area.</P>
    <P>Urban regeneration is another significant area and the key partner here is also Dublin City Council. The Liberties-Coombe area has an impressive heritage of industrial buildings and the utilisation of these for enterprise and residential space will help to give the hub a distinctive character and can be used as a marketing tool in the attraction of international digital media enterprises. We are not alone in seeing the potential of digital content to create high quality sustainable employment and there are a number of similar projects around the world. Therefore, harnessing the unique aspects of our project such as the attractive physical environment and our strong cultural heritage in music and literature is important.</P>
    <P>Ensuring that the people who live in the locality are key stake holders in the project is vital and a number of fora have been established to allow their views to be heard and taken on board. In addition, a number of initiatives have already started with a learning remit. Continuing the partnership approach, a number of State bod<Col N="1413" />ies have leveraged private sector investment to fund ICT initiatives. For example, the Liberties learning initiative is an education and community-based programme being run as part of the hub. The focus of the project is on digital literacy and empowering local people to acquire the skills and know-how to avail of future employment opportunities in the area. Part of the project involves the provision of a learning space where digital literacy courses aimed at, among others, teachers and community leaders are offered. Also on the education front, local schools have already been offered opportunities to improve computer literacy.</P>
    <P>Another interesting community-based project is a joint initiative involving educational providers, local community groups and the private sector, which aims to develop a community-based IT service in the inner city. A number of local authority housing complexes will be supplied with state-of-the-art computer equipment, support services and training. One of the complexes to be included in the scheme is the Bridgefoot Street housing complex which is within the hub. Ultimately, the targeting of educational and training resources at local people will create a pool of workers who will be in a position to avail of the highly skilled jobs to be located in the area.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. The Bill is separated into four Parts. Part 1 contains standard provisions covering the Short Title, interpretations and the laying of orders and regulations before both Houses. Part 2 deals with the establishment of the Digital Hub Development Agency. Part 3 deals with transitional provisions arising out of the transformation of Digital Media Development Ltd. into the Digital Hub Development Agency, and Part 4 sets out certain minor amendments to the Communications Regulations Act, which was enacted on 27 April 2002.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains standard provisions in relation to the short title of the Bill, the interpretation of words and phrases used, procedures for laying orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the establishment day, and the usual provision for expenses.</P>
    <P>In Part 2, section 7 sets out standard provisions relating to the establishment of a State body. The functions and role of the agency are set out in sections 8 to 10. The functions of the agency reflect the three main strands of the project, that is, enterprise, community learning and urban regeneration. Reflecting the key inter-dependencies, the Bill specifically provides for consultation with key State agencies and with the local community. Since the Bill was first published, the Minister has decided to strengthen the functions of the agency in so far as they relate to the role of the private sector in property refurbishment in order to reflect the importance of the PPP process. These provisions also set out the mechanisms through which the agency will interact with my Department in carrying out its functions.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 allow the Minister to confer additional functions on the agency and to issue <Col N="1414" />policy directions to it. Sections 13 and 14, reflecting the commercial remit of the agency, allow it to form subsidiaries, make investments and enter into joint ventures for the purposes of fulfilling any of its functions. However, any such arrangements may only be entered into with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance. The agency may also, with the consent of the Minister, make charges for the provision by it of services.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 18 set out provisions on the composition of the agency, its chairperson and procedural matters concerning its meetings and committees. These provisions follow recently enacted legislation establishing similar bodies. The appointment and terms of office of the chief executive, which include <i>ex officio</i> membership of the board for the duration of their appointment are detailed in section 19.</P>
    <P>Staffing provisions are covered in sections 20 and 21. The agency is allowed to appoint staff and make schemes for superannuation. The requirement to draw up a code of conduct for staff is set out in section 23. Procedures to be followed in the event that a member of the agency, the chief executive or a member of staff becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament, are set out in section 22. Again, sections 20 to 23 are standard provisions and are in line with enacted legislation establishing similar bodies.</P>
    <P>As is usual for State bodies, provisions on the declaration and disclosure of interests, and the disclosure of confidential information, by both members of the agency and members of staff, are dealt with in sections 24 to 27.</P>
    <P>The conditions whereby the agency may accept gifts of money, property and so on, are set out in section 28. It also stipulates that the particulars of any gift accepted should be included in the annual report to the Minister. The Minister is empowered to make advances to the agency, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to cover expenditure by the agency incurred in the performance of its functions in section 29.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, the Minister brought forward an amendment to the Bill to allow the agency borrowing powers up to a limit of &euro;l0 million. This function is set out in section 30. Arising from the power to borrow, the functions of the agency in section 8 were amended to reflect the fact that, in certain instances, it may be appropriate for the agency to borrow to undertake construction or maintenance works directly.</P>
    <P>Section 31 deals with the accounts of the agency. Procedures for keeping accounts and providing financial information to the Minister are covered, as is the requirement that accounts of the agency be submitted for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Minister has provided in sections 32 and 33 for the accountability of the chief executive to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas Committees. As is usual in legislation of this type, <Col N="1415" />section 34 provides for the submission of an annual report to the Minister and establishes the format and procedures to be followed in the submission of this report.</P>
    <P>Section 35 allows the agency to engage consultants and advisers as it considers necessary and provides that payment for such services would be met from the agency's budget. The seal of the agency is dealt with in section 36. This is a standard provision and is in line with current legislation for State bodies. Standard provisions which deal with indemnification of certain people carrying out their duties in pursuance of the agency's functions, and the immunity of the agency in respect of damages are contained in sections 37 and 38.</P>
    <P>Turning to Part 3, the sections here are standard transitional provisions to transfer functions to a new body. Section 39 provides for the dissolution of DMDL. This is a necessary legal step in transforming it into the agency. Section 40 provides that any references in legislation will automatically be taken to refer to the agency on the enactment of this Bill. It is also necessary to provide for drawing up the final accounts of the company and section 44 sets out the legislative basis for this.</P>
    <P>Transfer of the assets and liabilities of the former company is provided for in section 41. To reflect the fact that properties purchased in the hub were vested in the Commissioners of Public Works until the establishment of the agency, this section provides that the property acquired on behalf of DMDL, by the Office of Public Works, is transferred to the new agency on enactment of the legislation. Members will note, however, that the property purchased by Office of Public Works for Media Lab Europe will remain vested in Office of Public Works as MLE is a separate legal entity to DMDL. Sections 42 and 43 are also standard provisions dealing with the transfer of contracts and any legal proceedings from the company to the agency.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Part 4 is to give effect to certain minor amendments to the Communications Regulation Act 2002, including the amendment of the long title of the Bill to reflect the amendments to the Communications Regulation Act. A number of the proposed amendments are of a technical nature relating to the drafting of the Act, while the remaining amendments relate to the transfer of certain minor functions from the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to the new Commission for Communications Regulation, which were inadvertently omitted from the original text. The Schedule to the Bill defines the geographical area of the digital hub, and so defines the area within which DMDL and, therefore, the agency has its remit.</P>
    <P>A project of this type which represents significant State investment in a new industry is not without risk. The same could be said of other initiatives such as the IFSC and the indigenous software industry when they were in their infancy. <Col N="1416" />The lesson to be learned from the success of these projects, it that it is important to have a clear well thought out development strategy in place and to implement the strategy in a coherent fashion. We have done this with progress on the Bill placing the development company on a statutory footing, a significant investment in property, the provision of telecoms infrastructure and the involvement from the start of the project of key stake holders.</P>
    <P>I am confident the digital hub will become a world renowned centre for the digital content industry, thereby enhancing our innovation and intellectual capital capacity and, in time, will make an important contribution to the Government's knowledge economy strategy. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, 2002  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and that is has finally come before the House. Its purpose is to place the development company for the digital hub, Digital Media Development Limited, on a statutory basis and rename it as the Digital Hub Development Agency.</P>
      <P>The digital hub refers to an area in Thomas Street in Dublin. The intention of the initial project was to cluster together Irish and international media companies, research and development companies and educational initiatives. This is a concept I welcome. It is creating a digital quarter in our capital city and it sends out a message to the public and, more importantly, to potential investors that the digital media business in Dublin is taken seriously by the Government and by Dublin city. It could be described as a flagship project to highlight our intention to keep Ireland as an attractive destination to attract investment in IT, software development and digital media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" />While I welcome this Bill it is important to note that this is it only one, admittedly not insignificant, project nationally. It should be used as a template for other towns and cities across the country if we are serious about digital media development on a national basis and, more importantly, if we are serious about decentralisation outside Dublin. Digital media and information technology generally have the luxury, if the required infrastructure is in place, of not being located by necessity in the capital city or other major urban areas. By and large, their products can be sent and sold through a telecommunications infrastructure, if it is in place.</P>
    <P>Before I speak generally about the Bill and other digital media issues nationally, I wish to refer to an article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> about which anyone interested in the digital hub concept and the Bill will be concerned. The headline states: &ldquo;Digital Hub battles cash flow problems&rdquo;. It outlines the history of the digital hub, which is positive in many ways. The hub was established in 2001 with the intention and clear target of attracting 700 companies to employ up to 30,000 people, including residents and students, to produce products such as games, software and supports to the music and film industry, and it was to be developed through a public private partnership, a concept that appears to be questioned at some levels of Government. Some &euro;130 million has been spent to date and six companies employing about 100 people have moved into offices in recent weeks. This is a welcome development. The Bill is to place the DMDL on a State agency footing to give it an increased ability to raise loans up to &euro;10 million to finance its further development.</P>
    <P>The article points out that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said in the Seanad when introducing the Bill that the agency, as a commercial body, would be obliged to obtain its revenue from its own activities in future, despite that some support revenue clearly came from Government. Since its inception, the DMDL was promised operational support from the Government, and rightly so. The Government should be strongly supportive of the project. Some &euro;2.5 million was promised in 2001, &euro;2 million in 2002 and a further &euro;2.3 million is promised for this year to ensure the future development of the digital hub.</P>
    <P>However, through documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, we see that the digital hub has had serious cash flow problems since September 2002. The article states:</P>
    <P>Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 show that the Digital Hub ran into considerable cash flow problems in September 2002. A letter from the Digital Hub's executive services team director . . .  to . . .  an assistant secretary at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, confirmed &ldquo;that Digital Media Development has been experiencing significant cash flow difficulties over recent weeks and is now in breach of the Prompt Payments Act, <Col N="1418" />1997&rdquo;. The communication claimed that the agency had not received a drawdown of its quarterly budget for July to September 2002 and requested more funds to pay suppliers, lawyers and equipment. It is understood that a process was put in train to provide DMDL with the drawdown of funds.</P>
    <P>However, going into 2003, DMDL was warned that for its allocation of funds for 2003 it must not enter into contracts that would exceed its allocation [and rightly so].</P>
    <P>In the subsequent weeks, the department point out that the DMDL had already overrun its annual operational spend sanctioned by the department for a three-year period. On 7 October, a communication . . .  pointed out that DMDL had a &euro;500k budget surplus that must be surrendered. It stated: &ldquo;The Department of Finance takes the view that the surplus of &euro;500k from last year plus the &euro;1.5m already issued this year fully satisfies DMDL operational funding requirements for 2002. On this basis, the Department of Finance has advised that the remaining drawdown of &euro;500k in respect of 2002 from this department to DMDL is not to be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This means that the drawdown of &euro;500k, which has recently been made, represents the final allocation of operational funding for DMDL for this year,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I could go on but it is difficult to follow the detail of the article because it is complicated. The bottom line is that there is a serious concern about cash flow problems and there appears to be some uncertainty as to what money is available from Government. It appears that the DMDL made a conscious decision to roll over some of last year's funds into this year to pay expenses at the beginning of this year and, as a result, the Department of Finance is interpreting that as being that the DMDL did not use its allocation last year and therefore will not give it the full allocation promised for this year.</P>
    <P>We need clarity on this, as does the digital hub. We are talking about significant sums of money &ndash;&euro;500,000 is the sum about which there is uncertainty. Will the Minister of State outline clearly the position of the Department of Finance on the funding for 2002 and its implications for funding for 2003? This would give us a clear position of where the digital hub stands financially.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some general comments about digital media nationally and the infrastructure that needs to be put in place to allow that to happen. It is a responsibility on us in this discussion to include the issue of where we stand at present regarding national telecommunications infrastructure. Clearly, the concept of the digital hub should not remain in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that we have achieved high standards in some parts of Dublin in connectivity and telecommunications infrastructure. For example, the connectivity and services provided in City West are excellent and that is reflected in the number of companies that have moved there and <Col N="1419" />flourished. However, the fact that it takes longer for an e-mail to go from Cork to Dublin than it does from CityWest to New York makes one realise the inadequacy of the national infrastructure and the connectivity from the regions to international destinations.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the facts established by independent monitors of Ireland's performance in the availability of broadband access. In a recent World Economic Forum examination of world competitiveness for 2002 to 2003, Ireland ranks 51st in the nations examined. As I pointed out before when questioning the Minister with responsibility for e-government, we are behind countries such as Panama, Estonia, Chile, El Salvador, Romania, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Venezuela, Latvia, Brazil, Turkey, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Peru and Slovenia. As one might expect from that list, we are also behind all our EU counterparts. For a country that makes the proud claim to be the largest exporter of software in the world and that is a platform for American IT multinationals to sell their products into Europe, we have failed abysmally to put in place the necessary, as opposed to the desired, telecommunications infrastructure to allow this industry to continue to flourish and to encourage further investment into the country. It is to our shame that this list is available internationally and that people read it in magazines such as <i>The Economist, Time,</i> etc.</P>
    <P>In case anyone feels that report treats Ireland unfairly, we should consider some other international reports. In the Economist Intelligence Unit's e-readiness ranking, which measures where a country is in relation to Internet opportunities, we rank 15th in the world behind America, the Netherlands, Britain, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Canada, Finland, Singapore, etc. For a country that claims to be electronically competitive, we are far down the list.</P>
    <P>An interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in 2001 pointed out that a digital divide has emerged on class lines with a failure to develop a proper digital television service, preventing lower income groups from gaining access to e-mail and the Internet. Geographically the divide shows that high-technology is racing ahead in Dublin far quicker than elsewhere in the country. Although I welcome it, the digital hub is contributing to that problem. Some 19 Internet data centres were due to be completed in Dublin in 2003, but the total for the rest of the country is two. When converted to a priority ranking on a ratio basis it can be seen how miserably the rest of the country is treated for rollout of infrastructure and Internet readiness.</P>
    <P>Despite having gone through a period of stability and prosperity, the Government has seriously neglected its responsibilities to put in place the necessary infrastructure to encourage inward investment and allow existing industry to grow and prosper at the same time as an inter<Col N="1420" />national downturn in IT activity. Unfortunately this is resulting in Ireland becoming quite uncompetitive as a location for investment by major IT companies, which have contributed hugely to our economy.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence from the business sectors. People from companies such as Apple, Iona Technologies &ndash; Chris Horne is very outspoken in this area &ndash; Microsoft, Dell and others are demanding the infrastructure they need to continue to expand their employment in Ireland and they want to stay here. Ireland is an attractive location on many grounds. We speak English and provide a good well educated workforce. However the key issue is infrastructure for which the Government has primary responsibility. Services that were provided in competing countries up to five years ago are only now being talked about here. Later I will deal with the small progress we have made, which is important to recognise.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Information Society Commission, which was established by the Government as an independent advisory body, points out starkly that broadband telecommunications infrastructure is increasingly seen as having an importance in the 21st century that will parallel that of electricity in the 20th century and railroads in the 19th century. That is a strong statement that needs to be taken on board.</P>
    <P>Representatives from users' organisations have also made their views quite clear. Bodies such as Ireland Offline are conducting a continual campaign to improve service provision, infrastructure and connectivity. The consequence of not responding to these calls from the industry, users and independent groups established to advise the Government will be far more dramatic than many people realise. Many people see the IT industry as a niche industry. If we proceed as we should, it will have very positive implications as well as continuing to promote Ireland as a location for software development and IT investment.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Government there are a number of areas where it seems to have made some progress, which needs to continue. I welcome the fact that the Minister has recently established a strategy group to continually update him on the issues and what is required. However, I have some concerns that the group is not fully representative. It comprises users, consumers and small and medium enterprises, but not ComReg. If the regulator &ndash; or the enforcer as it will need to become &ndash; is not in the group it is difficult to come forward with credible recommendations. The Minister should reconsider the bodies on that group with a view to including the regulator or a representative from ComReg. It is imperative that she and her team be apprised of the recommendations that are being formulated and made. I would like the Minister to respond to that at the end of this debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome Eircom's recent announcements. ComReg is beginning to show its teeth, which is positive. To be fair to the Minister that is partly <Col N="1421" />due to his having given clear directives and made known his targets for new service provision. Eircom has realised that its monopoly in the market will not last forever and it will be forced to share its infrastructure, which has been such a problem over the past five years. Up to the last six months the Government failed miserably to tackle that problem. I recognise that progress has been made, albeit late.</P>
    <P>There are three key issues for the consumer and small businesses relating to the provision of services. They need access, a choice of service provider and a choice of pricing. I urge the Minister and his Department to insist on a timetable for the provision of wholesale prices by Eircom, which it is required to provide under law and which ComReg has a responsibility to enforce. The Minister must drive this politically. Without wholesale prices for the use of the Eircom infrastructure we will never have competition in the market or service choice. This does not only relate to a flat rate always-on service, but also to a wide range of services. That must happen and the Minister must drive it. If he does not do so, it is less likely to happen.</P>
    <P>Let us assume small and medium size enterprises have access and connectivity. They need a service with continuous access which must be priced on a flat rate basis. Let us take auctioneers as an example. Many auctioneers are connected to the Internet and send e-mails on a regular basis. They have real difficulty in calculating and measuring how much a connection to the Internet will cost on a monthly basis. Auctioneers need the financial certainty provided by what has become a necessary tool, namely flat rate charging. These rates should be competitive in comparison with other countries, particularly our prime competitor, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our target should be to provide flat rate, continuous Internet access at a cost of between &euro;30 and &euro;40 per month.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to direct the Commission for Communications Regulation to insist on the provision of continuous access and flat rate pricing, both of which are key requirements. Flat rate pricing, whether for analogue or DSL and broadband lines, is almost as important as continuous Internet access. When parents know how much Internet use will cost them, many more families and small businesses will routinely access and use the worldwide web because uncertainty about costs will no longer be a concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the need for flat rates. Rumour has it that June is the deadline by which a retail service providing continuous, flat rate Internet access must be in operation. Is this the case? If so, is it on schedule? Does the Minister intend to drive this issue forward politically to make sure the infrastructure required to offer customers this service is in place by June?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" />This brings me to the wider question of infrastructure. There is an emerging view that it will be impossible in the short-term to link up every house and small business to a DSL or broadband line, unless we take current wireless technology much more seriously. While I welcome the wireless LAN project to which the Minister of State referred, it is a miserable contribution by Government to an area that warrants much greater priority. The wireless LAN project allocates &euro;260,000 to pilot projects around the country. Of the 29 applicants for Government support to proceed with wireless pilot projects, six received funding amounting to &euro;260,000. While I am open to correction if significantly more money is being invested in this area, the information available to me indicates the pilot projects being funded by the Government have been allocated a total of &euro;260,000. I am glad to see the Minister of State shaking his head. I hope it signals my figure is wrong. If this is the case, it is a miserable allocation of funds.</P>
    <P>Experience from regions similar to us around the world shows that the only way we will be able to provide households and small businesses in rural areas with broadband services is to do so in a wireless form. The Government needs to show real leadership in this context and invest significant moneys in research and development, promotion and incentives for private investment in wireless technologies. Let us get moving. If I hear fibre rings mentioned again, I will&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would nearly make me swear. To be fair, fibre rings are a welcome development. However, in terms of mass and numbers, they come nowhere near providing what is needed. I welcome the fact that Cork city will be the first part of the country to have a fibre ring constructed around it. In reality, this will mean connecting industrial estates around the city to broadband. While this is welcome in that it will increase Cork's competitiveness and potential for attracting businesses from Dublin, we will need to consider other solutions in terms of linking up houses and small businesses in the suburbs and surrounding towns. Although I am sure the Government is receiving advice to this effect, it does not seem to realise how important it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need more investment. Telecommunications infrastructure needs to be given the same priority as road and rail infrastructure. It is clear from the funds available to the telecommunications sector that it does not have anywhere near the same priority as the other two areas. The Minister of State and his senior Minister must <Col N="1423" />fight in a more pro-active manner for funds for the sector.</P>
    <P>While I am extremely critical of the Government's performance over the past five years, I accept that some progress has been made in the past five or six months. This is welcome as is what appears to be a new and more open approach towards the roll-out of the infrastructure necessary to ensure Ireland becomes more competitive in the next five years. We are currently ranked fifty-first in the world in this regard. Would a large multinational seeking investment opportunities to expand its business consider a country ranked No. 51 in the world or one of the countries in the top ten? In my view, companies seeking to enter competitive marketplaces to expand their business and develop software will draw a line through countries outside the top 20.</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress being made in this area. Political direction and leadership are needed to drive it on and to ensure it continues. However, it must be brought about outside of Dublin. There is no point having in CityWest and the digital hub two highly competitive and resourced venues from an infrastructural point of view, when what we are trying to do in the national development plan and the national spatial strategy, as I understand it, is move investment out of Dublin. Infrastructure is a key area in which this can be done. We have graduates in Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford currently moving to Dublin to find jobs in the IT sector. We should make our towns and cities in the regions sufficiently competitive to be able to employ college graduates in this sector.</P>
    <P>On the issue of graduates, it is extremely worrying that the points from last year indicate that the number of students choosing third level courses in IT and software has fallen dramatically. The Government needs to put in place the infrastructure necessary to ensure confidence in the future of the industry is sustained to the degree that students once again start choosing IT and software courses in third level institutions as their first and second choices.</P>
    <P>Outside of Dublin, the Government must concentrate on access, flat rate pricing and continuous connection, and choice of service. These are the three key priorities. While I welcome the digital hub, we need to apply the principle behind it in other towns and cities to ensure the national development plan moves ahead as promised.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, which will put the media village concept on a statutory basis. It is almost three years since the first major moves were taken to create a vibrant, clustered media digital centre which would be a showcase for enterprise and community involvement in high-tech and digital output. Along with many other achievements of this Government and many other legislative measures, it has come before the House three or four years too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" />Before speaking on the Bill it is necessary to reflect briefly on the sorry history of the development of this project and the fact that it was the subject of severe criticism from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Government has belatedly tried to address this criticism by including a specific reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General in the legislation, which I welcome. It is now time to look to the future, however, and I will examine some of the key and exciting elements of the media village in the heart of the Liberties, clustered around Thomas Street, later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the fact that this project is happening in an historic industrial area of my city. Although it is an area dominated by the great Guinness company for the past two and a half centuries, with the changes in manufacturing and the development of that company the huge district that supported it was left behind to some extent. I welcome the fact that the Government chose our historic Liberties to create this type of platform for Dublin as a whole and for the nation. I wish it well and hope it will live up to the hopes of many people in this House.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years, however, there were a number of disturbing elements in the way the project was brought forward. At the outset there was a lack of discussion, particularly among the academic community at university level. The Dublin Institute of Technology and Trinity College are close by the development but I understand it was <i>The Irish Times</i> journalist, Karlin Lillington, who called the first discussion document on the media village as &ldquo;dismayingly anorexic&rdquo;, in other words, a document totally lacking in vision and enterprise. The row between members of the academic community in the original discussions on this proposal eventually spilled over onto the pages of <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> which probably did not do our image much good.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Coveney, made comparisons with other countries in his contribution but as welcome as the digital hub project is, it could be far more ambitious. If we compare what other countries are doing in their digital districts, our digital hub project looks dismayingly anorexic even today. To take two examples, the city of Kuala Lumpur and Seoul. In Seoul, the capital of South Korea, a vast media city of approximately 6.6 million square metres is being created, ironically around the area of the World Cup stadium in the Seongsan-dong district. It will have tetrabyte Internet connections into the central business district and all the research areas. Before the project was even launched, companies were wooed to the district and a determined construction and development project is under way which will continue until 2010. The basic idea behind the concept in Seoul is to have clustered digital media hub, software development, broadcasting, games and e-learning facilities. All the areas we want to encourage in the digital hub in the Liberties are being developed in Seoul but on a more vast scale, in other words, a major section of the <Col N="1425" />city is a digital hub. I accept Deputy Coveney's very good point that a hub appears to infer that it would reach out to the whole national community and that a national programme in this area was what was called for.</P>
    <P>In Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, in a district 50 kilometres by 10 kilometres, a high-tech corridor and high speed Internet access is being created in a new urban district called Cyber Jawa. Approximately 200 companies are already established in the location, along with 10,000 new residents.</P>
    <P>On the north western fringes of our city we are also developing a huge new urban district. In my own constituency, for example, we will develop a town approximately the size of Waterford over the next eight years. Planning permission for this development was received last week, although local residents want An Bord Pleanála to examine other aspects, but an extraordinary element of the planning permission is that the conditions did not indicate that every house should have pervasive, vast broadband facilities. We still do not have regulations from the Minister's Department or the Department of the Environment and Local Government which make it compulsory for every house &ndash; the development to which I refer is mostly apartments and duplexes &ndash; to have the option of an Internet connection. We have not done that yet we are building huge new urban districts but the comparison between what is happening abroad and our development is stark in that we appear to be lacking in ambition. A much more intensive debate should have taken place between academics and the IT business community and matters organised so that this concept would have been integrated into new urban regions.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem over the past three yeas is that this development was the Taoiseach's minor pet project. His main project, which ended in disastrous failure, was the Abbottstown stadium plan which was directed mainly from his office. The Taoiseach appeared to put all his energies, and those of his key staff, into bringing about the ill-fated stadium rather than developing, perhaps historically, the more important digital hub. The digital hub was the minor project and the stadium was the major one and it is interesting that the same personalities were involved in both projects, which were directed specifically from the Taoiseach's Department. Mr. Paddy Teahon was deeply involved in managing both these ideas and it is extraordinary that we did not give sufficient attention to the planning, consultation and designing of the digital hub. Last autumn saw the extraordinary resignation of Mr. Teahon as the executive chairperson of Digital Media District Limited because a few months earlier he had joined the board of Insignia Richard Ellis Gunn, which had been contracted by the Office of Public Works in 2000 or 2001 to undertake consultancy work for the purchase of land in the Liberties. That was an extraordinary development in what was an historic, cutting-edge project for the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" />As I said, in autumn 2001 Mr. John Purcell, our eminent Comptroller and Auditor General, criticised the Government severely for continuing with the multi-million pound digital hub's management by a private company. It is rare that a new project like this would attract such severe criticism from the Comptroller and I welcome the provision that he and the Committee of Public Accounts will have an overseeing role regarding this Bill. I was proud to be a member of that committee in the 27th Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney referred to the latest reports this morning about funding for the project. The Government seems to lack resolve, determination and vision in this area, as we understood corporate sponsorship was originally meant to provide 80% of the &euro;130 million necessary for start-up costs. However, since the project began a number of corporate sponsors have pulled out such as RTE and 360 Networks, the Canadian company which was building a major broadband connection between Ireland, Europe and America. We now find that MediaLab Europe has approximately ten corporate sponsors, including Eircom, Ericsson and AIB, which give it approximately &euro;2.5 million but that is well below the &euro;10 million in annual funding which was expected from the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>In addition, the digital hub suffered severely last autumn in the Estimates cutbacks, to which Deputy Coveney and I drew attention. The basic capital budget we were expecting was approximately &euro;250 million but it turned out to be only &euro;130 million, despite the fact that broadband connectivity had become much cheaper and that Dublin City Council took a lead in providing a fast physical broadband hub for this project.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the development of the project until now has left a good deal to be desired. The Taoiseach never gave this the kind of attention he gave to his number one project, the Abbottstown stadium. There could have been more consultation on this project, not least with the local community, and access should have been given to the funds promised from the start. The bottom line is that we could have been much more ambitious. If one looks at the recent Chamber of Commerce report's recommendations for Dublin as an e-capital and Ireland as an e-nation there is almost nothing in them any Member would disagree with. A fundamental commitment to major resources, in the amount of &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion, is needed, because this may be as important for our nation as our other resources. However, this is a commitment the Government seems unable to make; we are approaching the first anniversary of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in his post but he shows no determination to make such commitments.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I welcome the achievements of the digital hub, the staff who are working in the district and the funds invested in trying to assemble the key buildings which are necessary. Dublin City Council, my local authority, is one of <Col N="1427" />the sponsoring partners along with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. It is good to have those bodies represented on the board of the digital hub and I hope they remain there. However, there is no specific requirement that a community representative be a member of the board and the Minister should address this. Clearly those who live in the Liberties and the Thomas Street area will have a daily relationship with the six new companies the Minister has welcomed to the area.</P>
    <P>I have the digital hub strategy statement and it thoughtfully sets out details for high-tech enterprise and education in the area while looking forward to the Liberties becoming a vibrant and innovative area of the capital. I welcome the statement and hope its plans are realised. We have some distinguished public servants working here under Philip Flynn, chief executive officer of the digital hub and William Burgess, its chairman. When this Bill comes into force hopefully they can get the project under way and make it a success.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a number of areas which are doing well, such as the old Guinness print depot, which will be a flagship enterprise space, and its temporary accommodation at 157 Thomas St. However, the long-term plan, for 2004 to 2010, still seems vague. The Minister should clarify this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Liberties Learning Initiative. About a month ago, when the Bill was last due in the House, we saw some of the children involved in this initiative on the &ldquo;Six O'Clock News&rdquo;. They are involved in digital education and we saw the work they did which can be stored, retrieved and integrated with other digital imagery. I agree with previous speakers that this should happen in every primary school. However, it is good the project is under way and Guinness's sponsorship of the initiative continues that company's relationship with the district. All the collaborative projects happening in the area are exciting and hopefully will be a template for education in the future.</P>
    <P>I noticed recently that we are also beginning to see the first artistic digital events, such as the Darklight Digital Film Festival last September and the Starlight exhibition. These should create an interesting mix of artistic, enterprise and media approaches which we hope will be a hallmark of the area.</P>
    <P>I echo many of Deputy Coveney's points. Since I took over this portfolio the Minister has been looking for the Labour Party's broadband programme. Going back to the time our Leader, Deputy Rabbitte, was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, we have had interesting policies in this area. We had a comprehensive programme, &ldquo;Towards an Intelligent Society,&rdquo; which I intended to bring into the Minister and we also have a very good spatial strategy. Both of those strategies were produced <Col N="1428" />long before the Government's versions. It is ironic that six years later the Government is belatedly trying to come to grips with these issues and is criticising the Opposition, which has not had an opportunity to do anything as it has not been in power for the past six years.</P>
    <P>In the run up to the general election the Government produced the document Keeping Ireland at the Cutting Edge, stating that all public services should be available on-line by 2005 and that an information commission will be established. I find it strange, however, that Deputy Hanafin is e-Minister, an idea we copied from the British, while Deputy Dermot Ahern is the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. One is in charge of software and one of hardware and regulation but it seems they never talk to each other.</P>
    <P>I was astonished when the Minister of State told me yesterday that our Government has no e-procurement system. The Government undertakes massive projects but there is no electronic procurement system. I know of one company in Galway that constantly holds Internet auctions for its procurement and gets the keenest possible prices. Most of the ideas for flagship services for the citizen in New Connections are pie in the sky. If the Government does not lead by example, how will society follow?</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce report, Dublin as a World Class e-City, are striking. They present the Government with a huge challenge in terms of broadband infrastructure and creating real competition. The report puts us in the third division, with only moderate attributes of an e-city. We are in the same league as Dubai and Tel Aviv and way below Helsinki, Seoul and Singapore. Six years ago we were close to the cutting age but the Government has allowed us to fall to the third division.</P>
    <P>European Commissioner Erkki Liikanen called our broadband access very poor and criticised the lack of real competition at the point of access for consumer. Deputy O'Flynn gave me a copy of the Global Information Technology Report Network Readiness Index and it placed us 21st, behind countries we would have thought we were at least as good as if not better. Much work remains for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to do to make Ireland an e-nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Government have never faced up to the cost of investment in broadband. The Dublin Chamber of Commerce report gives a cost of &euro;5 billion for a nationwide system but the Minister announces a different one of the 19 towns for the metropolitan area network programme every week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" />Huge areas of the State, however, are still waiting for fast Internet access. A large proportion of the community will be excluded from the digital revolution. There is an onus on both Ministers to work hard at a programme of e-inclusion so the situation does not develop where huge tracts of the country are left out. I accept the points made about Cork, Limerick, Galway and rural areas, and welcome the comments about wireless LANs for remote areas, but we must ensure no proportion of the population is excluded.</P>
    <P>We must put in place an e-strategy to speed up investment. I congratulate Dublin City Council which has been involved in installing broadband infrastructure in the Liberties. There are now 170 kilometres of fast network throughout the city. That network has been devolved into a separate operating division which will run at a profit.</P>
    <P>Progress towards flat-rate access is still very slow. Will we see anything done about it before the Dáil breaks for the summer? I have had e-mail after e-mail complaining bitterly about the cost of access and the lack of fast access. I received one where the writer told me that, in his opinion, Internet access in Ireland is a bloody disgrace, that the Government has been promising since 1997 to do something but in a recent worldwide review of broadband we were second last. He pointed out that e-Government is supposed to be running by 2005 but the telecommunications provider is a private consortium and if it decides not to invest, there is nothing we can do. We sold off our main telecom provider, a point made by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce report, and that set us back in this area.</P>
    <P>A great deal must be done. This is the first opportunity I have had to address the issue but I will come back to it again and again until the Government takes it seriously, particularly fast, cheap access.</P>
    <P>My major concern about the Bill is that the local community in the Liberties and Thomas Street was not widely consulted before the project got under way. Thanks to the city council there is an integrated area plan and the city manager is a member of the current board but we should ensure that the community is consulted. We are getting used to district government with Leader programmes, such as Northside Partnership in my area, and it is critical the local community does not feel left out.</P>
    <P>Section 3 states that the Minister can extend the area of the agency. It should be extended to the whole State but given that there are colleges and universities near the hub area this is important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 31 that the company will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Given the sad history of disregard when the Taoiseach and the then Minister took their eyes of the ball, this should be the case. Section 33 also provides for an annual report to the Minister and I hope we will have an opportunity to debate it in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" />Section 19 refers to the chief executive. I believe there should be a community representative as of right. I commend the Bill and will return to some of those issues on Committee Stage. I urge the Minister of State and the Minister to address the overall issue of digital technology with the urgency it requires.</P>

      <P>Either we are serious about the digital economy or we are not. While there have been many launches and statements of commitment to the digital economy, we are lagging behind our European counterparts when it comes to pushing the boat out on this new and exciting development. Countries such as Croatia, Estonia, Poland and other eastern European countries are leaping ahead of us, both in terms of the provision of broadband lines and penetration per head of population. In this area, one certainly cannot stand still. Since the announcement of the digital hub, perhaps over two years ago, enough has not been done to push the boat out and make sure that Ireland grasps the fantastic opportunity of the new digital economy. My party is upset with regard to the cutback in funding available for the digital hub project over the past few years. We believe this has contributed, in part, to the fact that we have not moved as fast as we should have. Since standing still is not an option, it is important the Government prioritises development of the digital economy.</P>
      <P>There are incredible possibilities open to us with the new economy. As an environmentalist, I emphasise that one can transmit substantial quantities of data from one location to another without using significant amounts of energy. This offers tremendous scope for economic and environmental savings to the economy. More importantly, it provides enormous potential for economic development, job creation and other opportunities. Having regard to the fact that the digital hub is located in one of the most disadvantaged areas in the entire country, it is imperative to ensure that the benefits accrue to the local population as well as the wider employment possibilities in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We must become serious about the digital economy and push ahead with the roll-out of general broadband infrastructure in the Irish economy. I believe there is general agreement that unless Ireland has good broadband penetration with an up-to-date, accessible network, we will not be able to take advantage of the opportunities which can be delivered in the near future. It is also important that the system is affordable in order that both large companies and individuals can take advantage of it and thereby ensure that we do not fall behind, as I believe is now happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" />I must pose the question as to how the digital hub will attract business. I am concerned that, to date, we have not seen a huge flow of companies moving into the digital hub, although I accept that it is early days yet. Taking the Temple Bar development as a model of inner city development, with which those in charge of the digital hub would be very familiar, that model was predicated on success in attracting small businesses and individuals into the area in the first instance. It subsequently developed into a much wider success, economically and in other respects. My concern in relation to the digital hub is that, so far, we have only seen a few companies taking up space which has become available within the heart of the Liberties area.</P>
    <P>Much of the expenditure to date has gone into land acquisition and telling the world about the digital hub, but how many companies have actually set up operations in the Liberties? I suggest that a greater effort is needed to attract more companies in the first instance. Looking at the details of expenditure on the project, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, the vast bulk of that capital has gone into land acquisition. I worry about such a push towards buying land before first developing the essential embryonic businesses. I believe the balance in that regard may not be quite right. I ask the Minister to provide some clarification on the costs involved and the issue of value for money in relation to land acquisition, on which tens of millions of euro have been spent. While I appreciate that land does not come cheap in Dublin's inner city, there should be a value for money audit on that aspect.</P>
    <P>If I may change a familiar phrase slightly, there is no such thing as a free launch and there have been many launches of the digital hub over the past few years by various Ministers, including the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, I wonder about the substance behind that activity. Of course, we need to market the product and tell the world about it but behind the rather ethereal brochures, are we delivering on the substance? I am not yet convinced that we are attracting substantial business into the area.</P>
    <P>We should also develop outward links. There are many third level institutions in Dublin, including the Dublin Institute of Technology, the NCAD, DCU, UCD and TCD. I am not convinced that either the digital hub project or Media Lab Europe has made sufficient connections to those third level institutions. If we are serious about developing the digital economy, we should be there as a powerhouse tied into each of those institutions. That aspect should be moved forward. While there are students working actively for Media Lab Europe, many of them pursuing doctorates or other higher degrees, much stronger links should be developed at undergraduate level and, indeed, with second level schools in the area. The link with third level institutions <Col N="1432" />is particularly important. I believe there is a knowledge deficit, paradoxical though it may appear, between other third level institutions and the digital hub</P>
    <P>I welcome the mixed use community aspect of the digital hub and the 25% provision in relation to housing in the area. I assume much of the housing in question will be used to accommodate students pursuing studies within the digital area. I would like to see equal access within many of the third level institutions in the city, thereby making a wider population aware of the benefits of the digital economy and projecting the message that the digital economy is here to stay and that links with existing third level institutions are essential.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my point that a high quality broadband infrastructure is necessary and my concern that we are falling behind. I ask the Minister to clarify what is on the table in terms of pushing the boat out in that regard. I note what I can best describe as a paucity of information from the e-Minister, Deputy Hanafin, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. I have yet to see pronouncements from her on the digital economy and I look forward to a balance being re-established in terms of a partnership of e-Ministers coming together to show how Ireland will develop the electronic area. Thus far, the Green Party has not been convinced that there is a substantial Government commitment to e-government and e-commerce. I refer to a relevant anecdote &ndash; a colleague downloaded a driving licence application form and brought a hard copy for signature at a Garda station, where he was informed by the garda on duty that such a copy of the form was not acceptable. We must change that mind set. Much of the responsibility for doing that falls on the Minister's shoulders. We must make sure at every level of government that people are confident and happy to accept the electronic format of application forms so that they do not look for a form other than one downloaded off the Internet. The electronic form should have equal status, if not a greater status, than a hard copy.</P>
    <P>A fair amount has been done to make the links into the local community within the Liberties. We must do much more to make sure that young children are made aware of the possibilities. Last summer I was delighted to see the project involving skateboarders and cameras mounted on skateboards. It was a fantastic project, making young children aware of what is on offer there. However, we must achieve greater awareness and greater penetration of the schools and homes within the area, whether in Oliver Bond, School Street or Watling Street, which literally adjoins the digital hub. That will not happen by simply making available computers. It will happen by changing the mind set by having dedicated personnel who are talking to people in schools and in their homes about the potential job and leisure opportunities for people within the area. I hope the Minister will increase that commitment and put an onus on those working in the digital hub <Col N="1433" />to make a strong and active connection with the local community. No doubt he can do that but I am looking forward to seeing more evidence of that commitment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has taken an interest, which has been long-awaited, in the development of this area of Dublin. It is one of the oldest areas of Dublin with a long history and it has been neglected for years. Therefore, I welcome this Bill and I welcome anything which will help revitalise that area of Dublin. Anybody who has travelled down Thomas Street, in particular, or James's Street will be familiar with the desolation and dreariness of the derelict buildings there for quite a number of years. This Bill and the digital hub will, I hope, regenerate that area, create a vibrant area once again and maybe address some of the problems there.</P>
      <P>The area has the highest drug use in Europe for males between 17 and 25. The digital hub is not being set up to address that, but perhaps if there is a regeneration of the area some of the depression and the reasons people end up involved in heroin abuse, and now of late, cocaine and crack abuse, will be addressed and there will be hope for the people. The only way of giving hope to these people, and especially the young people, is if more is done to address the educational disadvantage. While many of them attend primary school and perhaps some attend secondary school for a while, the incentives do not seem to be in place to ensure that they remain in school.</P>
      <P>While I have commented locally on the digital hub in the past, I welcome the steps that have been taken to try to computerise the schools so that there is hope and there are facilities for the school children in the area to get used to the technology of the future and to have access to it so that they can learn skills which will enable them rise to the top level. One of my worries, which has been expressed by others in the community, is that because the area has had a low educational qualification level, there is a danger in the future that the people employed in the digital hub and associated industries will be those who will move into the new houses and apartments planned rather than the indigenous people of the Liberties. There is a definite need for a faster roll-out of computerisation of the locality's schools, especially the secondary schools, but it is also important that it starts from the bottom up. Therefore the Department of Education and Science needs to play a more vibrant role than it has to date. If that is done, then there will be a community who will not be dependent on jobs as porters, security staff or cleaners, as was the case in many of the industries in the area to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is proposed for the area will involve highly skilled workers. The only way of changing the ethos of the area is to promote education for all. In this area are families who have never experienced third level education. Most people <Col N="1434" />have limited training and very few have done the leaving certificate. This is about changing that atmosphere in the homes so that the children can be encouraged to continue in school.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted and recognised the important role of the community as stake holders However, the danger is that people from the locality will be priced out of the local houses by this huge investment and the building of housing to facilitate people working in the digital hub. Already the price of houses in this area is well beyond most of the local people and most depend on Dublin City Council for housing. In fairness, Dublin City Council has done a tremendous job in the past ten years in refurbishing and regenerating most of the complexes in and around the digital hub, and I hope that will also serve the hub well.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure that the project progresses quite quickly so that the dereliction and other issues can be addressed. The property has been bought up, boarded up and under utilised, and therefore the quicker the project progresses, the better. The plans for this concept began to be formulated as far back as 1996. Initially the community were not consulted, and even the City Council was not consulted because it had an integrated area plan being prepared and all of a sudden this plan was foisted on it. Both the community and the City Council have embraced the plan. What they want is that this would be rolled-out as quickly as possible so that we are not left with more years looking at derelict buildings.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns is how this digital park or digital hub will be successful when one considers the many other digital parks which have been developed throughout the world? What will make this one different? How will we succeed and how will we guarantee that in ten or 15 years the Minister will not come back to the House to say that there is a great deal of property in this area which needs to be disposed of because the project has not been successful? I would have liked to have seen the tax incentives continued. It is a pity that the European Union forced us to develop the site without tax designation. If there were such tax incentives, there would have been a much accelerated take-up of the opportunities which this area and this plan will offer for the future. It is the future, not only of the area but of Ireland. If this investment &ndash; it should be looked on as investment, not expenditure &ndash; works in this old area of Dublin, we can go beyond it. Research and development in new technologies will be vital for the future wealth of the country and also for future economic growth. I would warmly welcome such a development.</P>
    <P>One of the areas just mentioned by my colleague was Watling Street, which is beside a city council flats complex called Emmet Buildings. Next to Emmet Buildings will be the first project to come on stream in the digital hub, the print works. The community there has seen no benefits to the digital hub, nor can they foresee any. I had a meeting <Col N="1435" />with the residents' association and members of the city council last week and none of them seemed to be aware of any benefits or of what was to happen right next door to them, where a new walkway and so on are being built.</P>
    <P>The current developments are encouraging, but it should be happening more quickly. It is important that links are made with the third level colleges in the area, including Griffith College, Trinity College and the NCAD. The colleges need to form part of the project so that it can be successful. The innovation and imagination of not only the local people but also the people of Ireland are needed to help advance the companies and ideas coming from the digital hub.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill, which aims to establish an organisation, Digital Media Development Limited, which will self-destruct when the digital media hub in Dublin's Liberties and Coombe area becomes a statutory agency. The concept of the digital hub has been described as a virtual Valhalla and a Silicon Valley-type digital nirvana. A variety of new Irish and international digital media companies, research and development programmes and educational initiatives will be clustered together in the Liberties. There will be a vast amount of work involved in defining the functions and role of the agency, developing the digital hub, formulating strategies to promote it as a location for digital enterprises and other activities and devising and financing a development plan as well as consulting local interests regarding its implementation.</P>
      <P>After a considerable amount of foot-dragging and controversy and five years after the concept was conceived, plans to develop the digital hub to reality are finally under way. This area will play host to everyone from web developers and software firms to animators and games developers, musicians and artists and the architects of the future world of the Internet, communications and entertainment. One of the nerve centres of the digital hub will be the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MediaLab Europe, based in the Guinness Hop Store. More than 7,000 workers and 10,000 residents will be involved. Close to &euro;200 million has been expended on property acquisition in Thomas Street and the general Liberties area by the Office of Public Works and public private partnerships will be required to assist in the area's revitalisation, which will entail not only the physical enhancement of the area but also the matter of job creation. Some of the brightest and best brains from within and outside the country will be attracted to the development of Dublin's own mirror image of Silicon Valley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is unlimited scope for interactive research and development with third level colleges in Dublin. A wide range of digital media, animation, television and film making and computer technology courses will be available in the academy to be set up as part of the complex. Sev<Col N="1436" />eral media institutions will be able to combine in the provision of a wide range of undergraduate digital media courses in well equipped and modern lecture theatres. I understand that a ten-year agreement has been instituted with MIT in relation to MediaLab Europe at a cost of &euro;8.5 million. It is vital that the Minister provide a cost-benefit analysis, given the level of Government financing for this project. The anticipated return from the project over the next five years is in the order of &euro;3.8 billion, with anticipated exports of &euro;2.7 billion and a workforce of 30,000 people by 2012.</P>
    <P>This country stands on the threshold of a significant expansion of broadband technology. The development of the digital hub is most timely, as its establishment will be buttressed by the greatest advance in communications history since the invention of the telephone. Since the introduction of broadband in the USA several years ago, Ireland has trailed behind most other OECD countries in its development, which is vital to our country's economic growth and prosperity. A country's future prosperity depends on the development of a competitive market for broadband services and on advancing our national communications infrastructure to the greatest extent. In the recently announced national spatial strategy, the development of broadband technology and infrastructure forms an essential communications component of the various regional hub towns and gateways.</P>
    <P>The Liberties &ndash; Coombe area has numerous social, economic and employment needs, even though its rich cultural heritage is legendary. With the notable exception of the Liberties Community College, which provides a wide range of courses, the area has a distinct lack of access to digital information and communications technology and skills. The concept of a digital media hub is revolutionary and marrying this to the concept of public private partnerships in the refurbishment of the Thomas Street properties will provide an added impetus to the entire project. To cluster the digital media industry in a single location in Dublin is an excellent idea but it will be vital to ensure that Dublin's digital hub will be integrated with Ireland's regions in a type of national grid to create a virtual marketplace. The hub will completely transform the entire Liberties area, just as the IFSC has changed the face of Dublin's docklands. The next generation of technology talent will be ideally placed to benefit from this landmark development.</P>
    <P>The digital hub, although it will rely on a variety of technologies, will not be about technology but about people. It represents a new type of social institution that will provide ways for people with common interests to meet and interact. It also represents an important new economic force that will open new avenues of interaction between companies and their customers. I am convinced that the digital hub will become a major element in the development of the new world of electronic commerce. It will inspire a <Col N="1437" />genuine, passionate sense of belonging among its participants. Strong bonds of friendship can be developed and sustained on-line and the successful digital hub will be likely to endure for many years.</P>
    <P>Building and sustaining a digital hub, whether in the physical world or in cyberspace, is not a simple matter. It will take time to grow and will be slow to change. Perhaps no single factor is more critical to the long-term success of the digital hub than trust among its participants and customers. Anyone wishing to benefit from the opportunities offered by a digital hub must accept the responsibility of being a good citizen of the digital hub community. The regard for success is the prospect of building relationships with customers that may well be stronger and more valuable than those created by any other marketing strategy. This Bill is to be welcomed and its enactment should not be placed on the long finger but expedited.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to speak on the Bill which provides for the establishment of Digital Media Development Limited, the body set up to oversee the development of the digital hub on a statutory basis. I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill defines the functions of the agency with regard to the development of the digital hub and provides the necessary corporate and regulatory structures for a State body. The establishment of Digital Media Development Limited as a State agency will be an important component in the strategy to develop the digital hub as a vibrant centre for digital content enterprises. The digital hub is a development project cluster of Irish and international new media companies, research and development and educational initiatives in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin. The digital hub is part of the drive to move our IT sector up the value chain and make Ireland an international centre for high-speed research and cutting-edge digital industry, while also addressing the digital divide at a local level.</P>
      <P>The initiatives include the building of a high-speed broadband infrastructure in the digital hub area to meet the needs of digital media enterprises for state of the art telecommunications facilities, the marketing of the digital hub to digital content enterprises and the Liberties learning initiative for projects, developed by the digital hub, in support of recommendations made by the Liberties-Coombe integrated area plan advisory group. Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are key partners in the digital hub as part of their strategy to target the growth of the digital media sector in Ireland. Dublin City Council is also a key partner in the context of its integrated area plan for the delivery of urban regeneration to the Liberties-Coombe area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five years ago, Paul Kavanagh, one of the original architects of the IFSC development scheme, came up with the concept of a digital media hub for Dublin &ndash; a development in the heart of the <Col N="1438" />capital which would play host to a Silicon Valley-type digital area and a hub which would host the meeting of minds and money for Ireland's experts and some of the world's luminaries in this field. I am delighted that, some five years later, plans to take the digital hub from concept to reality are under way. This area will be a home for everyone from web developers and software firms, animators and games developers and musicians to artists &ndash; the architects of the future world of the Internet, telecommunications and entertainment. Upon completion, the digital hub is envisaged to play host to more than 7,000 workers and 10,000 residents on four land banks around the Thomas Street area of the Liberties including the MIT Media Lab Europe which is based in the Guinness Hops Store.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently visited the MIT Media Lab centre and saw at first hand the wonderful concepts, design work and innovative research that is being done in the area of media. In the first phase of the development, the project will see the creation of a 2.5 kilometre high-speed fibre optic ring or metropolitan area network &ndash; MAN &ndash; and the refurbishment of the 1930s landmark print works building as well as the launch of a Liberties learning initiative, sponsored by Guinness. The project will also prepare for the installation of the first tenants, under the auspices of Enterprise Ireland, in temporary accommodation in this area. It is understood that some 60 companies have already expressed an interest in locating at the hub.</P>
    <P>Importantly, it demonstrates recognition of the sector at State level and recognises that, like the software and call centre sectors that have thrived here in the past decade, the industry needs a degree of support to gel as a sector in its own right. Being able to locate in an area with the support of companies that compliment each other's activities will be beneficial to the companies which locate there. The nature of digital technology and broadband networks means that distance becomes irrelevant when one is doing business. There are islands of digital activity all over Ireland from the Ennis information age town to enterprise centres such as Innovation Works in Tralee, where some highly advanced digital media work is being carried out, and in Cork, we have the National Software Centre. We need to ensure that the regions are integrated with the digital hub to plan to create a seamless virtual marketplace.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased to learn that ESB Telecom switched on the first part of its &euro;50 million national broadband fibre network in a move that will lead to faster Internet services and cheaper prices for telecoms in the regions. The network will enable the ESB division to become a carrier's carrier &ndash; a firm that sells wholesale telecoms and Internet capacity from its network to other telecoms firms. Its first customers are likely to be companies such as Worldcom, ESAT, BT and a range <Col N="1439" />of wireless firms that want to provide telecoms services outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The ESB also plans to use a State-wide broadband national backbone network to gain a foothold in the market for third generation, 3G, mobile telephone services. Third generation mobile technology will enable firms to provide a range of video and Internet services to hand-held devices. ESB Telecom switched on the southern loop of its network which runs through Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford. The extra competition that its network will offer to these locations should reduce the cost of national broadband capacity. The construction of the ESB fibre network will help attract inward investment. ESB Telecom has received &euro;16 million in grant aid to help fund the national network from the Government and the EU under a special grant programme designed to assist the uptake of e-commerce.</P>
    <P>The national network, which runs in a figure of eight between Dublin, Cork, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Buncrana, should be completed by the autumn. However, there is a great deal of fibre in the ground and there will be more, but I wonder how much of it will be lit up. Are we running fibre alongside unlit fibre? I would like the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to provide a map of all the fibre in the ground. The Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is making its own inquiries into those matters and the Minister has been advised in that connection.</P>
    <P>It is important that ESB Telecom offers access to service providers at affordable prices, otherwise the network could become a field of dreams &ndash; similar to what happened in Iowa in the US, where the state government rolled-out a fibre optic backbone but got few customers because it was too expensive to use. The key to the success of the ESB project is to secure an anchor customer who will guarantee capacity use. Such a customer should be the Government, Departments, local authorities and health bodies.</P>
    <P>I urge the ESB to tender for managing the national area networks. The MANs, which are being rolled out by local authorities with the assistance of the Department will have to be managed in a network. There is a question as to whether the LANs &ndash; when they come on stream &ndash; will be cable or wireless-based. There is no size that fits all and I believe the LANs will be a wireless system which does not require a line of sight.</P>
    <P>I recently undertook a fact finding mission with the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to Grant County public utility district in Washington State where they manage the state network on a 24 hour a day, seven day basis. Who better than the ESB to manage such a network when it is already managing the national grid and has decades of experience in telecoms? When the digital hub is up an running, it will show everybody the way forward. The committee delegation, which also visited Sili<Col N="1440" />con Valley, included Senator Finucane and Deputy O'Donovan, the Clerk to the committee, Mr. Ronan Lenihan and Mr. Kieran Duffy from the Department and it was a worthwhile fact-finding trip.</P>
    <P>The Grant County experience mirrors what the digital hub will provide. In Grant County the public utility district is installing a full fibre optic broadband network available to every home in the county, just like the digital hub will deliver in the heart of the capital. The Grant County network was impressive. A simple test with a laptop computer in which an eight megabyte file, residing on a server in Dublin, was accessed in Grant County and opened in one second while, in San Francisco, using a DSL broadband Internet connection rather than fibre optic, the same file took minutes to open. For any company to survive in the competitive environment that globalisation brings, the ability to be more productive by accessing information 120 times faster, or greater, is a must for success and for Ireland this will be delivered by projects like the digital hub.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Foreign Policy,</i> the magazine of global politics, economics and ideas, shows in its 2003 globalisation index which measures a country's global links from foreign direct investment to international travel, telephone traffic and Internet servers, that for the past two years Singapore and Ireland have topped the ranking of political, economic and technical integration in 62 countries. Ireland was also among the world's largest beneficiaries of the global boom in high-tech and information technologies. Its success in attracting investments in earlier years gave it a first mover advantage when these industries began to experience global growth. By 2000, technology giants such as Microsoft, Intel, Gateway and Global Crossing were calling the &ldquo;Silicon Isle&rdquo; their European home. These high-tech investments help explain Ireland's steadily growing foreign direct investment inflows, which rose from an average of close to $3 billion per year throughout the mid-1990s to $20.5 billion in 2000, or nearly $5,500 per resident. This is more than three times greater than the $1,653 investment per resident in Finland.</P>
    <P>However, our first mover status is not secure as the index shows that while Ireland was in first place in both economic and personal ranking, it was only 17th in the technology ranking. This 17th place is due to our ranking of 24th for Internet users, 16th in terms of Internet hosts and ninth in terms of secure Internet servers. We need full broadband access at competitive rates and the USA illustrates this can be achieved; Grant County offers a 24 hour, fibre to fibre service for a fixed fee of $22 per month.</P>
    <P>Global Information Technology Report 2002-2003 published a report last week that shows Ireland in 21st place in the network readiness index. I believe we can easily rise to being in the top ten within two years if we continue to invest in the rollout of the infrastructure that will lead to increased connectivity and accessibility at <Col N="1441" />affordable prices. I commend the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for his initiative and driving forward this programme. I urge the Minister for Finance to make moneys available to drive these programmes forward to prevent us from falling behind.</P>
    <P>A result of our fact finding mission was that if Ireland is to consolidate and maintain its first place in terms of globalisation, technology ranking must be addressed and the concept of modem dial-up Internet access charged by the second has no place in the Ireland Incorporated strategy for the future. Ireland is set to continue to gain from and lead the ICT revolution with developments such as the digital hub. I am reminded of the expression that one only gets one chance to make a first impression &ndash; this happens to us all on different occasions. Projects such as the digital hub will show us the way to the future and if such projects are not grasped then Ireland runs the very serious risk of condemning our economy to stagnation at best. I am reassured when I see legislation such as the Digital Hub Bill as I know the Government is planning for the future and investing in order to secure the growth of our economy for our future and that of our children.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Communication, Marine and Natural Resources has established a sub-committee on information communications technology. This sub-committee will address the area of broadband infrastructure, connectivity and pricing. The work programme has been agreed and it will commence next Tuesday with a presentation by the Minister on the provision of a national high-speed broadband infrastructure, including cost to users. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, will make a presentation on the delivery of Government business and commerce functions through the national high-speed broadband infrastructure. We expect to lay our first report on this sector before the House within three months.</P>
    <P>I attended a TeleCities conference in Dublin Castle yesterday. Much emphasis was put on the importance of digital hubs for cities. I was delighted to hear a Dutch speaker praising the Government and Ireland for its success in the rollout of the digital hub and technology. At several meetings on the margins of the conference I was pleased to learn the Secretary General of the Department, Brendan Tuohy, and his officials working in this area are held in high esteem. We do not often praise officials for the work they do but it is important to do so in this case.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee will seek presentations from the ESB, telecom operators, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, the communications regulator, Cork City Council and Dublin City Council. I mention Cork because it is the first city to rollout a broadband contract. Work on this started a few weeks ago and it will take ten months to construct. The e-democracy unit of the Houses of the Oireachtas, educational and health interests, Microsoft and related main players in the IT <Col N="1442" />industry and MediaLabs Europe Limited will also be invited to make presentations. We may also have a number of site visits to examine the ESB fibre backbone. Users are the most important group and they will also be invited to meet the sub-committee. The seven Members on the sub-committee are deeply committed to the area of ICT. I hope this report will assist the Government when it is laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator Mary O'Rourke, introduced a computer-aided information technology programme. This programme has stopped since it was moved to another Department. I ask the Government to seriously consider the reconstitution and reintroduction of this programme. It is very important that all citizens be given an opportunity to learn about the information and knowledge society. It is important that everyone is given the opportunity to use the Internet and computers. If one takes South Korea as an example, 12 million people were trained in the use of computers and the Internet. This has resulted in South Korea being ranked as one of the top five countries globally in terms of rollout of technology and the use of the information society.</P>
    <P>The information society is somewhat like the rollout of the rural electrification scheme in the 1920s. The future for Ireland does not lie in industrial development but in the knowledge society and access to information. Ireland will accrue many benefits in the future if it ensures people at all levels are trained in accessing this knowledge and in its use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The only gripe I have with it is that it is based in the Dublin area. It is a pity it is not nationwide.</P>
      <P>There has been significant spending in this area over the past number of years, including on MediaLab Europe, the result of an arrangement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Now we have the digital hub. When a significant amount of money is spent on such projects, it is important that there is a legislative basis for it. It is taxpayers' money. There should at least be a reporting mechanism in place. However, the mechanism regarding the operation of DMDL and MediaLab Europe has, to date, been most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main function of this body is to promote and facilitate the development of the digital hub as a location for digital enterprises and related activities. To be successful in its strategy the Government must begin with radical decentralisation of Government administration services and the provision of quality state of the art infrastructure for both physical and electronic communi<Col N="1443" />cation needs. Enterprise Ireland needs a strategic plan that sets out ambitious targets to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The identified sectors of informatics, digital media, e-business and health and sciences are a public private partnership project. There is major investment, in the region of &euro;130 million, by private sector developments to meet the criteria laid down in the strategy for the digital hub. The aim is to increase sales to almost &euro;4 billion in the next five years, increase exports to almost &euro;3 billion and increase employment to an ambitious 29,000 people over the next decade. I hope the current wide reaching cutbacks by the Government will not destroy this ambitious plan. According to today's newspapers there are already cutbacks and financial difficulties in the digital hub.</P>
    <P>Digital is ideally suited to a well educated Irish workforce and if it is given support, it will be effective and productive for the country. However, there will be risks involved with such ambitious targets at a time of economic gloom. It is imperative to develop resources and infrastructure of a new nature within the digital hub development agency and through the functions conferred on it in this Bill. The opportunity exists to do something wonderfully new, different and well suited to our technology business and the well educated workforce. It is important that all agencies and bodies work closely with the people who manage the digital hub development to market the centres to a wide variety of companies involved in all facets of the development.</P>
    <P>My party has detailed a number of key objectives in its technology policy. Primary among these is the extension of broadband. It should be rolled out across the country. It is the future for bringing business to this country. We must possess and advance national communications infrastructure if we are to secure our future prosperity. The development of a competitive market for broadband services is crucial to sustaining a high level of growth in incomes, employment and overall economic growth for the coming years. Ireland is currently lagging behind, at 26th of the 28 countries in the OECD, in the provision of broadband services. It is improving but it must improve further. My party wishes to see the potential for broadband expanded throughout the country. It is an important component of our spatial plan.</P>
    <P>The world we live in today has changed for the better. At one time writing was the main means of communicating but now we depend on e-mail, text messaging and computers. If Ireland is to take a leadership position in commerce it will require more than attracting a few key foreign firms to invest here. It is a matter of giving those firms the communications infrastructure that allows them to conduct e-business from here. The widespread availability of broadband will encourage more companies to locate in Ireland and broaden our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" />Although these facilities are vital, taking a leadership position in this new world means, above all, making the information age a reality for everyone in Ireland. If the country is to gain the full benefits of the information age, we must bring new technology to everyone. We are at the bottom of the table when it comes to technology. That is the reality. Despite all the promises from the Government, Ireland is at the back when it needs to be at the front.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill will be only a small step in the right direction and much more work must be done. I hope the digital hub will place us in the prime position of being one of the most attractive destinations for technological companies. I hope the Bill will be enacted in the not too distant future. I cannot over stress the importance of the roll out of broadband. It is the element that will bring Ireland to the fore in attracting industry. The only worry I have about this Bill is that it is based on Dublin. I hope in the future it will be available throughout the country and give people the opportunity to see its importance. Every household in the Coombe area will see the benefits of the Bill. I commend the Bill and hope it will lead to a brighter future for Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kehoe spoke about his hopes for the development of information and broadband technology in Ireland. Everybody who is involved in the technology sector is living in hope at present. The big problem is that, to date, the Government does not appear to have any great vision as to how it will ensure that there will be broadband accessibility throughout the country so we can capitalise on the Bill before the House today.</P>
      <P>This Bill is welcome and long awaited legislation. The digital hub has been planned and debated for the past five years. It is a positive development. However, if we are to capitalise on what will happen in the digital hub and ensure that it expands and develops so it will attract investment to other parts of Dublin city and the country, our network must be put in place. Deputy Kehoe hit the nail on the head. That is only a hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no easily accessible looped cable network in this country. The only one available is in the private ownership of Eircom. We made a huge mistake when we privatised the Eircom network a few years ago. It was the biggest single mistake made by the State. Both the Government and the Opposition welcomed the privatisation of Eircom but, because of privatisation, there is no easily accessible network available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn mentioned the ESB. The ESB is rolling out a network but it is a partial network. <Col N="1445" />Bord Gáis is also rolling out a partial network. The only network that has not yet been mentioned is the Irish Rail network which, again, is partially rolled out. The western corridor is being put in place to bring broadband from Donegal through to the south west of the country. However, there is no connectivity between the four networks. Those networks must be linked if we are to have looped accessibility to broadband. There is no point bringing a broadband cable into a town unless it is looped. The local loop networks that are going ahead at present are a positive and welcome development but without looped accessibility it is pointless.</P>
    <P>That is a major difficulty but the Government has yet to realise it. It is within the Government's capability to provide a backbone network relatively quickly that would generate income for the State through the semi-State companies that currently own the cable facilities. That initiative has not been taken, however, so the matter has not progressed. If the initiative was seized operators could be encouraged to provide broadband Internet access to companies and individuals, thus assuring competition which is the key element. We have yet to see the competition element come to fruition and without it we will not attract employers who wish to diversify to the regions.</P>

      <P>Competition among providers of broadband access is the key issue for operators in this sector, but that is not available at the moment. We are still awaiting a decision from the communications regulator on local loop networks which will be fundamentally important to the development and provision of broadband access for the regions, especially with regard to small businesses. It is crucial to provide such access via this legislation which should ensure broadband access throughout the country. It is a key element for the future well-being of the economy.</P>
      <P>Jobs have been created on the basis of our skills base but we are now becoming extremely uncompetitive and because of that, low skilled jobs are moving elsewhere. Every week we see closures and consequent job losses. That will continue to happen unless, as Deputy O'Flynn said, we can invest in information technology and the knowledge-based economy. That is not happening, however.</P>

      <P>Traffic congestion in Dublin is an issue in which the Minister of State's colleagues, Deputies Ardagh and Eoin Ryan, are extremely interested. That problem cannot be addressed, however, unless infrastructure is put in place to bring employment to the regions. If that <Col N="1446" />was done, people would be able to live and work outside Dublin rather than have to commute long distances to and from the capital. A sufficient broadband capability is required to achieve such regionalisation but it is not there currently, even though it would be the key to decentralisation. Ministers should stop dragging their feet on the issue of decentralising Departments and agencies. It has not happened due to internal Cabinet feuding about which Departments and State agencies should be located where. Decentralisation would have provided the impetus for rolling out a broadband programme for which there is a demand in provincial towns and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Government is not using the new technology that is available. For example, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, is the Minister with responsibility for e-government and the Central Statistics Office comes within her remit. Up to now, however, the CSO has not figured out how to maximise the use of new technology, as the Revenue Commissioners have done. Such technology can reduce the level of red tape encountered by small businesses in their dealings with State bodies. The Minister of State has the authority to ensure the delivery of e-government, yet she cannot even work it out in her own Department. It must come about swiftly.</P>
      <P>Other speakers have mentioned the need for broadband access but it will not be provided to every single home without wireless technology which requires a broadband backbone. In that way, broadband technology can be delivered to small villages but the infrastructure has not been put in place because we have not made the necessary investment. One company wanted to develop wireless technology on the western seaboard but it went into liquidation due to the downturn in the IT sector. No such work is taking place at present, but wireless technology is required because fibre-optic cable alone cannot be used to bring broadband access to all rural areas.</P>
      <P>We must examine the international benchmarks that are in place. For example, the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, provides the example for what is currently taking place in the IT sector. The prime example for broadband accessibility is South Korea. These developments are being prioritised in south-east Asia where such investments are scheduled for the long term. In this manner, Asian countries will be able to attract fresh investment to develop the information society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only does the Government here have difficulty in explaining what is needed in this regard, but the public has also ignored the issue. That is because the public naively believes it already has high-speed Internet access through ISDN. It was a good marketing ploy by Eircom to provide so-called high-speed access through ISDN lines but that is not the same as providing broadband access. Fibre-optic cable installations are needed with investment in DSL systems, but this is not feasible without local loop bundling, and no such action has been taken on this matter. We also <Col N="1447" />need to develop satellite technology to cover peripheral areas of the country. The Government has been far too slow in dealing with this, as has the communications regulator.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will herald some action to provide the accessibility that is needed for competition which, in turn, will ensure widespread Internet access.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the debate, Deputy O'Flynn mentioned that Ireland is second only to Singapore for global access, and no one would dispute that. In fairness, the Government must be given credit for this. While Ireland can boast the top global access system, however, the problem is that difficulties have arisen along the western seaboard where investment must be made to upgrade broadband access. The Government must give a commitment to do so.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, Eircom had to return funding to the then Department of Public Enterprise because it was not financially viable to proceed with rolling out a fibre-optic cable network. It can be done, however, by bringing the semi-State sector, including the ESB, Bord Gáis and Iarnród Éireann, together with the local loop networks to develop the system on a public private partnership basis. Thereby, companies that made a commitment after foreseeing the demand for such services would see a return on their investments. Unless we can supply the backbone to provide the necessary levels of competition, this legislation will be valueless and further debate on the matter in the House will be pointless.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has to be commended for taking steps to introduce flat-rate Internet access, it comes back to the provision of competition.</P>

      <P>In his reply, the Minister of State will no doubt say that fibre-optic cable networks are already in place, but the problem is the companies that want to provide those services are not getting access to them at a reasonable cost. Until such accessibility and that type of network are provided throughout the country, this and all other debates on this issue are pointless.</P>

      <P>I want to declare a number of interests. I have an interest in the hub area because it is in the Dublin South Central constituency which Deputy Upton and I share and members of my family have an interest in a company that provides broadband wireless access services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The digital hub area is one of the greatest successes of the Government. It has not yet reached <Col N="1448" />its full potential, but when it does this area will have a similar effect on the economy of Dublin South-Central that the International Financial Services Centre has had on the economy on the northside.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach initiated and pushed forward this project following various recommendations from a number of bodies, which I must congratulate, the Information Society Commission, the Irish Council for Technology, Science and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland, based on recommendations in its report on the growth potential in high-tech internationally traded services.</P>
    <P>I take issue with a number of points raised by Deputy Naughten. He said there was no vision in Government. I cannot understand how he can say that when great efforts are being made under this Bill, with the development of rings of fibre area networks across 19 towns and with 67 more to follow. His claim that no action has been taken to date on local loop unbundling is a fallacy. There are currently over 50 exchanges where there is local loop unbundling. Some partners and I have an accountancy practice in Walkinstown where we have been using DSL broadband access for over a year. Therefore, it was wrong of him to say that no action has taken place to date in this area.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the board of the media district on the work it has done to date. It is a high powered board under the chairmanship of William Burgess, who, in his many capacities, is giving great public service to the economy. There are a number of other high profile members on that board, whom I shall not name, who have also been effective. I congratulate the Dublin City Manager, the Dublin City Council and its members for facilitating in every way the development of the digital hub project.</P>
    <P>I have great pride in commending the Bill to the House. This hub is located in the Liberties-Coombe area, which is one of the most unique and historic areas of Dublin. It nestles between the internationally renowned Guinness's Brewery and Christchurch Cathedral and is in the midst of one of the most important communities of people in Ireland, the constituents of Dublin South-Central. There is a strong, vibrant community in the area and the agency will find its home among a welcoming community. It is important to applaud the legislation for emphasising the importance of consulting locally.</P>
    <P>The people in the locality have benefited greatly to date. There are computers in many of the houses and flats in the area and the help and technical assistance that local people are getting from people in the digital hub is highly appreciated. There is a great sense that this project will develop into jobs, technology and a major improvement in the quality of life in the area.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that there has been a long tradition of hubs in the Liberties-Coombe area where there are a number of specialist streets. There is Winetavern Street where wine was sold, Cook Street, Fishamble Street and Cornmarket <Col N="1449" />near St. Audeon's Church. Therefore, there is a long tradition in the area of markets, trade, industry and innovation. There is also the entrance from the west into Thomas Street, which was a hub of agriculturally based commerce. This location is ideal for the digital hub, as it has had a tradition of hubs.</P>
    <P>MediaLab Europe is located in this area, and its location there was pushed by the Taoiseach. There was a downtown in the technology field in recent years, but one can sense the manner in which it is driving back in all its aspects. More and more companies are tied into the web and the Internet and that will develop exponentially over the next few years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the broadband network, I congratulate Dublin Corporation on putting in place an area network in the digital hub area. That was funded by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and by his predecessors who had the communications portfolio. Deputy Naughten referred to e-content and e-access. While the Departments in general have excellent websites and information can be accessed easily and effectively, we would all agree that e-access throughout the country is pretty brutal. The fibre optic cable currently being laid by BT, Eircom and Iarnród Éireann in 19 towns and which will be laid in 67 more towns will provide the backbone of a network which will, in a short period, enable Ireland to be at the forefront and top of the world league in e-access. The rollout of the digital hub broadband is in the shape of a ring, so to speak, and I would like spokes to radiate from it to the backbone of the network to ensure it is tied in fully with the systems that are being put in place in these 19 towns.</P>
    <P>The European Commission is developing a network security agency, the location of which has not yet been decided. I ask the IDA and the Department of Foreign Affairs, through its contacts in Europe, to use every effort to try to ensure that this agency is located in the digital hub area. That would be an ideal location for it. That agency would be of enormous benefit to the development of the area. It location here would also enhance our national competence in an emerging, high potential area.</P>
    <P>The network security agency would involve inter-operability and vulnerability testing between software and hardware communications providers. It would encourage such people to establish in Ireland. It would operate as a nexus for people, research as well as product development. It is an important agency and I would like the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Departments of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Foreign Affairs to work as hard and as fast as they can on having it based here and ensure it is not based elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As regards competitiveness in the economy, the area of knowledge economy is the way forward. The competitiveness of traditional industry <Col N="1450" />in Ireland is threatened by the accession of new members to the European Union and by countries in Africa and Asia. We need a knowledge economy to maintain our standard of living. We need to encourage more pupils to take science subjects so that they can become involved in projects such as the digital hub.</P>
    <P>A recent report by Gartner consultants, a well known and highly respected group, highlighted that returns from investment in knowledge infrastructure far outweigh investment in other areas. The digital hub is a vehicle for that investment. Digital enterprises are important for our national competitiveness and our quality and standard of living into the future. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. Eoin Ryan Mr. Eoin Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation which is important for the country, Dublin and the community in which the digital hub is located. The hub is an initiative of the Government to create an international digital enterprise area in Dublin city. It shows real vision. The core development of approximately nine acres is located within the historic Liberties area in Dublin city centre. The digital hub is being developed in partnership with the community, public and private sectors and will contribute to an enriched environment in this celebrated part of our capital city.</P>
      <P>The digital hub is well under way and includes investment of &euro;130 million from the Government. A number of key elements of the project are either completed or are under way. These include: establishing and running the digital hub project office, attracting the anchor tenant, Media Lab Europe, the construction within the digital hub of a high speed broadband fibre ring, the Guinness Print Depot, which has just opened, the developer competition, which is ongoing, the urban framework plan and the Liberties learning initiative.</P>
      <P>The digital hub will be the foundation and generation of a new economic base for Ireland. The project is an essential part of Ireland's long-term solution to the current vulnerability in the marketplace, both nationally and globally. The slowdown and turmoil in the economy during 2001 and 2002 in the global media, telecommunications and technology markets will make the growth of new industry sectors and the development of global markets more challenging. However, content creation, management and distribution through digital media are key areas of opportunity identified by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland for future growth and competitive advantage for the country.</P>
      <P>The digital media and entertainment industry is already global and was worth $830 billion in 2002 according to figures published by PricewaterhouseCoopers. This is forecast to increase to $1,176 billion by 2005. Newspapers, publishing and television distribution and content are the three largest segments worldwide. The United States is the largest marketplace, accounting for more than 40% of spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" />The term &ldquo;digital media&rdquo; describes the evolution that is taking place in the media and entertainment sectors. This evolution is enabled by the convergence of traditional media, telecommunications and information technologies. Digital media enable the creation, packaging, management and distribution of digital content on a range of digital media platforms, for example, digital television, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, the Internet and personal computers.</P>
    <P>Development of the digital media market is being driven by a number of key technological and market trends. These include the global penetration of broadband capability and mobile telephony, the development of new business models based on digital distribution of content, increased availability of content in digital form and ongoing development in technology.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the digital media sector is at an early stage of development and that context bears a strong similarity to the state of the software industry ten years ago. In seeking to develop the digital media sector here, Ireland can build on the success achieved in a number of strong related sectors, notably the software and localisation industries. The country also has a strength in the education system, with a number of specialist institutions, such as Media Lab Europe, Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Ballyfermot College and the National College of Art and Design. The production of skilled graduates is complimented by the existence of some pockets of research and development in leading edge digital technologies.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, in its internationally traded service strategy, identified digital media as a sector with considerable potential for growth. Forfás, working on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is developing a policy document on the content industry and its potential. Enterprise Ireland's strategy will seek to focus on specific market-driven opportunities and, in that context, the entertainment industry has been identified as a priority sector for development. Enterprise Ireland has committed &euro;2.3 million towards the cost of developing accommodation for established, early stage and start-up digital media companies within the digital hub.</P>
    <P>The digital hub is to be developed within one of the most unique and historic areas of Dublin. The Liberties and the Coombe area form the core of the south-west inner city and possess a rich tapestry of culture, history and tradition. It is also known as the home of Guinness. It is important that we mention that this is very good for Ireland, Dublin and for jobs. It also shows vision and that we are not just hoping the IT sector will continue but are looking at other sectors, be they this area, biotechnology or whatever. We must be vigilant, alive and awake to new trends in the world to ensure we are to the forefront.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ardagh, Upton and others who represent the Liberties and Coombe area spoke earl<Col N="1452" />ier. I had the pleasure and honour to represent the area some time ago before the constituencies were redrawn. It is a fantastic, strong Dublin community. People work in the area to solve its many social problems. It would be crazy not to mention what has happened there in the past 20 years. Without doubt, it is one area that has suffered most from heroin abuse. To say it has been devastated would not be exaggerating the problem. The community has stuck together through thick and thin. It still has a drug problem but the problem of heroin abuse has been because of lack of education and opportunities. Those who become involved with heroin tend to be young unemployed males who left school before 16. It is a sweeping statement but that is generally who they are.</P>
    <P>The digital hub project is an exciting one linking to all schools and colleges in the area to show people they have an opportunity to break that cycle of drug abuse. That is one of the reasons I support the project. I believe it will make a significant difference to the lives of people living in the area. Obviously not all people living in the area suffer because of the drugs problem but many do and it has added to the social problems in the area. Many people I met when I represented the area worked very hard to bring the area along and they deserve much credit for that. I know from having spoken to them that they are excited about this project because they see what is hoped will happen. They are especially excited about the fact that it has been linked into local colleges and schools. That shows real vision and that we can make a difference and tackle the problems of social exclusion and deprivation.</P>
    <P>The digital hub is committed to respecting the tradition and heritage of the neighbourhood and ensuring sustainable and measurable benefits in the area. An early priority of the hub was extensive consultation with the community. The digital hub discussion document, A Vision for the Digital Hub, included initial feedback on this process.</P>
    <P>In preparing its development strategy, Digital Media Development has partnered the community through Dublin City Council's integrated area plan monitoring committee to agree recommendations for the delivery of local benefits. The report of the IAP advisory group on the digital hub has been included in an appendix of the development strategy. The digital hub community consultation process is ongoing but can be broken down according to the most important milestones. Consultation for A Vision for the Digital Hub took place between January and July 2001, consultation for the digital hub development strategy took place between August and December 2001 and ongoing consultation took place in 2002.</P>
    <P>In August 2001, Dublin Corporation's IAP monitoring committee formed an advisory group with the aim of contributing to the development plans for the digital hub. This group felt the Government's decision to locate the digital hub in the historic heart of Dublin presented the com<Col N="1453" />munity, schools and business of the Liberties and Coombe areas with an exciting opportunity and challenge. Under the chairmanship of Clive Brownlee, Assistant Managing Director of Guinness, the advisory group came together to examine the potential benefit to the community for the digital hub and to recommend actions to Dublin Corporation's IAP monitoring committee. These recommendations were made under four headings: child care, education and training, enterprise, and youth services.</P>
    <P>There was a number of pilot learning initiatives such as: the &ldquo;my neighbourhood&rdquo; photography competition involving about 120 people; &ldquo;digiboarding&rdquo; a summer project for young people; and learning in the digital hub.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Government on introducing it. It is not alone exciting for future employment and to be seen to be at the forefront of new technology, but it is also very exciting for a community that has suffered enormously from deprivation and drug abuse over the years. I know the community has embraced this project and is very excited about the positive aspects it can bring in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Dowd. Anything that can improve our technology base and infrastructure to bring our communications into line with others wordwide is important. In the 1970s my brother was a missionary working out in the wilds on an island known as Jamaica. At that time we only had our local telephone system. Out there they could not believe my brother had to ask the operator to connect him to Newbliss 38. They could not understand how he could not dial it directly as they were living in poverty and we were supposed to be living in reasonable affluence. We have come a long way since then.</P>
      <P>I welcome the euphoria among the people who represent the Liberties and the surrounding areas. It involved 700 businesses and 30,000 people between workers and students, which is fantastic. I am concerned at the comments in the newspaper about the viability of the organisation and its economic problems. This was revealed as a result of a request under the Freedom of Information Act. I hope the Government will realise the benefit of that Act and either withdraw or amend the Bill that is due to come before this House before damage is done. People must be allowed to get information to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coveney and other colleagues have dealt with the main aspects of the Bill but I want to address the problems affecting the Border region and highlight the difficulties in areas that are not centres of population. The previous speaker spoke of the deprivation and difficulties in areas such as the Liberties and the need for restructuring. After 35 years of troubles in the Border region, we also have difficulties. While INTERREG and other funds granted by Europe <Col N="1454" />and funds from America, Canada and Australia through the International Fund for Ireland have been helpful they have been instead of rather than in addition to Government funds. If the digital hub and e-government are to be meaningful for the Border region, that funding will be required.</P>
    <P>In 1999 an Armagh-Monaghan group was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, whose Department provided some seed capital. That has now been set up as the M:TEK and A:TEK in Monaghan and Armagh. About 500 jobs were created as a result. While the buildings and staff are in place, they do not have the means to communicate. PricewaterhouseCoopers carried out a study and established that the critical mass does not exist to allow the big players to invest. A few years ago grants were available under the PPS and Eircom and others put in a bid. However, they subsequently withdrew because they felt it was not economical.</P>
    <P>The group is now considering a pilot scheme to link M:TEK in Monaghan with A:TEK in Armagh through a wireless type system. INTERREG funds may be available and I hope the Government will support the project. There would not have been any point in the Minister giving seed capital in 1999 if there was not to be a follow through. It is important to utilise the last years of the INTERREG funds to the benefit of that area. As there is good infrastructure in Armagh, the majority of the 500 jobs are there. The infrastructure issues in Monaghan need to be addressed if we are to get equal benefit.</P>
    <P>The Government has plans to utilise e-commerce throughout its systems. Yesterday, we discussed the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill, part of which amended existing legislation to allow motor tax to be paid on-line. If a county council in the Border region is on-line with a good service and other businesses in the region are not on the same service it means that the council could buy a product from a company in Belfast or Dublin on-line rather than from a business down the road. That is how serious it is for rural areas and we must make sure this sort of communication is available to all.</P>
    <P>While we have an adult learning centre and the ESB, the 60 workers in M:TEK represent the only industrial jobs in Monaghan. The M:TEK site has been owned by the State for years. This shows that extending a proper communication system to Monaghan would create the potential for high-level employment opportunities for our graduates, which have not been available until now.</P>
    <P>Datacare, an international company that created 35 jobs in the Diamond in Monaghan with little or no help from the State, has had to consider moving out of the area. It is a sad development when, despite all the funding and the supposed Government support for the Border region, a company such as this should have to consider moving. Datacare is indigenous to Monaghan and proud of it. I want to ensure that it and <Col N="1455" />other industries which need the type of services broadband can provide will be helped.</P>
    <P>Graduates from Cavan-Monaghan and other Border counties are living in Dublin and must compete for accommodation with all those working in the digital hub. They have a right to live and work in counties Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Louth or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to my county manager, Declan Nelson, who formed a group with the county managers of Louth and Cavan when we were not selected to receive broadband access. The group drew up a proposal, which was accepted locally, and forwarded it to the Government in December last where it awaits agreement. I support the proposal which, I understand, covers only Dundalk in County Louth. My colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, may have something further to say on it with regard to Drogheda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn to the process of decentralisation, which I encourage. The cross-Border bodies were the only decentralisation projects for which the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan had good prospects of securing. We have the extraordinary position that the constituency produces two-thirds of the country's poultry as well as mushrooms, pigs and much more, yet an agricultural body formed as a result of the British-Irish Agreement was established in Cork. I do not want to hear the excuse that organisations of this nature must be located in Cork, Dublin or elsewhere because my constituency does not have broadband infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I make no apologies for being parochial on this matter. My parochialism extends to the entire Border region. County Donegal, which has suffered tremendous job losses, Sligo-Leitrim, Cavan-Monaghan and Louth deserve to be compensated for their current position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wireless technology has the potential to solve many of the problems facing rural areas which I have outlined. The Border counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan do not have railroads, although improvements to road structures are taking place. Broadband infrastructure would allow people to work from home and thus create unprecedented opportunities for the Border region. As a Border Deputy and former chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natu<Col N="1456" />ral Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should understand that the region needs and deserves broadband access.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate and I welcome the Bill. I am sorry the Minister is not present as I wanted to address my remarks to him. I am very concerned by what is happening in Government circles in relation to the roll-out of broadband in the north-east.</P>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Crawford, I acknowledge the value of counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth working together on the issue. Their proposal to the Government is to extend broadband to six towns, Drogheda, Dundalk, Cavan, Kingscourt, Monaghan and Carrickmacross. The total roll-out of broadband to these towns would cost some &euro;9 million. As I understand it, the Government informed the north-east strategic committee that the necessary funding was not available. The officials then went back to the drawing board without consulting the people for whom they work, namely, the elected representatives and the county councils, and decided that the decisions of the spatial strategy would apply if there was a shortfall in funds, in other words, the only towns to be connected to broadband would be Dundalk, Monaghan and Cavan. Drogheda, which is the largest town in the north-east with a population of more than 30,000 people and is planning for a town of more than 100,000 people, would, therefore, be placed in the same league as the two fine, but small towns of Kingscourt and Carrickmacross. This decision is totally unacceptable and a cause of serious concern.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the proposal initially went to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and is now being processed in the Department of Finance. I regret the Minister is not present to clarify whether this is the case. The question that arises is whether we in Drogheda will accept last place and the answer is no. This decision is neither reasonable nor rational.</P>
      <P>The spatial strategy is the first example of administrators seeking to discriminate between regions and towns by designating some of them hubs and growth centres while ignoring others. The Minister and his Department will not be allowed to ignore the town of Drogheda. As the largest town in the region and the market leader in many respects, broadband is vital to its future and we will not accept last place. I insist the Minister does his job on behalf of his constituency and looks after the town of Drogheda. The issue is clear and simple. The Fianna Fáil led Government cannot be allowed to ignore south Louth any longer. We will not allow it to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having received 5,505 number one votes and ultimately receiving more than 10,500 votes, I speak for the people of my area when, during this debate on modern communications, the digital hub and broadband, I point out that, as a Member of the Oireachtas elected in my constituency to represent my town, I failed to raise a vitally <Col N="1457" />important matter affecting my constituency and town in the House this morning. I was not permitted to raise the matter under Standing Order 31, on the Order of Business, the Adjournment or by means of a special notice question.</P>
    <P>The issue I wish to raise is the decision of An Bord Pleanála to overrule its inspector's report on the incinerator in Carranstown and to decide by a seven to two majority, with three members absent, that the incinerator there should go ahead. I have not been permitted to debate this matter of serious concern in the House. The policy for regional waste management in the north-east, that is, for counties Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, clearly states further studies must be done before one can have thermal treatment or an incinerator in any part of the region. The decision of An Bord Pleanála has neglected&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill highlights some of the difficulties which have arisen, and inevitably will arise, in that area in the short and medium term. One of the difficulties people face when discussing an issue such as this is the huge number of technical terms that can arise in that they have difficulty in establishing the meaning of each term. Despite the strong move nationally towards more involvement in e-media, people are experiencing difficulties in terms of speedy access to the system, particularly to DSL, broadband lines and even ISDN lines. I welcome the prospects for progress that arise under the wireless land project, which appears to be the project which offers the best hope to rural communities and those who wish to establish their operations outside the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>A number of previous speakers referred to the tremendous progress made in this area in other jurisdictions. The progress is so rapid it is difficult for any country to maintain the speed of development that is required internationally. Particular reference was made to the new project in Kuala Lumpur which has already succeeded in attracting over 200 companies. It has some similarities to a digital hub project here because approximately 10,000 residents are already in the area in which the project is being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" />It is important also to examine the progress of the IFSC project which many people believed was unlikely to deliver high quality jobs of a significant number but which has far exceeded the expectations of even those who were optimistic at the time. Many of the companies in the financial services district are now looking to expand to regional centres, which is welcome. Some of them have already made that move and one company is looking at a location in County Clare, which we welcome.</P>
    <P>We should also examine the success of the Plassey technological park in Limerick, which is breaking new ground, as is the case with this particular project. The Liberties-Coombe area is an imaginative location and the involvement of the community in the consultation process would be a role model for future projects in that it presents many exciting opportunities and challenges.</P>
    <P>In his contribution, the Minister of State referred to digital content as that which can be manipulated, stored and exchanged electronically and which includes sound, pictures, text and video. The IT and the ICT areas operate across a number of sectors, including education, information, entertainment and, particularly in recent times, consumer related content which has gradually become one of the areas where the ICT sector is making substantial advances.</P>
    <P>The digital content area was the key growth area in the ICT revolution over the past ten years or so, contrary to what was predicted by many experts. There is no doubt, however, that this country must urgently move up the technological value chain and in that regard the enhanced value from research and development is of major importance. While the Government has provided &euro;2.47 billion in the national development plan for the research and development area, it is clear that even that seemingly large amount is not sufficient to address the technological advances that will be required of this country if it is to maintain a position at the forefront or gain an advantage over some of the other players. Speaking on the Finance Bill the Minister for Finance indicated that the area of research and development was one on which he would look favourably in terms of tax-based incentives. That area may need to be revisited quickly.</P>
    <P>There is also an urgent need to create a critical mass at the forefront of the industry. That is one of the jobs the new agency is charged with doing and there are already indications that, on foot of progress to date, this can be achieved with the necessary investment. In order to achieve the aims set out by the Minister we will need a very high grade telecommunications infrastructure not just in the area of the project but nationally. There are difficulties associated with that but some of those have been overcome or addressed under the regulatory regime.</P>
    <P>Such regimes tend not to be popular with existing players, as we have seen in telecommunica<Col N="1462" />tions, electricity and aviation but that is inevitable. However, for the advancement of the sector and the country's future positioning at or near the forefront of the industry, it is necessary that the regulatory regime be sufficiently strong to enable advances in choice and competition to be made. Some progress has been made with unbundling the loop project in over 50 locations at this stage and there is considerable pressure on the existing Eircom infrastructure, as there are requirements for bandwidth which have not been available heretofore. There are also substantial price pressures and the Minister has indicated he is moving towards a regime where a flat rate will apply, but there is a need for wholesale prices for those involved in industry which are not available at this stage to any extent.</P>
    <P>There are questions surrounding access to the service and also in relation to the improvements which can arise with sufficient competition. There are also issues regarding choice of both service provider and pricing. Such issues are relevant to industry, big and small, as well as the domestic consumer.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made on regulatory issues on foot of the E-Commerce Act 2000 and more particularly after the Communications Regulation Act 2002, when the commission was set up. However, more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Education is one sector which stands to benefit enormously from this project and from ICT developments generally. We need to invest more heavily and imaginatively in that area. The national development plan provides for almost &euro;700 million in funding for research and development in the higher education sector but there is incontrovertible evidence that our system is not as science and technology friendly as it ought to be. A report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education, with Deputies Naughten and Richard Bruton as rapporteurs, examined the extent of the need to advance studies of science and mathematics at second level. We are slipping considerably in this area. Recently the committee had a presentation from the Institute of Engineers in Ireland regarding the Steps programme, which was introduced jointly by the Institute and the Department of Education and Science to progress this issue. Some progress is being made on foot of that programme.</P>
    <P>I recently saw a UK report on the same subject and there are also some comparators to indicate that across Europe, and in the US and Asia to some extent, science, mathematics and technology subjects have begun to slip in the order of importance and preference for students throughout the system. That might be to the advantage of Ireland if it continues elsewhere but it is to our disadvantage if we do not address the problems which have become apparent.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following order in draft:</P>
      <P>Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003 a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 28th February, 2003.</P>
      <P>By agreement, the debate on this motion will conclude at 3.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The EU television without frontiers directive, Directive 97/3 6 EC, recognises that member states should have the right to take measures to ensure that events that are regarded by member states as &ldquo;events of major importance to society&rdquo; should continue to be available on free television services. Under the directive it is open to each individual member state to decide whether it wishes to designate events as events of major importance to society.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 incorporated into Irish law the provisions of Article 3a of the television without frontiers directive. That Act provides that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources may designate certain events as events of major importance to society for which the right of a qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on free television services should be provided in the public interest.</P>
      <P>The 1999 Act provides that the Minister must consult with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, event organisers, broadcasters within the State and members of the public before designating events. The Act also requires that the Minister must lay a draft of the order designating the events before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has conducted an extensive consultation process and a report on that process is available on my Department's website. The report details the process, the decisions taken and the rationale for those decisions. Key features of the consultation process included an online forum on my Department's website and a public meeting hosted by the Minister in Dublin Castle in August 2002.</P>
      <P>As required, The Minister has also sought the opinion of the EU Contact Committee established under Article 3a of the directive. That committee considered the measures proposed to be taken by Ireland at its meeting on 31 January and gave the opinion that it had no objection to the measures proposed. The only remaining step is for the draft order designating the events to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now turn to the actual events to be designated. While acting to protect the public interest, <Col N="1464" />I also had to take account of the interests of event organisers and of broadcasters and the list of events to be designated reflects a balanced and proportionate approach. The list covers major international events such as the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup and the European Football Championships. The EU directive specifically refers to these events as examples of the type of events where member states should be free to act. In soccer the list also includes all of Ireland's qualifying games in the World Cup and European Championships. In Gaelic games the list includes the All-Ireland senior finals in football and hurling. Some people argued for the inclusion of other games such as provincial finals and the decision taken was based on the fact that the All-Ireland finals are national events.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction to be drawn between events that are very popular and events that are of major importance to society and this distinction is very relevant in the case of Gaelic games. For example, Waterford's win in the Munster Hurling Championship last year was a significant event but in its importance to the country as a whole it would not been as significant as Armagh's win in the last year's football final or the breakthrough of Clare in 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on where you are from. What if one was from Waterford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly would have ranked behind Wexford's great All-Ireland win in 1996.</P>
      <P>In horse racing the Irish Derby and Irish Grand National are included as the two premier events on the racing calendar. Interest in these races extends well beyond those who closely follow racing. The Nations Cup at the Dublin Horse Show is included at the request of the organisers of the event.</P>
      <P>All of these events are listed on a live basis. Ireland's games in the Rugby World Cup are listed on a live basis and in the Six Nations Championships on a deferred basis. The reasons for the Minister's decision not to list the games in the Six Nations Championships on a live basis are set out in detail in the report which is on the Department's website.</P>
      <P>Rugby is a major sport in Ireland but, unlike Gaelic games and soccer, it is not played in every town and village in the country. It is popular but does not have as broad a popular appeal as Gaelic games or soccer. While attracting significant media attention, rugby internationals do not attract as high a level of media attention or television audiences as soccer internationals or all-Ireland finals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rugby at international level is not as mature or as stable as international soccer. Professional rugby is a recent phenomenon and while Irish rugby has made great strides in the years of professionalism, the future development of the game at international level is still under debate. The IRFU argues that in this environment anything that reduces the competitiveness of Irish inter<Col N="1465" />national rugby could have potentially disastrous consequences for rugby in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting rights for the Six Nations Championships games are sold by all the competing nations as a pool. The proceeds from the pool are then shared. A new three year deal with free television broadcasters was agreed last year and RTE has bought the rights to all games in the championships for this three year period. Because of the way the pool works, the IRFU will get out of it several times what RTE paid in. If the games were designated on a live basis, the IRFU might be forced out of the pool and this could have a disproportionate impact on it.</P>
    <P>The list was arrived at after all interested parties had the chance to submit their views and it protects the public interest. It also attempts to balance the interests of event organisers and broadcasters. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has indicated that he will review the list in two years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we have finally arrived at the designation of a list. Policy makers, those in government in particular, have a responsibility to the public to ensure free-to-air television coverage is provided for key sporting events of national significance and importance. We are attempting to do that today. It would, however, be remiss of me not to say that it should have been done a long time ago. The Government could have done this in 2000. Because of the incompetence of the Government, particularly the previous Minister, in this area, we had the embarrassing and unacceptable situation of not being able to provide free-to-air coverage of a significant soccer match in the autumn. It is only because of that embarrassment that we have moved to designate sports.</P>
      <P>Today is about the events themselves, not the legislation. It was somewhat unfair of the Government to expect to push this through without debate considering the level of national interest in these sporting events. I am glad the Government Chief Whip conceded to the requests made by Deputy Broughan and me to provide time to debate this today.</P>
      <P>We have a responsibility to the sporting bodies to ensure they get a fair deal so they can plough money back into their sports and ensure they have the necessary funding. I note that arbitration rulings in this area are not binding but we shall debate that another day.</P>
      <P>A third area of responsibility is ensuring a fair deal for the broadcaster. It should be able to afford to pay a reasonable amount to provide free-to-air coverage so no one in the country faces discrimination, as would be the case with the provision of pay-per-view coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some concerns about the list. It covers five sporting events, the first being the Olympic Games. How can Irish law enforce conditions on the international Olympics committee to ensure that RTE or TV3 can force the organisers of coverage to provide it on a free-to-air basis? It is <Col N="1466" />an international event, not one run by an Irish sporting organisation.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what we see here, and I am sure the Minister of State will agree, events like the Munster hurling final are of interest. There is also concern about camogie. A real effort is being made to promote female participation in sport &ndash; it is the centrepiece of the Fine Gael policy document on sport &ndash; but we offer no free-to-air guaranteed coverage of all-Ireland camogie finals. A further omission is that key events in the Eircom League calendar will not be guaranteed free-to-air coverage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the decision on the Six Nations Championships in rugby. The IRFU works with the Scottish and Welsh to bargain as a unit. It is not, therefore, reasonable or possible to remove that bargaining power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply, perhaps the Minister will refer to the contract entered into by the FAI and Sky Television to broadcast Ireland's home European Championships matches live to audiences in the State that was supposed to net the FAI &euro;5.3 million. What is the situation with that arrangement now? Can the FAI claim compensation from the Government? That is what brought us here today and we should clarify the issue.</P>
      <P>As a sportsperson, I welcome this legislation. Perhaps we are a nation of spectators rather than participants. More people are watching sport than was the case in the past and there are more experts scattered throughout our hostelries than ever before.</P>
      <P>It would be preferable to have greater participation in sport but, for those who are interested in sport, it is very welcome. The more people who are interested in sport as spectators, the better. A healthy interest in sport is a very good antidote to other forms of behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to Gaelic games in particular. While I welcome the inclusion of the All Ireland senior finals in football and hurling, there are now some very competitive quarter finals under the new &ldquo;back door&rdquo; system in Gaelic football and hurling. There are also some very competitive semi-finals as well as provincial finals, which have been mentioned already. I would favour a more inclusive approach in this matter. As Deputy Coveney mentioned, camogie has become a very popular sport. One of the faster growing sports here is ladies football, in which some 70,000 people are now involved throughout the country. It is becoming a very popular sport and a particularly encouraging feature is its popularity in counties which were not traditionally strong Gaelic football counties at senior men's level, such as Waterford and Monaghan. Perhaps the Minister of State will comment further on this matter. I appreciate that he has clarified the position to some extent already as to the reason for the present exclusions from this provision. In the case of northern counties in particular, is there a possi<Col N="1467" />bility of the BBC, for example, moving in to secure the rights in relation to those games? I believe there is every chance of that happening and I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.</P>
    <P>In relation to rugby, I understand the logic of the position outlined by the Minister of State. The joint Oireachtas committee with responsibility for sport is now in session and meeting a delegation from the Irish Rugby Football Union. Having lost &euro;4 million last year, that organisation will obviously welcome whatever revenue stream it can find.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the belated Designation of Major Events Order 2003 under the Broadcasting Act 1999. It should be noted that this development originated with my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, during his term as Minister for Arts and Culture, when he was also President of the European Council of Ministers in that regard. Under his leadership, the Council recognised that major cultural and sporting events should not be treated as commodities but rather on the basis of their intrinsic merits for the citizens of the European Union. That very important principle has been attacked by the Kirch organisation in Germany and by Rupert Murdoch's <i>News International,</i> but the principle was established and should be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish people were outraged last year when we lost the opportunity of viewing a number of major Association Football games involving our international team. Why did the Minister wait three and a half years to move on this matter? Even in this Government, why was this designation not introduced last summer? Could it have anything to do with the fact that the proprietor of <i>News International </i>and leading shareholder in Sky Television, Mr. Rupert Murdoch, and his newspapers were watching the Irish political scene very carefully? In the summer of 2000 when this whole process should have been over and done with, there was an expectation of a possible general election which eventually came a year later. Is it not a fact that the then Minister, Deputy de Valera, was not allowed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to deal with this matter because he wished to appease the great media mogul and magnate, Mr. Rupert Murdoch, whom he described as the world's foremost leader in media? That is the reason we are now discussing this matter, late on a Thursday afternoon, rather than two and a half to three years ago. We bowed the knee to those pressures. Somewhere in the Taoiseach's office, there is a sign from the 1992 general election in Britain which states: &ldquo;It wos <i>The Sun</i> wot wun it&rdquo;. <i>The Sun </i>certainly won it for Mrs. Thatcher in 1979 and other election <Col N="1468" />years and I believe there was the determination to ensure that organisation was kept on side.</P>
    <P>That shameful and undemocratic background has to be seen in conjunction with the recent RTE Prime Time investigation of the Taoiseach's treatment of the Football Association of Ireland, when he deliberately destroyed its attempt to build a national stadium. He pulled the plug on the FAI by presenting every possible impediment and barrier to destroy its stadium project. In the light of those events, I believe he is unfit to be a Minister, let alone Taoiseach of this country. This devious background displays a disgraceful role of vested interests in our society that would deprive people of the simple pleasure of watching an Irish football team in action at home or away.</P>
    <P>The fact that the lists have materialised at long last is welcome. The Irish fans in their green shirts &ndash; the best fans in the world, as evidenced in Seoul, Japan, Rome and Germany, where they created an outstandingly positive image of our nation which still reverberates today when one is engaged in business or political matters &ndash; should not have been betrayed, as they were, by this Government for disgraceful reasons.</P>
    <P>As regards Gaelic football, a distinguished champion has spoken just before me. Deputy Deenihan is one of the greatest footballers who ever strode onto Croke Park. A few years ago, the Dubs and Meath engaged in one of those titanic struggles which packed Croke Park over four successive Saturdays and Sundays. The whole nation is keenly interested in the outcome of such events. It is ironic that a person who claims to be a great supporter of the Dubs has not included such events in the designation list nor, indeed, the Munster and Leinster finals. I can empathise greatly with the Wexford hurling team as my father came from New Ross. In the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, I pose the question as to whether we will be allowed to see the Wexford team in action.</P>
    <P>In relation to rugby football, we are very proud of the great achievements of our provincial teams in recent months and it is good that Connacht will remain on a professional basis. Though rugby has a more limited membership than other sports, it is national in character. The combination of Leinster and Munster has provided a brilliant national team and long may they prosper. Perhaps some events, particularly home internationals, should be available to viewers. I welcome this designation order but wonder why it is so belated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this designation order and I will confine myself to the principles behind the list of events. As Deputy Broughan has said, I was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, President of European Council of culture Ministers and President of the European Council of broadcasting Ministers when the <i>television sans frontiers </i>directive was being revised. I wish to pay tribute to Department officials &ndash; two in particular &ndash; who <Col N="1469" />worked night and day on the directive. They also worked very hard on Protocol 52 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which should be seen in conjunction with the directive. That protocol, on which I can speak very plainly, was a window of revision on what was seen as a treaty that facilitated the reign of the market. It protected certain rights for public service broadcasters which have not been implemented.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the <i>television sans frontiers </i>directive was that sporting and other cultural events were acts of communication and should be considered in terms of communication rights. We also took account of the various rights which existed in external international treaties. With a very definite reason in mind, we were quite consciously seeking to resist the approach whereby events are treated as a commodity.</P>
      <P>The European Broadcasting Union, in the case of the citizen's right of access to significant sporting events in the communication context, had always an ability to pay. It never charged a flat fee for coverage of events. The European Broadcasting Union has effectively been brought to its knees by monopolies such as Kirch, which is now thankfully in a form of bankruptcy. I hope that the same fate is in store for some of the others. It is interesting to note, for example, that the amount of tax Mr. Rupert Murdoch's international news media company paid in the ten years between 1980 and 1990 was zero because of the way it located its finances. These destroyed the European Broadcasting Union. We were dealing with an attempt at monopoly which would stop people watching significant events.</P>
      <P>I can answer a question posed to the Minister. The European Broadcasting Union has been out-bid for the next Olympic Games and the next World Cup. These sporting events are now within the realms of monopoly.</P>
      <P>Dealing with this, there were certain legislative responses which could have followed our work on <i>television sans frontiers.</i> I tried one of them, which was a limit on cross-ownership and on a monopoly of broadcasting. The second was to implement the directive. It could have been implemented, not from 2000 but from its passing in 1997. What was needed was that one would establish the list, submit it to the Commission for approval and then legislate for it. I accept that 2000 is the correct year in this sense because that would have allowed an adequate period for consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, here is the confusion which has now arisen. As a person who was the author of the directive in part, there was never any suggestion of conferring a property right in a sporting event that was being enjoyed by citizens. That right does not exist. The delay in establishing the list, coming forward with the legislation and going to the Commission have created confusion as to whether there was a right there to be sold. This will arise, after arbitration, in discussions as to whether there is any right there retrospectively. I believe that Sky Television, for example, has no <Col N="1470" />basis for making an offer and that its position is an illegal one.</P>
    <P>There are proposals before the European Parliament to have a form of international regulation of broadcasting. I look forward not only to the day when Sky Television will pay taxes in some country but to when its monopoly grip on the media across several different forms, print, television and radio, will be broken. We have only to see its disgraceful comments about the war at present to know what is in store for us if its monopoly deepens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Crowe. Like many Deputies, I grew up in one channel land when RTE began at around 5 o'clock with the words, &ldquo;RTE anseo agaibh&rdquo;. There were many advantages and disadvantages to this. The advantages were that all of Ireland seemed to be focused on these programmes, on Micheál Ó Hehir and Gay Byrne, and there was a national discourse so that in a sense it was nation building. It moulded the nation. The topic of conversation would be the match or what happened on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo;, or whatever.</P>
      <P>Since that time there has been a proliferation of channels. People who lived in Dublin always received a number of channels. With digital television, this proliferation goes even further. Often I get the impression that it is a little like the old Bruce Springsteen song, &ldquo;57 Channels (And Nothin' On)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sport has now become almost an obsession and we cater for those needs. At times I worry that there are people who can scarcely afford to put bread on the table and yet have a satellite dish. Sky Sports is a must. It has become a total obsession. In some cases I tend to agree with Noam Chomsky when he said that it is a distraction and it is now like the bread and circuses of old. We need to be careful. One could probably get so many people who can name every sports star but who would not know anything about what is going on in this House. We need to get the balance right.</P>
      <P>I agree with those who said that there is now a real danger of monopolies occurring and this is precisely what Mr. Murdoch wants. We must have a clear division between the public and private sphere. The problem is that the private sphere is dominating completely. It is about time we tried to do something about it. I congratulate Deputy Michael D. Higgins for his work in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are notable omissions in this list. We all have our favourite sports. I am not a great man for the horses, but from what I see rugby stands out. The Six Nations and Heineken Cup matches attract huge audiences. There is great support for these games. One need only look at the support for the Munster team and the Leinster team getting a full house in Lansdowne Road. It behoves the Minister to look at those sports and to include them on the list. I hope he will do so at a future date. I welcome the introduction of this list <Col N="1471" />because in the past huge sporting events were not seen. That was wrong. We must enhance the public broadcasting sphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Finian McGrath. I welcome the motion. During the general election we called for this measure and it is always nice to see something you campaigned for come to pass. I share the views of Deputies who spoke earlier.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about some the games that have been left off the list such as the all-Ireland semi-finals. Deputy Broughan spoke of the support for the Dublin team. We saw the huge turnout for the Dublin-Armagh match. There were many people who could not get tickets for that match and watched it on television. It would have been terrible if the supporters, who did not have a ticket, had not be able to watch that match. It was a game which people all over Ireland, and Irish people all over the world, wanted to watch.</P>
      <P>People felt let down by politicians once again, and they were let down. The reality is politicians failed to act. We are waiting a number of years for this draft proposal to come forward, and it is welcome.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan spoke about the World Cup. Most of us, looking back over the years, would say that the World Cup provided some of our most enjoyable times. The problem with the Government's proposal is that while with pay per view you can go along to the local pub and watch the game, enjoyment of the game would be synonymous with the local pub. Many people complained about the effect this would have on children and said it was not necessary to go to the pub to enjoy oneself. As others have said, it is not only about watching but about involvement &ndash; you should be able to follow your heroes and Ireland has had many of them on the sporting fields and in athletics.</P>
      <P>In soccer, Ireland's supporters are mostly working people. Many of them are still paying for their trips to the World Cup and the European Cup qualifiers. With pay per view, people were forced to pay these multi-national broadcasting companies and the reality is that the Government did not gave a damn about those supporters.</P>
      <P>The supporters are characterised all over the world as people who know how to enjoy themselves and of whom the country as a whole should be proud, and clearly that is the case. People talk about our supporters and part of the upturn in tourism from Europe and further afield is as a result of Irish supporters travelling to matches making a good impression. However, the supporters were let down by politicians.</P>
      <P>I am glad the list is being put forward, but there are areas the Minister should investigate. Clearly, the all-Ireland finals need to be included. There have also been instances of discrimination against women in the Irish Open Golf Championship, and there is no mention of this. Perhaps the Minister will address some of these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of speaking on this important motion. I will be supporting the motion and I know that all followers of sport and supporters of good quality public broadcasting should form a team to take on vested interests for the public good. We must be strong in defending the rights of our people to watch all games and sports, particularly national games and international events. Treasures such as these must be protected.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003 is urgently required at this time in our broadcasting history. It is also needed to protect the interests of the people who line the pitches, put up the nets, train our young people and bring our young people with disabilities to the gym and the swimming pool and, above all, the massive community and voluntary effort that goes into our sports. I have a particular interest in GAA football, international soccer and the Special Olympics. We should not forget the massive efforts, the blood, sweat and tears that go into sports. We should always thank and commend those excellent people for their massive contribution to society. This debate is part of the wider debate on voluntary work in the community and the potential to develop a healthier society.</P>
      <P>Sadly, at the moment there are people in our sporting world that do not respect the jersey and seem to have lost all sense of priority and commitment to our country. Greed and selfishness is creeping in. I call this &ldquo;Keaneism&rdquo;, after a top sportsman who put his club before his country. I know it is not politically correct to criticise Roy Keane, but the bottom line is that he let his country down twice in its hour of need. We should not be ashamed to say that. Let us remember the thousands of young people who would give their right arms to put on the green jersey. Keane let us down and it is a bad example to our young people. I wish people would stop harping on about this and instead remember the Robbie Keanes and the Damien Duffs of this world and use them as a good example for our youth. We should also get out there and support Brian Kerr and people like Gerry Smith, a neighbour of mine from Griffith Avenue, the new manager of our under-20s team. These are the people I want to see on television, directing and developing our youth. They have a passion for the game. This motion should be dedicated to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All-Ireland finals should not be taken from the people. They should always be part of our national broadcasting service because they are part of our heritage and culture. All-Ireland day is a great national occasion and always sends a positive burst of energy through the city of Dublin and the whole country. I commend RTE for its excellent coverage of sports throughout the years. We may at times be critical of RTE, as I have, but we always need good quality public broadcasting. I agree with Deputy Broughan's remarks earlier about Mr. Murdoch and his <Col N="1473" />friends. Sky has acted in a negative manner in relation to sports.</P>
    <P>We are here today to amend the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999. The main reason I am supporting this is to ensure that a substantial proportion of the population is not deprived of the opportunity of continuing to watch designated events on free television services. I welcome the fact that this Bill will not have significant financial or staffing implications. As a person who has been a member of Cumann na mBunscoil, which trains under-13 children in primary schools, for more than 20 years, I want to be the voice for the people on the front line of sports. I have managed and trained under-13 teams for years and I have had the honour of reaching two finals in Croke Park. I will never forget those two days &ndash; the buzz around the school, the parents and children getting ready for the final and the look on the faces of our panel of 25 children as they ran onto the pitch in Croke Park. It was a burst of positive energy and those lads will never forget those days. This is the real world of sport. It makes a positive contribution to society and this is why we should all support this Bill.</P>

The interest in this issue augurs well for the future. The Minister has published a Bill, which commenced in the Seanad yesterday and will be coming to this House shortly. This will present another opportunity for the Deputies to debate fully the implications of the decisions he is taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" />The deal between the FAI and Sky was mentioned. This covers all future qualifying games in the European and World Cup tournaments. The Bill to be considered by the House shortly will allow the High Court to alter an existing contract such as this and provides that the High Court should decide who should be paid what sums if this happens. I recognise the role of Deputy Michael D. Higgins in drawing up the directive. I share some of his opinions about Sky, which rides roughshod not only over this country but over other EU countries. Perhaps the EU should deal with this at a higher level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney mentioned the summer Olympics. Because of the directive, all EU member states have legislation protecting the rights of other member states. For example, if Sky buys the rights to the Olympics, which is on our list, the regulator in the UK will not allow Sky to show a game without first selling it on to RTE and TV3. He also mentioned camogie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and indeed the Leinster final and all GAA games. It is all about making choices and ensuring balance. Deputy Deenihan raised the same issues in relation to qualifying games in the GAA and the all-Ireland semi-finals. All these games are important in their own way, but the Minister had to make a balanced political judgment. We should bear in mind that the GAA has stated on a regular basis that it does not intend to sell to the paid television platform and we must take it at its word. I also recently read an interesting article by the president of the GAA which stated that it was considering not televising some of the qualifying games because it was interfering with the club games and because attendances were down throughout the country. It was down to the Minister to make a balanced judgment about discussions with the GAA.</P>
      <P>The Minister has investigated extending the list, taking into account such sports as ladies' football and camogie. People feel that different sports are important &ndash; a constituent wrote me a letter saying that horseshoe throwing should be included. Every group or organisation felt it should be listed, but in the end the Minister had to be balanced and respect the rights of the sporting organisations. Deputy Coveney pointed out when talking about rugby that it is important that we listen to what the organisations have to say. The Minister will be reviewing his decisions in two years and he will then consider adding or deleting events.</P>
      <P>The fact that it will be reviewed in two years' time is important. I will communicate Deputies' ideas and suggestions to the Minister and ask him to take some of them on board.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I established the expert review group on radiation oncology services to examine the appropriate future development of radiotherapy services. The group has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision.</P>
      <P>The group's report will address the following key issues: access to radiotherapy service &ndash; in terms of information, financial access and organisational components of access &ndash; the need to provide a high quality, evidence based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be in place in a radiotherapy facility.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, there has been an unprecedented level of investment in cancer services. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy, a cumulative figure of &euro;400 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. This investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology throughout the country. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred &ndash; for example, the number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment has increased from 2,402 in 1994 to 3,809 in 2000. This means that an additional 1,407 patients are accessing these services, representing an increase of 58% nationally.</P>
      <P>I understand that the work of the expert review group on radiation oncology services is at the final editing stage and will be submitted to me shortly. All health boards have been afforded the opportunity to meet and make submissions to the group. The provision of additional radiotherapy services will be considered in the context of the report of the expert working group. Following consideration of the report, I will submit proposals for consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>No matter how specifically I phrase questions, I always get the same history lesson in response, without ever getting a specific answer. I asked the Minister whether he is satisfied that the capacity of the service will be sufficient to meet the needs of the population. There is no doubt that the review group will eventually report. All the stories one hears indicate that the report is already with the Minister and has been before the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>It may not be the case, but it is the most leaked report of all time. Given the sensitivities regarding what is contained in the report, I understand why the Minister is not anxious to publish it. We have services in Dublin and Cork and I hope they will be available in Galway by 2005. Given that the decision to provide those services in Galway was made in 1997 or earlier, it is clear it takes nine years to bring a facility to fruition so it is essential the Minister knows now that he will have sufficient capacity in 2005, otherwise he needs to plan further investments. In that context, why have sources close to the Minister ruled out of hand the possibility of the private provision of such a service, when the Minister is not yet certain whether he will have sufficient capacity within the three locations? </P>

      <P>Various groups have come forward with proposals and the basic answer I have given them is that I am awaiting presentation and publication of the report of the expert group before making any decisions on the provision of radiotherapy facilities. The issues relate to patient throughput, the population catchment area that any centre should deal with and the multidisciplinary nature of the human resources required for a radiotherapy centre &ndash; from radiation oncologists to physicists to specialist nursing. Many of those specialities are in scarce supply throughout the world so it is important that whatever configuration we come up with maximises the human resource inputs as well as the technology inputs and that we get the best value for money and best quality service for patients.</P>
      <P>The issue for local communities and the country will be whether we want world class, high quality services which cannot be located everywhere or something that falls short of that and which can be located all over the country. The expert group is grappling with these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept we do not have sufficient access or services in the radiotherapy field, which is why I set <Col N="1477" />up the expert group, but it is important that we get the proper model so we can begin to allocate resources against that model.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says and that it is precisely because there is a long lead-in time and because it is a hugely complex area that he must know well in advance what are his needs.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitment to the health services is clear from the significant increase the services have received for 2003. Despite the tight budgetary situation overall, health obtained the largest increase by far of any Department this year, at &euro;970 million, which was a 12% increase, and this continues the high level of investment since 1997 &ndash; the percentage increase since that year is 162%.</P>
      <P>The health boards and the ERHA have drawn up their service plans having regard to the approved limits. There will be a need to manage carefully the service plan delivery, in particular within the acute hospital programme, which can be the subject of great pressure, both from activity and cost. The major teaching hospitals in the greater Dublin area will of course face these pressures as will all major acute hospitals throughout the country. The ERHA is concluding its series of meetings with the major hospitals to agree funding levels and service plans in respect of 2003.</P>
      <P>The figures available for 2002 projected outturns and the 2003 proposed funding for the major acute Dublin hospitals are set out in the following tables:</P>

    <P>When comparing the 2002 outturn with the 2003 determinations, care must be taken to avoid simple comparisons. The 2002 outturn, for comparison purposes, must be adjusted for the impact of once-off elements. These include such items as pay arrears and medical indemnity insurance. It <Col N="1479" />will be appreciated that during the year, as is normal for agencies, the ERHA's determination will be increased by, for example, tranche 2 of the waiting list funding, bed capacity funds, winter initiative funds, pay settlements and other initiatives. Therefore, it would be misleading to make a straight comparison between final determinations for last year and the original figure for 2003.</P>
    <P>It is clear that they will have to manage their services in a proactive and effective manner throughout 2003. I emphasise that the discussions between the ERHA and the hospitals are ongoing and the precise make-up of the service agreements for 2003 are not finalised. My Department is in contact with the ERHA and will receive a report from the authority when its discussions are finalised in regard to 2003. The Secretary General and the senior management team in my Department will also meet the ERHA and chief executive officers of the major Dublin area teaching hospitals together as part of an ongoing consultative process.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister face up to the reality and clearly state the position of major acute hospitals in Dublin? Beaumont Hospital is facing a funding cutback of 10%, the Mater Hospital is facing a 12% cutback and I presume the position is similar in St. James's Hospital. Will the Minister guarantee that patient care will not be affected by what the ERHA has described as &ldquo;a difficult year&rdquo;? Will he ensure the 11,000 treatments that have been denied to patients in the Mater Hospital will not be denied over the year? Will he ensure the major Dublin hospitals can meet the needs of their patients without any question of cutbacks impacting on patients?</P>

Other increases are 8% for Beaumont Hospital, 9% for the Mater Hospital, 10% for St. Vincent's and 3% for Tallaght. The additional allocation that is made at the beginning of the year is added to throughout the year for waiting list initiatives, bed capacity, pay arrears and medical indemnity etc. It is simplistic to compare outturn figures with the initial figure. The additional amount we gave last year would have been greater than that which was originally allocated at the start of 2002.</P>

The variance between the determination and the outturn in St. James's was &euro;19,000, the variance for Beaumont was a deficit of &euro;3.7 million, the variance for the Mater was a deficit of &euro;5 million while there was also a &euro;5 million deficit for St. Vincent's.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act 1996 the Minister for Health and Children no longer has a statutory role in the acquisition or disposal of property by health boards. This function is now a reserved function of each health board. I am informed by the Mid-Western Health Board that the sale referred to by the Deputy was approved at a meeting of the board held in September 1998. The property, comprising of Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital and adjoining lands, was sold by the board to Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited for a consideration of £2.44 million and a property of approximately six acres in Killaloe, County Clare. Contracts between the parties were signed in December 1998, following which £2.44 million was lodged by the purchaser with a bank.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the health board that in September 1997, the Land Valuation Office valued the property in the region of £2.5 million, excluding the church, an area for respond housing and an area retained by the board. It appears that the proceeds of the disposal of Our Lady's Hospital and lands were in line with that valuation. I understand that the proceeds of the sale have since been re-invested by the Mid-Western Health Board in developing the Clare mental health services, which have been improved significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>The mental health services now emerging in County Clare can be regarded as being on a par with, if not better than, those available elsewhere. The new acute psychiatric unit at Ennis General Hospital opened in December 2001. Built at a cost of &euro;5.7 million, the unit provides acute psychiatric in-patient services for the Clare region in a modern, state-of-the-art facility. With the closure of Our Lady's Hospital, alternative facilities for 180 long-stay patients have been provided by the health board at the refurbished Cappahard Nursing Home, at Spanish Point and at the Orchard High Support Hostel in Kilrush. Community based services in Clare have been further enhanced in the past year through the employment of additional nursing and medical staff and the development of home based and intervention models of care. A new day centre opened in Scarriff in January 2002.</P>

        </i>The closure and sale of Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis, the location of a new psychiatric unit on the grounds of the acute hospital and the development of a range of alternative community facilities was fully in keeping with national policy on the development of mental health services. It was also in line with the Mid-Western Health Board's plan for the development of its mental health services, A Better Way.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he proposes to deal with the concern of Amnesty International at the inattention of the Government to a series of national and international reports critical of its failure to fully respect the human rights of people with mental illness and the view of Amnesty International that Irish mental health care policy and service provision remain out of step with international best practice, and as such, fail to fully comply with international human rights law.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Amnesty International's recently published report, &ldquo;Mental Illness: The Neglected Quarter&rdquo;, highlights areas of genuine concern in relation to mental health services. These are concerns which the Government shares and which it intends to address. To its credit, Amnesty International's report acknowledges the substantial progress that has been made in recent years in improving the mental health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1999-2002, an additional &euro;70.7 million revenue funding was invested in the mental health services. In the current year, additional revenue funding of &euro;7.6 million will be provided for ongoing developments in mental health ser<Col N="1485" />vices, including the areas of child and adolescent psychiatry, psychiatry of later life, liaison psychiatry, suicide prevention initiatives and support for the voluntary sector for the development of advocacy services in Ireland. Overall, about &euro;190 million in capital funding is being provided through the national development plan to facilitate the development of acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals, as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. The latest of these, at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, opened its doors to patients yesterday, 5 March.</P>
    <P>There are now 15 general hospital psychiatric units operational throughout the country. A further two units will become available in the near future, two more are under construction and several others are at various stages of planning. There are now approximately 400 community psychiatric residences in the country, providing over 3,000 places. This compares to 111 residences providing less than 1,000 places in 1984. As for day hospitals-day centres, there are approximately 2,000 providing over 3,500 places, compared with 39 such centres providing approximately 1,200 places in 1984.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I agree with Amnesty International's views on the importance of providing advocacy services for people suffering from mental illness. The Government made clear its support for the development of advocacy services in Ireland by its commitment, contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to assist initiatives to provide independent advocacy services for people who are involuntarily detained under the provisions of the new Mental Health Act 2001. In a concrete expression of the Government's commitment in the health strategy to develop advocacy services in mental health, &euro;251,000 was provided by my Department to health boards and voluntary agencies for this purpose in 2002. An additional &euro;50,000 has been provided for 2003.</P>
    <P>In relation to mental health services for children and adolescents, services for this age group still require substantial development. However, we have already come a long way. In 1997, there were few child and adolescent psychiatric services available outside the major cities. Now each health board has approval and funding for a minimum of three consultant led, multidisciplinary child and adolescent psychiatric teams. In 2002, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.061 million was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further &euro;1.64 million was allocated in 2003.</P>
    <P>The development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been a priority in recent years. The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services, which was presented to the Minister on 1 March 2001, contained recommendations for the development <Col N="1486" />of seven child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient units. Project teams have now been established in respect of proposed units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and one in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview.</P>
    <P>The health strategy &ldquo;Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You&rdquo;, contains a commitment to prepare a new national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services. The mental health services have not been reviewed in a systematic way for almost 20 years and the need for such a review is one of the key recommendations of the Amnesty International report. I expect work on the new policy framework to begin in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Act 2001 represented the first significant reform of mental health legislation in this country for over 50 years. Its purpose was to update legislation concerning the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment and to establish mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment provided in the mental health services would be supervised and regulated. When fully implemented, the Mental Health Act 2001 will bring Irish mental health law fully into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights and into line with best practice in the field internationally.</P>
    <P>The Act contains many positive provisions which improve the rights of patients. These provisions have been warmly welcomed by Amnesty International in its report. In the report, the organisation notes that the Act expressly provides for the right to information about the circumstances of a detention and any proposed treatments. It also provides that patients must be informed of their right to a review of their detention, their right to legal representation and to legal aid where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The main vehicle for the implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 will be the Mental Health Commission. The commission's primary function is to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. The establishment of the commission in April 2002 is also welcomed by Amnesty International in its report.</P>

      <P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately &euro;400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes the sum of &euro;29 million which was provided this year to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cancer services throughout the country have benefited from this investment which far exceeds the £25 million requirement which was initially envisaged under the national cancer strategy. This investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred. For example, the number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment has increased from 2,402 in 1994 to 3,809 in 2000. This means that an additional 1,407 patients are accessing these services, representing an increase of 58% nationally. The number of new patients receiving chemotherapy treatment has increased <Col N="1489" />from 2,693 in 1994 to 3,519 in 2000, representing an increase of 30% nationally. Similarly, breast cancer surgery has increased from 1,333 in 1997 to 1,854 in 2001. This is an increase of 39% nationally.</P>
    <P>My Department has consulted with all regional health boards and the position is that oncology patients are treated as an urgent priority and are generally operated on within two weeks. I have been informed by the ERHA that there were problems earlier in the year in the Mater Hospital with regard to the cancellation of elective admissions due to the pressure on acute beds as a result of emergency admissions and delayed discharges. These problems directly affected the availability of urology beds in the Mater Hospital for elective admissions, including cancer patients. The ERHA has confirmed that the ward in question has now reverted to use for elective patients.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that surgery for cancer patients should be delayed in this manner. Given the importance attached to this matter, the Eastern Regional Health Authority raised it yesterday with the chief executive officers of the Dublin academic teaching hospitals, including the Mater Hospital. At this meeting, the chief executive officer of the hospital concerned assured the ERHA that priority admissions such as urgent cancer cases are protected as far as possible.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I emphasise that the position is that cancer cases are protected and this is a major priority within acute hospitals throughout the country. My commitment to cancer services is reflected in the substantial additional investment in cancer services in recent years.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but it does not deal with the issue that has been raised. Just two weeks ago, a senior urologist who deals with kidney, bladder and prostrate cancers, described the crisis he is having to deal with as the worst time in his 30 years of practice. Does the Minister have any words of comfort for Mr. James Smith who made this statement? He is concerned about the fact that a number of his patients had to wait not for a couple of weeks but for months before they could access the required procedure, even though they were urgent cases. Mr. Smith has had ten or 15 urgent cases on his case list within the past two weeks.</P>
      <P>Since there is clearly a lack of beds in the acute hospital sector, is the Minister aware that nursing homes are queuing up to let us know they have empty beds which could be used to free up beds in acute hospitals in Dublin?</P>

      <P>Having contacted all the health boards, I made the point that the average waiting time for oncology patients who require surgery is two weeks. The Deputy referred to a specific specially in a Dublin hospital where there have been ongoing issues both this year and last year. It is disingenuous of the private nursing homes association and others to suggest that we have not been pumping money into the nursing home sector in the eastern region.</P>

      <P>Over &euro;50 million has been allocated through the Eastern Regional Health Authority to continuing care beds and nursing home subventions. While I do not have the exact figures with me, I provided them to the House on an earlier occasion. Between subvented and contract beds, up to 4,000 are available. The 1998 budget for nursing home subventions nationally was &euro;38 million, while by the end of 2002 it was &euro;102 million and it is expected to rise to &euro;110 million this year. It is no wonder nursing homes are queuing up to speak to the Deputy, given the premium rates that are to be obtained because of the shortage of public sector beds, of which there has been a historical underprovision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the beds that have already been subvented and contracted by the ERHA, 260 is not a huge amount. One does not always get the match between what is available and what is required but, having said that, the biggest investment project we have made is in this hospital. Admittedly, because of its location and topography it will take time for that major investment to take place. In the interim, last October I approved an additional investment of &euro;1.3 million for its accident and emergency department, a chest pain clinic and a minor injuries unit, to try to alleviate admissions and overcrowding in the accident and emergency department. I assure the Deputy that we will work with the ERHA not just to allocate more money to subventions, but also to provide funding for managing continuing care beds more effectively to get a better throughput of patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On 26 February, I met representatives of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association to discuss their concerns over the introduction of enterprise liability as the basis for funding the cost of personal injury claims against health boards, hospitals and their clinical staff. I outlined the reasons the Government had come to the conclusion that the existing arrangements for providing insurance cover to health boards and hospitals and separate indemnity cover for doctors are no longer sustainable. I explained that the Government order made on 18 February was needed to allow the State Claims Agency to manage the claims which had been reported to it since the end of June last year when the clinical indemnity scheme was put in place. I further explained that it was not feasible to exclude a specific category of medical practitioner from the provisions of the order. I made it clear that the making of the order was not intended to override the undertaking in consultants' contracts to change the existing indemnity arrangements by agreement. The making of the order did not terminate the arrangements set out in the contract and these would remain in place for the present.</P>
      <P>I emphasised the need for all parties that have an interest in this issue to engage in a short and concentrated series of discussions focused on resolving outstanding problems. This is a matter of some urgency as there is general agreement that the existing arrangements for providing indemnity cover for consultants are inherently unstable. It is not in the interests of Irish doctors or patients that they should remain in place for much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several reasons that the arrangements for the provision of insurance and indem<Col N="1492" />nity cover for health service agencies and their clinical staff needed to be replaced. First, the previous arrangements were fragmentary. Health service agencies, consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors were provided with separate insurance or indemnity cover. This led to a situation where a patient who believed that he or she had suffered personal injury as a result of medical negligence had to initiate legal proceedings against at least three parties and sometimes more than that. All these parties would appoint their own legal teams to investigate and defend the claim. This made establishing agreement on liability and apportioning damages to be paid a long, difficult and expensive process. Patients with straightforward, valid claims had to wait years in some cases, while the defendants argued over liability and damages. More problematic cases took even longer to resolve. The legal and other transaction costs were often several times greater than the damages paid to the patient. In addition, the mutual recriminations on the defence side were destructive of professional relationships in hospitals where the insurance and indemnity arrangements put colleagues in the position of blaming each other for the errors which led to the claims.</P>
    <P>The irony was that the Exchequer bore the bulk of the cost of these separate arrangements as the Department of Health and Children funded the full cost of the health agencies' insurance cover and the NCHDs' indemnity costs, and reimbursed between 80% and 90% of the cost of consultants' cover. This clearly made no sense and the Government decided in December 1999 that these arrangements should be replaced by a secure State-funded scheme based on the principle of enterprise liability as opposed to individual liability. The scheme was launched as the clinical indemnity scheme. International experience has shown that this is the only viable means of financing the cost of settling personal injury claims arising from medical malpractice. The commercial insurance industry has, to all intents and purposes, withdrawn from providing medical malpractice cover due to the enormous losses sustained from this business.</P>
    <P>Enterprise liability is the basis on which similar schemes have been established in the UK and is the basis on which public and university hospital systems in the United States provide themselves with indemnity cover.</P>
    <P>I confidently expect that in a short period of time consultants and others will come to realise that the clinical indemnity scheme is the only secure and reliable form of indemnity available to them. As the concept is more widely understood, it will be unusual to find a doctor individually named in a personal injury claim. Patients with valid claims will find them dealt with quickly. Claims that appear to be without merit will be vigorously defended by the State Claims Agency. The State has no interest in not defending claims which appear to have no merit and will not ignore the effect on the reputations <Col N="1493" />of doctors and hospitals of settling claims simply to avoid legal costs. The scheme as structured cannot and will not affect the clinical autonomy of doctors in their day-to-day work.</P>
    <P>The move to introduce enterprise liability is an initiative which will deliver clear benefits for patients, doctors, hospitals and the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the Labour Party's point of view that there should be support for an enterprise liability scheme as long as it will improve what is a very serious situation? Will the Minister also accept that he bungled the matter by signing a ministerial order without having an agreement with the hospital consultants? That decision led to severe criticism of the Minister by the consultants and it was described as a breach of contract, trust and partnership. Surely the Minister accepts that is not the way a good Minister for Health operates. Is he seriously saying that a parallel system is the way forward? If there is a disagreement between a consultant and the State Claims Agency, is it not the case that the consultant can bring in his or her legal team and, if so, surely this will add to rather than reduce costs? I ask the Minister for clarity on the way forward for the cover of private practice. What is the Government's policy on cover for private practice in which hospital consultants engage? Can he assure us that the taxpayer will get a good deal out of this, particularly in view of the fact that the Government's record on indemnity schemes has been atrocious? One need only consider the deal that was signed with the religious institutions in respect of the victims of sexual abuse and child abuse under which the taxpayer was exposed to great liability as a result of a bad deal done by Government. Can he assure us that in this instance there will be a deal that will address what we all recognise is a serious problem concerning claims for medical malpractice or negligence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's initial criticism in that the order had to be made to allow the State Claims Agency to manage the claims which have been reported to it since the end of June last year when the clinical indemnity scheme, which also applies to all the other professionals who work in hospitals, was put in place. A facility had to be provided to facilitate the State Claims Agency to discharge its duty. The mechanism being used by the State, the establishment of a single agency to deal with all claims against the State, is an efficient way of doing business and, over time, it will build up the requisite expertise to ensure best value for the taxpayer and to resolve these issues in a reasonably effective and efficient way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants' contract lays down that any changes must be by agreement. While I signed the order to facilitate the implementation of the scheme for all the claims that have come in and to facilitate the agency to manage the claims that have been reported since the end of last year, we <Col N="1494" />have agreed to enter discussions with the representative body of the consultants. There are a number of issues, one pertains to private practice and another is that of historic liabilities. I represent the taxpayer and the House in those negotiations and the interest of the taxpayer has to be uppermost in my mind and in the mind of my officials during the course of those discussions. However, we also want to achieve a resolution of this issue going forward in order that consultants can practice without the fear of major issues landing on their doorsteps in years to come. The issues are complex and, apart from the consultants, they involve other organisations, the medical defence bodies, both the MDU and MPS. There will also be further discussions with those bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my doubts about the State taking on enterprise liability. The removing of the link between the insured person and the insurance company in this case, the State, removes the drive for efficiency and performance and it will result in greater rather than fewer claims. I realise there is a balancing act as regards the multitude of people making claims and that defending claims can add to costs.</P>
      <P>What does the Minster foresee will be the impact of, say, obstetrics working exclusively in the private sector? Does he envisage that private consultants will be driven out of practice, and, if so, will the State be ready to take up the shortfall in the service? It seems that private consultants will be effectively uninsurable if they engage fully in private practice. Is that what we want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that enterprise liability, over time, will bring in better risk management processes and procedures within hospitals. The collective enterprise has to respond to claims; the enterprise liability scheme will act as a catalyst for better risk management processes across the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that about the VHI when the link was broken between the insured person and the VHI. Now the deal is between the hospital and VHI but customers are paying more and more claims are being made. That change is costing us all more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Without breaking confidence, the issue here is the capacity of any other system to cope going into the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental problem with capacity. That is what I understand from all the consultations in which I have been engaged. Obstetrics is a unique speciality with high claims against its practitioners, particularly in this country in recent times, and elsewhere across the world. We have already decided to cover private obstetricians in Mount Carmel and in the Bon Secours. We did that last year to make sure that <Col N="1495" />the number of births in the private hospitals would continue. If they were to close tomorrow morning, we would not have the capacity within the public sector to meet the demands of the annual birth rate, which in itself would cause a crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same question. We understand that the situation in regard to obstetrics is unique and a stand alone one. Is the Minster saying that the policy is to provide such cover for private practice? Will he indicate what discussions he has had with the MDU on historic claims? It made pertinent statements on its position following the changes the Minister made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had discussions with the MDU since the order was signed, but I had discussions with its representatives prior to that over a two year period. I must be mindful of its company situation and the information it has made available, but it seems it is very concerned about historical liabilities. There are issues as to whether the taxpayer should pick up the tab for historical liabilities which arose in the past for whatever reason. These are issues that are the subject matter of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>

Maybe we will have a discussion on this and I will also get the Deputy's view on it going forward. It is not policy to cover the private side as we speak. However, we did so in terms of obstetrics because a particular situation emerged in relation to it. We responded to an issue that arose in order to bring stability to the sector and to cover the consultants concerned in the obstetrics field.</P>

      <Quest>when the roll-out of the national cervical screening programme promised for 2003 will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening programme has been up and running in the Mid-Western Health Board since October 2000. Under the programme, cervical screening is offered to approximately 67,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group, free of charge, at five year intervals.</P>
      <P>Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to the full extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The process of planning and organising the national programme is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications that require careful consideration. Following discussions with my Department on the matter, the chief executive officers of the health boards, under the auspices of the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, have initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll-out of the national programme.</P>
      <P>In this context, I am advised that the board of HeBE has established a sub-group, chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer of the Western Health Board, to lead the initiative. The work being undertaken as part of the roll-out includes the planning and undertaking of an evaluation of phase one, policy development and the establishment of national governance arrangements. This work is informed by both the experiences gained from the phase one programme, the learning derived from other international programmes and current international best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the evaluation of phase one, the approach being adopted by HeBE is an integrated evaluation and planning one. This will ensure that retrospective analysis is linked closely to establishing best practice and emerging international thinking on cervical screening that will <Col N="1498" />inform the development of a high quality cervical screening model for Ireland. The evaluation dimensions will include: the overall approach to be taken by the national programme in the context of best practice elsewhere; quality assurance arrangements; standard operating procedures; governance arrangements; a women's charter; business model and organisational arrangements; programme screening policies; a population register; risk analysis and payment arrangements. Following a number of site visits and discussions with international experts, an evaluation team is being put together. It is expected that the evaluation of phase one will be completed by autumn 2003.</P>
    <P>In regard to policy development, I am advised that the sub-group established by HeBE is preparing a series of policy proposals to be adopted by the programme. These policy proposals will address a wide range of issues including: the priority target groups to be reached by the programme, the most appropriate screening intervals, laboratory accreditation, the use of liquid based cytology, information systems, HPV immunisation and the development of population registers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In summary, the evaluation of phase one is a major part of the planning process for the national programme. HeBE has advised that it expects to have a draft roll-out plan prepared by the end of the year following the evaluation. Furthermore, governance structures for the full national programme are also being considered. A final decision on structures will be taken in the context of the evaluation report and roll-out plan. The question of the appointment of a director for the national programme is being considered by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perplexed because I understood that the national cervical screening programme which was rolled out was phase one of the entire roll-out which was to be completed this year. I now hear it is a pilot programme that is to be evaluated and given serious consideration and that another review group has been established.</P>
      <P>Is this another broken promise? Can women believe the Minister is serious about rolling this out as a national programme when, in his constituency &ndash; he may not be aware of this &ndash; routine screening takes six months? It takes six months to have a test read. What plans, other than a review group, are in place to roll-out this scheme as promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Two issues are involved. One is the national screening programme and the other routine cervical smear programmes. This year and last year I provided additional funding, about &euro;2.5 million, to enhance the laboratory and colposcopy services, and a further sum of &euro;1.4 million was provided in 2003. This was to enable the employment of additional personnel, the pur<Col N="1499" />chase of new equipment and the introduction of new technology.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of the Southern Health Board waiting lists and those of other health boards, I have a list of waiting lists from the various hospitals. Some are much better than others and are a matter of weeks. The waiting lists in the Southern Health Board are too long but the board has reached an arrangement with Belfast to try to speed that up.</P>
      <P>We need to evaluate what has happened with phase one. Initial indicators suggested a poor response rate to the invitations issued under that phase. People sometimes have a simplistic view of what constitutes a screening programme. The national screening programme involves significant logistical operations. It is important we learn lessons from the operation of phase one.</P>
      <P>It must be a priority in the interim to reduce significantly those waiting lists that have arisen for routine smear tests. Between 1997 and 2001, the number of tests processed increased from about 170,000 to 213,000. The number of screenings is increasing, and the figure for 2001 represents about a 25% increase over 1997. Demand for smear tests has obviously increased and that has clearly led to longer waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to sound sarcastic, the Minister is extremely fortunate that there has been a low take-up rate. The system is unable to cope even with routine screenings. I realise these are separate from the national screening programme. However, if we do not have the capacity to deal with routine screenings, how can we possibly talk of a national screening programme?</P>
      <P>If there is to be such a programme, and I presume the Minister set out with the intention of putting one in place, then we must bear in mind the example of the position in Monaghan regarding colposcopy treatments, which relate to suspect smears, the figures for which took me some time to obtain. Does the Minister know how long it takes to get one done when a woman has already had a smear test that is suspect? For those living in Cavan and Monaghan it now takes 12 months to have the next phase done. Apart from the fact that these are life-threatening illnesses, if the Minister wants to save money in the health service and get value for money he must get his act together on screening, early detection and early treatment outside hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to make the case for protecting the lives of the women. This is a screening programme that is very effective, good value for money and literally saves lives. The Minister will surely accept that he does not have to reinvent the wheel. International practice clearly shows that it is possible to have a programme that is effective, targeted and meeting the need. The Minister should be aware there are long delays in getting test results in areas other <Col N="1500" />than the Southern Health Board area. A woman in County Donegal can wait up to six months for the results of a smear test. That is too long for anybody who has gone to the trouble of having the test done. If a woman is advised there is an issue or a doubt about the status of her health, it can take many weeks before she gets the result of a subsequent test. We must ensure we prevent the growth of cervical cancer and screening is one of the most effective tools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>While different hospitals have been mentioned, most urgent smear tests in St. Luke's Hospital are dealt with in two to three weeks. Routine smear tests can take up to 20 weeks. In St. James's Hospital, routine smear tests take seven weeks and urgent smear tests are reported in one week. In the National Maternity Hospital, it takes from one to three weeks to get results. In the Coombe Women's Hospital, routine smear tests take eight weeks and urgent smear tests take less than two weeks. In Beaumont Hospital, routine smear tests take seven to eight weeks and urgent smear tests take two weeks. In the Royal College of Surgeons, routine smear tests take nine to ten weeks and urgent smear tests take less than two weeks. In the Rotunda Hospital, routine smear tests take eight to nine weeks. At Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital it is two weeks and Sligo General Hospital&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in some of what he says. However, doctors have difficulty in trying to switch from one laboratory to another. If I am waiting six months for the results from one laboratory and I ring another one to ask it to do my smear tests, it will refuse to take on any more people. That adds to the difficulty for GPs doing smear tests. I am not referring to the cervical screening programme, but simply to routine smear tests. It is difficult to get laboratories to take on tests from other doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point. We are making interim efforts to improve the lists. For example, the Belfast City Link Laboratory and the Antrim Hospital have been contracted to provide up to 250 smears per week on behalf of the Southern Health Board to deal with its long waiting lists. We provided additional funding last <Col N="1501" />year and again this year to improve equipment at the laboratories to help get the results out. I understand the concerns of the Deputies and it will receive priority this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. Successive Governments have indicated it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention.</P>
      <P>While total expenditure on the nursing home subvention scheme was just over &euro;30 million in 1998, it will amount to almost &euro;110 million in 2003, an increase of 267%.</P>
      <P>The board of the Southern Health Board received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it could meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Southern Health Board that there are currently 518 people on a waiting list for enhanced subvention. Of these, 190 have received an enhancement and are awaiting further enhancement, 174 are in receipt of basic subvention plus an additional allocation under Article 10.6, and 154 are in receipt of basic subvention alone. There are currently 530 people in receipt of enhanced subvention and the average enhanced payment is &euro;364.34 per week. The average enhanced rate of subvention payable in the <Col N="1502" />Southern Health Board area is considerably higher than the rates payable in other health board areas. The Southern Health Board has also an over-reliance on private nursing home beds because of a shortage of public long-stay beds and I hope the PPP programme being piloted in the Cork area will address this problem.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Southern Health Board that it reviews the position regarding enhancements on a weekly basis and that it is kept under review. The board has informed my Department that it has continued to process applications for enhanced subvention since June 2002 and there is, therefore, no basis for the claim that applications are not being processed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I debated this at some length last night and the night before. Everybody is aware that subventions were never intended to carry the full cost of nursing home care, but when the scheme was introduced ten years ago, it contributed 60% of the cost. That is now down to a quarter of the cost in Dublin and about a third of the cost nationally. It is causing enormous hardship and in some cases intolerable conditions for families.</P>
      <P>The Minister says enhanced subvention is a discretionary scheme. While this is true in law, it is not being requested for the sake of avoiding hardship, it is being requested because there is no alternative. Without this subvention people would be evicted from nursing homes into the care of nobody in many cases. That cannot be allowed to persist. Is the Minister aware of how extreme the problem is, not just in the Southern Health Board area but also throughout the country? Health boards are so strapped for money that they are delaying the processing of ordinary subventions to which people are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very familiar with the need for long-stay beds and that is why there has been recognition of the need to commence some PPP programmes. I am not aware of anybody being evicted from private nursing home care because of a lack of an enhanced subvention and I would be seriously concerned if any such incidents took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the enhanced subvention and the contract arrangements currently in place. Should the Deputy be aware of anybody who is being evicted, I would be very anxious to hear about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can send the details on to the Minister personally. How can the Minister say he is very happy the existing arrangement with contract beds is still working? It is not working. Contract beds are being withdrawn from the system all the time, and that has been particularly so since last June. I never dispute that more money <Col N="1503" />is being spent, but the reality is the number of patients being catered for with either contract beds, enhanced subventions and even subventions is declining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that &euro;110 million is being spent on subvention this year. I am aware that some alignment is taking place in relation to the contractual arrangements for beds by certain health boards, which may result in the withdrawal of contractual beds in one area. However, these are then reallocated to the area in which the board is spending its money. This is particularly true of the three area boards under the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Overall, there should be more beds in the system.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of acute hospital services in the Dublin region rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The authority is supporting a wide range of developments in the hospital sector in Dublin and the eastern region. Last year I announced the implementation of the first phase of the bed capacity initiative. Under this initiative, 335 additional beds were approved for acute hospitals in the eastern region. Hospitals in the Dublin area which are benefiting under this initiative are St. James's Hospital, St Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park, incorporating St Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire Hospital, Temple Street Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny.</P>
      <P>Funding was provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to commission 229 of these beds in 2002. This is the figure the ERHA stated it could commission in a report to the Department. Additional funding has been notified to the authority for the commissioning in 2003 of the remaining beds in the region. The total additional revenue investment in the eastern region in 2003 for the provision of these additional beds is &euro;40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national development plan, the ERHA is also supporting a range of capital developments within the acute hospital sector in the Dublin region. Major capital projects under construction include: the phase 1 redevelopment of St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; phase 1H of St. James's Hospital; the re-equipping and major refurbishment at Beaumont Hospital; the provision of additional facilities at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown; the provision of new theatres at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin; the redevelopment of facilities at the Rotunda Hospital; and the major redevelopment of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. A number of additional projects are at planning stage includ<Col N="1504" />ing, for example, the new Mater Hospital-Temple Street Development.</P>
    <P>In the current year, additional revenue funding has been made available to the ERHA in the following areas: &euro;9.4 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services; &euro;9.8 million to address oncology service pressures; &euro;4.5 million to meet the cost of developing the national lung transplantation programme; &euro;13.5 million to support the continuation of the waiting list initiative; &euro;700,000 to further develop renal services in the region; and &euro;900,000 to further develop cardiac services in the eastern region.</P>
    <P>Funding has also been provided to meet the cost of recruiting additional consultants in emergency medicine and consultant anaesthetists. The application of these moneys to individual hospitals, including those in the Dublin region, is the subject of discussion between the ERHA and the individual hospitals. I am satisfied that the level of investment I have outlined represents tangible evidence of the commitment by this Government to the continuing development of hospital services in the Dublin region.</P>

      <P>The parents group of the children's hospital in Crumlin recently commissioned a report which was damning of the physical infrastructure of the hospital and makes clear that a new hospital needs to be built. How committed is the Minister to financing the rebuilding of the hospital? He indicated there would be a phased programme of investment in the hospital. Building an entire hospital on a phased basis, as the term is understood by the Department and the Minister, could take 150 years.

How is one to reconcile the investment in terms of capital funding being made by the Minister which will result in new beds with the possibility that beds currently in use will be taken out of commission in hospitals which cannot continue to provide services because of cutbacks they are being forced to make?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Olivia Mitchell's question on the hospital in Crumlin, I recently met the group to which she referred. The national development plan does not provide for the total rebuilding of the children's hospital in Crumlin. No one wants to get involved in a blame game as to the reason this occurred but, as far as I understand it, the relevant plans did not emerge in time.</P>
      <P>Up to &euro;30 million has been spent to date on the hospital in respect of new operating theatres. This was an earlier commitment which I saw through in terms of financial allocation. In addition, last year I made provision for a new MRI scanner at the hospital. We have a project team in place which is drawing up a development control plan for the hospital. We hope the brief will be ready by the end of the year, after which a design team will be appointed.</P>
      <P>Oncology and cardiology are the priorities at the Crumlin hospital and we are anxious to advance both specialties. The control team will report back on the optimal phasing in and upgrading of the hospital. I am committed to upgrading the physical environment of the hospital to the norms which should pertain to a tertiary hospital of this kind. The hospital has done great work for children through the generations. It is important to note that, notwithstanding the physical shortcomings of the building, outstanding care is being provided to children from across the country in a variety of specialties by the team operating there. I regard the physical features of the current building as unacceptable.</P>
      <P>On Deputy McManus's questions, prior to this I have never been asked to project 12 months ahead to determine the extent of deficits. This has never been done before and will not be done now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. I also thank the Minister for coming to the House at this late hour to respond to my comments. The withdrawal of &euro;45 million in subsidy to the meat and bonemeal sector has caused chaos. From talking with members of farm organisations and people working in the industry, I understand that not only will there be chaos next week when the measure takes effect, but there will be a complete closedown. Committed winter beef producers are in a serious crisis.</P>
      <P>I have a dairy farm with 90 to 100 dairy cows, for which I receive a premium for less than 50. I question whether I should be treated as one of the small farmers who do not have to pay a penalty for overstocking. That is another issue but I want to make clear that I come from that background.</P>
      <P>A total closedown is on the cards and that will do great damage to the industry &ndash; farmers, workers and the nation. Urgent steps were taken by everybody during the foot and mouth disease crisis. This situation is as serious and deserves similar urgent action.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister held meetings with farmers and the industry? Has the Taoiseach been fully informed of the total chaos and the cost involved? This is a Government decision, not a Brussels one. Europe will allow subvention to the end of this year but the Government has not taken steps to allow for the disposal of offal at the lowest possible cost. It is passing on a very expensive means of disposal to the industry.</P>
      <P>The Department, the industry and farmers must work together to minimise the cost. In the meantime, the Government must not opt out of its responsibilities. A total of &euro;30 million would make a major difference in that regard. A quick decision could be made by the Government on one aeroplane costing &euro;50 million.</P>
      <P>Two or three major meat factory owners have their own rendering facilities, leaving smaller plants totally isolated and vulnerable. I understand some of these plants had to close down for a few days. If this cost is passed on to farmers, the cost per animal will be from &euro;13 to &euro;16, &euro;2 per pig and 10 cent per chicken. I make no apology for reminding the Minister that two thirds of our poultry is produced in my constituency. Beef prices currently range between 80 to 81 cent per pound for &ldquo;Os&rdquo; and 85 cent for &ldquo;Rs&rdquo;. Two weeks ago, the flat price was 90 cent.</P>
      <P>This is the worst crisis in memory, as pointed out to me by somebody who has attended farm organisation meetings for the past 40 years. There were cuts of 9% in agriculture in the budget and if the other cuts of 3% are taken into account, that is a 12% cut. There was a further &euro;10 million cut in disease levies and now a &euro;45 million cut in meat and bonemeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" />The Government has lost the support of the agriculture industry, especially young farmers. There was a headline in today's <i>Irish Farmers Journal, </i>&ldquo;Coalition Policies Rejected by 84% of Farmers&rdquo;, and a headline in another article read, &ldquo;McCreevy Denies &euro;300 million Offer&rdquo;. The Minister told my colleague, Deputy Timmins, that an extra &euro;300 million had been offered but he has already taken &euro;300 million out of the pockets of farmers, as has been put to me by an independent source. The figure for this year alone is &euro;316.5 million as a result of the budget cuts and the other decisions the Minister has made. We are in an absolute crisis.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks in terms of individual farmers are very serious. The cost of killing an animal now is approximately &euro;80 per beast. Since the Government was re-elected there have been increases in levies and charges of &euro;15.56, not to mention insurance costs. If a farmer has an animal over 13 months, he incurs an additional cost of &euro;26. If he is a full-time beef farmer with over 50 livestock units, he is subject to a penalty of &euro;45. That is the reason I made my personal comment at the start of my contribution. The total increase in levies and charges amounts to &euro;80.56. How can an ordinary farmer take a cut of &euro;10,000? The Minister argued during the &ldquo;tractorcade&rdquo; discussions that they had an income of &euro;45,000 but he knows in his heart that it is &euro;15,000, and these cuts represent a total loss of &euro;10,000. Does the Minister believe any family could live on &euro;5,000 per year?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister accept he is looking at the demise of many genuine, committed livestock producers who provide winter animals for the industry, which allows the industry to serve the market 52 weeks of the year? I ask the Minister to come up with a substantial package to save this industry. He did that during the foot and mouth disease crisis and got credit from everybody. The crisis now is equally as bad and he must step in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a good source of protein, meat and bonemeal was historically used as an ingredient in animal feed and Ireland exported 90% of output for use in animal feed. New European Union wide measures designed to control the spread of BSE were introduced in December 2000 following outbreaks of BSE in other member states and included a ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to farmed animals. That ban remains in place.</P>
      <P>As a result of the ban, feed grade meat and bonemeal which had been a commercial product became a waste material with a significant disposal cost. In addition, unlike most other member states, Ireland has no approved disposal facilities, for example, incineration or landfill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 2001, to address the emergency faced by the meat sector, my Department introduced a subsidy towards the cost of rendering offal into meat and bonemeal and its subsequent storage and disposal. This was introduced as a short-term measure to allow time for the industry <Col N="1509" />to adjust to the changed legislative situation. It was not the intention that the subsidy would be paid indefinitely and the policy of the Government has been to gradually return financial responsibility for disposing of offal to the industry.</P>
    <P>In 2001, Exchequer financial support for the production of meat and bonemeal was &euro;66 million, including &euro;11 million for disposal of 36,000 tonnes. Expenditure in 2002 was significantly lower, at &euro;44 million, due to reductions in the level of subsidy for rendering and lower disposal costs. A provision of &euro;28 million was made to fund the rendering subsidy this year. This amount has been used to fund carryover payments from 2002 and the rendering subsidy up to 28 February of this year. There are now 170,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal in stores throughout the country paid for by my Department and costing approximately &euro;3 million per annum in storage costs. At current prices and disposal arrangements, this will cost in the region of an additional &euro;30 million to dispose of. The overall expenditure on supporting the production of meat and bonemeal since the introduction of the ban has been &euro;138 million.</P>
    <P>The figures I have outlined do not include the cost of other support schemes which involve rendering costs. For example, there was significant expenditure in excess of &euro;400 million on the purchase for destruction and special purchase schemes introduced to support the beef market in 2001 and 2002. There have been other substantial payments to the rendering industry for the rendering of BSE depopulated herds and for fallen animals.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the rendering subsidy it has been the policy of my Department to gradually reduce the Exchequer contribution and to fully disengage from payments to the rendering sector. From December of 2002 the Department's contribution to the rendering industry was fixed at &euro;410 per tonne for a three month period up to the end of February. That is for a package deal including collection, rendering and disposal.</P>
    <P>The Government has been generous and an editorial in <i>The Irish Times </i>two days ago alluded to the fact that the generous support to the livestock sector from public funding of &euro;600 million was paid out without difficulty at a time of crisis in 2001 and 2002. We cannot continue that level of support indefinitely but we are continuing support for the storage and the rendering of depopulated herds and fallen animals.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the subsidy, the costs associated with disposal have been reduced. The industry has also had the time to arrange outlets for the disposal of meat and bonemeal. It has been a matter of public record since early February that the subsidy would be withdrawn from the end of that month. I am of the view that in the absence of the Government subsidy the industry will achieve greater efficiencies than at present. There are already indications that lower cost disposal options are being actively explored and <Col N="1510" />there is evidence of greater competition in the sector. I expect in those circumstances that rendering and disposal costs can be reduced within the industry as greater efficiencies are achieved. In such circumstances I am not prepared to speculate as to what level of additional costs will fall on farmers. There is, however, every incentive for all the stakeholders in the industry to work towards the achievement of lower offal disposal costs.</P>
    <P>My information is that the rendering industry is operating and dealing with all available material from the meat sector. There have been some teething problems, as can be expected when State subsidies are withdrawn and costs have to be absorbed elsewhere. I expect that any difficulties that arise can be resolved by close co-operation between all the stakeholders in the livestock sector especially meat processors, the rendering industry and farmers. I assure the House that my Department will continue to fully implement all regulatory controls relating to the processing of animal by-products and the transport, storage and disposal of meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the absence of domestic disposal facilities for meat and bonemeal has the consequential financial burden of disposal abroad. Every effort should be made to make use of meat and bonemeal in a way that extracts maximum value from it. It can be done in other EU member states either in energy production or in industrial use thereby reducing disposal costs. That would be of benefit to the economy generally in terms of reducing the use of fossil fuels and would also be of benefit to the agriculture sector. Any disposal facilities would of course have to comply with the environmental and planning requirements of the relevant authorities.</P>

      <P>I seek clarity regarding the definition of an eligible person for affordable housing under Part VI of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 and Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and to identify problems with its operation for first time buyers. I hope the Minister will come forward with solutions for the categories of people involved after the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income limit for local authority loans is &euro;80,000 for two earners and &euro;32,000 where there is a single applicant, with a maximum loan of &euro;130,000. Apart from the fact that the income <Col N="1511" />limits and maximum loans need to be revised upwards to take account of the huge increase in new house prices in recent years and the modest wage increases arising from national wage agreements, there are particular problems relating to certain applicants who are eligible for affordable housing under the Part V scheme.</P>
    <P>This relates to applicants who exceed the limits of &euro;32,000 and &euro;80,000 and who are unable to secure a loan from a financial institution. The Minister of State will be aware that the Act states &ldquo;affordable housing may be sold or leased to an eligible person&rdquo; and goes on to define an eligible person as:</P>
    <P>one who is in need of accommodation and whose income would not be adequate to meet the payments of a mortgage for the purchase of a house because the payments calculated over the course of a year would exceed 35% of a person's annual income (net).</P>
    <P>We now have the untenable situation whereby a person who is eligible for Part V affordable housing under legislation passed by the Oireachtas is unable to secure a loan from the local authority because they are over the income limit. At the same time they are unable to get a sufficient loan from a financial institution to purchase a starter home on the open or private market. This needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am informed that it was envisaged that the Part V process would be financed through the commercial lending institutions. However, they are not prepared to become involved with this particular scheme because of the clawback provisions. I favour that provision. What is the Minister of State's view?</P>
    <P>Affordable housing under the Part V process is now becoming available in the Fingal County Council area and I commend the management of the council for the way it has dealt with this matter. This will be of great benefit to many first time buyers who have aspired to a home of their own for many years. I am aware of applicants who have been waiting up to four years with the council for these houses and who have now been informed that they have been taken off the list because they are over the income limit and thus cannot be provided with a loan.</P>
    <P>I will quote some examples from constituents' letters:</P>
    <P>I am currently just under the &euro;32,000 limit set by the Department of the Environment to assess eligibility for the affordable housing scheme. However, given inflation is running close to 5% per annum, I imagine I will not meet the income criteria when it is renewed in October 2003.</P>
    <P>Others say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wish to confirm I am just within the salary criteria since October 2002. My salary is &euro;31,750. When it is renewed I will be over the limit.&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have been approved for the afford<Col N="1512" />able housing scheme for the past two years. My application is due for renewal in the next few weeks. At the moment I do not exceed the &euro;32,000 but I am fairly close. When this happens I will not be approved for the scheme by Fingal County Council.&rdquo;; &ldquo;I applied to Fingal County Council in 2001. I was promoted in work in the ESB and have just gone over the limit and will be taken off the list.&rdquo;; &ldquo;In 2003 I will apply to Fingal County Council for the third year running. I am on the housing list. This year I may find I am slightly over the &euro;32,000 income and therefore will not be eligible. &ldquo;; &ldquo;I wish to confirm I will be borderline on the income limit of &euro;32,000.&rdquo;; &ldquo;I may have a problem.&rdquo;; &ldquo;Our situation is that we are just over the income limit for shared ownership but can only qualify for a mortgage of &euro;145,000 from a building society. What can I do?&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have now been taken off the list for affordable housing from the council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are quotes from people who were on the housing list and qualified for affordable housing. There is an anomaly here which must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for this opportunity to clarify the question of eligibility criteria for affordable houses provided under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2002.</P>
      <P>Part V and the arrangements directly associated with it are focused on producing a supply of affordable houses. These provisions allow local authorities to ensure the availability of houses at a price below that of the open market. The benefits of this price-discounted housing are then to be allocated to persons in need of accommodation. This must be done in accordance with a scheme of allocation priorities, adopted as a reserved function by the elected members of a local authority.</P>
      <P>Schemes of allocation priorities must be based on the criterion that eligible persons would otherwise have to spend more than 35% of their net income on meeting mortgage repayments for a comparator market value house but these schemes are not required to, and do not, specify any qualified income limit for eligible persons, nor any maximum on the loan to be drawn down.</P>
      <P>The loan limit of &euro;130,000 referred to by the Deputy is not directly related to access to Part V housing but to the maximum loan permitted to be made available by local authorities to persons who are unable to obtain mortgage finance from the private sector. It may frequently be the case that persons availing of local authority housing loans will be eligible for affordable housing provided under a Part V agreement but Part V affordable houses will not be restricted to these applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that Part V criteria derive not from circulars issued by my Department but directly from legislation enacted by the Oireachtas in <Col N="1513" />2000 and at the end of 2002. Clawback provisions have long been a feature of tenant purchase and affordable housing schemes and they will now, appropriately, apply also to houses provided under Part V. The requirement for clawback is to ensure that the various schemes produce a real benefit in terms of accommodating eligible persons with housing needs and that this objective is not threatened by short-term speculative interests.</P>
    <P>Normally, if a house is resold before the expiration of 20 years from the date of the purchase, the person selling the property must pay to the housing authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale. This percentage is equal to the percentage discount allowed by the local authority on the original sale of the house where the house is resold within the first ten years. The amount payable is reduced by 10% in respect of each complete year after the tenth year during which the person who purchased the property has been in occupation of the house as his or her normal place of residence.</P>
    <P>The private lending institutions have accommodated themselves in the past to clawback provisions of this kind. On the new Part V arrangements, my Department is currently in discussions with representatives of the private sector lending agencies with a view to resolving any concerns that they might have regarding the clawback.</P>
    <P>I am confident that with the addition of Part V and the further development of affordable housing initiatives a wide range of options is being provided to those in housing need and that these will permit a major and desirable expansion of affordable housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue which has somehow escaped scrutiny in the House. On 8 February 2001, the Taoiseach announced with great fanfare the RAPID programme, revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, to transfer resources to and develop &ldquo;the 25 most deprived urban neighbourhoods in the State for special treatment, involving the front-loading of State investment for facilities and services to bring about a major improvement in the living standards of the residents in these areas over the next three years.&rdquo;. The impression created was that there were virtually unlimited resources to underpin the programme &ndash;&euro;2 billion nationally was mooted &ndash; in the context of &ldquo;the national development plan which will provide &euro;15 billion to address social inclusion measures.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told the press conference that &ldquo;there is commitment at the highest level to see the situation of deprived areas turned around.&rdquo;  The then Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, outlined that the RAPID programme would operate to deliver effectively to the target areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up and down the country the deliberately <Col N="1514" />chosen acronym RAPID was touted before the election as Fianna Fáil's commitment to the poor. It added another 20 areas so that now 45 areas would be transformed. Co-ordinators were established, committees set up, conferences convened, area implementation teams created and endless consultation embarked upon. The simple message was to come up with a good plan and money would be no object.</P>
    <P>The local communities took the local Fianna Fáil candidates at their word. They set about their work and after much effort submitted their plans, but what has happened? Not one euro has been dispensed under RAPID. The Government is now furiously relabelling community projects that were on stream and are redesignating them RAPID. It is a cruel con-trick by Fianna Fáil perpetrated against the most disadvantaged communities in the State.</P>
    <P>On 11 February I could not believe my ears when in Fettercairn in Tallaght I heard the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, at a meeting of project promoters under RAPID, effectively disown the programme. He told a dumbfounded audience that there is no money available to support the project. The Minister gave the vague impression that he had inherited this mess and that someone else was responsible for misleading people, that he was sorry but he was actually contemplating pulling the plug on the whole sorry saga. I have never seen anything like it. It was a performance that merited the all-time brass neck award for a Fianna Fáil Minister, and that is some accolade. This was the meanest of all the cuts as Fianna Fáil, safely re-elected, abandoned the poor.</P>
    <P>All these projects are still out there, all this work has been put into them, but now the Government says it does not know where the money will come from. This is exactly what it has done in the new partnership deal. The community and voluntary sector has condemned the new partnership deal because there are no measures for social inclusion that were not already in the Government programme. Outstanding commitments under the PPF, such as those in respect of child benefit, have not been honoured. There are no additional resources for the national anti-poverty strategy. The new deal is substantially different because there are no specifics on social inclusion that were not already in the Government programme and no additional funding. The Taoiseach has told the community and voluntary sector, however, that if it walks away it will lose its access to senior civil servants and Government.</P>
    <P>This stands out from all the broken promises made with such abandon in May &ndash; this promise to the most deprived areas in the State, areas calculatedly chosen by Fianna Fáil&mdash;</P>

Round three of RAPID will see rural areas being told that although they have spent thousands of euro and hundreds of hours preparing a programme, they must wait in the hope that economic prosperity might return. The last answer I got from the Minister on this question was that the 45 areas selected have been consistently targeted as areas of special need through various Government interventions over the past few years. Anybody living in those areas will not have noticed because they have not been getting anything more than the normal, very poor service. The areas I mentioned in my question have been deprived and neglected, with the highest unemployment figures, the greatest lack of skills and educational attainment and the greatest concentration of social problems. A glance at the list of areas will confirm that they correspond directly to those with the highest drug abuse and drug-related fatalities and the greatest need for programmes aimed at restoring some form of normality to those societies. They are also the areas of poorest service provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was one of the issues which RAPID was supposed to address, with all services combined in one-stop shops and delivered promptly. <Col N="1516" />However, that has not happened. On the contrary, everything seems to have been slowed down under RAPID, which focused community activists over a two year period on producing plans despite the fact that most of those plans were already available. In effect, they were re-inventing the wheel but they had no choice in the matter. A great pot of gold was dangled in front of them, subject to certain actions on their part. Those actions have been completed but the money has not been delivered and there is no indication that it will be.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and his colleague, an t-Aire Fiontar, Trádála agus Fostaíochta, should focus on the need for a co-ordinated action programme and perhaps transfer community employment schemes, jobs initiatives and the social economy into the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The vital community service projects for those disadvantaged areas are not being delivered by the Minister's colleague. In fact, she has eliminated those jobs and devastated entire communities which were dependent on funding from FÁS via her Department under the scheme which has now been abolished. The programmes which people had hoped to build in RAPID would depend on community employment schemes or something similar. That is no longer available. Community workers are tired and dispirited because they have been let down on this and every other occasion when they tried to put together a plan to resurrect communities and restore hope, self-confidence and self-esteem to those areas.</P>
    <P>The money which was supposed to be provided has disappeared. If the Minister could now give a commitment that, within a month or two, he would direct that the money be front-loaded as quickly as possible, this debate would have achieved a great deal. However, I am not hopeful in that regard. Maybe there is need for a review but that should not have brought RAPID to a halt. Even though it has not even got off the ground yet, we hear of a review and evaluation.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an Rialtas, an t-Aire agus a chomhghleacaí an t-Aire Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta, geallúint a thabhairt go mbeidh an t-airgead seo ar fáil agus go dtarlóidh rudaí maidir le RAPID, RAPID 2 agus CLÁR i bhfad níos tapúla. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil difríochtaí móra idir CLÁR agus RAPID agus is maith na difríochtaí sin. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an t-Aire in ann na tharrthála atá i gCLÁR a chur i bhfeidhm ar RAPID i gceann bliana nó dhó amach anseo ach ba chóir dó RAPID a thosnú i gceart ar an gcéad dul síos.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an mbeirt Teachta as ucht na ceiste seo a ardú tráthnóna agus deis a thabhairt dom léargas a fháil ar mo thuairimíocht faoin gclár seo. I thank both Deputies for raising the issue. I have the usual ministerial script but before, or perhaps instead of, reading it, I wish to <Col N="1517" />outline my thinking on this matter. First, I should point out that there are three strands to RAPID, namely RAPID 1, RAPID 2 and CLÁR. The process being followed in RAPID 1 and 2 is very much that agreed with the social partners during the partnership talks. That process was put together by Government and the social partners because they each thought it was the way to proceed. However, when I became Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food and was told I was to start the rural RAPID programme, I saw it as a cumbersome way of doing the job. I had long and rather difficult meetings with the social partners because I believed that if we followed the route of RAPID 1, we would, as the Deputy has rightly pointed out, simply end up with a lot of plans. There was a fundamental difficulty in getting all the agencies to re-prioritise. In all honesty, this problem should never have arisen in the first place, as Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not have arisen in the first place because when Deputy Rabbitte was in Government he should have front-loaded all the money into those areas. However, as in previous Governments, he did not succeed.</P>

      <P>If I may continue, CLÁR approached the situation in a totally different way. CLÁR is part of the RAPID programme but its approach was not that of the social partners. However, it is fair comment that most politicians and people on the ground in the CLÁR areas see huge merit in CLÁR as a programme that has made a difference and a methodology which is effective. It is a measure of its success that it is the one programme for which I was under continuous pressure to have the boundaries extended. People will only make such demands if they consider a scheme beneficial on the ground. That pressure came from public representatives, particularly on the Opposition side, as well as from the people at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of the RAPID programme was to re-prioritise towards the RAPID areas part of the &euro;48 billion which is being spent and will be spent under the national development plan. Including stage 1 and stage 2, there are 45 such areas. The implementation process was that the co-ordinating role was given to my Department, supported <Col N="1518" />by Area Development Management Ltd, generally known as ADM. ADM was to co-ordinate the efforts of each Department which, individually, was to re-prioritise in favour of RAPID areas. Deputy Rabbitte may say I am brass-necked. If it is being brass-necked to have the honesty to say at a meeting in Tallaght that a major development was going to happen anyhow rather than staking a political claim on a pretext of prioritisation, then I will continue being brass-necked. However, I prefer to regard that as integrity in not claiming credit for huge developments in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain my position to the Deputy. I will repeat what I said in Tallaght. Having gone around to RAPID areas, I got a feeling from the people on the ground &ndash; the only people that matter to me &ndash; that they were not happy with its performance. That was before I came to a meeting in Blanchardstown. People involved in RAPID in Blanchardstown said it was the greatest thing since the sliced pan. I was obviously interested to find out why it was working in Blanchardstown, where some very big things have happened, and not in other areas.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the area action plans were drawn up. If there is a fault with them, it is that there were no guidelines. It was literally a case of any idea that came to mind. This has been a recent trend. The problem with that is that a huge number of actions are outlined. To give the Deputies a sense of the scale of the proposals involved, 1,000 different actions were proposed within the RAPID plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to carry out a review, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh said. What I am trying to do is find a methodology which would bring success. Since the meeting in Tallaght, at which both Deputy Rabbitte and I were present, I decided that what we should do is look at the various elements of the plan. Some of them are much more appropriate to be dealt with at the new level which we have created at local authority level, that is, the county development board level, because it deals with elements within its ambit. Many of the elements had nothing to do with the national development plan, but I will not throw them out of the RAPID programme because there are issues of local importance, for example, cleaning the graffiti off walls and re-allocating community gardaí. These are not <i>per se</i> national development plan issues but they are important to the communities. What I am doing is setting up a mechanism so that those issues can be dealt with locally and we can concentrate at Government and <Col N="1519" />Department level on the larger issues where decisions must be made.</P>
    <P>I will assure Deputies that, just as in the case of CLÁR which I set up, I am deadly serious about getting results and the measure of results for me will be what people in the areas targeted say as to whether it has made a difference, not what the co-ordinators or anybody else says. I will give this my best shot. Although some movement has been evident on some aspects since the meeting in Tallaght, I would not continue with it if it was not going to deliver over the period of the Government for the people of these areas.</P>
    <P>As regards my Department, there are a number of funds which we control and where we can achieve re-prioritisation because it is within our ambit. These include the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, and the community development programme, CDP, and funding for local drugs task force, LDTF, projects.</P>
    <P>In the case of the YPFSF, the national assessment committee, NAC, of the fund, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups under round two of the fund. With regard to services projects, the committee is awaiting completion of the external evaluation of the fund before seeking such proposals under round two. The first draft of the evaluator's report was received in mid-January 2003 and is being examined by the NAC at present. Proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round two and in light of the overall funding position for 2003. I assure the Deputies that in any funds under my Department, proposals from RAPID areas will be given the priority they deserve and we in my Department will lead by example in this regard.</P>
    <P>Similarly, with the community development support programme, there was no additional funding this year. However, in a large number of cases pre-development work has been under way. The full establishment of groups under community development projects in 2003 is subject to available resources, but again I want to make it absolutely clear that the RAPID areas will get priority in bringing forward these community development support projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" />In addition, a number of proposals from RAPID plans are being pursued through the LDTFs. In this case the position is simpler because many of the LDTF areas are nearly coterminous with the RAPID areas and therefore by definition they would be targeted. Again I will not claim that LDTF money is going to RAPID areas because the Deputies could take it, by definition, that is what would have happened anyway.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that this Department was founded in a situation where there were a lot of groups operating in the community sector. A huge number of them are doing incredible work on the ground, but there was a great disparity of methods applied. There were partnerships working in one direction and CDSPs in another. CDSPs received money directly from the Department and via ADM on a partnership basis. This has been a wasteful way of doing business. When I came into the Department it was the equivalent of having electricity cables going all over the place, with half of the power being lost in the transmission and not too much of the electricity getting to the end user. When I talk about rationalisation, I am talking about using the money we have in such a way that less of it is lost in bureaucracy and more on services for those in the target areas who need it.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies &ndash; I note one of them has left, obviously interested not in the answer but just in hearing himself &ndash; that I am absolutely committed to making this programme work, from the very small actions which are so important to people in communities to the larger actions. I will measure success by the visible difference seen by those living in those communities.</P>
    <P>I believe I was right to see weaknesses in the processes followed to date and, rather than pretend that everything was rosy in the garden, to say so. At the beginning of the process the Government and the social partners probably did not realise difficulties would arise in getting re-prioritisation. Learning from my experience in CLÁR, I set about making this programme work. If admitting faults and doing something about them is wrong in politics, then we have a very funny view of politics.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to comments made by a person (details supplied) that a dramatic increase in the numbers of people presenting with sexually transmitted infections has plunged the service into crisis; the additional resources being provided for this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent statistics on sexually transmitted infections in Ireland are those published by the National Disease Surveillance Centre for the first two quarters of 2001. These show that a total of 4,817 cases of STIs were notified in Ireland in the first six months of 2001. This compares with a total of 4,368 notifications in the first six months of 2000 and represents an increase of 10% in STI notifications.</P>
      <P>With regard to HIV-AIDS the most recent available statistics published by the NDSC refers to the period from January to June 2002. These indicate that a total of 157 new cases of HIV were diagnosed in Ireland in the first six months of 2002.</P>
      <P>Clearly these increases are a cause of concern. While some of the increase in STIs may be due to an increased public and professional awareness, improved acceptability of STI clinics and the availability of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques, and the increases in HIV partly reflect migration patterns, these figures undoubtedly also suggest an increase in unsafe sexual practices.</P>
      <P>The national AIDS strategy committee is charged with overseeing the recommendations made in AIDS Strategy 2000 which relate to dealing with HIV-AIDS and other STIs within the overall context of sexual health.</P>
      <P>The care and management sub-committee of NASC is currently visiting the hospitals and health boards involved in the provision of services to people with HIV-AIDS and STIs. The purpose of these visits is to see at first hand the facilities available and to identify gaps in service provision. The sub-committee is expected to report to NASC on its findings later this year.</P>
      <P>Education is an important aspect in raising awareness of the dangers of engaging in risky sexual behaviour which could result in a sexually transmitted infection. Health boards undertake information and awareness activities at regional level and amongst the issues addressed is the prevention of sexually transmitted infection. Where appropriate the health boards work in conjunction with and fund voluntary organisations in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" />In addition the health promotion unit of my Department is involved in and supports a range of initiatives aimed at preventing and raising awareness of HIV-AIDS and other STIs. These initiatives include a national public awareness advertising campaign to promote sexual health which is aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 age group. In addition the health promotion unit produces a range of awareness raising leaflets on STIs and safe sex practices. These are available through health promotion departments in each health board area.</P>
    <P>More than &euro;4 million additional funding has been provided to health boards since 1997 to address the problems of HIV-AIDS and other STIs. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the facilities in place. At present there are six consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV-AIDS and STIs &ndash; five of these are in Dublin, one of whom deals with children, and one in Cork. Funding has also been provided to the Western Health Board for the appointment of a new infectious diseases consultant. My Department will continue to closely monitor the position in relation to the treatment facilities in place, especially in view of the increased demand for these services.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services, including respite care, to people with physical and-or sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Significant levels of additional funding have been provided since 1997 for the maintenance and development of health related services for people with intellectual, physical or sensory disability, those with autism and older people. This additional funding has enabled substantial advances to be made in terms of the quality and quantity of health related services to these care groups. For example, in terms of services for people with intellectual disabilities and those with autism around 465 additional dedicated respite places were provided between 1999 and 2002.</P>
      <P>With specific regard to the services that are available for people with physical and sensory disabilities, additional revenue and capital funding of approximately &euro;195 million has been provided to the ERHA and the health boards for the maintenance and development of health related services, including respite care. An additional 95 respite places were created specifically for this care group between 1997 and 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that funding and places are required. It is my intention that as funding becomes available further resources will be allo<Col N="1523" />cated for the continued development of services for these care groups. Specifically relating to people with physical and sensory disabilities, future resource allocation will be guided by the information available from the national physical and sensory disability database. It will provide an accurate picture of the health service requirements in that sector.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003. My Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</P>

    <P>The overall outturn of 0.38% variation reflects a very favourable result given the ever increasing demands on the system. The 1996 accountability legislation provides for a first charge reflecting excess expenditure to be set off against the following year's, budget as a disciplinary measure so that health agencies plan their service delivery within approved expenditure limits. The result is particularly good when one considers that health inflation is such a significant element in the day-to-day cost of providing services. It is generally understood that health inflation is running at about twice that of ordinary inflation. Ordinary inflation, as reported through the consumer price index, was in the region of 5% throughout 2002.</P>
    <P>In 2002 health boards-authority provided a 4.8% productivity increase in acute hospital services which accounts for about 50% of budget. The estimated number of patients discharged as in-patients or day cases in 2002 is estimated at about 963,000. This is a record level of productivity and continues a trend of increasing and record activity levels in our acute hospitals.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends taking up the offer of the private clinic in Galway to provide breast screening services by the year end; and the reason such a service should be provided privately within ten months and the national BreastCheck service could not provide it for another 22 months, even assuming funding was available.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has consulted in relation to the offer by a private clinic referred to by the Deputy. BreastCheck's position is that involvement of the clinic in the provision of breast screening services is not practicable for a number of reasons: the availability of a single mammogram machine at the private clinic provides no basis for the provision of a population based programme; and the facility that the private clinic has available is digital mammography. BreastCheck does not currently use digital mammography as it regards it to be, as yet, unproven technology in the context of population based screening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000 with its first phase covering the ERHA, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The <Col N="1525" />target population consists of approximately 140,000 women and represents about 50% of the national target population. By end December 2002, 110,636 women had been called for screening and 83,000 women had been screened. This represents an uptake of 75%.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck. As evidence of that commitment I recently announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. Approximately 19,000 women in the 50-64 age bracket in Counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Approximately 9,500 per annum will be invited once the programme is fully operational in these counties. It is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually.</P>
    <P>In relation to the further expansion of the programme, BreastCheck's board has submitted a business plan to my Department. A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll-out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will meet BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.</P>
    <P>Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in boosting employment levels of qualified social workers in the health services over recent years. This is borne out both by the NSWQB survey, referred to by the Deputy, and the results of the annual health service census. This indicates that the number of social workers employed in the health services rose by 35%, +437, in whole-time equivalent terms over the two years to end 2001, with total employment rising to 1,682 WTEs over that period. These substantial increases highlight the increased attractiveness of employment in the health services for social workers, reflecting the impact of pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional development.</P>
      <P>While health agencies continue to experience difficulties in the recruitment and retention of social workers in certain areas, the Deputy may wish to note that intensive efforts have been undertaken in the health service to improve staffing levels in social work, both at local and at national level. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has, over recent years, made an important contribution to meeting human resource needs. The number of non-national social work qualifications accredited by the NSWQB has increased significantly in recent years. Between 1996 and 2000, 330 holders of non-national qualifications were accredited by the NSWQB to work as social workers in Ireland. In 2001 the board approved 149 holders of non-national social work qualifications and a further 302 accreditations were completed in 2002. Also in 2002, 32 persons with non-national qualifications were offered a period of adaptation or an aptitude test to ensure their qualification level matched the standard required to practice in Ireland. The introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, including social workers, has also facilitated the recruitment of qualified social workers from overseas.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional training places is a central element of the strategy to meet the human resource requirements of the health services in social work. A further 54 social work training places were provided in 2002 bringing the total number of training places to 192 compared to 138 in 2001. This represents an increase of +85 training places, 80%, over the level of training provision in 2000. It is envisaged that an additional 28 training places will be provided in 2003. This very significant expansion in training places will play a major role in ensuring that there is sufficient supply of qualified social workers available for employment in the health services in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the significant progress achieved in the provision of additional training places a further priority is to attract and retain social workers to work within the health services. In this context a number of initiatives specifically designed to improve recruitment and retention of <Col N="1527" />social work professionals are currently under way. A national social work forum has been established to progress a number of key issues for the social work profession, arising from the recommendations included in the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000. Major developments designed to improve job satisfaction and career and professional development for social workers include the creation of a new grade of senior social work practitioner and the upgrading of single handed and certain specialised posts. A further significant initiative is the undertaking, under the aegis of the NSWF, of a social work workload management study designed to facilitate the best use of social work time and human resources. All of these developments, along with the implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body applying to social work grades, will make an important contribution to strengthening the capacity of the health services to recruit and then retain the high calibre social work professionals required to fill the challenging and demanding roles required for the delivery of quality social work services to the public.</P>

      <P>The ERHA and each health board have a major emergency plan which is based on a framework approved by Government in 1984 for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies. These plans are updated on a regular basis and both the authority and the boards have a significant response capacity in place for dealing with the effects of biological agents.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 in the USA I established an expert committee under the chairmanship of Professor William Hall, director of the virus reference laboratory, to develop a contingency plan which would be implemented in the unlikely event of a biological attack here. In preparing the plan it was necessary for the committee to identify the level of risk of such an attack. It considered that the secondary consequences of an attack in another country was the most likely threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed protocol in relation to category A agents, including smallpox, botulism, plague and tularaemia, entitled Biological Threats &ndash; A Health Response for Ireland was issued in May <Col N="1528" />2002 to all health board chief executive officers and directors of public health for circulation to all relevant personnel. The chief executive officers were requested to circulate the document to appropriate medical personnel and to ensure that each board's emergency plan was reviewed and updated to take account of the protocol. It is available on my Department's website: www.doh.ie/pdfdocs/biothreat.pdf.</P>
    <P>The national disease surveillance centre issued a document entitled Biological Threat Agents. It was aimed at informing all medical staff, particularly GPs, in order to assist in the diagnosis of anthrax, plague, botulism and smallpox. This document was agreed by the expert committee and was circulated in May 2002.</P>
    <P>It was agreed by the expert committee that a sub-group, representative of health boards, consultants in emergency medicine and infectious diseases, public health doctors as well as the NDSC, was required to examine operational issues arising from the document Biological Threats &ndash; A Health Response for Ireland. This sub-group was established in October 2002. It was requested to examine several key issues including the designation of hospitals for treatment of smallpox cases and development of protocols in relation to transport of patients and samples. It submitted a number of reports to the expert committee for consideration.</P>
    <P>Based on the recommendations of the expert committee, I approved the purchase of specific antibiotics and vaccines which would be required in the event of a biological attack with specific class A agents. The following quantities were secured: 2.4 million doses of ciprofloxacin, oral, and 16,000 doses of ciprofloxacin i/v, for the treatment of anthrax; and 600,000 doses of smallpox vaccine for use in the event of a confirmed case of the disease. This vaccine can be diluted by a factor of five or six.</P>
    <P>These products will compliment the existing stocks of medical products for the treatment of these diseases. There is a considerable quantity of antibiotics and other therapeutic substances already available in hospitals which could be used against a range of biological agents in the event of an attack.</P>
    <P>A high level containment facility has recently been constructed at the virus reference laboratory. The facility is designed to a BL3+ standard to allow for containment of a range of infectious agents including smallpox and to ensure increased safety.</P>
    <P>Ireland's strategy on the control of smallpox, based on the recommendations of the expert committee, complies with the advice of the World Health Organisation. The WHO does not recommend mass vaccination. The key to smallpox control is early detection, isolation of cases and vaccination of contacts. In the unlikely event of a case of smallpox occurring here the expert committee will provide advice in relation to the management of the situation, including the issues of vaccine <Col N="1529" />use and dilution based on the specific circumstances prevailing at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>The hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure on available beds due to a number of factors, including the growth in population, the number of in-patient beds in the system and the increasing number of older people who have a higher than average length of stay. The pressure on the hospital system, and in particular on hospitals providing accident and emergency services, is more severe over the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has taken a number of measures designed to enhance accident and emergency services. A &euro;41 million investment package was provided in the winter of 2000-01 aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the <Col N="1530" />acute hospital sector. This investment package provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants. As many as 17 of these posts have been filled and the recruitment process is continuing in respect of the remaining posts.</P>
    <P>As part of the winter initiative announced in 2000 beds were contracted from private and voluntary nursing homes where appropriate facilities were available for patients being discharged from the acute hospital sector. This arrangement allows for people to be cared for in a more appropriate setting with a more suitable level of care. It also ensures that people are maintained in a setting best suited to their needs. It eases service pressures on the acute hospitals to allow for the more effective treatment of patients who need intensive medical intervention.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the national health strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, plus 600 additional day hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson's disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. In addition, the strategy proposed the provision of an extra 800 extended care-community nursing unit places per year over a seven year period which will include provision for people with dementia.</P>
    <P>Public private partnerships are currently being piloted in the health sector. PPP is based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be created when the initial pilot programmes are complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds in Dublin and Cork. The services offered in these units will include: assessment/rehabilitation, respite, extended care and convalescence.</P>
    <P>If the public private partnership pilots demonstrate success, I intend to use them as a means of providing additional CNUs in other locations throughout the country.</P>

      <P>On 10 February Amnesty International launched its report. It acknowledges the significant advances made here in the provision of community psychiatry, nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres since the publication of the landmark <Col N="1531" />1984 report, Planning for the Future. In the period 1999-2002 an additional &euro;70.7 million was invested in the mental health services. In the current year additional revenue funding of &euro;7.6 million will be provided for ongoing improvements in mental health services, to develop and expand community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the old age psychiatry services, to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>Approximately &euro;190 million capital is being provided over the lifetime of the national development plan to fund the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals, as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. Substantial progress has already been made. There are now 19 general hospital psychiatric units operational, a further two units will become available to their mental health services in the near future, two are under construction and several others are at various stages of planning.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences here providing over 3,000 places. This compares to 111 residences providing less than 1,000 places in 1984. There are approximately 200 day hospitals-day centres providing over 3,500 places. This compares with 39 such centres providing approximately 1,200 places in 1984.</P>
      <P>The report also acknowledges the funding which is being made available by Government to support groups and organisations such as Schizophrenia Ireland, Mental Health Ireland, GROW and Aware to heighten awareness and develop support services for service users and carers.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the report's recommendation for a comprehensive review of the mental health services, which reflects a commitment in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness, to the development of a new national policy framework on mental health. Work on this review is expected to commence later this year.</P>
      <P>In describing the shortcomings and deficiencies of the existing mental health services, the report has highlighted the scale of the challenge facing both Government and Irish society as a whole, in seeking to reduce the stigma traditionally associated with mental illness and, by extension, the mental health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last April the Mental Health Commission was established under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001. It has an important role to play in improving the quality of our mental health services. Its establishment was welcomed by Amnesty International in its report. The commission's primary functions are to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. It is now working, along with officials <Col N="1532" />from my Department, to put in place the structures required for its new role.</P>
    <P>I am committed to improving the quality of care and service delivery in the mental health services. I will seek additional resources for this purpose during my term of office as Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The drugs payment scheme, which replaced the drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes in 1999, was initially introduced on an administrative basis. It was intended that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced at a later date following amendment of the relevant section of the 1970 Health Act. However, amendment of the Act was delayed. Following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's Office in October 2000 regulations made under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act, fixing the threshold for the new scheme at &euro;53.33, came into effect on 1 March 2001. Given that, as has been pointed out previously, claimants derived greater overall benefits under the new scheme, as reflected in the significant <Col N="1533" />increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at that time.</P>
      <P>The GMS Payments Board estimated that the maximum cost of claims for potential refunds for the period 1 July 1999 to 28 February 2001 is in the region of &euro;18 million. This involved 175,000 households and covered approximately 4.75 million transactions relating to 11.86 million items. The administrative cost of processing these claims is estimated at &euro;2 million.</P>
      <P>Following a review by my Department of the position in relation to this issue, I have obtained the Government's authorisation to put in place a process for assessing applications for refunds from persons who may be owed money arising from the introduction of the DPS.</P>
      <P>There are significant administrative issues to be resolved before a process can be put in place. My Department will address these issues in consultation with the relevant bodies. When an appropriate procedure is agreed applications will then be invited through public notice. Each application for refunds will be considered under the terms of the agreed procedure. The final cost and the numbers qualifying for reimbursement will not be known until all applications are received and processed.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that this issue be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The working group on the role of the mental handicap nurse was established by the Department of Health in July 1995. One of its aims was to review the role of the mental handicap nurse from a health service management perspective in preparation for the development of a diploma programme in mental handicap nurse training. One of its terms of reference was to make a recommendation as to the appropriate title under which a mental handicap nurse should register.</P>
      <P>The question of the title under which a mental handicap nurse should register was addressed in all of the submissions received by the working group. All of the submissions requested that the word &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; be retained in the title. There were various interpretations of what other words should be included in the title such as registered mental handicap nurse, registered learning disability nurse, registered nurse for mental handicap, registered nurse for the intellectually disabled, and registered nurse (mental handicap).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group discussed this matter at some length. It concurred with the general con<Col N="1534" />sensus that the term &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; should remain in the title. It considered that the term &ldquo;mental handicap&rdquo; in the title had been accepted by nurses, service providers, persons with a mental handicap, parents and friends of persons with a mental handicap and the general public. If any change in the terminology were to be considered then the opinions of a wide range of people would have to be elicited. In the meantime the working group recommended that the term registered nurse (mental handicap) be used.</P>
    <P>An Bord Altranais has statutory responsibility for the training and registration of nurses here. It is the regulatory body for the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Nurses Act 1985 provides for the maintenance of a register in accordance with the nurses rules promulgated under section 26 of the Act. The nurses rules 1988 provide for the division of the register into seven divisions, of which the division for mental handicap nursing specifies the designation of registered mental handicap nurse. The redesignation of the title of a nurse on the register would require a rule change by the board.</P>
    <P>The question as to the designation of mental handicap nursing and registered mental handicap nurse was raised at the board's last meeting on 13 February. It referred the matter to the education and training committee for further consideration.</P>

    <P>Since 1997 there has been an unprecedented level of investment in cancer services. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy a <Col N="1535" />cumulative figure of &euro;400 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. This investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology throughout the country. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred. For example, the number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment has increased from 2,402 in 1994 to 3,809 in 2000. This means that an additional 1,407 are accessing these services, representing an increase of 58% nationally.</P>
    <P>The work of the expert review group on radiotherapy services is currently in the final stages of drafting and is due to be submitted to me shortly. The provision of additional radiotherapy services will be considered in the context of its report. Following its consideration proposals will be submitted to Government for consideration.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services in County Clare rests with the MWHB. In 2001 the board agreed that the staffing levels at St. Joseph's elderly care hospital, Ennis warranted review. Management and staff agreed to commission an independent consultant to carry out this examination. Since the review significant developments in staffing have taken place. An additional 20 staff nurse posts and 4.5 attendants have been appointed in the past two years. Non-nursing posts were also provided in 2002 for the main kitchen and new canteen areas. The additional staffing has allowed for the implementation of a new roster for each unit. This includes a second nurse on night duty on the three larger units. Twilight nurses are also on duty in the smaller units in addition to the nurse on night duty. There has been an increase in staff numbers on all units and wards for day duty. All units and wards are now managed by a clinical nurse manager 2 and a clinical nurse manager 1. New rosters were introduced on a phased basis in 2002. The wards are now self managed in terms of annual leave and other leave to ensure continuity of patient care.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to improving staffing levels at St. Joseph's hospital. In 2001 additional funding of &euro;4.54 million was provided to the MWHB. Of this &euro;0.22 million was provided for the elderly mentally infirm unit at the hospital, &euro;0.51 million was provided to improve staff ratios and &euro;0.18 million was provided for additional staffing. The board received additional funding of &euro;7.073 million in 2002. Of this &euro;0.305 million was provided for additional staffing at St. Joseph's.</P>
      <P>The dementia unit at St. Joseph's hospital is scheduled to open mid-2003. Fifteen nursing and non-nursing staff posts have been agreed between the management at the hospital and the relevant unions. I am informed by the board that the recruitment process for these posts is currently ongoing.</P>
      <P>The additional staffing levels in the hospital have allowed the staff to undertake an ISO quality management project. All departments in the hospital are working together in a partnership approach to achieve this certification by September. The increased level of staff has also facilitated the introduction of a complete new nursing documentation system in the hospital. This will be introduced on a phased basis commencing in September. These initiatives will serve to improve the quality of care provided to the patients at St. Joseph's.</P>

      <P>My Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are engaged in a major project to modernise the civil registration service. A consultation document Bringing Civil Registration into the 21st Century, published in 2001, set out the two phased approach to the modernisation of the service and invited submissions from interested parties.</P>
      <P>The focus in the initial stage of the project is on the introduction of new information systems, procedures and legislation to facilitate the electronic registration of vital events including births, stillbirths, deaths, marriages and adoptions and the electronic production of certificates. In addition, the archival records held by the General Register Office and the associated indexes are being converted to an electronic format in a separate project in Roscommon. Phase two of the modernisation will focus on the development of external access and services via the Internet to facilitate a wider group of users.</P>
      <P>Consultations were held with a number of interests. These included service providers, other bodies directly associated with the provision of the registration service, groups representing users of the service who had responded to the consultation document and representatives of the unions involved.</P>
      <P>The legal changes necessary to enable the direct electronic registration of births and deaths and the holding of birth, death and marriage records in an electronic format were included in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. The other provisions required to facilitate the wider modernisation of the registration service are being included in a new civil registration Bill, the drafting of which is currently being finalised.</P>
      <P>The implementation of a modern CRS is at the heart of providing better public services to citizens through the Government's modernisation programme. It is a key building block underpinning the integration of public service delivery and electronic Government objectives of providing more convenient access to services. The new service will facilitate the sharing of information between Government agencies. Future registration of vital events will include a personal public service number. It will be used as a unique customer reference number by public service providers, thereby facilitating opportunities for streamlining the provision of services from other Departments and public service organisations, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The new system was successfully piloted from December 2002 to January 2003. The roll-out of the system to offices throughout the country will begin soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year. However, the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within its lifetime.</P>
      <P>Health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards. A range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card. A medical card may still be awarded if a chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify it.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
      <P>The strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF. It includes: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services. Shorter waiting times for <Col N="1539" />public patients is prioritised with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of a treatment purchase fund. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including: continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people; initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers-refugees and prisoners; and implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy targets relating to health.</P>
    <P>Access to primary care services is of crucial concern to this Government as is evidenced by the publication of a separate strategy document, Primary Care: A New Direction. Primary care is the first port of call for the majority of people who use health services. It can meet 90-95% of all health and personal social service needs. It is a vital public service. People want community based, well integrated, round the clock services that are easy to reach. They want themselves, their family members and their communities put right at the centre of care delivery.</P>
    <P>The primary care strategy sets out a vision of the service we want to put in place building on our existing strengths, to develop a high quality, user-friendly primary care service to meet people's needs into the future. Change will not be effected overnight. The strategy sets out an implementation plan, which recognises the breadth of the change and which will be required in order to support the rolling-out of the new primary care model over the next decade.</P>
    <P>As the new model is developed a wider primary care network of other primary care professionals will also provide services for the population served by each primary care team. Last year I approved the establishment of a number of initial implementation projects which involves the putting in place of an integrated primary care team in ten locations around the country. This will enable us to see, in a real and practical way, how the new model will operate in practice, the benefits which we hope will flow from this new way of working and to explore some of the implementation issues in a practical way.</P>
    <P>This is only one of the first steps along the way. The implementation period recognises that there are major structural changes which must occur in order for the new primary care model to be implemented. It is also necessary to ensure that the required numbers of health professionals are trained and retained in the system over the coming decade and beyond to meet anticipated needs.</P>
    <P>Following an extensive consultation process with disadvantaged groups carried out under the auspices of the working group on NAPS and health, NAPS health targets have been included in Building an Inclusive Society: Review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, published by the Government earlier this year. Key health targets are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and <Col N="1540" />lowest socio-economic groups by 10% by 2007, and to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest of the population. Policy measures for implementing these targets as outlined in the framework document for the NAPS review, and the report of the working group on NAPS and health, have been taken on board in the national health strategy.</P>

      <P>In 1984 the Government approved a framework for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies. The purpose was to establish common procedures in each of the front line emergency services for activating emergency plans and co-ordination, control and co-operation during peacetime emergencies.</P>
      <P>The ERHA and each of the health boards have an emergency plan which is based on this framework and which is kept under constant review. The main aim of the plans is to ensure that the health service is in a position to mobilise all necessary and available resources and to utilise these to best advantage so that the resulting response will be appropriate, structured, co-ordinated and effectively managed. The emergency plan can be activated by the ambulance service, fire service or the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each acute general hospital, including those providing accident and emergency services, has an emergency plan which is an essential subset of ERHA and health boards' major emergency plans. Hospital emergency plans are designed to deal with the receipt and treatment of patients in the event of the occurrence of a major incident. The aim is to ensure that hospitals are in a posi<Col N="1541" />tion to provide appropriate treatment to incoming casualties.</P>
    <P>In September 2001 the chief executive officers of the ERHA and the health boards established a national group to review all aspects of major emergency planning in the health context. This review recommended that responsibility for overseeing and co-ordinating the health boards' major emergency planning function should be assumed by the recently established health board executive. An emergency planning unit is being established within HeBE to prepare, issue and maintain guidelines on emergency planning across all health boards and to support the emergency planning activities of my Department. An emergency planning project officer will be appointed to this unit shortly.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to have the opportunity to visit the Central Mental Hospital last month and to meet its staff and patients. I was impressed with the work being done at the hospital and by the dedication of the staff who are carrying out their work in difficult physical conditions.</P>
      <P>I accept that the physical conditions at the CMH are not satisfactory. As has been pointed out by the inspector of mental hospitals on numerous occasions, most of the old building is quite unsatisfactory for its current purpose and conditions in some parts of it are unacceptable. Since 1999 &euro;500,000 has been spent on the refurbishment of the hospital but there is an acceptance by all parties that a more substantial redevelopment is required.</P>
      <P>In December 2000 the East Coast Area Health Board, in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my Department established a group to advise on proposals for the future of the CMH. It took into account national and regional services provided by the hospital, linkages with community psychiatric services and with the criminal justice system, new mental health legislation, the training role of the CMH for medical, nursing and paramedical staff and future accommodation and resource requirements. The group concluded its work last year and its report was submitted to the ERHA and my Department. The report included plans to modernise, refurbish and extend the existing building at the CMH and to provide a new residence on the campus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. Increased investment in this or any other developmental aspect of the strategy agenda is dependent on the availability of the necessary additional resources. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act 1970 the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Neither I nor my Department has a function in the matter. Since July 2001 all those aged 70 years or over are automatically eligible for a medical card. Health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance for individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused. It should also be remembered that health board chief executive <Col N="1543" />officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. The chief executive officers have been reminded by my Department that medical card holders should not be disadvantaged as a result of budgetary increases in social welfare allowances. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication for those who do not qualify for a medical card. Under the long-term illness scheme persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain, without charge, the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drugs payment scheme a person and his or her dependants do not have to pay more than &euro;70 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>
    <P>The health strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services. Shorter waiting times for public patients are prioritised with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of a treatment purchase fund. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, including continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people; initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers-refugees and prisoners; and implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy targets relating to health.</P>
    <P>The strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information for people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
    <P>The health strategy acknowledges the need to clarify and simplify eligibility arrangements. It sets down a commitment to introduce new legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on entitlement for health and personal social services. As part of the implementation process a review of all existing legislation is ongoing in my Department. The outcome will inform the approach to the drafting of a new legislative framework on entitlements. I expect that this review will be completed in the current year and <Col N="1544" />that proposals for reform will be submitted to Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Monosodium glutamate has been authorised for use in all member states of the EU under Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners. Its function as a food additive is to enhance flavour: it is not used as a preservative. Food additive uses of MSG include its incorporation into food and its use as a condiment. Directive 95/2/EC has been implemented in Ireland by the European Union (Food Additives other than Colours and Sweeteners) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 613 of 2002).</P>
      <P>MSG was authorised following a rigorous safety assessment by the EU scientific committee on food. It has also been evaluated by other national and international food safety organisations, including the joint expert committee on food additives of the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation and the US Food and Drug Administration. These organisations have all placed MSG in the safest category of food ingredients and have allocated it no specific acceptable daily intake, ADI not specified. A food additive is only categorised as ADI not specified when, on the basis of the available scientific data, the total intake of the substance following consumption of a typical diet will not represent a hazard to health.</P>
      <P>While the European Commission carried out a survey of dietary food additive intake in the EU, the results of which were reported in October 2001, MSG was not among the additives surveyed since in a priority setting exercise the Commission decided to exclude additives with ADI not specified allocated by the SCF from the monitoring exercise as these did not represent a hazard to health. Ireland took part in this survey, the Irish estimates of food additive intake being provided by the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance at the request of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. As MSG is placed in the safest category of food ingredients, the FSAI has no plans for a survey of MSG.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scientific data on MSG does not support the conclusion that many people are seriously allergic to this particular ingredient in food. Were this the case MSG would not have been approved as a food additive in the EU nor have been allocated an ADI not specified rating. Some individ<Col N="1545" />uals are sensitive to the presence of MSG and may have mild and transitory reactions when they eat foods that contain large amounts of MSG such as would be found in heavily flavoured enhanced foods.</P>
    <P>The scientific data on MSG also does not support any restrictions on its use. Under the harmonised EU legislation on food additives other than colours and sweeteners, Ireland would have to provide specific justification for a restriction of use for foods placed on the Irish market containing MSG. The FSAI does not consider that there are scientific grounds for such a restriction.</P>
    <P>Legislation does require the labelling of additives on pre-packaged foodstuffs. For MSG, the following may appear on the label: flavour enhancer: monosodium glutamate or flavour enhancer E621.</P>
    <P>Current legislation does not require food outlets to state if MSG is used in their products nor does the FSAI consider that there are scientific grounds for such a requirement.</P>

      <P>MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme. It provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board chief executive officers estab<Col N="1546" />lished a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes, including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The steering committee was assisted by four working groups which examined the following areas in relation to immunisation: communication, materials management, IT systems and planning and organisation.</P>
    <P>On 22 April 2002 I launched the steering committee's report. It is the first step towards improving immunisation uptake and also enhancing and developing the key systems which underpin the immunisation programmes. In July 2002 a national immunisation implementation group was established. It is responsible for co-ordinating the planning and implementation of immunisation programmes in order to improve uptake and reports to the national steering committee.</P>
    <P>In order to improve uptake I have made an additional &euro;2.116 million available in 2003 in order to fund specific projects and measures which will improve immunisation uptake particularly in areas of low uptake. Health boards were requested to submit proposed projects-measures to the NIIG by the end of January. These proposals are currently being considered by health board-health authority chief executive officers.</P>
    <P>There is concern among some parents in relation to the MMR vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether to vaccinate their children. In April 2002 I launched the MMR vaccine discussion pack &ndash; an information guide for health professionals and parents. It was produced by the national disease surveillance centre and the department of public health, Southern Health Board. It was published by the health boards executive on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about the MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The layout of the pack is in a question and answer format. It addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn's disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack will be of great assistance to health professionals and will enable them to respond to the very real concerns of parents.</P>
    <P>At present I have no plans to introduce compulsory measures in relation to immunisation. However, I urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the popu<Col N="1547" />lation generally have maximum protection against the disease concerned. This is particularly important at present in light of the increase in reported measles cases in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Midland Health Board areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 in the USA, I established an expert committee under the chairmanship of Professor William Hall, director of the virus reference laboratory, to develop a contingency plan which would, implemented in the unlikely event of a biological attack in this country. In preparing the plan it was necessary for the committee to identify the level of risk of such an attack. The committee considered that the secondary consequences of an attack in another country was the most likely threat.</P>
      <P>On 17 October 2001 I launched a protocol for dealing with a suspected anthrax attack in Ireland. The protocol was prepared by the expert committee and deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax attack, including patient treatment and management, post exposure guidelines. Included with the protocol are guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with a suspect package believed to contain anthrax. The document is available on my Department's web site: www.doh.ie.</P>
      <P>A detailed protocol in relation to category A agents, including smallpox, botulism, plague and tularaemia, entitled, Biological Threats &ndash; A Health Response for Ireland, was issued in May 2002 to all health board chief executive officers and directors of public health for circulation to all relevant personnel. The chief executive officers were requested to circulate the document to appropriate medical personnel and to ensure that each board's emergency plan was reviewed and updated to take account of the protocol. It is available on my Department's website: www.doh.ie/pdfdocs/biothreat.pdf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" />The National Disease Surveillance Centre issued a document entitled, Biological Threat Agents. It was aimed at informing all medical staff, particularly GPs, in order to assist in the diagnosis of anthrax, plague, botulism and smallpox. This document was agreed by the expert committee and was circulated in May 2002.</P>
    <P>It was agreed by the expert committee that a sub-group, representative of health boards, consultants in emergency medicine and infectious diseases, public health doctors as well as the NDSC, was required to examine operational issues arising from the document, Biological Threats &ndash; A Health Response for Ireland. This sub-group was established in October 2002. It was requested to examine several key issues, including the designation of hospitals for treatment of smallpox cases and development of protocols in relation to transport of patients and samples. It has submitted a number of reports to the expert committee for consideration.</P>
    <P>Based on the recommendations of the expert committee, I approved the purchase of specific antibiotics and vaccines which would be required in the event of a biological attack with specific class A agents. The following quantities were secured: 2.4 million doses of ciprofloxacin, oral, and 16,000 doses of ciprofloxacin, i/v, for the treatment of anthrax; and 600,000 doses of smallpox vaccine for the use in the event of a confirmed case of the disease. This vaccine can be diluted by a factor of five or six.</P>
    <P>These products will complement the existing stocks of medical products for the treatment of these diseases. There is a considerable quantity of antibiotics and other therapeutic substances already available in hospitals which could be used against a range of biological agents in the event of an attack.</P>
    <P>A high level containment facility has recently been constructed at the virus reference laboratory. The facility is designed to a BL3+ standard to allow for containment of a range of infectious agents including smallpox and to ensure increased safety. In addition, protective clothing for use in the event of an attack as well as specific equipment for use by the VRL have been secured. In the event of a biological threat occurring the expert committee will provide advice in relation to the management of the situation, including the issue of vaccine use, based on the specific circumstances prevailing at the time.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.</P>
      <P>The ERHA is currently in discussions with all providers within its region, including the major acute hospitals in the Dublin area, to finalise the level of services to be provided in 2003. It will be a matter for the authority, and each of the respective hospitals, to agree on any specific measures to be taken to ensure that each hospital continues to maintain a high level of service within available resources. In relation to Beaumont Hospital, none of the proposals contained in the leaked document, referred to recently in the House, has been agreed with the ERHA.</P>
      <P>The provider discussions are expected to conclude within the next two weeks. I have asked the ERHA to report back to my Department on the outcome.</P>
      <P>The authority accepts that 2003 will be a difficult year for the acute hospitals sector as increases in funding over last year will be limited. There is a clear need for tight management of cost and activity in 2003 in the context of working within available resources.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in the authority's service plan for the completion of major initiatives which commenced in 2002, for example, the introduction under the Government's bed capacity initiative of over 300 additional acute hospital beds in the region, including an additional 35 beds at Beaumont Hospital. The revenue funding for these additional beds has already been notified to the authority. The hospital has advised that these additional beds will come on stream in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The authority has received additional funding of &euro;9.45 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services. This funding will be allocated among the service providers to assist in meeting the increased costs of current levels of activity and to fund service developments initiated in 2002. This funding includes an additional &euro;1.4 million for the continued provision of national specialty services. Additional funding has also been provided to meet the cost associated with the recruitment of additional consultants in emergency medicine and consultant anaesthetists, and for cancer, cardiology and renal dialysis services.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Health and Children my responsibilities centre on the provision of a high quality <Col N="1550" />health service. This includes ensuring, in so far as is possible, that adequate and accessible pharmacy services are generally available.</P>
      <P>In January 2002, following advice from the Attorney General, I revoked the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations 1996. These regulations had set out the criteria and procedures for the granting of community pharmacy contracts by the health boards. As a result of the revocation of the regulations, there are now no restrictions on granting new community pharmacy contracts by health boards in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The opening and operation of retail pharmacies in Ireland continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts 1875-1977, subject to conditions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the planning Acts.</P>
      <P>I established the pharmacy review group, chaired by Professor Michael Mortell, in November 2001 to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group based its approach on the principles set out for evidence based policy formulation by the Mandelkern group, the Mandelkern Group on Better Regulation Final Report, 13 November 2001. These include: public and interest group consultation; analysis of the existing position; and analysis of possible options. The group consulted widely and, in particular, invited submissions from consumer interests and special interest groups such as the Asthma Society and the Irish Heart Foundation.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group was submitted to me on 31 January. I am currently examining its recommendations and it is my intention that it will be published as soon as possible.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002 an extra &euro;188 million revenue and &euro;139 million capital funding has been provided. This makes a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the current year further additional funding of &euro;13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism. This will meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and will further enhance the health related support services for children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years. Of this total amount over &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002 around 1,700 extra residential places have been provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002 about 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period from 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of around 2,950 new day places.</P>
      <P>Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment. This is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service <Col N="1553" />programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision.</P>

      <P>The figures available to me, which are not finalised, for health boards-authority outturns for 2002 are set out in the following table. The over<Col N="1554" />run as reported is &euro;26 million across health boards-authority and represents approximately 0.38% of approved expenditure. The Deputy will agree that this is a good result given the pressure on services that was experienced throughout 2002.</P>
      <P>Whilst I cannot be definitive at this stage about the detail of the programme overrun for each board-authority, it is clear from the information available to me that the major problem was experienced in the acute hospital sector. Other difficulties arose in areas such as legal costs associated with children services, services for older people, particularly nursing home subventions, health inflation issues, such as insurance and waste disposal. A detailed breakdown of this will not be available to me until the figures for 2002 have been finalised in the annual financial statements. The 1996 accountability legislation provides for a first charge reflecting excess expenditure to be set off against the following year's budget as a disciplinary measure so that health agencies plan their service delivery within approved expenditure limits.</P>

      <P>The incidence of tuberculosis in Ireland has declined dramatically since its peak at the beginning of the 20th century. TB has been a significant cause of mortality in Ireland. There has been a notable and steady decline in the level of TB over the past 20 years. In 1990 there were 613 notified cases of TB &ndash; by 2000 this figure had fallen by 35% to 395 cases. This represents the lowest ever annual incidence rate of TB in Ireland. The combination of BCG vaccination, expert medical diagnosis and treatment with the use of antibiotics and better living conditions have brought about a dramatic improvement in the situation, but continued vigilance is crucial.</P>
      <P>Information supplied by the NDSC indicates that for the year 2001, which is the last complete year for which figures are available, the number of cases of TB per health board region is as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation here attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are required to fluoridate public water supplies in accordance with the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960 and I have no plans to extend the scope of this Act. The report of the forum on fluoridation recommended a reduction in the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water. Currently, approximately 71% of the Irish population reside in fluoridated communities. The Act provides for the making by health authorities of arrangements for the fluoridation of water supplied to the public by sanitary authorities through pipes.</P>
      <P>I established the forum on fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. Its report was launched on 10 September 2002. Its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum also concluded that: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the <Col N="1556" />best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at 1 part per million, human health is not adversely affected; and dental fluorosis, a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel, is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research. Ultimately, the forum took an evidence based approach to its examination of water fluoridation.</P>

      <Quest>the total legal costs incurred by his Department as a result of the successful High Court case taken by a number of tobacco companies challenging sections of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, which the judge in the case described as being fatally flawed from the outset; if it is intended to re-enact the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The challenge to the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 in the courts by the tobacco industry comprised three sets of proceedings. In one of these cases no order for costs was made. In the other two cases an order for the State defendants to pay the legal costs was made. The precise amount of legal costs payable will be determined by the taxing master of the High Court upon a claim being made by the plaintiffs. In addition, the State will be responsible for its own legal costs.</P>
      <P>As the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 is a public health measure it was considered that it was not notifiable to the Commission as a technical regulation. It was also considered that the requirement to introduce commencement orders in the case of the Act would allow for notification of the commencement order in draft form thereby meeting the requirements of the transparency directives. Following correspondence and discussions with EU Commission officials on this matter, and having obtained legal advice from the Attorney General, it became clear that any attempt to commence the affected sections would result in considerable uncertainty as to their enforceability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I decided that the quickest and most appropriate way of resolving the issue was <Col N="1557" />to repeal the affected 14 of the 53 sections and to re-introduce them by way of a new Bill which would then be notified under the transparency procedure and, on completion of this procedure, would be re-enacted.</P>

      <P>In November 2001 I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to produce a situation report about the position in Ireland and in the United States in respect of a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia.</P>
      <P>As part of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner liaised with solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society. He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in the HIV haemophiliac litigation in the US. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm in relation to the matters relevant to his investigations.</P>
      <P>Mr. Gardiner furnished a report to me which consisted of a 60 page opinion and a number of appendices, one of which comprised over 50 pages of legal advice from the US lawyers. The report drew attention to the fact that there is no guarantee that the US Authorities would provide judicial assistance to an Irish tribunal, either in relation to enforcing the discovery of documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses.</P>
      <P>I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the content of the report and I provided the IHS with a copy of it. Following further consultations with Mr. Gardiner late last year, it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would access publicly available material and seek the assistance of persons and bodies willing to co-operate with such an investigation.</P>
      <P>I am in ongoing consultation with the IHS in relation to the format and scope of the proposed investigation. I intend to present proposals to Government in the not too distant future.</P>

Corporate financial and legal advisers were engaged to examine the strategic options for the VHI and their report is under consideration.</P>
      <P>The VHI board has indicated that, in principle, it favours being privatised. This has been noted in the context of the consideration to be given to its future. Ultimately, proposals by the Government for a change in the VHI's corporate status will require legislation and will therefore arise for consideration and discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The advisory group examining the feasibility of introducing a no fault compensation scheme for brain damaged infants has met regularly since its establishment in July 2001. The group has conducted an extensive investigation of the clinical and legal issues involved in the handling of those cases. It has also examined existing levels of service provision for those affected by cerebral damage. The group has had a presentation made to it by parents of children affected by cerebral damage on the day to day implications of providing care for them at home. Most recently it has examined prevention strategies and the effect of <Col N="1559" />reforms introduced in the United Kingdom on the handling of claims for compensation for injuries resulting from the provision of clinical care. I hope that the group will be in a position to present its final report in 2003.</P>
      <P>The recent settlement made on behalf of an infant with cerebral palsy emphasises the need to complete the examination of the issue being undertaken by the advisory group. As the group has already indicated its intention of completing its work by the end of this year it would not be appropriate to ask it to expedite the process.</P>

      <P>A prohibition on smoking in all places of work, including licensed premises, is being introduced from 1 January 2004. This prohibition is based on recommendations contained in the report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace prepared by an independent scientific working group commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority which was published on 30 January.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the prohibition is to protect the health and safety of workers and the public from toxic environmental tobacco smoke.</P>
      <P>The owner, occupier or person in charge of a licensed premises is legally responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements as well as a range of other legislation relating, for example, to fire safety, food hygiene and the control of the sale of alcohol and tobacco products to underage persons. Since the announcement, I have consulted interested parties regarding implementation.</P>
      <P>I expect that the vast majority of customers will comply with the new health and safety measures when introduced.</P>
      <P>Monitoring compliance with and enforcement of the ban on smoking can also be carried out by authorised officers from the Health and Safety Authority, the Office of Tobacco Control and the health boards.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services, including speech and language therapy, to people with physical and/or sensory disabilities is a matter for the ERHA and the health boards.</P>
      <P>All health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy posts and particularly in filling senior vacancies.</P>
      <P>My Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service.</P>
      <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report an interagency working group, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present. It is expected that the first intake to fill the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-04 academic year.</P>
      <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the Bacon report, I have asked the ERHA and the health boards to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision, or an enhancement, in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. The Northern Area Health Board has also undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals, including speech and language therapists, on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the overarching need to ensure that all therapists <Col N="1561" />working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The target in the national health strategy is that by the end of 2004 all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department. Intermediate targets have been set to ensure that the focus is on patients waiting longest for treatment.</P>
      <P>Waiting list data in respect of the quarter ending December 2002 are being collated at present by my Department.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for public patients in 2002. The total number of children waiting for more than six months for in-patient treatment fell by 24% between June and September 2002. The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialties covered by the waiting list initiative fell by 15% between June and September 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, the national <Col N="1565" />treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment. Funding of &euro;43.8 million has been provided in 2003 for the waiting list initiative and some &euro;31 million has been provided for the national treatment purchase fund. To date approximately 3,000 patients have received treatment under the national treatment purchase fund.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to redirect any of the &euro;31 million that has been provided for the national treatment purchase fund in the current year.</P>
      <P>The NTPF identifies public patients waiting longest on in-patient lists, so that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists over 12 months and children waiting over six months for surgical procedures.</P>
      <P>To date approximately 3,000 long waiters have received treatment under the national treatment purchase fund. This achievement would not have been possible without the co-operation of hospital consultants, general practitioners, nurses and other staff with the NTPF. I am looking forward to an increase in the numbers being treated under this initiative and the specific funding is in place for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is currently in discussions with all providers within its region, including the major acute hospitals in the Dublin area, to finalise the level of services to be provided in 2003. It will be a matter for the authority and each of the respective hospitals to agree on any specific measures to be taken to ensure that each hospital continues to maintain a high level of service within available resources. The provider discussions are expected to conclude within the next two weeks. I have asked the ERHA to report back to my Department on the outcome.</P>

      <P>The National Health Strategy 2001 is a seven to ten year comprehensive strategic plan for the health system. Several key actions will take the full ten years to implement, for example, the primary care strategy.</P>
      <P>An additional &euro;694 million was allocated to the health service this year bringing the total health allocation for 2003 to &euro;8.9 billion, including capital. The Deputy will recall that I gave a detailed report on the breakdown of this allocation in relation to implementation of the strategy in 2003, in my response to his parliamentary question of 11 February on this matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to action 89 of the health strategy, preliminary talks aimed at resolving the outstanding issues of the 1997 consultants' common contract have already begun. My Department has successfully negotiated the introduction of a revised grievance and dispute procedure with the consultants' representative bodies. In addition, discussions regarding a revised administrative leave scheme for consultants have been productive, although this issue has yet to be finalised. It is hoped that substantive talks on a new contract will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>It is my Department's intention that the talks on a new contract will take cognisance of the recommendations made in the report of the forum on medical manpower, the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the forthcoming report of the national task force on medical staffing and other recent reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of these recommendations will lead to increased productivity, greater flexibility in work practices, enhanced team-working, and improved accountability of consultants in their provision of public health services. Particular emphasis will obviously be placed on the intention, outlined in the health strategy, to provide a more equitable system of health care for public patients. This will necessitate improved access for public patients, the restructuring of services to provide greater focus on the public pati<Col N="1567" />ent, and improvement in the development of services for public patients.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that implementation of the strategy involves challenges for everyone in the health system. Its implementation must be underpinned by strong management of our economy. That is our best guarantee that the health strategy will be delivered on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act 1996.</P>
      <P>The costs of private nursing home care vary throughout the country and these costs depend on the type of accommodation available, the number of nursing homes in a particular area, the availability of public long-stay beds, and the demand for nursing home beds in the area. Accordingly the maximum amount of enhanced subvention paid by health boards will also vary for the above mentioned reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Southern Health Board that there are currently 518 people on a waiting list for enhanced subvention. Of these, 190 have already received an enhancement and are awaiting further enhancement, 174 are in receipt of basic subvention plus an additional allocation under article 10.6 and 154 are in receipt of basic <Col N="1568" />subvention alone. There are currently 530 people in receipt of enhanced subvention and the average enhanced payment is &euro;364.34 per week. This level of payment is significantly higher than that applying in a number of health board areas.</P>
    <P>While total expenditure on the nursing home subvention scheme was just over &euro;30 million in 1998, it will amount to almost &euro;110 million in 2003, an increase of 267%.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be acknowledged that the present structures in the health system evolved from a model developed over 30 years ago. During that time, the size, range of functions and complexity of managing the system have all grown dramatically. There have been significant enhancements to the original health board model, through the Health Acts 1996 and 1999, as well as considerable changes to the internal structures of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. A number of new advisory and executive bodies have also been established in recent years. One of the issues which came to the fore during the consultation process on the health strategy was the complex structure of decision-making, roles and responsibilities within the health system, the many layers and intersecting roles, and the lack of consistency in the development of systems and the application of schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" />One of the main conclusions in the health strategy was that while the system has served us well in many respects, some significant concerns remain. These include the need for stronger co-ordination and integration of functions and services; greater consistency in access to services and delivery of services throughout the country; and greater clarity around levels of decision-making in the full range of organisations, particularly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the role of the Department, and the requirement for &ldquo;whole system&rdquo; effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Action 114 of the strategy was intended to support organisation development in helping to clarify roles and co-ordinate the work of different organisations. It was for this reason that Prospectus Strategy Consultants were contracted in June of 2002 to complete an audit of structures and functions of the health system. The terms of reference included consideration of the structures and functions of both health boards/authority and other specialist, advisory, regulatory and executive agencies under my aegis. The terms of reference also require Prospectus to make recommendations to improve corporate governance arrangements in the health system generally. This includes consideration of interactions between all agencies who play a pivotal role in the system, including the Department of Health and Children. The outcomes sought are to ensure that the structures in the system are: the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future service needs; constitute an adequate framework for overall governance of the health system; achieve an effective integration of services across all parts of the system; adequately represent the views of consumers in the planning and delivery of services; and focus on the principles of equity, accountability, quality and people centredness and the national goals of the strategy.</P>
    <P>The project is being overseen by a steering group. Drafts of the report have been provided to the steering group and further work is being completed by the consultants. On completion, I will bring the report to the Government for decision. Once decisions have been made by Government I anticipate that the report will be published in full and made available generally.</P>

      <P>Following the introduction of the clinical indemnity scheme, based on the principle of enterprise liability, health boards, hospitals and other agencies covered by the scheme are no longer required to purchase insurance cover for medical malpractice. The medical indemnity scheme through which insurance cover was purchased for NCHDs, public health doctors, health board dentists and other salaried doctors has been terminated. In due course health boards will no longer be required to reimburse 80% to 90% of the cost of consultants' indemnity cover. The total expenditure on these arrangements has been estimated to be in the range of &euro;80 million to &euro;100 million in a full year. However, these savings will be progressively eroded in future years as the cost of meeting claims is progressively met by the State.</P>

      <P>The special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on financial control and management in the IBTS was laid before the House on Tuesday, 18 February 2003. The report relates to financial control and management in the IBTS in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the report, financial control problems encountered by the IBTS in 2000 mainly related to first, severe cash-flow problems due to legal costs arising from the Lindsay Tribunal, which will only be recouped following examin<Col N="1573" />ation of costs by the taxing master this year and, second, overruns on a major IT development project, The progress project. The new IT system will come fully into operation this month; the system has been in pilot phase nationally for a number of months. The increase in cost was due, in part, to the necessity to engage additional contractors to ensure compliance with best practice, validation of the existing system and ensuring year 2000 compliance. Third, sales invoices for the first quarter of 2000 were not issued until April of that year, thus delaying the receipt of income. This backlog was due to delays in the integration of the existing blood banking control system with a new financial accounting system. This integration was completed in April 2000.</P>
    <P>I understand that the report will be the subject of a hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts on 3 April next and that management representatives of the IBTS will be in attendance.

    <P>In response to concerns raised by pharmacists regarding both the administrative aspects and the timescale proposed in the circular, my Department met the payments board and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on 25 February 2003 to consider the issues raised by pharmacists and to discuss the most efficient and effective means to implement the Government decision. Arising <Col N="1574" />from this meeting, at which a number of issues of mutual concern were discussed, all parties agreed to work towards formulating an appropriate mechanism to implement the decision.</P>
    <P>I would point out that it is not the intention to permit any individual hardship to arise from the implementation of this decision. The aim is to ensure that there is effective management of the large number of claims annually which cannot be attributed to a valid GMS or drugs payment scheme entitlement, particularly in the context of the substantial cost to the taxpayer. Where there are difficulties with individual claims that cannot be validated for a genuine reason, I am confident that the final mechanism agreed between all parties will overcome any administrative difficulties that may emerge, and that close co-operation between the payments board, the health boards and pharmacists will ensure that all issues relating to incomplete claims are dealt with in a manner that minimises inconvenience to individual patients.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 140,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. By end December 2002, 110,636 women had been called for screening and 83,000 women had been screened. This represents an uptake of 75%.</P>
      <P>I have publicly expressed my commitment to the nationwide extension of BreastCheck. As evidence of my commitment, I recently announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50-64 age bracket in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the further expansion of the programme, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway, at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the south, west, mid-west and north west. A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national <Col N="1575" />roll out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will meet BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.</P>
    <P>It is the combination of breast screening services, access to breast surgery and to oncology drug therapies, together with radiotherapy that is required if we are to reduce mortality rates from breast cancer. National Cancer Registry data shows that 35% of breast cancer cases occur in women in the 50-64 year age group. As BreastCheck only deals with women in the 50 to 64 year old age range and only those who have no symptoms, it follows that the great majority of women with breast cancer will continue to be diagnosed and treated outside of the screening programme. Since 2001, there has been a cumulative investment of &euro;30 million in symptomatic breast disease services. In relation to the Western Health Board, the cumulative investment in these services since 2001 is almost &euro;4 million. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred, with in-patient breast cancer procedures increasing from 1,336 in 1997 to 1,839 in 2001, an increase of 37% nationally.</P>
    <P>Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, was formally established as an independent statutory body under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998. The principal function of the authority is to ensure that food consumed, produced, distributed or marketed in the State meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene available. The authority is responsible for the enforcement of all food safety legislation and carries out its enforcement functions through &ldquo;service contracts&rdquo; with over 48 official agencies who undertake inspections and other enforcement actions on its behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, an agency with responsibility for the promotion of food safety, the Food Safety Promotion Board, FSPB, also known as Safefood, was established as one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies. The functions of the FSPB, as provided for in the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, are: the promotion of food safety; research into food safety; the communication of food alerts; the surveillance of <Col N="1576" />food-borne diseases; the promotion of scientific co-operation and linkages between laboratories; and the development of cost-effective facilities for specialised laboratory testing.</P>
    <P>The roles of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Food Safety Promotion Board are, I believe, complementary. As the single regulatory authority with responsibility for the enforcement of food safety legislation in the State, the primary focus of the FSAI is on enforcing legislation and imparting a greater understanding to all food businesses of their legal responsibility for producing safe food. On the other hand, the FSPB has a remit throughout the island of Ireland in relation to the promotion of food safety.</P>
    <P>Given that both organisations are engaged in the area of food safety, there is, of course, a need to ensure that they co-operate and work closely together, and this is provided for in the relevant legislation. At operational level, the FSAI and the FSPB are in regular contact, keep each other informed of their activities and, indeed, are working jointly in a number of areas. The close ties between the two organisations are illustrated by some common membership on the respective boards of the bodies.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is no duplication of roles between the FSAI and the FSPB. On the contrary, the work of the two organisations complement one another and together they ensure that the Irish consumer is among the best protected in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health related services, including speech and language therapy, to people with physical and-or sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that all health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy posts and particularly in filling senior vacancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requir<Col N="1577" />ing a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service.</P>
    <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-2004 academic year.</P>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published April 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Bacon Report I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision, or an enhancement, in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. The Northern Area Health Board has also undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals, including speech and language therapists, on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the over-arching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</P>
    <P>I recently met a delegation of parents regarding the provision of speech and language therapy. In this instance, the relevant health board made a commitment to revert to those concerned within two weeks with a view to determining the means by which the immediate problem will be solved.</P>

      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards which enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service.</P>
      <P>Information received from health boards indicate that they have experienced difficulties in establishing the current position in relation to the number of children revaccinated, following the administration of oral polio vaccine, OPV, after the expiry date, as not all GPs have provided the required information.</P>
      <P>My Department has written to the health board chief executive officers in relation to this matter on numerous occasions since this issue arose and has requested that any discrepancy between the number of children in their health board area where records indicate they received OPV more than one month after the expiry date and the number of children who were subsequently revaccinated be comprehensively explained.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my letter of 22 January 2003 to the Deputy, health boards have indicated that the apparently high number of children yet to be revaccinated may not in fact be as high as current records show for the following reasons: GPs may have revaccinated children but have not advised the health boards; GPs may on rechecking their records have established that vaccine was not in fact administered after the expiry date but may have failed to advise the relevant health board; parents may have decided not to have their children revaccinated; some children may have moved from the region; GPs may have decided against revaccination; or GPs may not have advised parents that vaccine was given more than one month after the expiry date and that revaccination is recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards have assured my Depart<Col N="1580" />ment that they have contacted all relevant GPs and advised them of the recommendation to revaccinate; however, they have advised that in all instances the clinical responsibility for these patients rests with the GPs in question.</P>

      <P>These additional beds are currently not available, as the process of providing services under a PPP arrangement requires the health board or authority to abide by EU procurement legislation for projects of this size.

The provisions relating to Ireland's participation in overseas missions are set out in the Defence <Col N="1582" />(Amendment)(No 2) Act 1960, as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, which provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State, as part of a particular international United Nations force. Where the number of armed troops exceeds 12, the approval of Dáil Éireann is also required. This means that participation in an overseas mission requires UN authorisation, a specific Government decision and the approval of Dáil Éireann, the so-called &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo;. These are the underlying principles for our national decision making procedures which are fully in line with the principles underlying ESDP. The question of legislative change in this regard, therefore, does not arise.</P>

I am very satisfied that the existing complement of vessels enables the Naval Service to carry out its roles in a very effective manner and there is no requirement at present for further resources.</P>
      <P>The defence White Paper set out a strength of 1,144 for the Naval Service in accordance with the recommendations of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers consultancy study. The strength of the Naval Service on 28 February 2003 was 1,035 comprising 133 officers, 433 NCO ranks, 448 enlisted seamen and 21 cadets.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service will continue to benefit from the Government's policy of ongoing annual recruitment programmes to the Permanent Defence Force. These programmes comprise general service recruitment, the trainee technician/apprentice schemes and the annual cadetship competition. Specialist &ldquo;direct entry&rdquo; competitions are also held as and when required to recruit particular specialist categories of personnel to the Naval Service in various ranks, such as marine engineer officers, watchkeeping officers and electrical artificers.</P>

      <P>Supplementary measure 5 of the first rural environmental protection scheme provided for payments to farmers who undertook to give public access to their land for environmentally friendly leisure and sporting activities. However, there is no supplementary measure of this kind in the current REPS which commenced on 27 November 2000. Unlike the regulation governing the previous scheme, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, under which the new REPS is implemented, includes no provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme. In an effort to secure the continued availability of public access as part of REPS, my Department made proposals to the European Commission for the inclusion of the measure in the new scheme as a State aid fully funded by the Exchequer. However, the Commission indicated that for legal reasons a public access measure was not admissible under the agri-environment title of the regulation, even as a State aid.</P>

      <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, engages in dialogue with the Russian Federation on a range of human rights issues in <Col N="1585" />the overall context of developing positive Irish and EU relations with Russia. Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a right which is to be protected under all circumstances. Promotion and protection of this human right therefore is a priority for Ireland's and the EU's overall human rights policy.</P>
      <P>I share the deep concerns of the UN committee against torture expressed in its report of May 2002, in relation to &ldquo;numerous and consistent allegations of widespread torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of detainees committed by law enforcement personnel&rdquo; in Russia. Ireland, along with our partners, continues to urge the Russian Federation to adhere to the international humanitarian and human rights standards that prohibit the torture or ill-treatment of persons, in particular the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</P>
      <P>In this context I also view with concern the findings of the recent Amnesty International report, The Russian Federation &ndash; Denial of Justice, which sets out alleged specific and serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by the Russian authorities.</P>
      <P>The Government attaches great importance to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which is central to the protection and promotion of children's rights on a global level and has achieved almost universal ratification. Ireland expects the Russian Federation to fulfil its obligations under this convention, to which it is a party.</P>
      <P>Ireland is committed to the elimination of violence against women. In this regard, Ireland places great importance in the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women as a legally-binding instrument, which explicitly aims at the recognition and protection of the human rights of women and calls upon all states to adhere to their obligations under this convention. Ireland raises its concerns in relation to violence against women in international fora such as the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights. At the 58th session of the Commission on Human Rights Ireland co-sponsored resolutions on the &ldquo;Elimination of Violence Against Women&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Traffic in Women and Girls&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to raise human rights concerns in Russia on a bilateral basis with the Russian Federation, in concert with our EU partners, and in international fora.</P>

      <P>School insurance arrangements have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant <Col N="1589" />aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita</i> grants may be used for this purpose. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, the relevant vocational education committee arranges insurance cover. With regard to community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to voluntary secondary schools. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant from &euro;224.74, that applied in 1997, to &euro;266.49 in the current school year. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil in the year 2000 to &euro;99 per pupil over this school year.</P>
    <P>Recent developments also include a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of a recent equalisation measure, the support services grant was further increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brought the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to &euro;127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001.</P>
    <P>For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of &euro;236,761, &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs.</P>

The Centre for Management Organisation and Development, CMOD, of the Department of Finance was commissioned to undertake the review. This review has been a detailed process involving wide-ranging research and consultation with the key stakeholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CMOD report was presented to my Department recently. The report contains a wide range of recommendations with regard to all aspects of the network. One of the agreed terms of reference for the review referred to the num<Col N="1591" />ber, location and geographical remit of centres, and the CMOD review recommends the rationalisation of the education centre network. This recommendation would involve the closure of three full-time centres &ndash; Kildare, Kilkenny and Sligo &ndash; and the closure of all part-time centres excluding the Gaeltacht part-time centres.</P>
    <P>The CMOD review and the wide range of recommendations made in it are being considered in my Department at present. I wish to assure the Deputy that decisions regarding the recommendations contained in the review will be taken following a thorough consideration of all the relevant issues and following full consultation with the ATECI. However, as the content of the report and the recommendations contained therein are still under active consideration in my Department, the question of the possible sale of a centre and related issues do not arise at this time.</P>

Paid sick leave is granted to an individual teacher based on need and on the assumption that there is a reasonable prospect that the teacher will recover and be able to resume full teaching service within a reasonable period. This arrangement is of general application to all teachers and it would not be appropriate for an exception to be made in individual cases.</P>

      <Quest> the reason promises made to farmers in County Leitrim and elsewhere in the 1980s to provide loading bays and access roads to facilitate the abstraction of thinnings have not been kept; the reason these farmers have not received parity of treatment, in relation to grants and taxation, with more recent growers; and the reason his Department is not taking steps to prevent plantations from being left unthinned due to the fact that the cost of thinning under existing extraction conditions will not be met by returns from the sale of thinnings.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding for forest roads, which would include features such as loading bays as appropriate, has been available from the forest service since 1984. This funding is intended to facilitate the extraction of thinnings and final harvesting of the woodland. Application forms are available from the local forest service inspector or from the Forest Service, Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Johnstown Castle Estate, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>There has always been parity of treatment for farmers in relation to grants. Although it is acknowledged that grant levels under the current operational programme are higher than under earlier programmes such as the western package, I am not aware of any lack of parity in relation to taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the economic viability of first thinnings is a factor of crop quality, plantation size, or area, species, forest-owner knowledge, market availability and proximity, labour &ndash; harvesting-haulage &ndash; availability, geographic location and ground conditions. I recognise the value and importance of early thinning. Distance to market is the critical factor in determining if the grower will <Col N="1593" />make an economic return on early thinning. My Department is currently working on developing local markets for early thinnings, particularly in the area of wood energy. In this context three potential sources of wood energy have already been identified, viz. early thinnings, forest-harvesting residues and short-rotation forestry.</P>

      <P>Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists, so that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists over 12 months and children waiting over six months for surgical procedures.</P>
      <P>Public patients who satisfy the criteria can apply to their general practitioners, medical consultant or to their local health board to seek to have their treatment carried out under the NTPF. In addition, patients have been invited to contact the NTPF via a locall telephone number. The vast majority of referrals under this initiative are made by medical consultants.</P>

      <P>The figures recently published by the Minister for Finance in the 2003 Revised Estimates for public services, REV, show the Department of Health and Children's non-capital gross Vote at &euro;8.644 billion. This represents an increase of &euro;952 million on the 2002 Revised Estimates for public services, REV, and &euro;798 million on the 2002 outturn. This can hardly be described as a cutback in spending. The overall capital programme in 2003 is &euro;514 million. This is &euro;18 million over the 2002 figure for capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>Since taking office in 1997 the total gross Vote for health has risen from &euro;3.497 billion to the current level of &euro;9.158 billion, an increase of &euro;5.661 billion, which translates as some 162%. The additional non-capital funding for 2003 comprises two broad elements of moneys, one for technical items and the other for services.</P>
      <P>Technical items comprise some &euro;859 million, which includes increased funding for pay and inflation adjustments, the general medical services scheme, blood products and increased funding of &euro;60 million for compensation payments to persons infected with hepatitis C or HIV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Services programmes have received some &euro;229 million in additional funding, including &euro;117 million for hospital services, of which &euro;53 million was for the bed capacity programme, &euro;29 million for cancer services and &euro;26 million for acute hospital services, &euro;63 million for continuing care services, of which &euro;15 million was for services for older people, &euro;31 million for disability services and &euro;7.6 million for mental health, &euro;26 million for primary care services, including &euro;10 million for development of GP co-ops and primary care units, &euro;8 <Col N="1595" />million for child care services, of which &euro;1.5 million for youth homelessness and &euro;15 million for other service programmes, of which &euro;7.1 million was for the cardiovascular strategy.</P>
    <P>The costs of the technical items and service programmes are offset by a package of increased income initiatives, efficiency targets and amendments to certain schemes, leaving a net overall increase of &euro;952 million available in 2003. It should be noted that this package should not result in service reductions, but is, in effect, an alternative source of funding and enhanced value for money.</P>

    <P>Two pieces of amending legislation on adoption and related issues are currently being progressed by my Department: (i) the heads of the Adoption Information, Post-Adoption Contact and Associated Issues Bill, were approved by Government in May 2001 and are currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting of the legislation, and (ii) draft heads of a Bill to ratify the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.</P>
    <P>Irish adoption legislation was first introduced in 1952 and has been amended by six subsequent Acts. The impact on legislation of the changing trends in adoption is one which I am currently pursuing. I hope to be in a position to produce a set of proposals in the near future and I would intend consulting widely on these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may <Col N="1598" />be aware, under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged are private arrangements between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Southern Health Board that the information requested by the Deputy is as follows: there are currently 518 people on a waiting list for enhanced subvention. Of these, 190 have already received an enhanced subvention and are awaiting further enhancement, 174 are in receipt of basic subvention plus an additional allocation under article 10.6 and 154 are in receipt of a basic subvention alone. The current waiting time is approximately 18 months. There are currently 82 people on a waiting list in nursing homes in County Kerry. All applicants for enhanced subvention have been placed on a waiting list and the position regarding enhanced subvention is reviewed on a weekly basis and is kept under constant review. My Department has made considerable resources available to the Southern Health Board in recent years to help cope with the pressures on the nursing home subvention scheme and in 2003 the board will spend almost &euro;17 million on subventions under the scheme. While total expenditure on the nursing home subvention scheme was just over &euro;30 million in 1998, it will amount to almost &euro;110 million in 2003, an increase of 267%.</P>

      <P>As part of the security measures being introduced by the USA following the attacks on 11 September 2001, the US Government has introduced a legal requirement for access to data on passengers travelling to, from or through the USA.</P>
      <P>The European Commission was concerned that the US requirements might infringe European data protection rules. This concern was shared by member states. The European Commission met the US authorities on 17 and 18 February 2003 to work out a compromise which will respect EU data rules and address the concerns of member states but which will also meet US demands. The main elements of such a compromise were arrived at following those discussions, and the final details have been agreed in recent days.</P>
      <P>Under the compromise agreement, US authorities will process passenger name and record data held by airlines in their computerised reservation systems, for passengers travelling to, from or through the US. In doing so, the US authorities have undertaken to respect EU data protection laws. The information held by the US will be treated as confidential personal information and will be protected by the US authorities from disclosure or inappropriate use.</P>
      <P>The European Commission will meet soon with airlines and data protection authorities from all member states, including Ireland, to explain the agreement reached with the US authorities and to elicit their views.</P>

Commissioning of these, which was due to begin on 3 February, has been delayed following the discovery of a fault in the gearbox of the cars in the plant of the manufacturer CAF in Bilbao, Spain. The cause of this defect has been identified and CAF is rectifying it at its own expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next four-car set is scheduled to arrive on 7 March 2003 and this will be used for series testing and commissioning. In the meantime, the <Col N="1603" />gearbox defect will be corrected on other trains. Commissioning and testing of each train will take 12 weeks to complete. I have been advised that the vehicles will be delivered at a rate of three trains per month and delivery will be completed in September 2003. The first train is due to enter service in June 2003 and all trains will be available for service by the end of year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 137, 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>In response to the first element of the Deputy's questions I would refer him to the publication of the legislation programme for the autumn 2002 session of the Houses of the Oireachtas wherein I had signalled my intention to bring such legislation forward during 2003.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 290 of 5 March 2003 I dealt with a number of the other questions raised by the Deputy today. Access to retained data for various purposes is allowed in law by virtue of section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 as amended by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993. The amendment to the Act in 1993 specifically allows for the disclosure of information concerning the use made of telecommunications services for the prevention or detection of crime, for the purpose of any criminal proceedings or in the interests of the security of the State on a request from a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Chief Superintendent and a member of the Defence Forces not below the rank of colonel. This amendment put the disclosure of such information on a statutory basis to ensure compliance with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is now proposed is that, following EU directives concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, a time limit be set on the period for which certain data on telecommunications usage must be retained for possible access, under specific circumstances and subject <Col N="1605" />to specific safeguards, by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The time limit being considered is three years which is shorter than the period for which licensed operators historically retained such information for billing purposes.</P>
    <P>On 24 February 2003, I hosted an information forum attended by a wide range of interested parties including industry representatives, civil rights groups and members of the legal profession. This forum was a first step in a consultative process that will continue up to and including the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. The data protection commissioner spoke at the forum and outlined his views on the matter, views which he had previously made known to me and my officials. I am arranging for the paper delivered by the data protection commissioner at the forum, together with the contributions from the Garda Síochána and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to be posted on the website of my Department at www.justice.ie. At that forum, I stated that I have an open mind in relation to all aspects of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>In the light of concerns expressed by the data Protection Commissioner and in advance of the drafting of the proposed legislation, the Government decided that, as an interim measure, directions under section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 should be issued by the then Minister for Public Enterprise in April 2002 to licensed operators to retain such data for a three year period. I previously referred to this in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 166 and 178 on 5 December, 2002.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of privacy raised by the Deputy, the 2002 EU directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector allows member states to legislate to retain such data for a limited period of time. As is stated in a preamble to the directive:</P>
    <P>it does not alter the existing balance between the individual's right to privacy and the possibility for member states to take the measures referred to in Article 15(1) of this directive, necessary for the protection of public security, defence, State security (. . . ) and the enforcement of criminal law. Consequently, this directive does not affect the ability of member states to carry out lawful interceptions of electronic communications, or take other measures, if necessary, for any of these purposes and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the provision in law of access to retained data has implications for the protection of privacy of individuals. Without legislation to set the parameters in which the privacy of individuals can be overridden we would risk creating a situation <Col N="1606" />where there is a free for all in relation to the use of such information. Irish constitutional law strongly supports a right to privacy and any legislation must take account of that. In framing the proposed legislation I will be guided not only by the EU directives, constitutional law and the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights but also by the work of the Law Reform Commission as represented by its 1996 consultation paper on Privacy: Surveillance and the Interception of Communications and its 1998 report on the same topic.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the legislation will be subject to the normal rigours of passage through the Oireachtas, including Committee Stage scrutiny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a crèche in Dublin 17 has submitted an application for additional funding towards its staffing costs. In 2000, this crèche was awarded grant assistance towards its staffing costs of &euro; 304,737 over three years under the equal opportunities child care programme. About a third of this sum is drawn down each year. This is the maximum amount normally made available towards the staffing costs of groups targeting disadvantage under the programme. It was envisaged that this amount would address its needs until end 2003.</P>
      <P>Further provision was made towards the staffing costs of a new after school child care service in June 2001 when a further staffing grant of &euro;114,276 was allocated to this crèche, again to cover three years and running to mid 2004. As a result, this service is currently receiving annual support of &euro;139,761 from the equal opportunities child care programme towards its staffing costs. I understand that it also receives considerable support from the local health board.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that the crèche has submitted a request for additional grant assistance towards its staffing costs. I understand that this application is currently under appraisal. Among the issues to be addressed in such appraisals are the capacity of the facility; the number of children availing of the facility and their hours of attendance; the number of staff involved in the delivery of the service; the ratio of staff to children; and the economic capacity of the client group to contribute to the operating cost of the service through fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" />As soon as clarification is given on these issues, I hope to be in a position to take a decision with regard to the level of funding appropriate to the service.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland concessionary travel scheme, provides free travel on cross-Border routes for passholders of both jurisdictions. This scheme applies to cross-Border journeys and not to travel exclusively within either jurisdiction. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to put in place an all Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island. Implementation of this scheme will require detailed discussions and agreements with the relevant authorities and transport providers on both sides of the Border. Work on this proposal will commence as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of proposals to extend entitlement for free travel to people living outside Ireland including a proposal contained in the Report of the Task Force on Policy Regarding Emigrants, which was submitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs last year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal, to make free travel available to persons in receipt of Irish pensions living abroad, will be examined in a future budgetary context taking account of the other demands for extension of the free travel scheme, the cost implications, compatibility with EU law, and administrative implications.</P>

At that stage, following a Government decision to continue the arrangements with An Post for a further three years these arrangements became the subject of complaints to the European Commission under both competition law and procurement law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" />The complaint relating to competition law has been closed by the Commission on the basis that there are no implications for my Department in this area. The complaint relating to procurement has also been investigated and the Commission considers that the present arrangements are not in compliance with EU procurement legislation and principles. It is my view that the reasoning put forward by the Commission is flawed and, following advice from the Attorney-General's office, the Commission has been notified of the Government's disagreement with the reasoned opinion. The matter may now be referred by the EU Commission to the European Court of Justice for determination.</P>

      <P>As part of its normal business, my Department undertakes a range of reviews of the effectiveness of its schemes and services. Such reviews are intended to ensure that the schemes continue to operate effectively and fulfil their objectives in the light of current needs. These reviews also highlight opportunities to rationalise and simplify the system. Any consequential changes to social welfare legislation arising from such reviews are normally incorporated in the annual Social Welfare Bills which implement the budget improvements in social welfare.</P>
      <P>In this year's Social Welfare Bill which has recently completed Committee Stage in the Dáil, I have taken the opportunity to introduce a number of scheme enhancements. Among others, these include the extension of entitlement to increases for qualified children aged between 18 and 22 to recipients of certain short-term social welfare payments. This provision is similar to the arrangements which currently apply to recipients of long-term social welfare payments. The Bill also provides for improvements in the payment after death arrangements where the deceased person was in receipt of a disability or unemployment related payment.</P>
      <P>Many of the conditions underlying social welfare schemes are intended to meet specific needs arising out of a contingency such as old age or unemployment, and to target scarce resources at those in greatest need. This may give rise to different treatment of claimants for different schemes. Differences of treatment in this way are not anomalies in the strict sense but they need to be kept under review to ensure that any differences in treatment continue to be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of its ongoing programme of expenditure reviews the Department is currently undertaking a review of the various income main<Col N="1610" />tenance payments for people who are ill and people with disabilities. This review will examine the roles and effectiveness of the range of income maintenance payments provided by the Department and the health boards. I hope to be in a position to address any unintended inconsistencies or anomalies that may arise in the relevant payments examined on completion of the review.</P>
    <P>Further developments in relation to pensions will be considered in the context of the phase 2 review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. The first phase report was published in 2000 and the second phase report is at an advanced stage of preparation and I expect to publish it in the next few months.</P>

On 28 February my Department formally notified every dentist on the panel of the terms of the agreement and supplied each one with a copy of the revised scale of fees, effective immediately.</P>

      <P>Policies relating to debt and how it can be avoided or overcome are informed by a number of sources and information on indebtedness is derived in a number of ways. For example, the Living in Ireland surveys undertaken by the ESRI contain data relating to debt problems which arise from ordinary living expenses. Analysis of the results of the 2000 survey, published by the ESRI in 2002, shows that the number of households affected by consistent poverty, of which debt is a component indicator, has fallen from some 15% in 1994 to 6.2% in 2000. The analysis also indicates that the incidence of debt problems arising from ordinary living expenses among households has declined from some 18% to under 6% in the same period. Qualitative information on debt problems experienced by some low income families is also contained in a number of research reports on poverty, such as &lsquo;Against all Odds', published in 2002 by the Com<Col N="1612" />bat Poverty Agency. Further information in this area is provided in reports of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and in reports from local authorities in relation to rental arrears.</P>
      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which provides assistance to people experiencing indebtedness. There are 52 independent companies nationwide operating the service. While the MABS does not generate statistics on indebtedness, the work undertaken by the service provides valuable insights into the experience of those confronted by problems associated with indebtedness. A National Advisory Committee, NAC, on which other parties such as credit unions, the Combat Poverty Agency and the St. Vincent de Paul Society are represented, advises me on policy in relation to the MABS. In addition to giving the service a direct link to national policy, the meetings of the committee enable an exchange of advice and information on the work of the service. They also enable discussion on policy issues arising from this work or discussion relevant to money advice and over-indebtedness. Policies and guidelines are elaborated following a process of consultation and discussion at the committee.</P>
