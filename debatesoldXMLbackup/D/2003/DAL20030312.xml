      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As we move towards St. Patrick's weekend, the world is consumed with arguments about the possibility of war on Iraq. Europe is now sharply divided on this issue. In recent weeks, I have endeavoured in the House to get a straight answer from the Taoiseach by direct questioning on the Government's attitude towards this potentially catastrophic situation. The Taoiseach travels to the United States today and has a private meeting with the US President tomorrow. He has already confirmed that he is opposed to war, that he supports the United Nations and that he has a difference of opinion with America on the issue of Iraq. He has also confirmed that he does not want to insult the American Government and people.</P>
      <P>In that context, has the Minister for Foreign Affairs been contacted by the US Secretary of State, Mr. Powell, in regard to Ireland's position on Iraq if an invasion by the United States takes place without a UN resolution? Has the Taoiseach had any contact from the US President on this point? If that is not the case, will the Taoiseach during his private meeting with President Bush tomorrow &ndash; as one friendly leader to another &ndash; inform the President that in the event of action being taken against Iraq by the United States on its own or with Britain without a second resolution from the United Nations, refuelling and over-flight facilities at Shannon will be withdrawn? Will the Taoiseach tell the American President in a straight manner that, as a friendly nation, friends can differ on issues of principle such as this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the Government has had numerous discussions with the US Administration, including with its envoy in Dublin, Ms Jane Fort. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has had a number of conversations with Ambassador Haass, and, while I do not think the Minister has had any discussions with Secretary of State Powell in recent days, he has had several discussions in past weeks. I <Col N="366" /> understand that the Minister spoke with Ambassador Haass on Saturday and Monday last.</P>
      <P>At my meetings in the United States, I will stress our consistent position which is support for the United Nations. I will restate that for the United Nations to be effective and respected, it must be united in purpose as well as in name. Saddam Hussein and his brutal regime in Iraq pose precisely the kind of threat to international peace and security with which the United Nations was created to deal. The ways and means of doing that were set out in the UN Charter in a very logical sequence and Ireland has supported the charter since 1955. The peoples of the United Nations, in whose name the charter is adopted, look to the members of the Security Council to try to find a compromise and to work together to do that. I hope they will succeed in that.</P>
      <P>My position remains as it was. If there is no second resolution, that creates major difficulties for everybody and means that military action would be taken by countries without the support of international opinion. At the last hour, I will restate the need for force to be averted if Saddam Hussein seizes the opportunity available to him and if the Security Council is allowed to do its job. The Security Council is still trying to do that. It has a resolution in front of it and is endeavouring to come to agreement on it. The UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has been working to the best of his ability in recent days to try to achieve compromise.</P>
      <P>If all of those things do not happen and war takes place unilaterally, the Government will recall the House and set out its position.</P>

      <P>I know that this is a difficult call for the Taoiseach to make, depending on the question he is asked. However, the Taoiseach is meeting in private with the US President tomorrow for a meeting scheduled to last half an hour. He has referred to Ireland's consistent position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If we support the United Nations and are opposed to war, can I assume that the Taoiseach will tell President Bush that, in the event of the US taking action against Iraq without a second resolution from the United Nations, Ireland's consistent position will be, in keeping with our United Nations traditions, that the over-flight and other facilities at Shannon will be withdrawn? Is that our consistent position and will the Taoiseach tell that to the American President?</P>
      <P>Has the Government considered the question of support for the British position in regard to a second resolution and does the Taoiseach have a view on that?</P>

      <P>With regard to the first question, the Government has already relayed to the United States its concerns so it will not be hearing our position for the first time. However, I will relay those concerns again. The Government has, of course, discussed what action it will take if certain eventualities arise. I hope while in the United States to have the opportunity to state that. Deputy Kenny would also appreciate that, in the absence of a second resolution, we will set out a position in a way that befits whatever action we must take.</P>

      <P>There is no point in Members asking for a recall of the House in order for the Government to restate its position when the situation arises while, at the same time, calling on me to state that position now. I have not stated it since September and will not do so now. I am sure that Deputy Kenny and Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who cannot speak during Leaders' Questions, would, like me, acknowledge France's position which is very strong on all these issues. France has already stated its willingness to allow stop-over flights&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Taoiseach's remarks that, like the rest of his Cabinet in Cheltenham, he would like to take an each way bet on the war. I return to the contribution of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the debate last night on the Labour Party's freedom of information Bill. He said that the Information Commissioner had exceeded his powers. I ask the Taoiseach whether he agrees that the Government has abused its powers. The commentary this morning universally describes the actions of the Government, in conceiving legislative amendments in secret, as excessive, repressive, draconian and unnecessary. The comments of the Information Commissioner make clear that the Government's proposed amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 will effectively fillet the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" />Is the Taoiseach saying that the documents released, for example, under freedom of information legislation which showed the differences that exist between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance have somehow damaged the public debate on health? The week before last, a Beaumont Hospital memorandum was revealed. This morning, we had revelations about the Mater Hospital. Consultants in the Dublin region say that the 50 beds to be closed in the Mater are only the beginning and that between 300 and 350 beds will be closed in other Dublin hospitals. Doctors are idle, nurses are over-worked and patients are being denied access to beds, yet the Taoiseach is somehow saying that the public debate on this has been damaged by the release of documents under freedom of information legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach whether, at this late stage, he will accept the Labour Party Bill on freedom of information. That Bill would merely extend for one year the existing Act to allow for proper public consultation on a critical matter that informs the character of our democracy. Why does the Government persist in railroading its proposed changes through the Houses of the Oireachtas? I ask the Taoiseach whether he will, even at this stage, recall Cheltenham Charlie to at least defend the Bill amid the charade that is going on in the Upper House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Commissioner, in his report yesterday, stated that he would not comment on a Bill before the House. He went on to report on certain matters and to make suggestions which will be examined by the Department of Finance. Many of them, I believe, have already been examined by the Department of Finance as the report makes clear that they have been in correspondence for some time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte mentions matters such as reports from hospitals and correspondence between the Minister and chief executives of hospitals such as Beaumont, the Mater, the Wilton or any other. These will continue to be available under freedom of information legislation. The Government's proposed Bill has no implications for collective Cabinet responsibility, which is a constitutional provision, or for the deliberative process or working groups in Cabinet. As I outlined yesterday, information relating to matters of public interest, personal matters, travel and subsistence, use of the Government jet, communications between Ministers and chairmen and chief executives and staff employed as political advisers will continue to be available. It will not be affected by the proposed Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my fault that people continue to misunderstand this and to write about the issue in a way that is not factual. I can only state the factual position and hope that people listen to what I say. I cannot make journalists write it, but some of the points made in this morning's newspapers are untrue. Matters relating to the NRA, planning issues, the Competition Authority, valuations, <Col N="369" /> local authorities and hospitals are not affected by the Government Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to health issues, the Minister for Health and Children has been asked questions on the national airwaves about what is going on. A process takes place at this time every year of dealing with the hospitals, including the teacher training hospitals in Dublin, which are under particular focus today. That process will continue for another few weeks. Some 24% of entire State expenditure this year will be devoted to the Department of Health and Children. The Department has received an additional &euro;902 million since 2002. Of the entire expenditure increase provided for in the Book of Estimates for 2003 over 2002, 34% is allocated to the Department of Health and Children. We have increased hospital staff from 68,000 to 96,000. This figure was under 60,000 less than a decade ago. The Minister for Health and Children has received a large slice of available resources &ndash; over one third. I acknowledge that there are still difficulties. The Minister and his officials and the ERHA are trying to deal with them. They stem mainly from the fact that some hospitals have over-run their budgets for three years because they were insufficient to cope with their service demands. The Minister appreciates that, and I think that answers Deputy Rabbitte's question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply not true that the Information Commissioner does not concentrate on the deliberative process. At the heart of his criticism is the situation whereby a Secretary General can certify documents as being related to the deliberative process and, thus, not available for release. That is a fact. I ask the Taoiseach how he can reconcile the extent of cuts we are now seeing in the health service with statements by the Minister for Finance, who is away in Cheltenham and, no doubt, accepting the plaudits of the bloodstock industry, whom he protected from paying their fair share of taxation yet again. On 28 February, he stated that anyone who regarded the budgetary restrictions being imposed on Departments as cutbacks was &ldquo;numerically challenged.&rdquo;  We have heard this morning about 50 beds going in the Mater. Some 300 to 350 beds are to go in the Dublin teaching hospitals. Yet, the Minister for Finance went on to say that only a fool would describe what was going on in places like Beaumont and the Mater &ndash; where plans to treat 1,100 patients are being considered &ndash; as the result of Government cutbacks. I ask the Taoiseach whether he agrees with Cheltenham Charlie&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would totally object to anybody abusing the deliberative process. Let us be straight about the fact that the deliberative process ends at a particular period, so it cannot be abused within the legislation if the Secretary General certifies documents. I accept that somebody could allow the deliberative process to run for years, but that would be entirely against my wishes. There should be a clear end to the deliberative process.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte will accept that Article 28.4 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;the Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances&rdquo;. I do not believe that the legislation does anything other than safeguard these constitutional provisions. Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte has a more secretive mind than me and will abuse the new legislation, but I will not.</P>

      <P>My party would prefer if the Taoiseach did not pay a visit to the United States, given that a war in Iraq has been threatened, but it seems he is determined to go. He said yesterday and today that he would highlight the differences between the Irish and US positions during his discussions with the US President, Mr. Bush. If he is to set out a certain point of view and to stand by the United Nations, it is fair that he should tell the House what he will say to Mr. Bush and that he should explain how his opinion differs from the US President's view.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should clarify which United Nations he intends to stand by. Will he stand by the US interpretation of the UN, which is that a veto does not matter as long as there are nine votes in favour of a new Security Council resolution or will he stand by the view of the UN articulated by France, which is determined to ensure that the veto is respected, as required by international law? Will the Taoiseach take into account the perception in the EU, based on the negotiations on CAP reform, that Ireland is supporting the US view of the best way to proceed in relation to Iraq? The Government's position on this matter is damaging Ireland's position in the CAP reform negotiations. Will the Taoiseach take this opportunity, before he travels to the United States, to clarify his views to the House and the Irish people? Which view of the United Nations does he support?</P>

I have continually said that the UN should be united in purpose if it is to be effective and Ireland would like such a position to be achieved. I will say at the last hour, as I am saying today and will say tomorrow, that there is a need to avoid the use of force.

It is clear that the UN is not united at present, as there would be a resolution to this matter if it were. Is the Taoiseach aware that other bodies are making contingency plans in the expectation of a war? Development agencies are bracing themselves for an almighty humanitarian crisis and the business sector has arranged work stoppages in the event of war. The Irish Hotels Federation is bracing itself for a downturn in tourism and Aer Lingus has said it will refund the cost of tickets to those who do not wish to go to the US if a war breaks out. Irish citizens, such as Michael Bermingham, as well as citizens of other countries, including the US and the UK, are staying in Iraq to bear witness to the violence that will unfold. Haliburton, a company associated with Dick Cheney, is making plans to reconstruct Iraqi oil fields after the war.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Sargent did not hear me state yesterday that it is regrettable that efforts to implement Resolution 1441 have created tensions within the Security Council. Everybody knows that such tensions exist. One can see on television every night that permanent members of the council are working in direct opposition to each other, which is a cause of considerable regret. Ireland shares the goal of the United Nations in relation to reaching agreement.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department has two items of legislation for the 29th Dáil, the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill 2002 and the Interpretation Bill 2002. I have instructed my officials to commence work on the heads of a Bill to effect the transfer of responsibility for local State solicitors from the Office of the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

      <P>I would like it to come before the House soon. The office is working on a non-statutory basis at present, but I would like it to be established on a legislative basis, especially in the interests of the staff involved. The Bill will be brought forward when the House is ready to deal with it.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify a reply he gave to a question I asked during the last discussion on legislative priorities? It referred to the Government's plans on controlling the price of building land and outlawing the speculation which has taken place to such an outrageous degree and which puts in total jeopardy the right of people to purchase a home. This is because the owners of land banks decide to speculate and make a fortune.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the question on the legislative priorities for the current Dáil session. Does the Taoiseach intend to bring forward legislation to control the price of building land? I have been asking him this for the past six years. Will he stop the speculators who are making it impossible for young people to purchase a home and who are continuing to reap the outrageous profits they have been reaping?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is certainly limiting the range of supplementary questions. I wonder if it is in line with the precedent in the House because, in response to previous questions on the legislative programme, the Taoiseach certainly took the liberty of talking about the whole national question. He dealt with the North, partnership talks and some legislative programmes of other Departments. Is he allowed to extend his remit beyond his own Department although the Opposition is not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Taoiseach would have legislative priorities that go beyond his Department. Given the phenomenon of climate change and that we are 80% reliant on imported fuels, the Taoiseach should be interested because this will have an impact on every Department, including his own. Is greater urgency being accorded to the type of remedial action needed? A completely different economic outlook is required given that the Kyoto Protocol will lead to enormous fines being imposed on this country.</P>

      <P>My question does not refer to the Taoiseach's Department and it was worded very carefully. It asks the Taoiseach to outline his legislative priorities for 2003 and for the remainder of the 29th Dáil. I would have raised some of the questions that have already been posed, but I wish to raise again one which was asked throughout the term of the 28th Dáil and which was, at times, greeted with mockery and derision.</P>
      <P>I find it absolutely intolerable that the ground rent Bill is on the programme of the 29th Dáil again although the Taoiseach has absolutely no intention of bringing it forward and making it the priority that it should be for so many who are suffering the consequences of this Government's and previous Governments' failure to tackle this very important issue &ndash; I challenge the Taoiseach to clarify the position. This issue affects communities and urban areas not only in my own constituency but throughout the country. Will the Taoiseach make the ground rent Bill a priority of the Government in the course of the 29th Dáil? When exactly will he do so, rather than offering the glib, dismissive responses that we received to questions on this important legislation in the past?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach has a co-ordination and managerial role in respect of all legislation. Notwithstanding what has been stated in the past, inquiries about legislative priorities, such as that of Deputy Joe Higgins, constitute perfectly legitimate parliamentary questions to the Taoiseach. Members of the House will be aware that the Taoiseach can establish the legislative priorities of the Cabinet and order time through his Minister of State to give legislative proposals oxygen in this Chamber. On that basis, does the Taoiseach accept he has a unique role in articulating the Government's legislative priorities, not just those which emanate from his Department?</P>

I ask the Chair to note the Taoiseach's clear indication that a question on the legislative programme of the Government phrased in a particular way must be responded to citing its rank in terms of priority.

Questions Nos. 4 and 5 put by Deputy Kenny and me, respectively, make no such reference, nor did the Ceann Comhairle rule on my question. The baton was passed to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who is in a position to make a judgment, but has not ruled. I asked the Taoiseach his legislative priorities for 2003 and the remainder of the 29th Dáil. Is a ground rent Bill a priority for the Taoiseach in this Dáil term or during the course of the 29th Dáil? The responses we received between 1997 <Col N="382" /> and 2002 indicate that the Taoiseach does not intend to address this important issue seriously.

Does the Taoiseach think the discussions to which he referred will be concluded halfway through the life of this Government at which point the issue I raised will be dealt with?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I said in the course of my address at the launch of the programme of the Robert Emmet bicentenary commemoration on 20 September, 2002, a significant proportion of this year's commemoration budget will go to the Robert Emmet Association. Last year, &euro;7,000 was paid to the association to cover expenses already incurred and it is expected that this year approximately &euro;40,000 will be provided on receipt of costings of the details of the planned programme. The programme consists of publications, lectures, conferences and public events to commemorate the lives of Robert Emmet, Anne Devlin, Sarah Curran, Thomas Russell, Jemmy Hope, Michael Dwyer and Thomas Moore.</P>
      <P>While it is general policy to commemorate significant anniversaries of major historical events, preference is generally given to 50th, 75th and centennial anniversaries. There are no plans, therefore, to mark the 90th anniversary of the 1913 lockout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach plan to indirectly commemorate the 1913 lockout by legislating for the right to trade union representation, which was the issue involved in that event? It is ironic that 90 years later, the right to trade union recognition &ndash; meaning representation &ndash; is not guaranteed by law. What is the Taoiseach's disposition with regard to the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very limited resources in the budget to celebrate directly or indirectly anything other than 50th, 90th and 100th anniversaries. That is appropriate. The discussion of recognition issues is ongoing at EU level and within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I do not know if there are legislative proposals to be brought forward, but commitments were made in the programme for Government to continue the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach anticipate that the thorny question of trade union recognition will be resolved through the charter or social partnership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how the debate is going in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the right to trade union membership and representation should be guaranteed by the Constitution or enshrined in legislation now that 90 years have passed since the 1913 lockout? The right to be a member of a trade union is certainly underscored but the imperative of employers to accept trade union membership within their <Col N="384" /> workforce and to recognise and negotiate with the representatives of workers is something that needs to be guaranteed in law. I ask the Taoiseach if he would consider this an appropriate measure to undertake in this current year, the 90th anniversary of the dreadful events Mr. Murphy and others visited upon the workers of the city of Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 7 regarding the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the 1803 rising and the execution of Robert Emmet, the Taoiseach indicated in his response that a sum of &euro;47,000 had been allocated. With an office working in support of commemorative work and programmes by civic society during the course of the year, does the Taoiseach agree that &euro;47,000 is a derisory figure? This is a commemoration not only of Robert Emmet but also of Thomas Russell, Michael Dwyer an Ghleanna, Anne Devlin and Sarah Curran. These and other major figures in Irish history came together at a crucial and critical time. Would the Taoiseach consider it appropriate for the Government to undertake some special project in the course of this year to duly recognise the role and contribution of these many brave and eminent people? There is great public interest in Emmet, his contemporaries and his time. I saw the Emmet memorial in San Francisco before I saw the Dublin memorial which is buried among the bushes&mdash;</P>

      <P>In answer to the first question, I am not involved in discussions between the Tánaiste and the trade unions but those matters are set out in the programme and they will be pursued in that way.</P>
      <P>I have attended the launching and opening events of the commemorative programme. It is not the view of the organisers that the sum is a derisory amount. I only have a total budget of &euro;63,000 for this commemoration. There are perhaps others ways of accessing funding. It has taken practically all the resources I have available for the year. I am very supportive of the commemoration. I have worked with the people involved for the past two or three years and I continue to lend my support and will do anything that is helpful. The Office of Public Works would perhaps be the appropriate agency to assist with the placing of the monument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is entirely appropriate that his Government would not have any plans to celebrate or commemorate 1913 because many of the key policies on which the Government rests would be anath<Col N="385" /> ema to the men and women who fought to establish trade unionism and the rights of workers and their leaders, the great socialists such as James Connolly and Jim Larkin? I refer to the privatisation of public services, the free rein given to rackrenting landlords and land speculators, the huge proportional shift in wealth, over which the Taoiseach has presided, from working people to those with wealth and interest. I ask the Taoiseach what he thinks Robert Emmet who rose up prematurely and tragically against landlordism would make of the fact that English landlordism has now been replaced by almost as virulent a form of Irish landlordism which makes life extremely difficult for people trying to put a roof over their heads and trying to live a decent life?</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that the vast majority of trade unionists vote for my party and by extension, this Government. He has asked me what I think of Robert Emmet. I think a great deal of him. Over Christmas I read two books which have been published for the bicentenary. I do not consider that Emmet rose up against landlordism because that was not his aim in the rebellion.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach and Members of the House will be aware that Anne Devlin and Sarah Curran were both closely associated with Robert Emmet and are both associated with Rathfarnham in south County Dublin. A broad-based community group has been formed there to celebrate and mark the bicentenary year. I understand that a piece of sculpture sited in the open air is being actively considered. I ask the Taoiseach if it would be appropriate for this group to contact his office for assistance in furthering this project?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach says there are no plans for the commemoration of the 90th anniversary of the 1913 lockout. Will he refer to that event by strengthening the charter of fundamental rights being debated by the European Union <Col N="386" /> which proposes that trade union membership would become a legal entitlement?</P>
      <P>Will he agree that Robert Emmet might not be all that keen to have his life commemorated because it was not his life that he valued rather the objectives for which he stood and died? Will he agree that there should be more focus on Robert Emmet's message of inclusiveness and equal opportunity in society for both men and women as well as for people from different backgrounds? The widening gap between rich and poor indicates to me that Robert Emmet would probably prefer not to be commemorated. This nation has not yet fulfilled his objectives for a fair republic where everybody is treated equally. I suggest that should be the focus of the commemoration rather than giving some kind of sentimental history lesson which will miss the point of why Robert Emmet died.</P>

      <P>The commemorative programme has been in preparation for a number of years. I participated in the programme, I launched it in City Hall six months ago and I am offering it my support. It is not possible to change that programme at this point in the year. I support the programme and I had my say in what is being planned. People always remember the one line of Robert Emmet's speech but there is far more to the man than that one line about his epitaph.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 47, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I visited the Czech Republic on 30 and 31 January. The visit coincided with a very successful trade mission organised by Enterprise Ireland. I was accompanied on the visit by the Minister of State for Trade at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern. As part of the official programme, I had a meeting with the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vladimir Spidla, followed by a working lunch. The Prime Minister and I noted our excellent bilateral relations and in particular our bilateral economic relations which are developing in a very positive manner. The large trade delegation accompanying my visit was a clear indication of our intention to further enhance these relations. We discussed the broad range of European Union business, the Convention on the Future of Europe, EU enlargement, including the forthcoming referendum on EU accession which will take place in the Czech Republic on 15 June, and the Lisbon agenda. We also discussed the current international situation concerning Iraq.</P>
      <P>During my visit, I paid courtesy calls to the Chairman of the Senate of the Parliament, Mr. Petr Pithart, and had a very useful meeting with the outgoing President of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vaclav Havel. I was the last official guest to be received by President Havel before his retirement from office. The President particularly stressed the need to make EU institutions more accessible to the people and to reduce bureaucracy. He was particularly interested in the Northern Ireland peace process because of his many visits there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended a number of Enterprise Ireland business related events to mark important Czech-Irish business developments. I had an opportunity to meet members of the Irish business community in Prague and members of the Czech Friends of Ireland. I paid a courtesy call to the Chamber of <Col N="390" /> Deputies of the Parliament before returning to Dublin. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, remained on for an extra day to attend further business related events.</P>
    <P>On 6 February, I visited Lisbon. This visit, like my visit to Prague, formed part of a structured series of engagements at prime ministerial and ministerial level with our EU partners in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union and the ongoing business of the Union. I had a useful meeting with Prime Minister Barroso at which we discussed issues of mutual concern regarding both European Union and international matters. The meeting revealed a broad coincidence of interest between our countries on many issues at the European Convention.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the situation regarding Iraq and the postponement of the EU-Africa summit scheduled to be held in Lisbon in April. I paid a courtesy call to President Sampaio. When asked about the Iraqi situation, I pointed out that the Government wants to see the differences between Iraq and the rest of the international community resolved peaceably, through the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The President of the European Convention, Valery Giscard d'Estaing will visit Dublin on 26 March. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will host a lunch in his honour following which he will meet me in Government Buildings. Our meeting will present a useful opportunity to discuss the work of the European Convention to date. Following our meeting, he will pay a courtesy call to President McAleese.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Special European Council held on 17 February, I refer Members to my statement to the House on 18 February and the subsequent question and answer session. On this occasion, therefore, I will be brief in my comments. The meeting of the European Council on 17 February was both timely and useful. It was skilfully managed by the Greek Presidency, and Prime Minister Simitis is to be congratulated for the manner in which he prepared and handled the meeting. Ireland made a significant contribution to the shaping of the agreement which emerged from the meeting. The most important aspect of the meeting was that the European Council as a body was able to reach agreement. It should be recognised by all that there is an overwhelming consensus and that Ireland's approach to this issue is very much in line with that consensus. I had no bilateral meetings during the Council.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House in reply to questions on 29 January, I will attend the European Council in Brussels on 21 March. I will travel to Brussels on 20 March for the social summit. The objective of the social summit is to assist the Presidency of the Council in assessing progress towards achieving the goals of the Lisbon strategy. The social summit also ensures the participation of the European social partners in achieving the Lisbon goals. While a formal agenda for the social summit has not yet been received from the Greek Presidency, the normal format is that the first half of the summit allows for an exchange of views <Col N="391" /> between the Troika and the EU social partners on the Lisbon process. The second half usually involves presentations by the social partners, with interventions by the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council. The summit will be followed by a press conference.</P>
    <P>While the agenda for the European Council has not yet been finalised, the main item on the agenda for this Council will be to review the progress of the Lisbon Agenda. In addition, the Council will receive a report from the Chairman of the European Convention, Valery Giscard d'Estaing. The international agenda is also likely to arise at the European Council. Ireland's key priority for the Council will be to ensure that the momentum behind the Lisbon reform agenda is maintained. The Government has submitted a priorities paper to the Greek Presidency in which Ireland's objectives for the Council are set out and the likely priorities for the spring European Council in 2004 are outlined. In addition, I have co-signed a letter with the Dutch Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, on the internal market for services and a letter with the Swedish Prime Minister, Goran Persson, on small and medium enterprises and sustainable development. The Irish priorities paper and joint letters with the Dutch and Swedish Prime Ministers have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The next spring European Council will, of course, be during the Irish Presidency. I have no plans at this stage for bilateral meetings of the Council. That position might change because I believe there will be bilateral meetings. The next European Council following the spring Council will be held in Greece on 20 June. Dates have not yet been finalised for the two European Councils to be held during the Italian Presidency of the Union from June to December 2003.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the long reply. In a rather robust exchange here some weeks ago, the Minister for Defence was taking questions on the Government's decision to buy the first of a fleet of jets. During the exchange, he referred to the necessity to take trade missions abroad. He indicated that members of the trade mission might fly in the Government jet. Will the Taoiseach confirm that when trade missions travel abroad, as his did to Czechoslovakia, members of the Government and civil servants travel by jet, but industrialists and those involved in business do not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has he examined the papers from the European Convention produced to date? Deputy John Bruton, a member of the convention, has clarified that the comment &ldquo;the Union shall administer certain competencies on a federal basis&rdquo; refers specifically to certain competencies like the common agricultural policy or trade policy, which are dealt with on a federal basis. Does the Taoiseach agree with that? How does he envisage the documents produced by the convention to date will <Col N="392" /> be debated and clarified from the Government's point of view? </P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it important that each country retain a Commissioner in the context of the overall perception of the importance of what is known as &ldquo;the European project&ldquo;? In other words, will he continue to fight for the retention of a Commissioner for each country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the jet, we are considering the best and most cost effective way to deal with the matter. We have not reached a decision on the issue raised by the Deputy. Other countries bring the media and business people on trips, and they pay. The British Government, and several others, operate in this way, which probably makes some sense. It depends on the economics of the situation.</P>
      <P>Work is proceeding on the convention. Articles 1 to 18 have been presented and amendments have been tabled. Amendments were tabled on a federal basis. I am aware of the clarification of the federal basis. Deputy Kenny will agree that, even on the clarification, it is federal in the sense that the competencies covered work on a full Union basis. I understand that and I do not have great difficulty with it. I appreciate that Deputy Bruton has done a lot of good work in other areas, as have other Members of the House who are involved in the convention. However, it gives rise to people taking another meaning from it. As we know from recent referenda, when something is included, it is not easy to convince people what it means. I would prefer if it was not worded in that way, but it may not be possible to change it.</P>
      <P>Articles 18 to 24 are now being considered. The intention is that the full draft of the text should be available by May. There is some doubt whether it will be achieved but it is the intention. I am more concerned about Articles 1 to 18, to which there are more than 1,000 amendments. I saw some of the redrafts which did not seem to take account of many of the amendments. I am concerned about that issue because people have put in a lot of work. The Government is doing an enormous amount of work, as are other parties.</P>
      <P>On the question of a Commissioner, I hope to have a meeting with some of the other countries next week. During the debate on the Nice treaty, the argument was that there would be a strict rotational system. We would not always have a Commissioner. We would be out at certain times but so too would the larger countries. While that was not the ideal position, and there were some differences of opinion in the House on the issue, it was fair. Some of the larger countries were not happy but they agreed to that. They are changing their view now as are some of the smaller countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is the same as it was three years ago when this was last discussed. If we get to the position where we have 25 to 30 member states and each one has a Commissioner then we will get into different levels of Commissioners on the lines of Ministers and Ministers of State. I can see <Col N="393" /> that happening straight away. The question would then arise as to what level of Commissioner one would have in the future. Our Commissioner, so far, has always been at the table. I know that Commissioners do not act strictly for their country but there are advantages in being at the table. We have been lucky that our Commissioners have always been good there.</P>
    <P>The position is a matter of concern. At the moment we are sticking to the position as per the Nice treaty. We are looking at the other arguments and I think the debate will move forward. It will probably come down to the position where people will say that even if their Commissioner is not a front line Commissioner they would rather have that than none. I have no problem with that, but it is not as good as the present position. It is arguable. Some people feel it is not a good idea to be without a Commissioner. Others would say that not having a French or German Commissioner for a period makes no sense because France and Germany are both large countries and need a Commissioner at the table. The debate is open. My hunch is that there will be different levels of Commissioner.</P>

      <P>With regard to what the Taoiseach refers to as the international situation at the Council meeting, does he envisage any initiative being taken at that level? What is his view of the reported advice this morning of the UK Attorney General to Mr. Blair to the effect that any war without a UN mandate is illegal? This would imply that any overflights are similarly illegal. Does the Taoiseach intend to raise this issue at the forthcoming Council meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that at some session of the Council, or at some working dinner, Iraq will be discussed. The present position with the European Council is that it agreed what I reported on concerning the meeting a fortnight ago. Not much more can be done within the Council on an initiative. There is no move for an initiative because people feel the situation might have moved on between now and then if the Security Council meets and decides whether it can or cannot agree on a resolution. Those matters are still uncertain so there is no effort by the Presidency or by any of the member states to come to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>I do not want to comment on anything going on within the British system. It would be wrong for me to give an opinion on that. In regard to our own position, it is my preferred position to see a second resolution. If there is no second resolution we will have to see what we will do. On a strictly legal interpretation of advice I have got these issues do not arise. There are many examples over the years of where there were not resolutions but Shannon was available. Shannon was available and used at the time of the Vietnam conflict. It was used in more recent times for Kosova. Therefore, it is not an issue on a legal basis but there is more to this than law.</P>

      <P>I wish to expand slightly on Deputy Kenny's remarks in regard to No. 11. It would be impossible to have a report of the committee's deliberations because the committee met within the last hour to consider this issue. It is an extremely important matter whereby the provisions for mergers or acquisitions of media are referred to the Competition Authority for consideration. This has implications right across the country in regard to cross-ownership of critical media at local level. This was tabled for the committee this morning although on this week's Order Paper it was set down that the matter would come back from committee today. There was insufficient time for the committee to scrutinise it or bring in, as the committee wanted, representatives of the media who are directly affected by this. It is a bad way to do business and it negatives the proper scrutiny of legislation, which the committees were designed to do. There should be a debate on this issue.</P>

It needs to be given time and there is no reason this cannot be done. I am aware that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will refer later to a long break to allow Ministers vacate the country. It is important that we sit and debate issues that will be of immense significance, not just for media outlets and for national identity but also for competition in general &ndash; our corporation tax is so low that we cannot even afford basic park and ride facilities and transportation of people in employment as it is. There is an urgent need to discuss competition in the widest sense, but it would be completely irresponsible to rush through this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny said his bit earlier and I do not want to rise again. I look at the empty benches on the Government side. The Tánaiste gave a commitment to my colleague, Deputy Higgins, last week that there would be a debate this week on Iraq. There is no reason the Taoiseach ought not faciliate such a debate tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Given the gravity of the situation, the way things have changed since we last debated it, the humanitarian dimension, the changing situation in the United Kingdom there is no reason the Taoiseach would not respond to the comments of Deputy Kenny and the Labour Party to have that debate tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose those proposals. There is an air of unreality in this Chamber. We are talking about important Bills but in the context of the global situation that faces us it is crazy and irresponsible of this House to talk about guillotining these Bills and going on a break until 25 March. I ask that the Government take into account the serious responsibility of this House, and particularly of the Government, to debate the issue of Iraq in the event of an escalation of hostilities when this country, by its Constitution, will be flouting both its own laws and international law. That is an issue for which the Government has to accept responsibility. We are endeavouring to comply with the law and the Government is thwarting that effort.</P>

      <P>It is imperative to record our opposition to the proposal to guillotine a further important Bill. In the context of the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Iraq, and the question I posed to the Taoiseach yesterday, will he outline exactly when and how he intends to accommodate a special session of the Dáil in the event of full-<Col N="401" /> blown war being visited on the innocent of Iraq in the period during the recess in the coming week? Will the Taoiseach specify exactly, given that the proposal is to reconvene the Dáil on the following Tuesday? Will the Dáil be reconvened in the coming week if hostilities are visited on the people of Iraq beyond even current levels? Will he make clear to the House his real intentions?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to No. 15, the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003, was debated for seven hours on Committee Stage last week. Three hours has been allocated for debate today. There are ten amendments, seven of which were discussed on Committee Stage and referred back. Given the amount of time provided for debate today it is not likely to require a guillotine. Some of the parties who are objecting to the guillotine did not bother to turn up on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>On the question of Iraq, I gave a clear commitment in a reply yesterday to Deputy Ó Caoláin, which I had promised the House previously, that if the situation changes, if the UN resolution is not resolved or if is resolved, that we would recall the House next week. Ministers have not gone on a break. They are going around the world doing their business for this country and we will do that as successfully as we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not agreed. This Bill is being taken in the absence of the Minister and the Minister of State who are in Cheltenham. The Taoiseach is proposing to provide 75 minutes to discuss 47 amendments. A long debate took place on Committee Stage and many of these amendments are unresolved, specifically in relation to the credit union movement whose regulation is now being put into the Central Bank and the regulatory authority against its wishes. Also, consumer protection is being put under the Central Bank quite clearly against the wishes of consumer representatives. There are important issues to be debated on this Bill which will not be reached in this schedule. I recall that last week we discussed the Finance Bill when there were 93 amendments to be debated, only 26 of which were reached. Many amendments, introducing important measures, tabled by the Minister for Finance on <Col N="402" /> Report Stage were never debated. This is no way to run important issues in this House.</P>

      <P>There was a long debate on this Bill on Committee Stage. The Minister for Finance undertook to come back and explain in detail the implications of his proposals for the credit union movement and the outcome of his discussions with the credit union movement. In addition, he undertook to explain at length the new regulation in respect of consumer affairs and the Central Bank's role in relation to consumer affairs and how consumers would be reassured that the new regulatory authority would properly look after their affairs. In the absence of the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State there will be no proper debate on the Report Stage of this important Bill which will govern the regulation of financial services here. We saw yesterday how financial services have lost about &euro;2 billion in equity for investors this year alone. It is an important issue for most families here and the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State will not be available due to their engagements in Cheltenham. It is not good enough for the families whose pension funds are at risk by the collapse of the equity market. It is a really important issue for families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to this proposal and the comment made by the Taoiseach earlier, the reduction in time for Report Stage is an insult to the House. It affects, most particularly, Members of smaller parties who are not members of particular committees and whose only opportunity is to speak on Report Stage. That the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State are not present to take the Bill is an undoubted insult to the House. In regard to the incident the Taoiseach mentioned, as social and family affairs spokesperson for my party, I was not present for the debate on Committee Stage last week, but I was in this Chamber, as finance spokesperson for my party, debating Report Stage of the Finance Bill. If the House is to operate effectively and if Opposition Members are to be properly informed and contribute to all legislation it is the Taoiseach's responsibility and that of his chief whip make appropriate time available to allow us do our job properly.</P>

      <P>Before the Taoiseach starts to point the finger of accusation at small parties who cannot accommodate attendance at several <Col N="403" /> different committees, given that we do not have the gift of bi-locaton, he might look around the front benches of his party this morning. Many of the Cabinet Ministers have more pictures in <i>The Irish Times</i> today than they would ordinarily get if they were performing in this Chamber. It has nothing to do with political representation. They have more photographs than do the jockeys in the winners' enclosure in the newspapers this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the Finance Bill that passed through this House last week is that the Report and Final Stages were dealt with in the most disgraceful way. There was no substantive debate on Report and Final Stages of the Finance Bill. Quite clearly with the intent of guillotining the Central Bank and Financial Services Auth<Col N="404" /> ority of Ireland Bill there will be a repeat of last week's performance. The reality is that we will not have the responsible Ministers present.</P>

      <P>We have, for two days now, heard a new spin on a commitment given last week that we would have a debate on Iraq. We were told such a debate could take place if there was a change in position. Apart from the fact that that change has taken place, who is to say whether the debate is justified? I put it to the Taoiseach that there are matters on Iraq that have never been discussed in this House. Neither he nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has made one substantial reference in any statement to the Dáil on the humanitarian consequences of a war. Not one paragraph has been devoted to that issue. Yet, by the time this House returns on Tuesday, 25 March it is possible that up to one million mothers may be affected by war, there may be 100,000 direct casualties and 400,000 secondary ones, ten to 15 million people on food dependency may also be affected. That that does not merit a debate in this House is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is fudging the question on where he stands regarding the illegality or otherwise of a pre-emptive strike and the action by a super State outside the ambit of the United Nations Charter. That matter has not been discussed in this House. The Taoiseach says he is in favour of the United Nations. Is he in favour of the UN Charter? If not, which proposal in the Security Council does he favour? If an illegal action takes place, what is the status of all his previous actions on Shannon? The Taoiseach as good as said this morning that irrespective of legality or otherwise he will allow Shannon to be used for business purposes. That is a change.</P>

The Chief Whip has come up with a cheap suggestion that if matters change we will have a debate. There is time for a debate tonight, tomorrow or next week. I do not want it to happen in my name that this House adjourned on the brink of war, on the verge of illegality with all its consequences not only of a humanitarian kind but of an international legal and political kind. The Government will come back on the 25 March happy in the knowledge that it got away without offering an opinion. One wishes we were members of the Security Council. We might at least have had to make up our mind.</P>

We have been left under a cloud of confusion that the House might be recalled but we do not know under what circumstances. The House should sit tomorrow to discuss Iraq and one of the Bills on the Order Paper. There is no excuse for the House not to sit tomorrow. The Taoiseach will be excused to go to America where he has important business to do on behalf of the Government, namely, to outline our consistent position, whatever that may be, to the American President. The House should be able to sit in his absence, as we have done for the past number of weeks.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Michael Higgins, I am opposed to this adjournment because we require a debate on Iraq. The position is changing every day. What are the precise circumstances in which we will have a debate on Iraq? Reading between the lines of what the Taoiseach said this morning, it is clear that he is prepared to allow the US to continue to use Shannon Airport even if there is not a UN resolution, which is a disgrace. It is disgraceful that the Taoiseach, as the leader of a so-called neutral country, endorses that position. The Taoiseach said he had respect for the UN, but he does not have respect for the UN or for this House.</P>

I asked the Taoiseach earlier today and yesterday about bringing the House together for an emergency debate on any escalation in the situation. I emphasise the word &ldquo;escalation&rdquo; because I argued last week that the US-British axis of war on the people of Iraq is already in operation with bombing occurring in different locations throughout Iraq.</P>

      <P>It is clear the Taoiseach's somewhat disregard for the importance of this issue is reflected by some of his backbenchers. The Taoiseach gave a commitment and yesterday he stated that he would honour the commitment. I ask him to be specific because he was unspecified yesterday. I have already asked the Taoiseach today but I got no reply. I ask him to be specific as to exactly when and in what way he will accommodate a special debate in this House, a debate which should be scheduled now. Will he schedule such a debate now or what are his intentions to carry out his so-called commitment to honour a promise made to this House? I want it spelled out clearly. It is imperative we do that. It is not acceptable that we will resume busi<Col N="408" /> ness on Tuesday week next if, in the interim, there is a full scale onslaught against the innocent people of Iraq.</P>
      <P>Time is being lost on a raft of important issues. The Taoiseach was not in the House last week as he had important business to attend to on Tuesday and part of Wednesday. This House has not had the opportunity to engage with the Taoiseach on the very important talks which took place in Hillsborough. All that is being held back in terms of questions to the Taoiseach which are well down the Order Paper. That issue needs to be addressed and I do not think the briefings to some of the parties are enough in terms of fulfilling the obligation to properly inform the Members of this House of the detail of the discussions which took place and the positions reached. To accommodate a proper debate on legislation, the House should not go into recess in the coming week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the House note the passing of Mr. Dick Walsh, the esteemed journalist who served the public and this House over many years in his work at <i>The Irish Times</i>. He used the corridors of this House for many years, made contact with a great number of politicians and members of the public and could always be relied upon to report the truth as he saw it. I regret his untimely passing and think it appropriate that the House should note the extent and range of his public service in his duty as an objective journalist.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Kenny in his remarks. It is only a few short weeks since I spoke at a reception to mark Dick Walsh's retirement. It is hard to believe that a man who was for so long at the heart of Irish political life has passed from us. I extend my sympathy to his wife, Ruth, and his two daughters, Francesca and Suzanne. There is no doubt that Mr. Walsh was a man of independent mind and deep convictions, dedicated in the pursuit of his craft and with strongly held views about Irish journalism. He had the opportunity to talk just a few weeks ago about how journalism and the media should develop in Ireland, a subject on which he had strong views. I extend my sympathy to his wife and children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the House should mark the passing of arguably the finest political reporter and commentator of his generation. Dick Walsh was a punctilious reporter and an outspoken and forthright commentator. He bore his disability with great courage and good grace. His only complaint was to empathise with others with disability. Many endured his lash as a critic and columnist but he was never less than straightforward and honest, and a man of fierce independence.</P>
      <P>He had a profound impact on politics and politicians over a generation. Mr. Walsh took an independent and courageous position in commentating on Irish politics since the Troubles, showing fierce resistance to the use of force in politics and defending pluralist principles and those of equality, peace and justice. It is appropriate that the House should mark his passing. I want to be associated with the remarks of genuine sympathy to Ruth and his children.</P>

      <P>There is a genuine sense of loss and the feeling of the passing of an era in hearing of the death of Dick Walsh. In many ways, the quality and consistency of his writing was a yardstick by which many others measured their views, whether in journalism or politics. It is doubly tragic that not only has Irish society lost somebody of the calibre of Mr. Walsh but also that he died so young and so soon after his retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" />It is frequently said how rigorous is a life in politics, but the death of Dick Walsh, who was so dedicated to his profession, is a reminder to all of us that the life of a journalist can be difficult and demanding also.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the adverse financial effect to lone parents in returning to the workforce under the FÁS Jobs Initiative Programme and to report on the number of lone parents who have seen a reduction in their weekly income as a result of recent wage increases under the Programme.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I said to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on Committee Stage last week, an amendment is necessary to provide for lone parents who are involved in FÁS schemes. Such people have received an increase of &euro;10, but they have lost &euro;60 from their lone parent payments. I hoped the Minister would deal with this matter this week to assist those who are trying to return to the workplace and to better themselves so they will not be a burden on the State at a later stage. It is wrong that people who are receiving training so they can get a job should lose out, but they have lost &euro;60 because the Government has not raised the ceiling to take account of the &euro;10 increase. I will call a vote on this matter if it transpires that the Minister has not considered this amendment in the past week.</P>
      <P>People on the job initiative scheme will also be affected. The ceiling pertaining to PRSI has not been increased and therefore they find that they have to pay PRSI. People who have been unemployed for many years and who joined job initiative schemes to be retrained to re-enter the work force find themselves being penalised simply because the Government gave them an increase of &euro;10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure to raise the PRSI ceiling had a knock-on effect. This is wrong because the people affected are the most vulnerable in society. They find it difficult enough as it is and the payments they are getting are not great. I hope the Minister can resolve this issue today. As she said on Com<Col N="420" /> mittee Stage last week, it will affect only 400 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should increase the ceiling. Because the lone parents got an increase of &euro;10 they are losing &euro;60. The Minister should deal with this today and I hope she will respond positively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I felt the Minister understood the case the Opposition was making on behalf of some of the most marginalised in society and the effect the legislation was having on them. I hoped and expected that she would re-examine the issue to see what could be done.</P>
      <P>The fabric of local communities is being damaged and the viability of several community employment schemes is being diminished. Community arts organisations are under serious threat. Amendment No. 13 refers to the necessity to deal with the problem of lone parents being hit by the failure to raise the PRSI threshold following the increase in pay in the job initiative scheme. This problem also renders the people concerned ineligible for the rent allowance.</P>
      <P>The failure to adjust the threshold to correspond with the pay increase is putting the average male participant on the job initiative scheme into a different category, thus reducing the value of his increase. Furthermore, the requirement to be unemployed for five years or more to qualify for the back to work allowance is cynically restricting the possibility of finding suitable candidates for the scheme, and this is effectively terminating it.</P>
      <P>The failure to make adjustments is affecting income, the ability to encourage people to come back to work, the benefit of that work to the community and the chances of attracting the right calibre of people into the scheme. I hope for a positive response from the Minister on all these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues have made an eloquent case and we spoke about the issue last week on Committee Stage. The problem in question is not just confined to Dublin. Last Friday, a young girl at one of my clinics stated that she had received a small increase. However the impact of this increase was to diminish her lone parent's allowance significantly. It also had an impact on her rent allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure to raise the threshold will certainly have a significant impact. As Deputy Ring stated, about 400 people will be affected. However, this is not a huge number and therefore it should be possible to deal with the issue. Failure to raise the threshold will also result in a poverty trap, which I feel is not the intention of the Minister. She indicated on Committee Stage that she would dis<Col N="421" /> cuss the matter with FÁS. Has there been a positive outcome to these discussions?</P>
    <P>There are some significant development companies, set up on a voluntary basis, to bring people back into employment. The job initiative scheme is very worthwhile and its participants are involved in very important community programmes. Many people employed on them are paid a gross amount which is below the threshold for payment of PRSI. If an annual pay increase is made by FÁS and the annual PRSI threshold is not increased accordingly, participants become eligible to pay PRSI, which they would not have had to pay beforehand. When trying to co-ordinate all the relevant schemes it is difficult to ensure that their intent is not damaged by a failure to make necessary provisions in respect of PRSI.</P>
    <P>On 6 January FÁS increased the gross weekly pay for job initiative participants from &euro;286.35 to &euro;298.40. The threshold figure below which PRSI was not payable in 2002 was &euro;287, but this has not changed in 2003. Therefore the weekly gain from the increase of &euro;12 will be neutralised. The increase by FÁS, made to keep wages in line with inflation, will be seen as a failure because of this anomaly. Some participants will stop availing of other benefits if the threshold figures are treated as per the PRSI sector.</P>
    <P>There is much concern about this matter in the voluntary sector. As my colleague has said, lone parents can lose up to &euro;60. I know one who is losing &euro;53 or &euro;54. Therefore, they will drop out of the very scheme in which they are encouraged to participate.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will press amendment No. 13 and support that of Deputy Ring very strongly. We gave the Minister an opportunity on Committee Stage to examine the matter, bearing in mind all the various bodies involved. I hope she has had positive discussions and will adjust the threshold to ensure that the people who are most in need do not lose out at this critical time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As promised on Committee Stage, my officials and I have taken on board the issues raised by the committee and there was contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>We must examine the job initiative scheme and the policy approach. As we all know, the scheme is one of the FÁS schemes in which many lone parents can participate. The intention of the policy is that people will gain a foothold in the jobs market through the scheme. My Department has taken into consideration the concerns that have existed over the years in terms of why people do not progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reason we have a substantial income disregard of &euro;293 per week for lone parents. Deputies will be aware that an increase in the payment to those on the jobs initiative scheme brought their income above the disregard. I have had discussions with Members of the House and <Col N="422" /> officials from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to establish what can be done to address this anomaly. I am not in a position to increase the income disregard because of the effect of such a measure on consequential schemes. There is also an equality issue in terms of people on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit who do not receive income disregards and would be justified in thinking we were more favourably disposed to others. It is our opinion that those who reach the threshold and are still entitled to the transitional payment outlined on Committee Stage will also be entitled to family income supplement.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement is provided annually and the thresholds are updated at every budget. This means the issues which have arisen with regard to the jobs initiative scheme will not be problematic. If someone is above the threshold, they will receive the jobs initiative payment from FÁS, a reduced one parent family allowance and family income supplement which will bring their payment levels back up. After 12 months, the one parent family allowance will be reduced, but the family income supplement will increase while the thresholds will change at every budget. It is not a perfect solution, but it addresses the concerns which have been expressed by the Members of the House which I share. If this approach is agreed, we will progress with family income supplement and my Department will facilitate the 400 or so people affected with an application form. The difficulty with a threshold is that someone will inevitably reach and exceed it. We are seeing the consequences of that. Substantial tax credits mean that in the cases I have outlined, lone parents do not pay income tax. I agree that overall the treatment of lone parents in the tax and social welfare codes is very favourable. Many Members will have been made aware of the OECD report which indicated that Ireland is the member state most favourably disposed towards and supportive of lone parents within the EU.</P>
    <P>With effect from the 2000-01 tax year, all employees covered under classes A, B, C, D, E, and H with reckonable earnings of not more than &euro;287 per week have been exempt from making an employee social insurance contribution. The introduction of the exemption was informed by the negotiation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and was principally designed to increase the net pay of those on lower incomes. If the PRSI exemption thresholds were raised to &euro;298.40 per week to facilitate those currently taking part in the jobs initiative scheme, they would have to be introduced for all employees within the same earnings band. To differentiate would be inequitable and discriminate against other categories of lower paid worker. The most recent figures available indicate that to implement such a measure would affect approximately 21,300 employments and cost in the region of &euro;7.1 mill<Col N="423" /> ion in a full year. Therefore, it is not proposed to adjust the threshold at this time.</P>
    <P>Class A employees with reckonable earnings of over &euro;287 per week pay a social insurance contribution of 4% up to the employee earnings ceiling. Due to the flexibility of the jobs initiative scheme, the income earned exceeds what would constitute a normal take home pay for many on low pay. I am not in a position to change the PRSI exemptions which will have to remain as they are this year because of financial implications. It would be unfair and wrong to change the exemptions for people on the jobs initiative scheme. If they were changed, the measure would have to be introduced for all workers who find themselves at the threshold.</P>
    <P>I hope the concerns of Members are addressed to some extent. I can provide them with an information note on the matter and ask my officials to facilitate those who require an application for family income supplement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fair to the Minister, she has gone some way towards addressing the problem that has arisen through the recent payment increases in the FÁS scheme. I have spoken on Committee Stage about family income supplement which can be retained by those whose incomes rise during the year, but cannot be increased in the cases of those whose earnings fall. There is no appeals mechanism in place which means they have to wait for the annual review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the overall scheme of things which we will be talking about later.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister's difficulty. If she increases the threshold for family income supplement, she will have to do it for all other schemes with inevitable knock-on effects. However, the Minister and her Department must examine this area to encourage people to do better for themselves. We are trying to get people to retrain and re-enter the job market. We do not want them to find that they are worse off if they adopt that course of action. Those on the jobs initiative scheme will question the loss of &euro;60 and wonder about the effect on their rent supplement which might lead them to give up the payments to return to one parent family income. That is not good for society and it is not good for them. We want them to enter employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received much correspondence from a number of groups, particularly in the Dublin area, who are put out by this scheme. They feel it has a negative effect. I cannot criticise the Minister for making an effort to address this issue. We must wait to see what the knock-on effect will be on the people involved. I understand the costs to the taxpayer of providing threshold increases in all schemes, but the small number of people <Col N="424" /> involved led me to believe the matter could be dealt with within the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister is somewhat constrained in dealing with this problem. We have received a great deal of correspondence on the matter which has a direct impact on people who are doing their best to escape the poverty trap. I realise the Minister fears dealing with the issue may create a different element of discrimination in the social welfare system. How many people will feel the impact of an increase in the threshold from &euro;287 to &euro;298.40? I heard the Minister say the cost would be &euro;7.1 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister is obviously aware that she must deal with this in some fashion and she has taken cognisance of some of the points made. However, it is important that something be done for the communities affected, particularly the participants in the jobs initiative scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the exact date for submission to me of the Commissioner's annual report for 2002, which will contain the Garda crime statistics for that year, has not yet been determined.</P>
      <P>I understand statistics for the year 2002 are currently the subject of a validation process which must be completed before the final compilation of figures for inclusion in the annual report for 2002 can occur. Neither I nor my Department has any involvement in the generation, compilation or presentation of Garda crime statistics, and that includes the date by which the Commissioner's annual reports are produced in printed form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may recall that last year I published provisional Garda crime statistics in respect of the year 2001 pending the preparation of fully validated statistics by the Garda authorities, in <Col N="425" /> the interest of timeliness in reporting on a key quality-of-life indicator. Those provisional statistics were published in July 2002, and the validated figures, which were only slightly different from the provisional figures, were published in November 2002.</P>
    <P>I now intend to engage in a similar process this year in respect of the 2002 figures. I propose to seek provisional statistics from the Garda authorities and publish them as soon as possible, without awaiting the compilation of the full annual report for 2002. I expect that these statistics will be available to me in the near future, and there will be no avoidable delay on my part in making them publicly available.</P>
    <P>With respect to the annual reports for the year 2000 onwards, the format in which the reports present crime statistics has changed as a result of the PULSE information technology project. Specifically, the changeover to PULSE allowed the Garda to reorganise its crime classification system, so that it more accurately reflects the complex, modern criminal activities reported or known to the Garda Síochána. I remind the House that in January 2003, with Government approval, I established an expert group on crime statistics to examine the methods of collation and presentation of crime statistics by the Garda Síochána and other organisations involved in criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>In the context of the introduction of PULSE, the expert group will develop an accepted framework for the production and presentation of reported crime statistics over the coming decades. Such a framework, to be agreed following wide-ranging expert consultation, will also serve to inform and reassure members of the public of the integrity, validity and usefulness of official crime statistics. As part of its work, I understand the expert group is actively considering the issue of the timeliness of the production of Garda crime statistics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Garda PULSE computer system which records crime statistics was described recently by a District Court judge as &ldquo;totally and utterly unreliable&rdquo;. I am sure the Minister has heard those remarks and I ask for his comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the remarks attributed to the District Court judge. If I may put it this way, I appreciate that he was frustrated in respect of some incident that came before him. I would be very slow to dismiss out of hand the PULSE system because it is the system that last year produced the figures which showed a major upswing in crime figures and which was the subject of some public controversy. I would be very loath to go back to the pen and paper method. I think the PULSE system is more reliable.</P>

      <P>It would be a foolish and retrograde step to say that because there may be small hiccups in the PULSE system we should revert to a system which would allow a much more subjective view to be adopted by regional divisions of An Garda Síochána in presenting figures. Whatever inadequacies there may be in the PULSE system &ndash; and I do not believe they are as serious as the learned District Court judge's remarks suggested &ndash; it must be accepted that they are more likely to be more accurate than a system which is a donkey and cart method of recording everything by hand in ledgers.</P>

      <P>The Minister used the word &ldquo;timeliness&rdquo; in the last sentence of his answer when speaking about the crime statistics. I ask him how he can deal with a problem when he does not know what is the nature of the problem. Our crime statistics are produced months after the fact. Surely the crime statistics need to be published at least monthly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no principled objection to the production of monthly crime statistics if that would advance public awareness or enable a closer view to be taken on trends.

      <P>In light of considerable public disquiet as to whether crime statistics were reliable in the past, I decided to establish an expert group to advise on the compilation and validity of crime statistics. The Deputy's point is an interesting one which I will put to the expert group. Should we have monthly or bi-monthly figures so that we could have a clearer picture on a more timely basis of crime statistics? Not everything has to be done on an annual basis.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>when he plans to bring forward legislative proposals arising from the reports for the Commission on Liquor Licensing; the proposals he is considering in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7527/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Liquor Licensing was established in November 2000. Its remit is to review the liquor licensing system and make recommendations for a system geared to meet the needs of consumers in a competitive marketing environment, while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the commission has submitted three reports to date and I understand it is in the process of completing its final report. I spoke to the chairman today who told me it will be submitted to me in the coming fortnight. I will then seek Government approval to have it published in the normal way.</P>
      <P>As regards legislative proposals to give effect to the commission's recommendations, I have already announced a codification of the entire liquor licensing code. The codification I have in mind has two aspects. First, it will consolidate into a single instrument the licensing law provisions currently scattered over many statutes, some of them dating back to the early part of the 19th century. Second, it will reform the licensing laws and for this purpose will draw on the valuable work of both the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the strategic task force on alcohol and the recommendations for reform set out in their respective reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards timing, the position is that preparatory work has already commenced and I hope a draft general scheme of the codification Bill will be ready by the middle of next year. While I am not currently in a position to outline the content of the codification proposal, not least because I am still awaiting the final report of the commission, I can outline a number of guiding principles. The aim should be a rationalisation of licensing law in order to make the intoxicating liquor code more accessible and user-friendly for licensees and the public alike. The importance of public order and public health aspects must be fully recognised to prevent and reduce the incidence of alcohol-related harm. Clear and coherent legislative provisions that leave no room for ambiguity or doubt are required to ensure compliance with, and enforcement of, the law. Open and transparent decision-making procedure, including adequate advance notification for designated notice parties and opportunities for public <Col N="428" /> consultation, are essential. Objective criteria for granting licences are required that recognise, among other things, the need for an appropriate spatial distribution of licensed premises in order to serve the needs of local areas and their communities. Where possible, application and renewal procedures should be streamlined in order to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens and overheads.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Existing sanctions and penalties need to be reviewed and updated to fully reflect the gravity of offences in this area.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed in advance of the codification exercise. In its report on admission and service in licensed premises, published in December last, the Commission on Liquor Licensing identified certain weaknesses in the existing law in relation to drunkenness and pointed to the need to strengthen legislative provisions in this area. The commission made similar recommendations in relation to violent, quarrelsome and disorderly conduct on licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Having considered the commission's recommendations, I decided that an urgent response was called for and I intend, therefore, to bring proposals to Government as soon as possible for the necessary legislative changes, including stronger penalties, as recommended by the commission. The necessary preparatory work is already under way in my Department and I hope to obtain Government approval for the amending legislation before Easter.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the chairman and members of the Commission on Liquor Licensing for their commitment and hard work over the past two years, and also thank all those organisations and individuals who responded to the commission's invitations to submit views and proposals for changes in the licensing laws and thereby assisted the commission in its work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect a reply that was not related to the question. My question related to how the Minister proposed to deal with the report of the Commission on Liquor Licensing. Codification of the law, which already contains approximately 70 statutes, is a different matter. I am seeking an immediate response. The Minister is already on record in the media in regard to the issue. He has often enough leaked to the media that he intends to make proposals in regard to young people between the ages of 18 and 25 having mandatory proof of identification before being allowed into public houses, local authorities having a brief in regard to the allocation of licences and the hours of licensing and deregulation of the licensing laws. He is forever making speeches abroad about what he will do. However, his reply to me is that he will codify the licensing law sometime in 2004. I do not believe that can be done in 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" />I seek a specific answer from the Minister to the problems currently experienced in the licensed trade, including the manner in which licensed premises operate and the question of very large fatalities on the roads. A recent report indicated serious public order offences relating to under age and binge drinking. My question related to matters of that nature. I would like a response as to when he will have specific proposals on how to deal with what he is talking about to the media almost every day of the week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a different question from the one he now claims to have asked. He asked when I proposed to bring forward legislative proposals arising from the reports of the Commission on Liquor Licensing. Since I have not got the final report, which is a major report of that body, apart from the interim reports received to date, I cannot tell him about the steps I will take. Unlike the Deputy, I have not been privy to the text of the final report of the commission. I am not in a position, therefore, to answer the Deputy by saying that I intend to bring forward specific recommendations arising out of a report I have not yet seen.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the commission and its excellent chairman, Mr. Gordon Holmes, for all the work he has done. I assure the House that he told me this morning when I spoke to him on the phone that he will have the report with me in the next two weeks. When I know what the report contains, I will bring it to Government and the Deputy will then be in a position to ask me what I propose to do about it. Apart from that, I cannot engage in crystal ball gazing.</P>

When does the Minister intend to legislate specifically to deal with the four reports of the Commission on Liquor Licensing?</P>

      <P>I do not like to correct the Deputy unduly, but the question he asked was when do I plan to bring forward legislative proposals arising from the reports of the Commission on Liquor Licensing. Since the main report is yet to land on my desk, I cannot be more specific than I have been.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers. I do not accept that the events which led to the establishment of the Morris tribunal have any bearing on this case. Neither do I accept that the circumstances warrant the establishment of independent inquiry into the matter.</P>
      <P>In August 1989, the person in question, along with another individual, was arrested on suspicion of membership of an unlawful organisation. In November 1989, a file was submitted to the DPP who directed, in March 1990, that the person in question be charged in relation to firearms offences. Subsequently the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that no charges were to be proceeded with in relation to the person. The Garda Complaints Board investigated a complaint from the person and in April 1992 advised him that the board was satisfied that the matter had been thoroughly investigated and was of the opinion that neither an offence nor a breach of discipline on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána had been disclosed.</P>
      <P>Following an earlier parliamentary question from a colleague of the Deputy and other correspondence received from members of the Deputy's party, I requested a report on the matter from the Garda Commissioner. When I have had an opportunity to consider the Commissioner's report, I will communicate further with the Deputy and his party colleagues in the matter, particularly in relation to their request for a meeting.</P>

I do not wish to <Col N="431" /> become involved in a debate on the merits or demerits of a person's involvement with the Garda Síochána. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to prepare a report for me. When I have seen it, I will be in a position to draw my private conclusions on some of the questions raised by the Deputy. I have already indicated that at that stage, I will be in a position to decide whether to meet with the Deputy and other members of his party who have raised this issue. It would not be fair, especially as the Deputy has named the person, for me to go any further at this stage in discussing the merits or demerits of what happened in 1989. It was a long time ago and I am not in a position to pass judgment on where the truth of the matter lies.</P>

If matters were still under investigation or if the named individual was continuing to pursue his case it is strange that that the gun and ammunition were destroyed. It raises questions about the Garda complaints procedure, which has been shown to be ineffective. Thankfully, it has been suggested that it should be changed.</P>
      <P>If the Minister believes that questions remain to be answered, there should be a public investigation or inquiry into this matter because there are similarities between it and the subject under investigation by the Morris tribunal. It may not require a big investigation.</P>

It may be inferred from what the Deputy has said that a decision was made to destroy a firearm which was the subject of a current investigation. That is not the case. No significance should be attached to the fact that from time to time, the Garda destroy firearms in bulk which have fallen into its possession.</P>
      <P>I retain an open mind on these matters. The Garda complaints procedure, to which the Deputy referred, concluded 11 years ago. In view of this, I am not in a position to offer any fresh insights as to its adequacy until I receive a report from the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>The Children Act 2001, introduces a range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in <Col N="432" /> accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Three Departments have a role in implementing the Act &ndash; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. The National Children's Office has responsibility to oversee the implementation of the Act and co-ordinate regular working group meetings.</P>
      <P>The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided, among other things, for the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a diversion conference based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand; the establishment of the Children's Court; the introduction of a fines structure for children found guilty of offences and the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children; the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences; court orders to parents to exercise proper control over their children; the updating of the law in relation to cruelty to children and persons who cause or encourage a sexual offence on a child; reversing the burden of proof on parents whose children are found begging; a limited clean slate in respect of most offences committed by children; and provisions relating to the safety of children at entertainments.</P>
      <P>Garda youth diversion projects are crime prevention initiatives which adopt a multi-agency partnership approach to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level. The role of the projects is to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order, can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he proposes to respond to the third annual report of the Equality Authority which revealed widespread complaints of discrimination relating to gender, race and disability in the workplace and relating to members of the Traveller community in licensed premises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7529/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Equal Status Act 2000 prohibits discrimination on the same nine grounds in relation to access to and provision of goods and services. The functions of the authority, which was established under the 1998 Act, are to work towards the elimination of discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity on the grounds and in the areas covered by the equality legislation.</P>
      <P>The Equality Authority annual report for 2002, which the Minister launched on 6 March 2003, shows that in 2002 the authority received 10,978 general queries for information about equality and related legislation. Nearly half of the queries related to parental, maternity and adoptive leave entitlements. During 2002, the authority opened 532 new case files across all nine grounds. Those figures compare with a total of 752 new case files opened in 2001. Of the case files opened in 2002, 227 refer to the Employment Equality Act 1998 and 305 refer to the Equal Status Act 2000. With regard to the workplace, 88, or approximately 39%, of the new cases under the 1998 Act related to gender grounds, 43, or 19%, related to race grounds and 39, or 17%, related to disability grounds.</P>
      <P>Discrimination in relation to employment on grounds of gender and marital status has been prohibited since the mid-1970s. It is somewhat disappointing, therefore, that gender discrimination in employment, and in particular pregnancy related discrimination and dismissals, appear as a significant issue in the cases that are dealt with by the authority. However, it is heartening that during 2002 women who were dismissed because of pregnancy successfully sought redress under the Employment Equality Act in the Labour Court. This sends an unequivocal message to employers that such discrimination will not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>I note from the Equality Authority report that under the Equal Status Act access to licensed premises still constitutes by far the largest category of case work on hand. It is a significant and welcome development that the number of cases taken on by the authority in relation to the Traveller ground under the Equal Status Act dropped considerably from 340 in 2001 to 89 in 2002. This, perhaps, points to a maturing of attitudes on all sides in relation to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Equality Authority is empowered by the legislation to provide representation only where discrimination complaint cases have a strategic importance, I welcome the development by the authority, in conjunction with the Irish Traveller <Col N="435" /> Movement, in 2002 of a model for community advocacy which allows community-based groups to take on a role in supporting cases under the Equal Status Act 2000. This role is similar to that played by trade unions under the Employment Equality Act 1998. According to their annual report for 2002 there now appears to be a greater willingness on the part of Travellers and publicans to resolve issues without recourse to a full hearing before the Equality Tribunal.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, in December 2002 the Commission on Liquor Licensing presented its report on admission and service in licensed premises. Although it did not make recommendations for changes in equality legislation, it nonetheless made a number of suggestions arising from issues raised in submissions received by the commission.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The commission made it clear, however, that those suggestions requiring legislative changes would need further consideration and a wider consultative process. The Department is currently conducting such a consultative process with the interested parties, including the Equality Authority.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the equality infrastructure put in place, on the coming into force of the recent equality legislation, is sufficiently resourced to respond to discrimination in our society whether in the workplace or elsewhere. On the establishment of the Equality Authority in 1999, significant increased resources were provided for the authority compared with its predecessor, the Employment Equality Agency. The Revised Estimates for the Public Services for 2003 show that the grant-in-aid for the authority for 2003 is &euro;5.16 million. There are a total of 51 staff, including six job-sharers, serving in the authority at present. I am of the opinion that this level of resources is sufficient to enable the authority to carry out its statutory function to work towards the elimination of discrimination in our society.</P>

      <P>I thought I would get a direct and specific response to my question but it is mere waffle. I did not want an account of the functions of the Equality Authority or of the report which I have in front of me. I wanted to find out what the Minister's response is to matters such as that three quarters of all complaints in regard to licensed premises come from the Traveller community. How will he respond to that? The Minister has told me he will codify the law in regard to liquor licensing. By the time that is done we will all be grey and ancient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being done about migrant workers? There is a huge escalation in claims in regard to migrant workers and the recommendations of the authority. The authority cannot do all the work itself. How will the Government respond to actively deal with the discrimination in this area? <Col N="436" /> We see that 30% of all complaints brought by women relate to gender grounds. The number of claims on the issue of race have increased enormously. Will the Minister of State specify how he will deal with the serious issues of discrimination that have been highlighted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks what we are going to do about the many people who have been discriminated against. We have brought forward modern legislation, which is among the best in the world, to prevent discrimination. We inherited a situation from the previous Government, which included the Deputy's party, and have taken over an authority which was being funded to the tune of &euro;700,000 a year. We have increased funding seven fold for that authority. The latest figure is &euro;5.2 million and it now has a staff of 51. The legislation is in place and there is back-up from the Equality Authority. The legislation has only been in operation for the past two years but it is working. The fact that many people are coming forward and getting redress is indicative of that. In regard to the complaints taken under the Employment Equality legislation in 2002, only 30% of cases were successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 makes provision for the issue of age cards to persons who have attained the age of 18 years and who are therefore legally entitled to purchase and to consume alcohol in licensed premises. Detailed arrangements for the age card scheme are set out in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999.</P>
      <P>This voluntary age card scheme, which is operated by the Garda, is designed to assist licence holders to comply with legislative provisions relating to under-age drinking by providing evidence of age where a doubt exists. As an incentive towards greater use of the scheme, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides that in any proceedings against a licence holder for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person, it shall be a defence for the defendant to prove that an age card was looked for and was produced by the person in respect of whom the charge is brought. Serious penalties, including temporary closure of licensed premises, can result where a licenceholder is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an under age person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the sharp increase in alcohol consumption by young people in recent years, I have given consideration to the possibility of making the age card compulsory for certain age groups when purchasing intoxicating liquor. However, certain practical difficulties arise in this context. For example, it would be unreasonable to expect young tourists and visitors to this country to apply for the card. An alternative approach would be to require all young people within a defined age category to carry some proof of age in licensed premises. The aim would be to improve compliance with and enforcement of the <Col N="438" /> law in relation to under age consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>At present, I am considering how best to proceed in regard to this matter. As I mentioned earlier, I am waiting for the report of the Commission on Liquor Licensing which I will have within a fortnight. Deputies can be assured that, in that context, I will take steps to bring forward a system which will be effective in combating under age drinking.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with which we have to contend is that there is nothing wrong with a person aged 16 years of age spending all day and all night in a pub up to closing time. There is nothing illegal about it. There is nothing illegal in them being served Club orange if the publican is happy to have them there. There is nothing wrong with an 18 year old boy or girl bringing their 16 year old girlfriend or boyfriend into a public house and having a drink with them, as long as alcohol is not served to the under age minor. That clearly is a somewhat impractical state of affairs, certainly in regard to night time drinking. I am not against the notion of families going into pubs for soup and sandwiches, during the day especially, as that is part of our social fabric, but it does become a bit ridiculous if gardaí go into a licensed premises and find under age people there, whereupon they have to work out who is drinking alcopops and who is drinking minerals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy, in regard to the latter question, that the probable reason for low prosecution rates is the inadequacy of the legal infrastructure that members of the Garda have to operate. They must establish that people are drinking alcohol rather than similar looking minerals. How are they to do that? Are they to go around with syringes taking samples from glasses? This is not fanciful &ndash; recently, a District Court judge threw out a case on the basis that the garda could not prove beyond reasonable doubt whether something was an alcoholic drink. This is the kind of difficulty one faces in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that charging for a card makes it involuntary. As far as I am concerned, if a card system is introduced I do not want to make it an undue burden on the taxpayer. If I made it freely available, as the Deputy implies I should, people would abuse the system and ask for a number of these cards and keep going to Garda stations to get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the human rights training for the Garda Síochána currently provided at the Garda College, Templemore is as follows: Human rights and diversity training is provided for trainee gardaí. There is an inspectors' and sergeants' development course, a two day seminar, entitled &ldquo;human rights, anti-racism and ethics&rdquo;, <Col N="441" /> which aims to provide a basic introduction to international human rights standards.</P>
      <P>In order to further enhance and support human rights training, a generic human rights training course for Garda teacher-trainers has been developed and will be delivered between March and September this year to 132 teacher-trainers. The aim of the course is to facilitate the integration of human rights concerns, norms, principles and ethics into all relevant aspects of training courses.</P>
      <P>In accordance with best practice the course will be delivered by internal and external experts. It is proposed to involve staff from the Garda human rights office and the racial and inter-cultural office as well as Amnesty International and the University of Ulster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I very much welcome this progressive development. Will the Minister elaborate a bit more on it? As he knows, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has called for this for quite some time. It wants to know exactly how often will students have this particular module. How often does it happen and is it simply a case of half an hour a week?</P>
      <P>The Minister once famously described the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as racially prejudiced. That was before he became Minister. Does he agree that it might be a good idea if such a course was also introduced for his officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to members of the Garda and students who are going through Templemore, there is currently a module on human rights. It should be stressed that human rights are not merely to be found in what it is now fashionably called &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;, but the exemplification of our Constitution is also a human rights agenda which infuses everything that happens in Templemore and under which all of us have to operate. A training course for teachers-trainers is now being put in place so that all the teachers-trainers will infuse all their courses with human rights awareness rather than merely include a human rights module. It is perfectly reasonable that human rights should infuse everything.</P>
      <P>From all my dealings with it, I am satisfied that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the moving party in this country in relation to racial awareness and the moving agency in combating discrimination. The Department has been transformed dramatically, and I am not claiming credit for this. The merger of the Departments of Justice and Equality and Law Reform, which took place in 1997, has had a beneficial effect on both Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that this has been an amazing transformation, given that he, in his article in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>in 1998, was so damning in his criticism of that Department? Who takes the credit for this won<Col N="442" /> derful transformation to a Department which now understands the need for proper racial integration? The Minister previously stated that the Department's agenda had included the preservation of a racially homogeneous society. What has caused the transformation and who takes credit for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I mentioned racial homogeneity I was referring to the well acknowledged data from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when, in particular, people of the Jewish faith who sought admission to Ireland and members of the Jewish community who sought leave for their co-religionists to come and live here faced undoubted discrimination at the hands of the Irish State in general and the Department of Justice in particular. Anyone who doubts that need only look at some of the published literature in relation to that matter.</P>
      <P>More recently, it is undoubtedly the case too that the Department was on a learning curve in dealing with multi-racialism in Ireland. The article to which the Deputy refers concerned a scene, which was the subject of general disquiet in this House, of 200 adults and children queuing in the rain on a Saturday morning in St. Stephen's Green while trying to obtain documentation. Things have moved on dramatically since then.</P>

      <Quest>when he expects to receive the report of the Nally inquiry into allegations that the Garda withheld information from its counterparts in Northern Ireland which, it is claimed, might have helped to prevent the Omagh bombing; if it is intended to publish the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 50 of 6 February 2002, on 6 January 2003 I was advised by the members of the group established to examine matters arising from the report raising concerns at the activity of the Garda Síochána officers during 1998, dated 22 March 2002 and prepared by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland for the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they had intended to <Col N="443" /> submit their report to me before the end of 2002. That was their intention.</P>
      <P>However, in early December it emerged that there were further lines of inquiry which the group felt should be pursued. In these circumstances the members of the group informed me that completion of their work would of necessity take more time than they had previously envisaged but that they would present their report as soon as possible. When I receive the report I will make a statement on the group's findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was to have been with the Minister last December. We have not heard what was the further line of inquiry which had to be pursued. It appears that when a matter of controversy is raised an inquiry is simply established, we wait forever for the report of that inquiry and it never comes properly into the public domain. The group was originally given six months to produce a report but a further three months have gone by and we still do not know when a report will be made.</P>
      <P>We are referring to the serious allegation that the Garda had information which it did not disclose to the Northern Ireland authorities and which could have prevented the Omagh bombing. We still do not know the status of the inquiry, other than that the person under whom the inquiry was established has sought an extension, which seems to be open-ended. Has the Minister any more specific information than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the group consists of Mr. Dermot Nally, a former Secretary to the Government, Mr. Eamonn Barnes, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, and Mr. Joe Brosnan, a former Secretary of the Department of Justice. They were asked to carry out this examination.</P>
      <P>In December last it was my impression that the report was about to be given to me very shortly and that they had, effectively, completed their lines of inquiry, were wrapping up their inquiry and proposed to give me the report as soon as possible. However, a development took place at that stage. Extra information came into their hands which, I understand, involved examining information provided to them by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Consequent on that information they came to me and told me that they would have to reopen various lines of inquiry which they thought they had exhausted or satisfactorily concluded. They spent considerable time in January, February and the first portion of March working on those additional lines of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to give the group a deadline. However, I assure the Deputy that before it understood that these additional lines of inquiry were open to it, it was about to conclude its business punctually and effectively. There is no question of my having to apply the whip. The group wants to terminate this inquiry as soon as it can <Col N="444" /> do so in accordance with its duty as citizens and as people in whom the Government has placed its trust, and to get to the bottom of these matters in so far as it can.</P>

      <P>As I previously outlined to the House in response to Question No. 619 of 18 June 2002, security personnel became suspicious of the correspondence in question and handed it over to the Garda authorities. The correspondence in question was from a member of the Garda Síochána relating to the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. I understand that internal Garda disciplinary action was commenced against the member of the Garda Síochána and that the correspondence was being held in that regard.</P>
      <P>I was concerned at the length of time it was taking to resolve this matter, taking into account the circumstances and asked, particularly in the context of the Deputy's question of 6 February 2003, that the matter be finally resolved. I am very happy to inform the Deputy that the seized correspondence was returned to the superintendent of Dáil Éireann with an explanatory note outlining the circumstances around the withholding of the correspondence and the delay in forwarding it to the addressees.</P>
      <P>I further understand that the disciplinary proceedings have been properly discontinued. I am also assured by the Garda authorities that there is no question of the member involved being victimised in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information. It is good to get a specific response once in a while. This was a serious matter. A member of the Garda Síochána contacted Members of this House in relation to a matter of human rights concerning a student in Trinity College who came from China and was a member of the Falun Gong. The letters were seized and were not distributed to the Members of this <Col N="445" /> House. There are two aspects to this question. Why did letters, which were sent to me and others in this House and which reached the House, not reach us? That matter has still not been resolved. Apparently the Garda undertook an inquiry and disciplinary action against the member for having the temerity to send letters to Members of the Oireachtas. I would have thought every citizen of the State was entitled to communicate with Members as and when they wished within reason. This was by postal arrangement. Further questions need to be asked in relation to why the letters were seized by officers of this House, why the Garda conducted disciplinary proceedings against the gentleman in question and why I did not receive that and other letters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the letters have been furnished back to the Superintendent of the Houses and presumably the Deputy will receive correspondence which was furnished to him. The letters were opened as part of a routine security arrangement of the House at the time because of the anthrax scare. I have no axe to grind or point to defend on this issue. I agree with the Deputy that it is perfectly open to a member of the Garda Síochána to raise with any Member of this House a concern of the kind to which this correspondence apparently related. There should be no question of censorship or infraction of Garda discipline in the context of a member of the Garda Síochána being so concerned about an international human rights issue as to write to Members. Gardaí are not second class citizens. In the circumstances, therefore, the Deputy's sense of surprise is one I share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the circumstances are ever likely to occur again but I presume if it ever became apparent to anybody in authority in the Garda Síochána that one of its members had written to a Member of this House, in circumstances which were perfectly proper, the privacy of the Members of this House and the member of the Garda Síochána would be fully respected and no steps whatsoever would be taken to draw that member into formal or informal inquiries within the Garda Síochána. Gardaí are citizens of this world and are entitled to have their views on the issues we have raised. There is no question of it being behaviour which is inimical or inconsistent with membership of the Garda Síochána to raise an issue of human rights of an international type. If the Deputy asks what is to be done to prevent this happening in future, I would say it is extremely unlikely that anybody would embark on the regrettable course of action which took place on this occasion.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the action he intends to take arising from the decision of the Supreme Court on 19 February 2003 regarding Garda guidelines for the handling of persons who have been asked to undertake a breath-alcohol test on an intoxilyzer; if it is intended to place these guidelines on a statutory basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7320/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Road traffic legislation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. With respect to the enforcement of the existing legislation, which is, of course, a matter for the Garda Síochána, I understand that the background to the Supreme Court judgment in question is as follows.</P>
      <P>The matter concerned the arrest of a person in relation to an alleged offence of driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The case centred around the justification for an observation period of 20 minutes between arrival in the Garda station and the time at which the driver was required to give breath specimens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court held that insufficient evidence was given to the Circuit Court judge to draw a conclusion as to whether the 20-minute interval was reasonably necessary to the achievement of the statutory purpose of enforcing the drink driving legislation. The Supreme Court <Col N="447" /> further concluded that in another case where the same offence was alleged, there might be sufficient evidence on this point.</P>
    <P>I wish to explain the background to the requirement for this 20-minute interval prior to the taking of a breath sample. The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is the statutory body responsible under the Road Traffic Acts for the approval, supply and testing of evidential breath testing instruments used by the Garda Síochána. These instruments must comply with the requirements as set out by the medical bureau and, as part of the supply of this equipment to the Garda Síochána, the bureau instructs Garda operators on how to perform a valid evidential breath alcohol test.</P>
    <P>The 20-minute observation period is a recommendation of the medical bureau, in line with international best practice for obtaining a proper forensic breath specimen. This period is to allow for the possibility of what is known as the &lsquo;mouth alcohol' effect.</P>
    <P>Breath alcohol analysis measures the alcohol from the lungs, which is in equilibrium with the blood. However, if alcohol is present in the mouth, due to recent drinking, regurgitation or vomiting, this would affect the result of a subsequent breath test. Any resulting reading would be elevated, as the consequent concentration of alcohol would be much higher than in a person's blood or breath. By waiting 20 minutes, ample time will have elapsed to eliminate the possibility of this effect completely.</P>
    <P>The mouth alcohol effect is a physiological phenomenon and is independent of the apparatus used to determine the concentration of alcohol in breath. In other words, no matter what instrument the medical bureau approved, the recommendation of &lsquo;nil by mouth' for at least 20 minutes preceding a test would still be included in instructions to Garda operators.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that I have explained the real, obvious and ongoing requirement for a waiting period of 20 minutes. Coupled with the Supreme Court conclusion that in another case where the same offence was alleged, sufficient justifying evidence might be produced, I am advised that there is no need for the Garda authorities to review its current guidelines.</P>
    <P>Moreover, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has informed me that the Supreme Court judgment in question does not relate to or question the legislative provisions that underpin the operation of the system</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with that answer. The Minister is going back to his old ways of lecturing us again, telling me all about the intoxilyzer and how it works rather than answering the question. It is an important question as it relates to thousands of cases of drink driving. The Supreme Court found that the current guideline in regard to a particular case was invalid. Surely it is not a major step to put the informal Garda <Col N="448" /> guidelines on a statutory footing to ensure that any future cases would be proofed against the Supreme Court decision on the observation period of 20 minutes and that hundreds of hours of Garda time is not wasted in seeking to prosecute cases where the issue of the Supreme Court might be used? Can we have a more urgent sense of action in relation to this matter which concerns drink driving, fatalities on the roads and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the Attorney General but my advice is that the two judgments do not amount to a decision by the Supreme Court that current Garda guidelines are in any way defective. As I understand it, what the Supreme Court found was that there had to be affirmative evidence that there was a legitimate reason for keeping a person for 20 minutes before the test was administered to them. I understand the Department of Transport, having considered whether any amendment of regulations, statute or guidelines is necessary, has come to the conclusion that it is not. All that is required is that in cases where the defendant raises the issue of the validity or otherwise of a period of detention prior to the administration of a test, it is necessary for members of the Garda Síochana to show by positive evidence that it had some legitimate purpose in mind. It is implicit in the two judgments to hand from the Supreme Court that if evidence is given that the test validity is effectively underpinned by allowing time to prevent the mouth alcohol affect from contaminating the test that the courts would be disposed to accept that as a reasonable grounds for detention and it would not invalidate the test in question.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me what happens in hundreds of other cases. I do not know if this point was ever raised in other cases. All that is needed when this point is raised is for the Garda to give evidence to the court to the effect that they allow a 20 minute period to elapse to counter the mouth alcohol affect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Garda inspectorate which would have the power to investigate complaints and would also have the powers of an ombudsman. Work on the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill to provide for this is well advanced and I intend bringing it to Government in the near future with a view to publication later this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific question of a three-tier disciplinary process raised by the Deputy, I am still in the process of finalising my proposals and to that extent I do not wish to go into too much detail at this stage on the precise mechanisms proposed for the inspectorate. In general, however, I envisage the inspectorate having complete independence in the investigation or oversight of complaints. Some minor complaints &ndash; I use that term in a relative sense, as every genuine complaint is important to the person making it &ndash; ought to be capable of being resolved informally. More serious complaints would require formal investigation and one approach would be for the inspectorate, exercising its independent judgment to investigate such a complaint or to monitor and supervise the investigation of the complaint by the Garda Commissioner. In such a scheme, I envisage a category of very serious complaints which would, in all cases, have to be investigated directly by the inspectorate.</P>
      <P>This is one of the models I am considering but I emphasise that I am still in the process of finalising the details of my proposals. I am clear, however, that the inspectorate will be fully independent, will have the powers of an ombudsman, will have its own investigators and will have the capacity for the independent investigation or oversight of complaints.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 13 on 6 February last on the proposed role of the inspectorate and I draw particular attention to the commitment I gave to refer the draft proposals to the Human Rights Commission under the terms of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000.</P>

      <P>The Minister says the inspectorate will have the powers of an ombudsman. Why not go for the ombudsman model? Would that not have been preferable? Does the Minister accept that we witnessed difficulties with Garda conduct during the Reclaim the Streets debacle? We are aware of that brutality because of the presence of Indymedia and its cameras and had it not been there, there would be no investigation. The demonstrators may even have been disbelieved in many quarters. We have CCTV cameras throughout the city. Does the Minister believe the inspectorate should have the power to acquire CCTV footage which is usually used to catch criminals? It could also be used to monitor Garda conduct. Has the Minister envisaged such a power for the inspectorate?</P>

      <P>The Deputy also asked why I did not introduce an ombudsman in this area. An ombudsman responds to individual complaints. I want to have something capable of dealing with systemic problems in regions. It would not make sense to have two separate agencies in this area.</P>
      <P>The answer to the question regarding evidence in the possession of third parties is yes, an effective inspectorate would have to have the capacity not simply to obtain material which is in the possession of the Garda Síochana but also to have compulsory powers to acquire evidence from third parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard what the Minister intends doing to alleviate difficulties with FIS. Perhaps the Minister might clarify a point for me. During Committee Stage she stated that a lone parent under 66 years of age and over 35 years of age with one dependent child receives a payment of &euro;288.40 under the family income supplement scheme and receives a one-parent family allowance of &euro;79.10 per week amounting to &euro;367 per week. The Minister then said under the new rules taking account of a  &euro;10 increase the person will receive &euro;298.40 from the job initiative payment and &euro;39.55 from the one parent family payment totalling &euro;337.95. That indicates a loss of &euro;29.55. The media said there would be a loss of &euro;60 per week. Once one brings in FIS, one must take into consideration child benefit. When assessing eligibility for FIS &ndash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister responds, I would like the opportunity to speak on amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 13. Most of the points have, however, been covered. The Minister is probably aware of my particular disadvantage of not being a member of the Committee on Social and Family Affairs, even though I am a spokesperson on the area. Report Stage represents one of the few opportunities we have to comment on amendments we might have considered introducing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to lone parents and the job initiative programme, the Minister explained her case fairly well and the danger of the knock-on effect. One criticism I put to the Minister is that it is a good example of the lack of co-ordination in Government in that decisions are made by one Department but the implications of them on another are not thought through. Perhaps in her discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and <Col N="453" /> Employment in the future, the Minister might ask it for some degree of prior consultation in regard to the knock-on effects of these increases on people benefiting from services from her Department.</P>
    <P>There is a wider argument about PRSI and its use and benefits as a social insurance fund or as a flat rate tax but we do not need to go into that at the moment.</P>
    <P>I refer to Deputy Ryan's amendment. It is a well made point and goes back to my initial one that there should be an onus on Ministers who share the implications of decisions to report to the House on those implications, particularly in relation to increases in rates. Anomalies which arise in FÁS job schemes, whether the job initiative, the social economy or community employment schemes, have a marked effect on people in certain categories, including lone parents who were mentioned. There are other categories of welfare recipients who are also damaged by these knock-on effects. Perhaps, through the committee system, we could examine these anomalies periodically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we have clarified some of the issues. I will try to prepare a note for Members which will explain exactly what we propose to do. The Deputy asked about the number of people affected. The figure is 21,300 and the cost would be in the region of &euro;7.1 million in a full year. I appreciate it is not a perfect solution. I suppose one of the difficulties is that our welfare system is quite complex. Like everything else, if we were starting from this point, it might be different. That said, I hope we have been able to address to the best of our ability the concerns of Members, the partnerships and the people involved. We will continue to review the issues.</P>
      <P>In the context of employment supports and FÁS, we do a lot of work with FÁS and meet it on a regular basis. I take the point in regard to the impact of decisions of other Departments on our Department. Likewise, we are often criticised for the impact some of our rates have on schemes under the remit of other Departments. I take on board what has been said in the House. We will try to avoid these things happening but when one sets a threshold, someone is bound to reach it at a certain stage. When one tries to do one's best for people and tries to extend the limits as much as possible, one can find one's self in these difficult situations. I hope this will address the concerns of Members.</P>

      <P>We discussed this issue at length on Committee Stage. I pointed to the Minister that the recent increases in social welfare do not add up in relation to inflation. I wish to put on record some of the increases which affect people. Home heating oil and fuels are up 8%, motor tax is up 12%, hospital charges are up 26%, the drug refund scheme is up 31%, VHI is up 18%, cigarettes and alcohol are up 15%, bank charges are up 108%, bin charges are up 29%, ESB bills are up 13%, college fees are up 9%, parking is up 25%, bus fares are up 9% and the television licence is up 40%. I could go on and on. There have been major increases in the price of foodstuffs as well. The Minister said that she and her Department were not responsible for inflation, but neither are the people on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consumer price index includes people's <Col N="455" /> holidays and goods they buy for their homes. Will the Department prepare an index on day-to-day spending by those on social welfare on items such as food?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the consumer price index, the Department should index how this affects those on social welfare. Categorising such people with those in full employment is not right as people on social welfare will not have several holidays per year and will not be affected by the price of insurance on their Mercedes or Jaguar. A price index should be drawn up for those on social welfare and the Department should consider this. It is not right that other goods are put into the price index, which does not give a true reflection of the situation for people on social welfare.</P>
      <P>The recent social welfare increases have not matched price increases and people are beginning to feel the pinch and are getting upset. It is the first time in many years that people are coming to my constituency clinics to tell me they are not able to survive on social welfare. They want to know what the Government and the Department of Social and Family Affairs will do about it and that is the question I put to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Linking increases to the rate of inflation as measured by the CPI is one of the invidious areas of social welfare. The increase in VAT to 13.5% and the increase in the price of cigarettes, spirits, diesel, credit cards, insurance, medicine and hospital charges announced before the budget affect those on social welfare, particularly elderly people. The House does not doubt that the Minister is working with her best &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; of the rate of the inflation, which is 4.8%. However, that leaves the elderly, in particular, only marginally better off.</P>
      <P>Basic social welfare rates and unemployment assistance for one parent families rose by about &euro;6 and there was no increase in the living alone allowance despite research by the ESRI in 2002 showing that older people living alone, particularly women and rural dwellers are among the poorest in society. Of those aged 65 or over, 43.3% live below the 60% median, in regard to the medium income poverty line, compared to 21% of adults nationally &ndash; almost a three-fold increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" />These trends should be measured in a particular way and isolated. The Minister faces a difficulty in that she must play on the pitch that is marked. However, if inflation gallops in at 5% or 6%, as some economists predict, there will be problems. The Minister has tried to align increases to or beyond the anticipated rate of inflation. The Labour Party has argued, as has the voluntary and community sector, that social welfare rates should be increased to 30% of gross average industrial earnings over a specified period. The Minister did that in the revised national anti-poverty strategy where she set out a commitment &ndash; though that was deliberately vague &ndash; to achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rate of social welfare, to be met by 2007. Some &euro;150 per week in 2002 is equivalent to 30% of gross average industrial earnings in that year. However, the Government has set its face against making a clear link between welfare and wages. It is predicted that the &euro;6 increase will leave people 30 cents ahead of inflation but if there is any take-off in inflationary pressures, they will be in a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>While some people have a free travel pass, bus fares have gone up by 10% and postal services by about 8.8%. When those increases are fed into the inflationary index, social welfare payments amount to a pittance and will not be adequate to cover basic needs. It is from this perspective that Deputy Sean Ryan and I ask for a report on the level of increase on each payment under the principal Acts amended net of changes in the consumer price index, and ask for that to be compared with the gross average industrial wage. That would be an interesting and worthwhile exercise and the relevant committee might look at it with the help of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to change the mechanism for evaluating increases appropriate for those living on the lowest rung of the ladder, particularly social welfare recipients. The current mechanism does not take into consideration the poverty that exists and the difficulty for families living on the lowest social welfare rate. Social welfare payments this year are infinitely small after inflation is taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>CORI, which is very professional in the way it quantifies increases and which deals with the needs of those on social welfare, states that a person on unemployment assistance got a &euro;6 increase and, even taking inflation into consideration at 4.8%, that works out &ndash; the Minister has not denied this &ndash; at 30 cent per week. It is hard to imagine and must be considered with all the other U-turns by the Government with regard to indirect taxation, which has not been considered with regard to the 4.8% inflation rate. For example, local authority rents have increased by well in excess of 4.8% and there is an increase of just 54 cents per week for a single person with one child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister living in the real world? An <Col N="457" /> unemployed single person with one child is worse off in real terms but the Minister for Finance, when it suits, flies to the races in England and forgets about the problems here. A single person with one child will be worse off, and the Minister stands up in this House and takes credit for that. It is scandalous. The people at the top end of the market are looked after, with concessions here, there and everywhere. Merely taking inflation into consideration is not the proper way of dealing with this issue, and we must deal with it to try to lift people out of poverty. Perhaps the Minister did not have the capacity this year to deal with it, but there has been a great deal of discussion behind the scenes about the proper way to tackle poverty and many recommendations have been made to take gross average industrial earnings into consideration. That is the way forward. We need a commitment to deal with poverty once and for all, and we cannot do so until we get that system in place and quantify poverty properly. Until we get to that stage, there is no point in the Government going to the media with hyped up claims of percentage increases across the board.</P>
    <P>It is the people on the ground who understand the problem, social welfare recipients, lone parents and the unemployed. These people live with the realities of inequality. There is one way to deal with this problem, and that is to take on board the spirit of these two amendments. The Minister obviously cannot take this initiative this year, but she must give us a commitment to put her expressions of concern &ndash; which I acknowledge &ndash; into practice and change the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see merit in both of these amendments. My preference would be for amendment No. 4, in the name of Deputies Ryan and Penrose, as it mentions the specific benchmark of average industrial earnings. The social partners, through the NAPS process, seem to be agreed upon a figure of 30% of average industrial earnings as a sufficient benchmark. My party sees a figure of 50% of average household income as a more appropriate benchmark, but there is not too much difference between the two figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of any willingness on the part of the Government to introduce index-linked payments, a mechanism that could show the difference in not having index links would be preferable to many of us who try to assess the impact of social protection expenditure. I caution the Minister for Social and Family Affairs against any attempt by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Health and Children to interfere with the consumer price index in relation to tobacco and alcohol. There is ready agreement about the deleterious health effects of both tobacco and alcohol, but to remove them from the consumer price index would be detrimental to those depending on social welfare payments. Like it or not, lower income groups and those depending on welfare payments have higher consumption patterns in terms of tobacco and alcohol. If we try to mess around with the consumer price index in such a <Col N="458" /> way as to make the inflation figures lower, those who have their payments weighted accordingly would ultimately lose out. We must come up with better strategies than that to encourage people to live healthier lives.</P>
    <P>This possibility has been discussed. The Ministers feel the inflation figure would be lower if we did not count tobacco and alcohol, but we do not live in a ideal world and our inflation figures are set in comparison with other European countries. As long as that stands, we should have the same inflation measurements as anywhere else. I support these amendments and hope the Minister can give some effect to them as they do not have cost implications. They should help in terms of framing policy and assessing the effects of policy on an on-going basis.</P>

      <P>I do not take it personally and it does not annoy me in the slightest. I support these amendments. The Minister is as aware as anybody of the serious price increases experienced in recent months, which were brought about, in the main, by decisions of the Government. The increase in car tax is an example. The increases in motor insurance are a result of the Government's failure to deal with the situation. I know the Tánaiste is now making all sorts of promises in this regard, but she did nothing in five years other than set up a committee that took five years to report. I hope her new initiatives will give some real support to motorists in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Other examples include electricity, TV licences, third level registration fees and bin charges. One could go on and on. These increased charges were all imposed by the Government. Such increases should not be imposed without an evaluation of how they will affect the lower paid, the poor and those on social welfare or other benefits &ndash; the people who need help most. The Minister knows as well as I do that these people do not all have medical cards. There are many hidden costs for them, especially for people living in rural areas who must have a car or else must pay bus fares. It is essential to make these points. An increase in unemployment assistance of &euro;6 may have seemed generous at the time, but our clinics are full of people in a state of desperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Christmas, I talked to an individual in <Col N="459" /> charge of collections for the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul, and he told of the tremendous response they received from the general public. The public realise there is poverty out there and want to help. There is a willingness among people to make allowances for the less well off to ensure that they get a chance in life. Obviously, we cannot obtain more money from the Minister this year, but I hope she will look at our proposals sympathetically and try to put new structures in place to make life more meaningful for people at the lower end of the ladder.</P>

      <P>That would be more than my life is worth. I do not question the sincerity of what Deputies are saying. As political animals, we are all very aware of people's needs and aspirations and of our duties as public representatives. However, I have discussed this issue five or six times now in the context of two Bills we have brought forward. We must take into account the average inflation rate, which, Deputies are agreed, is at present 4.8%. The lowest social welfare payment increase I have offered is 5.1%, and the majority of increases are well above that. I know there has been a great deal of discussion about taking the average industrial wage into consideration. As I said on Committee Stage, if we had tied increases to the average industrial wage over several years, we would be in a more regressive situation. That is not the way forward. The CPI is the most professional way of dealing with this issue, through the CSO.</P>
      <P>It is the Opposition's job to express its points of view, but it is my job to put across the balancing viewpoints. I admit there have been price increases &ndash; all of us who strive to run families encounter challenges &ndash; but the prices of other essential items, such as clothing and footwear, have decreased. All households do not have the same needs, as needs vary depending on various factors. I was interested to hear Deputy Boyle's remarks about the effect of inflation on the price of alcohol and cigarettes. I would not necessarily consider such items to be essential, although one might consider cigarettes to be essential if one were a smoker. I prefer to consider the cost of life's more essential items, such as food, heating and electricity. I have taken these issues into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has set targets in the national anti-poverty strategy for the next seven years. They do not have to be met in the first year, but I intend to meet them within the NAPS timeframe. If inflation exceeds 4.8%, certain issues will have to be taken into consideration by my Department in the context of next year's budget. <Col N="460" /> The impact of this year's decisions on the people's lives will have to be considered. The Department's position does not necessarily have to be a reactive one, but changes in inflation must be taken into consideration and will be examined in the context of next year's social welfare increases. There have been huge increases in payments in recent years and the amount of money provided through the budget has increased. One tends to forget that rates have increased well in excess of inflation in the past five years, in particular. The fact that the base line is much higher than heretofore does not take away from the basic goal we all share &ndash; the eradication of poverty.</P>
    <P>Other services offered by my Department must be borne in mind along with the financial supports it provides. I have mentioned that the money advice and budgeting service is available for those who are unable to manage their financial affairs. Other schemes are provided to support the elderly and people who are disabled and my Department also organises employment support services. The services provided by my Department should not be viewed in isolation and are not totally dependent on finance. While funds are important, other issues, such as encouraging people to work, can be more important when trying to alleviate poverty. The most vulnerable people in society need to be assured that supports are available to them as they try to make progress in life.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that additional indexes should be provided to advise me, the Department or the Government in relation to household budgets. The Combat Poverty Agency, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the National Economic and Social Forum and a huge number of other institutions provide statistics for the Government. An inflationary base of 4.8% has been set by the Department of Finance, following consultation, and we are advised of the inflation figures at the end of the month. The most recently published consumer price index report by the Central Statistics Office, which relates to January 2003, states that the rate has been reduced so far. We do not know what will happen in the future, as there may be increases and decreases as the months go by. I am happy, if not ecstatic, with an inflation rate of 4.8%. I am satisfied that we will have relative adequacy when we come to the rates that have been provided in this Bill and the Bill that was passed before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised national anti-poverty strategy sets out the Government's social welfare commitments, albeit somewhat reluctantly. I assume that brilliant people in the Department have ensured that the commitments are sufficiently vague to allow the Government some room for manoeuvre. The strategy states that a minimum social welfare rate of &euro;150, in 2002 terms, will be achieved by 2007. In light of the Government's failure to meet that goal in 2003, Deputy Ryan and I have asked the Minister to outline her proposals to ensure it will be met by 2007. The recent budget, which was the first to be <Col N="462" /> announced after the revised anti-poverty strategy was published, provided for a basic social welfare increase of &euro;6. If inflation remains at the rate of 4.8% predicted by the Government, the increase will be just 30 cent. The rate of social welfare decreased in real terms when one considers that there have been increases outside the normal consumer price index basket.</P>
      <P>The Government has restated its commitment to NAPS in the proposed partnership agreement. It has said that increases will be made in social welfare rates during the period of the agreement in order to achieve the strategy's targets. No commitments have been made to provide additional resources for social welfare payments, however. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs will have the support of my party at the Cabinet table, as she challenges right-wing Ministers who do not share our social democratic conscience. The Labour Party is ready and willing to assist the Minister if she needs help in removing such elements from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Government has missed its targets in relation to the national anti-poverty strategy. A recent report indicated that Ireland's child poverty levels rank sixth highest on a list of 26 OECD countries. Some 29% of lone parents and 19% of two-parent households live in poverty. It upsets me when I hear Ministers repeat the language of the Government's spin doctors. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has pointed out how well the Government has done in recent years, but she has to admit that we started from a low base. It cannot be denied that additional funds were allocated to social welfare when things were going well, but people on social welfare were the first to lose out when the economic downturn came. It is not right and it is not fair. Irish people are not mean and do not mind paying tax if they feel it is being distributed evenly. They want social welfare recipients to receive a fair amount of money. As Deputy Penrose has said, people in certain political parties &ndash; some of them are in Fine Gael &ndash; would like to get rid of people on social welfare, if at all possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that because there is a strong social conscience in my constituency. Many people think that people on social welfare do not count, but they do. They are human beings and are part of our culture. The downturn in the economy led to many reports. This country is great at producing reports &ndash; I am not blaming the Government in this respect &ndash; and our librar<Col N="463" /> ies are full of them. If we started burning them today, they would not all be burned in 25 years' time. It would cause an awful problem.</P>
      <P>We want to see the national anti-poverty strategy put in place and people on low incomes and social welfare being looked after by the Government. A percentage of the public wants nothing done for people on social welfare but most are fair-minded and want to see social welfare recipients keeping in line with everybody else. There has been a problem with the increases this year and it is difficult for the Government to match its targets. I know the Minister will tell us that the Department is examining many schemes and will deal with the problem. However, I am appalled by the way in which people on social welfare have been treated, particularly in recent months. The level of anger is increasing.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be critical of the Government but it did not do well this year. It was Deputy Coughlan's first time to be a Cabinet Minister and she might not have learned a lot. I suppose the more senior people took advantage of her. At the Committee on Social and Family Affairs I said that I knew there would be bad days ahead when I saw her colleague Deputy Dermot Ahern, whom I know she will defend, running out of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows more about Deputy Dermot Ahern than I do, but I knew there would be problems. She has learned a lot this year from the committee. Budget targets are now being set for July and she should make sure that she and her officials are not shoved aside by the Progressive Democrats and others as they were this year. She should fight for the poor and the weak and make sure that increases of &euro;6 and &euro;8 are not wiped away by inflation. We will be nice to her this year because it is her first year, but I assure her that we will attack her more vigorously next year in respect of these increases if she lets us down.</P>

      <P>I suppose the NAPS has always been an unfortunate acronym for the national anti-poverty strategy. I am surprised that the tabloid newspapers in particular have not made more use of it when accusing the Government of napping in respect of its approach to poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always considered the figures outlined in the NAPS to be singularly unambitious. The Minister and I have argued before about the use of consistent poverty as an indicator. Its use as an indicator and the failure to reach the targets further indicate the poverty of the NAPS. This is particularly marked in the area of child poverty, which is the subject of a wide-ranging campaign. The End Child Poverty Coalition would not have existed if Government policy was seen to be working. NGOs, which are at the coalface in relation to poverty and income distribution issues, have actively lobbied those in public life <Col N="464" /> to achieve higher standards. That is the point we are starting from.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with what Deputy Penrose has just read from the Sustaining Progress document. I presume that is what the Deputy was reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to contradict the press reports that led us to believe that clear benchmarks were to be achieved by way of this document. It is too vague, not weighed down and gives the Government an opt-out clause in terms of meeting its vague promises in the future. I am surprised that elements of the community and voluntary pillar have been prepared to say they might be willing to accept this aspect of the partnership agreement. We have moved backwards and more progress needs to be made, even to reach the unambitious targets of the NAPS. These amendments are an attempt to make this progress and I hope the Minister will take at least some of the suggestions on board so the NAPS can get back on track.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>In her reply to the previous amendment, the Minister said that all the other strategies had to be taken into account, such as the back to work scheme. This is part of the problem. There was a back to work scheme until this year, but it has been removed to all intents and purposes. People were doing reasonably well on FÁS, but for the sake of a small additional sum they are being put back on social welfare. The numbers prove that and one only has to talk to a community group to realise how serious is the issue.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I received a phone call about a small school which employed a girl through FÁS whose job it was to look after a handicapped child. The job specification has changed and a loophole has been found that enabled the school to put the girl on notice last Friday to finish this Friday. She is being removed from the school.</P>
      <P>A man was telling me how well he fared in terms of money for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. I said to him that he will need it. He has come back to me and has told me in no uncertain terms that this was only too true and that there is desperation and child poverty in society. As I mentioned in previous debates, young widows with young families are finding it difficult to get by. We know the Minister is sympathetic to these people but the boot has to be put in.</P>
      <P>At a time when there are two finance issues being discussed, one in the Dáil and another in the Seanad, it is a national scandal that the Minister for Finance and the roll-over Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who claimed to be able to solve all the problems&mdash;</P>

It is a national scandal that the poorest of the poor are told that they have to exist on increases of &euro;6 with all other expenses taken from that while the Ministers spend as much as they like of their own money and that of the Government having a good time.

During the budget speech, the Minister for Finance stated that the full-year cost of personal tax reductions was &euro;186 million. The largest allocation from last year's budget was the &euro;530 million which was made available to my Department. That represents a commitment to supporting the less well-off.

      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, we are reviewing the national anti-poverty strategy by assessing what has been achieved and examining its targets. This process was outlined in the social partnership agreement &ldquo;Sustaining Progress&rdquo; which stated:</P>
      <P>The NAPS explicitly recognises the multi-dimensional and dynamic nature of disadvantage and provides the framework to address poverty and social exclusion and to protect vulnerable groups. It commits to building on what has been achieved to date so as to move to a new phase in the development of a more inclusive society. This commitment is reflected in the setting of an objective of reducing, and ideally eliminating, poverty in Ireland; a specific target of eliminating long-term unemployment and a new benchmark for the lowest social welfare payments of &euro;150 by 2007 in 2002 terms. The challenge now is to achieve the targets set out in that strategy in light of changed circumstances and to ensure real and significant progress in relation to implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> The Government has made a clear commitment through the national anti-poverty strategy and it will do so again when the strategy is revised. Building an inclusive society involves reaching the strategy's targets within the timeframe set out. As I indicated, the first kick of the ball does not constitute the final score.</P>

      <P>There have been a few own goals scored over there, but I will not embarrass the Deputy by listing them.</P>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy has been put in place and is multi-dimensional. It takes account of the views of many NGOs and operates across various Departments to implement a multi-faceted approach to addressing poverty and social exclusion. The national anti-poverty strategy is the way forward which is why I disagree with Deputies who criticised the package provided under the budget. In the context of the national finances, my Department and the people I have to care for through it have received a considerable amount of money. The allocation of &euro;530 million for the full year compares very favourably to other packages and to taxation in particular.</P>

      <P>3.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test for carer's allowance and introducing a top-up carer's payment for those in receipt of another social welfare payment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Much consideration has been given to carers and the need for respite, but certain statistics should be recorded. In 1999, the Central Statistics Office reported that 35,000 people were providing more than 50 hours unpaid personal care per week, 17,000 people were providing 20 to 49 hours of unpaid personal care per week and 79,000 were providing unpaid personal care for between one and 19 hours per week. That represents a substantial contribution by unpaid carers to our society and it is the context in which we should examine respite provisions. We must consider the carer's ability to continue caring and to cope with life when caring ceases. Time off is necessary to enable carers to develop a life outside the home and to acquire a certain level of disposable income. They should be able to connect with other people as far as possible while they give their time and energy to their loved ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year's budget, the respite care grant was increased by a miserable &euro;100 to &euro;735. Carers provide an invaluable service to the State and it is up to us to acknowledge the role they play. To provide an increase of &euro;100 to those carers in receipt of the respite care grant is despicable. The <Col N="468" /> total increase of &euro;2 million in respite care funding for the year is degrading when looked at in the context of the budget as a whole. Hopefully, the committee chaired by Deputy Penrose will use its professionalism to recognise carer's needs. If the respite needs of carers are not met, people will burn out and the contribution they make to society will be lost. We must consider their health and make a greater effort to provide them with the incentive to continue with their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I support those sentiments. Our committee is examining the work of carers and we will examine the number of anomalies in the social welfare system. I have a great personal commitment to carers and I hope that we will produce a report that will be of use to the Minister in her endeavours to secure additional funding and indeed significant structural changes in relation to carers and carers' payments. In particular the means testing of the allowance serves to deprive a number of people who work extremely hard 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year. They provide care for their loved ones and save the State multi-millions of euro because the patient does not have to go into a convalescent or nursing home. The charges in those homes are significant and families have to join forces to scrape together the money. Carers work for about &euro;100 which is only about 80 cent an hour. People feel deeply aggrieved, even insulted, at the lack of recognition of their work. It is important to have definitive statistical information about carers which will strengthen the Minister's hand.</P>
      <P>We can do something about respite care and at no great cost. The respite grant could offer widows or widowers looking after somebody in the home for a number of years an opportunity to go out and take a break. I acknowledge that the increase of &euro;100, small though it is, is a step in the right direction. It would be a great help if people could get their hands on it. Widows and widowers who are looking after somebody in the home cannot avail of respite because of the rule forbidding the payment of a second social welfare payment. These people are not eligible for carer's allowance or respite care, but because of their natural love and affection they continue to provide extraordinary care and friendship to their relative. I implore the Minister to do something in this area. It would be a significant and compassionate step and would be long overdue recognition to those people who are an inspiration to us all. It is an indictment of all of us that nothing has been done about making the respite care grant available to people who may well be in receipt of another social welfare payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two big problems when it comes to social welfare recognition of the rights of women. The Minister is a woman and I wish to inform her that there are many women who feel very let down by the State. They are looking after their loved ones but because their husbands or partners earn more than is allowed by the means test they are not given recognition for their work as carers in the home.</P>
      <P>A constituent of mine is caring at home for a very severely handicapped child. Because she is in receipt of a widow's pension she does not qualify for a second State payment. She is given no recognition for her work in looking after a very sick child who should probably be in full-time care. She is not eligible for a respite grant and I ask the Minister to investigate this situation. There is only a small number of people who are affected by this regulation. They are given no recognition as carers but they should at least be given the respite grant. A person who looks after a loved one for many years is not eligible for payment of a respite grant in the year of the death of the patient. I ask the Minister to right that wrong.</P>
      <P>There are more than 140,000 people acting as carers in the country. About 23,000 carers are given some recognition in the form of a carer's allowance or a partial allowance. Deputy Penrose and the committee have been listening to groups representing carers. When people come to my clinic I know by the look of them that they are looking after an elderly person at home. I ask the Minister to do something for people who are not being given recognition by the State. A small amount of money such as &euro;60 would be a way of thanking them because they are saving the State a fortune.</P>
      <P>We can no longer cope with the number of people who want to go into State homes. Carers are saving the taxpayer a fortune. The Ombudsman has made it clear that as the law stands a person over 65 years with a medical card is entitled to a place in a State home. Many people would prefer to die in their own home and want to be cared for at home. Their family is happy to care for them but they would be grateful for some support, both financial and respite. Carers feel upset that society does not recognise their work. Many of them have given their lives to the care of an elderly parent or sibling without recognition.</P>
      <P>I know of a person who spent years as a carer and who was paid the carer's allowance. When his relative died he applied for social welfare but did not get it even though he had spent years looking after his father. He felt humiliated by the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister that the people are crying out for a hero and whatever Minister for Social and Family Affairs deals with this anomaly will always be remembered and will be the most popular Minister ever. The carers feel they have been forgotten by all Governments, yet they do <Col N="470" /> all the work. If this Minister cannot deal with it maybe the day will come when I will be in a position to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that respite care has massive potential to offer the best value for money to the Department of Health and Children and to the health boards. It also has the potential to give carers much needed short and regular breaks. If people could be reassured that they would be given respite on a regular basis, it would make life much more comfortable for them. It would relieve the pressure to find a permanent nursing home bed for the patient. Many people who could be at home are taking up places in nursing homes. However, if they go home they are afraid they may lose a bed and may have to go through the whole routine of trying to secure a place again and so on. It makes life very difficult for these people.</P>
      <P>When licences are being provided for nursing homes, a certain number of beds should be held for respite care. This would help in the same way the social housing policy helped the housing market. If people had such a guarantee they would be more willing to remain at home.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring referred to people who give up their time to care for relatives. That is a thing of the past. Dual income earners nowadays do not have the time to do this work. There needs to be some form of encouragement to keep people in the home. We all know that people prefer to live in their own home and they must be encouraged to do so. It is cheaper and good for everyone, a win-win situation.</P>
      <P>In regard to carers, these people save the State approximately &euro;420 per week by providing residential care places. Yet they receive approximately one quarter of that amount through the carer's allowance. It is time carers were given some form of tangible recognition. They are the unsung and unacknowledged heroes and heroines of the country. Carers do not seek headlines. There is scant recognition of the part played by carers of disabled or incapacitated people. There is little evidence of real Government commitment to improving the lot of carers and, by extension, the people for whom they care. The Government is not doing enough in that regard. Only 20% of carers receive any form of State allowance. The State is getting care on the cheap without any acknowledgement of the strains or pressures on carers for 24 hours a day. Carers help to keep people out of institutions. As I said earlier, these people are giving real value for money. There is great potential for savings for health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was once said that there are two kinds of people in the world &ndash; those who are prepared to <Col N="471" /> work and those who are prepared to let them work or provide care. I put the Government in the latter category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. The Minister and her officials are well aware of where I stand on the issue of caring and respite care. However, it is important to put it on record.</P>
      <P>An enormous number of people are doing a wonderful job looking after their parents and loved ones. I refer again to single social welfare payments and the need for that issue to be reconsidered. Perhaps the Minister will give a commitment to look at that matter. If carers lose a loved one, either a husband or wife, and are looking after their partners' parents, they are no longer entitled to carer's allowance or respite care on being widowed. People who are in receipt of widow or widower's allowance are not entitled to respite care, yet they are entitled to work and retain their pension in full. I do not understand why these people cannot receive at least half the carer's allowance and, through that, respite care. This whole area needs to be reconsidered. The issue of respite care cannot be over-emphasised. The money people receive is very welcome and it is something that should be encouraged. However, the red tape that prevents approximately a dozen or less people receiving this care is unreal.</P>
      <P>I heard on the radio recently about a catastrophic situation in Beaumont Hospital where people could not be discharged because they had nowhere to go. Yet, down the road in Swords, people could have gone to a nursing home with 49 beds. While that aspect is not the responsibility of the Minister, it needs to be emphasised.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the issue of single social welfare payments. If a carer is looking after two people, they receive one and a half times the allowance. If someone is caring for one person and they are entitled to hold down a full-time job, why are they not entitled to at least half the allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Carers are the most underrated people in the State with just 20,000 of more than 100,000 of them receiving carer's allowance. We do not value carers. From a financial point of view, they contribute an enormous amount to the State in the work they do and this should be recognised. More important, the quality of life they give to the person being cared for is not recognised. I am sure the Minister has been in contact with the Carer's Association, which is very active, and that its members have made clear to her their concerns and needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have attended public meetings with carers and I have heard very emotive stories about the difficulties they experience, whether in regard to people with intellectual disabilities, physical disabilities or elderly people. People sometimes give up a lot of their time at a crucial period to care <Col N="472" /> for a parent or sibling who needs long-term care. This service should be recognised. There should be a programme to reward all carers and a criterion should be drawn up for deciding what is a carer &ndash; one already exists but it is a bit restrictive. However, I will not go down that road today. I cannot sufficiently emphasise the need to recognise carers and to move towards a regime where there is financial support for all carers. I appreciate that the Minister cannot go from 20,000 to 100,000 in one Bill, but there should be a programme over a short number of years to afford all carers recognition through a carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>In regard to respite care, this year 1,014 people with intellectual disabilities who require respite care will not get it because the funding was not made available. While this may be the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children, it is important to put on record that the Government did not provide one shilling extra this year for respite care for people with intellectual disabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of means testing for carer's allowance, respite care and so on has been raised <i>ad infinitum</i> during my short time as Minister. I appreciate that the committee will look specifically at caring and carers. My Department has been involved in a study looking at the long-term financial implications of caring. There is a need to address these issues when one considers the age profile of people in this country who give of their time voluntarily to look after loved ones in the long-term or short-term.</P>
      <P>The recognition of caring has progressed through new initiatives such as carer's leave, the respite care grant, carer's allowance and carer's benefit. When those who were previously in work take up caring, their contributions continue and can be taken into consideration at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Varying views have been expressed on whether the abolition of the means test is the best way to proceed. The cost would be approximately &euro;150 million in a full year. Some argue that some people can well afford private care. However, I agree that others are outside the remit of the scheme because of the means test. This is an ongoing issue and it is one we will have to address.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is no data base dealing with carers, but the CSO has done work in this area which indicates that 35,000 people provide more than 50 hours of unpaid personal help per week, or seven hours per day. Some 17,000 people provide between 20 and 49 hours unpaid help per week, or between three and seven hours per day, while 79,000 provide between one and 19 hours per week, or between nine minutes and 2.5 hours per day. At present, 20,500 carers are in receipt of the allowance, or approximately 40% of the 52,000 carers we believe to be operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance is concerned with those who provide full-time care and attention. We also provide for those carers who do other work, up to a maximum of ten hours per week. The respite <Col N="473" /> care grant covers those who require a break from their caring role and we are committed to increasing it. I would also like to see the eligibility thresholds raised, even where those covered are outside the remit of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Last year, overall expenditure on the carer's allowance amounted to &euro;160 million, which is considerable, especially when people are not paid to be carers. The allowance is an acknowledgement of the difficulties they face and offers them some kind of financial support. The household budget schemes supplement the allowance. These include free electricity and a free telephone allowance and they are considered to be very helpful in the same way as they help the contributory widow's pension and contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the argument that if disregards are allowed to those who work they should also be allowed to those in receipt of the carer's allowance. However, with the exception of the blind pension, the policy of the Department is to disallow double payments. The Department often advises applicants that it is better for them to be eligible for the carer's allowance scheme because of the additionally in terms of benefits and the recognition that additional costs in terms of light, heating etc., arise when one is caring. There are choices open to applicants and my Department offers advice on the best way forward.</P>
    <P>This debate will continue, especially given the changes in society, including the role of the family and the necessity to appreciate the huge personal commitment made by those who care for people. I would like to progress this scheme and I intend to increase the disregard again next year. This year we increased it to allow more people join the scheme and to provide additional funding to those in receipt of a lower rate of the allowance. We have also made a commitment with regard to the respite care grant.</P>
    <P>I will hold ongoing discussions with the Carer's Alliance and those who represent carers on the question of addressing outstanding issues. These represent a challenge to us as politicians and to society in general. However, that does not take away from the fact that we have progressed well on the issue of caring. I hope the good work of recent years will be built on. I also look forward to the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee after it has concluded its proposed hearings on this issue and to further deliberation on the issue in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Comhairle recently issued a social policy report in favour of carers, of which the joint committee will take account. The report points out that demographic trends suggest there will be an increase in demand for carers at a time when there will be a fall in the supply of traditional carers, who are generally women in the home. They have done tremendous work in this area. The report points to the strong social arguments for properly supported home care being provided by families within the home. It is the preferred option for those being cared for and there are strong economic arguments in favour of it. Departments, especially the Department of Finance, probably attach greatest importance to cost benefit analyses and this approach would provide them with a winning situation.</P>
      <P>The traditional carer might be under threat, given that dual incomes are required to fund households. The Minister is a woman of compassion with a deep interest in this area. Although progress has not been made in this debate, it will be made in the near future, especially as the Oireachtas joint committee, which is an all-party committee, has given this matter priority.</P>

      <P>We dealt with this in great detail on Committee Stage. It is appropriate for a member of the Labour Party to refer to the provisions for widows and widowers, particularly those who are under 65 years of age. They are a group of social welfare recipients who have been hard done by over the years. They feel they have been let down by Government. I ask the Minister to take that on board, try to deal more sympathetically with them and acknowledge their rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that. This is an area that needs more attention. It is when a person loses a spouse and is left with two or three children that the person is most vulnerable. That is particularly accentuated in rural areas. I harp back to rural areas because I come from a remote rural area. <Col N="476" /> Those people have nothing provided for them at this vulnerable time when they need most help. The free schemes could be just the additional help that is required at a time when a person is vulnerable and has a lot to look after. A spouse might be in the position of having to deal with a myriad of problems that were previously shared with or dealt with wholly by the dead spouse. We make this argument from a compassionate viewpoint.</P>

They are one of the most neglected and vulnerable groups in society and have not been looked after by Government during the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on the free schemes particularly in regard to rural transport. We had a major debate on this issue in committee last week. The Government will have to look at some kind of voucher system in areas where there is no public transport available for people with free passes. They should, at least, be able to come to town on a Friday to do their shopping and collect their pensions. A voucher scheme of some sort needs to be put in place. It is fine to have the free travel pass but people in rural Ireland do not have the DART or Luas available to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport has talked about reorganising public transport and allowing the private sector take it over. We know what the result will be if that happens. The only place the private sector will want to operate is in the cities. It will not want to operate in rural areas. The Minister must protect the people in the free schemes. This is 2003 and we should be looking at new ways of doing things. I said in the committee last week that the Department is brilliant at stopping schemes. I ask the Department now to be positive and try to use the free schemes in a better way.</P>

Since I was elected I have been surprised by the number of people who have called to my constituency office to outline the circumstances in which they find themselves. Many of them are women over the age of 50 and under the age of 65. Even if we cannot allow them the full entitlements we should at least examine the cost implications of phased entitlement to many of these services. Even though they are over the age of 50 there are often young teenagers involved in the family units. For all the wrong reasons people over 50 are not con<Col N="477" /> sidered to be as economically valuable as they should be. Because of these constraints the Department needs to look at the circumstances of people in this situation. I commend the motion on those grounds.</P>

      <P>I wanted to target the people who are over 66 and some of the anomalies that existed there. We have made progress on that and I hope to address it completely next year. I agree that people under the age of 66 do not benefit from schemes except where there is a spouse. There is an interim period between the ages of 60 and 65. I appreciate what the Deputies have said and that it is a huge difficulty for people from an emotional and financial point of view. If I was to do everything I was asked to do I would run out of money. I appreciate the concerns and I hope they will be addressed in due course.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Within two years of the coming into operation of this Act, the Minister shall present to the Oireachtas a review of the operation of the Act which will <i>inter alia</i>, assess&mdash;</P>
      <P>a)&nbsp;the impact of the operation of the Act on the Credit Union Movement,</P>
      <P>b)&nbsp;the adequacy of the system for developing a strong pro-consumer financial environment,</P>
      <P>&nbsp;and</P>
      <P>c)&nbsp;the quality of the reporting arrangements to provide the Oireachtas with timely information in regard to&mdash;</P>
      <P>protection of consumer savings,</P>
      <P>transparency of information for the users of financial services,</P>
      <P>competition among the providers of financial services, and</P>
      <P>efficient redress for consumer grievances in relation to the provision of financial services.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a lengthy debate about this Bill on Second and Committee Stages. One of the most contentious aspects of the Bill is its effect on the credit union movement. The preferred approach, which was initially proposed by the Government as the way to regulate the movement, has been abandoned. We are no longer to have an independent regulator of the credit union movement. That regulator will, instead, be under the thumb of the Central Bank. Credit unions will depend on the Central Bank and the regulatory authority for budget. They will be subject to direction by the Central Bank and will depend on the Central Bank for staffing. Any reports that will be made in relation to the regulation of credit unions can only be made through the Central Bank and the regulatory authority. The right to report directly to the Oireachtas is being removed. This is a significant change in the traditional independent regulation of the credit union movement.</P>
      <P>The movement has been a unique institution in Ireland. It has offered support to people who would be regarded as unbankable by the other financial institutions. Credit unions have been based on mutual trust and have been an important pillar of financial support for those whose financial means would put them in difficulties with the traditional banking sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue which has been highly contested in the course of the debate on the Bill is whether it is appropriate to bring consumer protection within the same body as is responsible for prudential regulation. Very strong advocates have said this is wrong. These include Dr. Ray Kinsella, who was formerly an adviser to the Government and is a professor of financial matters in the Smurfit School of Business in University College Dublin. He has argued convincingly that the two roles should not be joined and that to do so would damage both the body's capacity <Col N="481" /> to be effective in consumer protection and its capacity to be effective in prudential regulation.</P>
    <P>The third issue which has been raised inside and outside the House is the extent to which the Oireachtas, which will be responsible in the long-term for overseeing the effectiveness of these bodies, is equipped or has the resources and interest to do so.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes that the Minister present a review to the Oireachtas within two years. We are going into uncharted territory. I believe we have taken the wrong option in respect of the regulation, both of credit unions and consumer protection for financial services. After the Act has been in place for two years and a reasonable amount of experience has been built up, we ought to insist that the Minister presents a review to the Oireachtas that will look at all these issues and the extent to which the Central Bank with all its new powers is changing its spots and delivering real consumer protection, new sources of financial information for consumers and real competition within the sector. As I pointed out on Second and Committee Stages there is a genuine conflict between the desire for a highly competitive low margin banking sector, which is good for the consumer, and one that is uncompetitive with a high margin, which is good for central banks which want to protect prudential regulation. There is a conflict here and we should test it and come back within two years when, hopefully, we will have learned something. The Oireachtas can make changes to the legislation if deemed appropriate at that stage and, if not, we can say it is working well and that the Oireachtas is managing to hold these bodies to account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Bruton's amendment, I am still not satisfied about the undertakings given by the Minister for Finance, who is at Cheltenham, and his Minister of State, who is also at Cheltenham. It is unsatisfactory that the Minister of State, who is my esteemed constituency colleague and to whom I do not wish to refer in a personal way, has been landed with this job. It is a disgrace when an important Bill is being debated on Report Stage that the Minister for Finance and his Minister of State are disporting themselves in Cheltenham for the week. The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan is in no position to take part in any serious way in the debate. I am not satisfied with the undertakings given to the credit union movement about the regulatory authority applying to the credit union movement. We have tabled a subsequent amendment to take into account the specific ethos of the credit union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of consumer information I raised with the Minister for Finance on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill the fact that last year the cost to the Exchequer of capital allowances for businesses used by the banks, under leasing arrangements, was in excess of &euro;300 million. Are we satisfied that small and medium-sized busi<Col N="482" /> nesses are getting the appropriate advantage from the banks from the generous tax break and tax avoidance mechanism, which is uniquely open to banks and financial services as a consequence of their taking the benefit of capital allowances, otherwise meant for businesses? The Minister's reply last week was that the cost of these tax breaks to the banks in the year to March 2002 was &euro;316 million. Consumers of banking services are not only individuals and families but are also businesses. I am inundated, as I am sure is the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan by small and medium-sized businesses in Dublin 15 who say that the cost of banking services is incredibly high.</P>
    <P>In regard to a regulatory service, the Central Bank rather than the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment won the argument that it would control the structure. We also have a consumer services director who comes from a Central Bank background. I am sure she will attempt to do a fine job. Where is the protection for consumers, particularly small and medium-sized businesses in relation to value for money from the financial services? We received a report from the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs which clearly indicates her unhappiness with the regime for which the Bill provides. It is a question of the Central Bank having a traditional role to protect the integrity of the banking system, which we all accept, but how does that role tally with providing the best value to consumers who pay through the nose for financial services? Yesterday we had the acknowledgment by pension fund operators and others that the equity investments market has lost &euro;2 billion to date this year. Most of those are financial service advisers.</P>
    <P>How is the Central Bank to regulate for the consumer, whether an individual or family, looking to long-term investments in relation to pensions or business people who are being asked by banks to give them their capital allowances because it will give them a better deal? We are not satisfied that our small and medium-sized businesses are getting a better deal. The Government has many questions to answer. We are seeking accountability from the Government on the functioning of this new body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Bruton. The points have been made already as to why it should be accepted. I welcome the Minister of State although I am not sure what role he intends to play on Report Stage or whether he has been given any plenipotentiary powers in relation to acceptance of any amendments tabled. If so, it would be a welcome relief to the acceptance or otherwise of amendments tabled on various Bills taken by the Minister for Finance. Hopefully, there will be some interaction and consideration of what is being said here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further clarification I sought from the Minister on Committee Stage was why the role of standard conventional banking was being lumped <Col N="483" /> in with credit unions given the unique position they hold in the Irish scheme of things. I pointed out that the United States, which is meant to be the economy from which we are supposed to take our example, has a separate regulatory framework in the form of the credit union supervisory association. It is a grouping of three people who on a national and federal basis regulate credit unions in the United States. Subsequently I received from the Department a five page document as to why the United States model would not suit Ireland. The argument it appeared to make was that Ireland did not need to be considered as a nation, it needed to be considered as an American state, which is a narrow way of looking at the issue. There is a separate way of regulating credit unions at a state level in the United States and at a federal level.</P>
    <P>The Minister has chosen to go with the state model. We should aspire to more than that. It also follows the example that the original amendments tabled by the Government, which worsened the lot of credit unions, were accepted on the basis of a submission made by the European Central Bank which did not have an understanding of the role and extent of credit unions in Irish society and were making comparisons with other forms of co-operative banking that would be found in continental Europe, particularly the German model.</P>
    <P>The Irish model is far different from anything found in any other European model and it is in need of a separate regulatory framework. The Minister softened his cough somewhat and introduced further amendments that appeared to have met with the general acceptance of the Irish League of Credit Unions. I question whether these vague references and the commitments given are watertight. They do not change anything. We still have a situation where the credit union registrar will have a reporting relationship but will not be subservient to this regulatory authority, a position that could undermine that person's credibility.There is a need, through Deputy Bruton's amendment, to put in place an assessment procedure where we can see after a given time if it is working. I suspect it may not and there might be problems along the way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton cited the position of many individuals, including the Director of Consumer Affairs on the dichotomy between a prudential and consumer protection role. Many Deputies have also been lobbied about it by the Consumer Association of Ireland. This Bill lumps together the Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority in direct opposition to the recommendations contained in the McDowell report. It is akin to the way Britain was described in the 1950s; the Central Bank has lost its empire and has yet to find its role. If we are merely giving the Central Bank something to do now that we have the European Central Bank and all the real aspects of banking are being dealt with at that <Col N="484" /> level, then we are doing a bad day's work and will be introducing flawed legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Bruton's amendment which seeks to at least give the House an opportunity to revisit many of these concerns to see if they can be redressed in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's amendment. During Committee Stage I made inquiries from Mr. Liam O'Dwyer, Chief Executive Officer of the Irish League of Credit Unions about the deficiencies in the initial proposals they highlighted to the committee. They were subsequently &ndash; I made a note of this and shared it with colleagues &ndash;&ldquo;relatively happy&rdquo;. I hope their sense of trust in the Minister's meeting the concerns of the Irish League of Credit Unions stands the test of time and that the amendments and alterations introduced to reflect and accommodate their concerns will stand up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment allows for an opportunity to revisit and appraise the actuality of the effect of this legislation on the credit union movement. I wish at this point to proudly declare that I am a member of my local credit union. The amendment would be welcomed by members of the credit union throughout the country. Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) refers to the adequacy of the system for developing a strong pro-consumer financial environment. That will be a new experience for everybody. Having worked in banking for 12 years, I look forward to the pro-consumer days that may lie ahead.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2)(<i>c</i>)(<i>iii</i>) refers to competition among the providers of financial services. What a wonderful idea. It would be great to see that come to pass so that people would have an opportunity to compare financial products in terms of the high street or main street banking choices currently on offer. It is far from the reality we know today. The majority of ordinary people are being fleeced by the banking sector and financial institutions under a raft of headings. Every possible idea for taking more and more from a citizenry that has been herded over the years into the banking sector, in many cases to access their wages and salaries, is contributing to the vast profits recorded by the banking sector. We have only to look at the recent announcement by Allied Irish Banks of profits of &euro;1.3 billion in 2002. Some might laud and applaud that. I, too, want to see them do well but not at the costs currently imposed on and exacted from the ordinary consumer.</P>
      <P>An earlier speaker referred to SSIAs and that element of the accounts linked to the share market. Information about the sums lost in that regard was released yesterday. Who is picking up that tab? It is not the players in the respective institutions. The real losers, not just paper losers, are the investors or consumers, depending on which word one deems appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend this amendment to the Minister of State and wonder, as Deputy Boyle asked, as to his powers regarding the acceptance of Oppo<Col N="485" /> sition amendments as presented and argued. Is the Minister of State working from a prepared text which offers the Minister's traditional response to which Members were exposed during deliberations on the Finance Bill? We could second-guess that response. Perhaps the Minister of State will treat Opposition Deputies and the import of the amendments tabled by them by offering a different reaction and response.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Burton was not reflecting on my capacity to take this debate. I have consulted in detail with officials in the Department concerned. The Minister accepted the spirit of some of the amendments tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton signalled his intention to move this amendment on Report Stage. He is suggesting in the proposed amendment that a review of the operation of the Act should take place, the results of which will be presented to the Dáil within two years of the Act coming into operation. The Minister indicated during Committee Stage discussions that any review of the legislation should wait to see how it operated following the passage of a few years. It should be noted that the Central Bank and the regulatory authority will produce annual reports to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The annual strategic plan of the regulatory authority will also be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, following which the authority must publish the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coupled with the provisions of section 33AM of the principal Act which provides for certain officers of the bank to attend before appropriate Oireachtas Committees, this will allow the Oireachtas ample opportunity to assess the operations and activities of the Central Bank and the regulatory authority. Section 33AM &ndash; I am sure many Deputies have already examined it in committee &ndash; makes it clear that the governor of the bank, the chairperson, chief executive officer and consumer director of the regulatory authority and the registrar of credit unions can be required, under the legislation, to attend proceedings of <Col N="486" /> Oireachtas Committees. A substantial degree of accountability has already been written into this legislation.</P>
    <P>The consumer director and registrar of credit unions must produce strategic plans and annual reports for submission to the regulatory authority. In the circumstances, an effective ongoing review and assessment process is entrenched in the legislation as it stands. For that reason I am not disposed to accepting the amendment. It is, as previously announced by the Minister for Finance, our intention to publish a second Bill to implement other recommendations contained in the McDowell report. That Bill will include provisions establishing consultative panels of consumers and the financial services industry. Among the functions planned for the consumer panel will be a review of the discharge by the regulatory authority of its functions, including those of the consumer director and the Registrar of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>Deputies naturally used the opportunity of Deputy Richard Bruton's amendment to raise wider questions in relation to the principal features of the Bill which have given rise to discussion. I welcome the fact that some Deputies noted that the Minister had gone some way towards meeting the concerns of the credit union movement. The Minister issued a four page letter earlier this year in response to representations received setting out in great detail the context of the amendments being proposed in regard to the Registrar of Credit Unions. I think Deputies received a copy of that letter.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained in detail at the beginning of Committee Stage the reasons for the amendments he was proposing to make to the provisions of the Bill dealing with the Registrar of Credit Unions. He set out his reasoning in relation to each amendment and indicated that he intended to table an amendment on Report Stage to section 33AA(4). That draft wording was circulated to Deputies and it was the result of meetings between officials of the Department of Finance and representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions. The agreed reports of the meeting showed that the league representatives indicated that they could live with the wording. They were told the wording was subject to amendment by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The league subsequently issued a statement to all credit unions about the agreement which it had reached with the Department. Amendment No. 33 is the wording which the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has drafted based on the draft wording agreed with the league. I will explain the background to that amendment if I have the opportunity to move it in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Burton raised the issue of whether consumer protection should be in the same body which has the responsibility for the prudential regulation of the financial industry and that these are incompatible functions. Again, the McDowell group felt <Col N="487" /> strongly that separating the consumer issues from the prudential regulator had two important disadvantages. It left unresolved the legal problem of passing relevant information from the authority to the Director of Consumer Affairs and that the advantages of a one-stop-shop would be lost. There would be two official bodies dealing with different aspects of financial services regulation. The Government considered that this restriction on the exchange of information was unacceptable and that is why it decided to implement the structure before the House. We may revisit this question further in the course of Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burton referred to leasing arrangements and the tax advantages which accrue to financial institutions as a result of the operation of these leasing arrangements and the tax treatment of them. That is really a matter for discussion on a Finance Bill rather than on this measure. The Deputy also referred to the cost of bank charges. I advise the House that a review is being undertaken by the Competition Authority on the cost of bank charges. Indeed, Deputy Ó Caoláin raised the same question. The Irish Bankers Federation has made a submission to the Competition Authority which suggests that our banks are not fleecing us. I am not giving ministerial endorsement to any particular submission &ndash; they will have to make their case &ndash; but I draw to the attention of the House that the Competition Authority has instigated a review of this whole area and on whether value for money services are being provided in the context of the competition which must exist within a sector such as this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boyle asked me about my plenipotentiary powers. That is very appropriate when one considers that the Minister is across the water. My powers are to deal with the amendments before the House. Deputy Boyle also raised the question of the credit unions and the approach towards them. I think I have dealt with most of the points raised in the initial discussion.</P>

      <P>It just shows how quickly Deputies forget what it is like to be a backbench Deputy working within the resources available when the Minister of State tells us there will be ample opportunities for the Oireachtas to see that the Central Bank and the regulatory authority are doing their work. He is living in cloud-cuckooland if he believes that. The Oireachtas has virtually no capacity to carry out the type of research implicit in my amendment, namely, into whether proper transparency is being delivered to consumers, whether there is adequate competition or whether the credit union movement is, in some way, being eroded in regard to the principles which were always there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the regulatory authority develops, there will be huge pressures from the financial institutions to see the credit unions sucked into the same obligations they claim they carry. If the Minister of State believes we have the capacity, with the type of resources available to the committees, to do <Col N="488" /> that job, he is underselling the reality. The presentation of annual reports and strategic reports will, by and large, pass unnoticed in this House. That is the nature of the supervision which we are capable of delivering with the resources available to us. The simple faith the Minister of State has that the Oireachtas can adequately supervise the Central Bank and the regulatory authority is, unfortunately, misplaced, and I am sure he realises that.</P>
    <P>To say the credit union movement can &ldquo;live with the wording&rdquo; is a poor achievement for a Government, which has a substantial majority in the House, to claim. The truth is the credit union movement had to come cap in hand and take whatever deal it could get. To say it is willing to live with what the Government is doing is to suggest the credit union movement is far from happy but that it has had to settle for half a loaf rather than none at all. The role of the Oireachtas is to supervise legislation and to try to get the best legislation rather than see whether the legislation can be lived with by those for whom we are supposed to be providing an environment for their development and a recognition&mdash;</P>

      <P>I take the point made by the Deputy about the resources available to Oireachtas committees, although again it is not a matter directly related to this legislation. Even if I was disposed to accept the amendment proposed by the Deputy, I wonder would the same questions not arise on the consideration by the Oireachtas of the report to which the Deputy referred because questions would be raised by Deputies as to whether they had sufficient assistance to consider the implications of the type of review document which the proposed amendment would generate.</P>

      <P>The other possibility with such a proposal is that the State would then embark on an expensive consultancy project because of the statutory obligation which would stem from such an amendment.</P>
      <P>As I stated, the Minister's view is that any review of the legislation should await its operation for at least a few years. He does not consider it appropriate to write into the legislation a particular timescale or format for such a review. It should be a matter for the Minister of the day to decide how best to approach the matter. As I indicated, there are structures in relation to accountability to an Oireachtas committee where at least Members of this House can question certain designated officers in this proposed new structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Irish League of Credit Unions, to summarise its position as living with the <Col N="489" /> amendment is not quite the full picture. The league indicated in its statement that there is clear recognition in the amendments being proposed by the Minister for Finance of the distinct voluntary character and social and economic roles of credit unions. That is the view it has taken in correspondence and in public statements. That goes beyond living with these proposals and is an indication that it is content that recognition has been given.</P>

      <P>We are making wrong choices in this legislation, choices which have not been properly evaluated. For example, those choices were not evaluated by the McDowell report which the Minister praised earlier.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the McDowell report in its appendix showed that in 16 of the 19 countries, consumer protection was separated from the financial aspect. In the other three countries, it was nothing like the hook, line and sinker attachment to the Central Bank that is proposed.</P>
      <P>The Minister is making a mistake. It is important a review is presented to the Oireachtas in a couple of years so that it can be evaluated. That will not happen automatically in the way that the Minister has simple faith in the Oireachtas to do. The impetus will be with the <i>status quo,</i> backed by a body with a budget of &euro;20 million to defend its turf, as it has already admirably done against other Departments as well as Members of the Oireachtas. I am disappointed the Minister of State did not take the opportunity while the cat was away to make a significant change in this legislation, to the benefit of all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)&nbsp;Prior to making an order under subsection (2) in relation to a provision of this Act in so far as it relates to credit unions, the Minister for Finance shall report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the implications of the operation or proposed application of the relevant provision of this Act to credit unions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position set out in the Minister's amendment No. 33 is that the credit unions are being legally and formally put into this structure. There are some nice words in that amendment with regard to the role of the credit unions and to their voluntary ethos. However, the Central Bank, urged on by one or more of the large commercial banks, decided that the credit unions are competition. <Col N="490" /> The banks are not comfortable with that regardless of the fact that, despite the Government's attempt to have universal accounts available to everybody, the commercial banks have been busily closing branch offices around the country. Many towns and villages, even those towns with substantial populations in the summertime due to tourism, not only no longer have a bank branch but do not even have an ATM machine. In its urge to control everything, the Central Bank moved to put credit unions into this structure at a time when they are needed, just as the post offices are, if people are to be given access to universal banking services and bank accounts, as the Government has stated they will be.</P>
    <P>The amendment put forward by the Labour Party is reasonable. It asks that the Minister come back to the House and report on the implications of the operation or proposed application of the relevant sections of this Act for the credit unions. It would give the credit unions recourse to a mechanism for accountability. While the Minister's amendment No. 33 refers back to the correspondence and the draft amendments that the Minister and his officials made available to us on Committee Stage, it goes no further. I specifically raised with the Minister on Committee Stage not just the voluntary nature of the work of the directors of credit unions but, critically, the not-for-profit ethos of credit unions.</P>
    <P>With regard to regulation, the Central Bank comes to this House on this Bill with a glowing reputation regarding Ansbacher deposits, non-resident deposits and so on. The role and record of the Central Bank is not glorious with regard to the carry-on that has been revealed in various tribunal reports dealing with banks such as Ansbacher and bogus non-resident deposits. Nonetheless, the Central Bank is now to be given control of the regulatory authority, not only with regard to banks, intermediaries and providers of financial services, but also with regard to the unfortunate credit unions. They will get the full whack because the Governor of the Central Bank writes a letter to say that the ECB shares its concerns in this area.</P>
    <P>The amendment put forward by the Labour Party is simply an attempt to get the Minister, before implementing what may be a very tough regime, to recognise the unique position of the credit unions. There are different kinds of credit unions, including large ones allied to trade unions for gardaí, prison officers and teachers, and small and localised ones located in different regions. However, they will all be subject to this one size fits all measure and the regulator of credit unions will be within this mammoth structure meant for the largest financial players in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that amendment No. 33 represents an adequate deal for the credit unions. They have accepted it because Cheltenham Charlie told them: &ldquo;This is it, you are getting nothing else.&rdquo;  The Minister is not here to discuss this because he is enjoying himself at Cheltenham &ndash; good luck to him, I hope he wins a lot of money. <Col N="491" /> However, this is not adequate for the credit unions and my amendment seeks to provide for accountability to this House and further important discussion with regard to the impact of the new regulatory structure on the credit unions, large, medium and small.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister did not include in his amendment reference to the not-for-profit ethos. The big banks have a clear for-profit ethos which the credit unions do not, and that is an important distinction. The Bill is subject to a guillotine tonight so the House may not get to amendment No. 33. I realise that the Minister of State is simply reading from the brief provided to him but, nonetheless, the House deserves further explanation in regard to the inadequacy and poverty of amendment No. 33 which the Minister put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment. The Minister should explain in simple terms why he has decided to reverse the position in the Bill as originally published. The original Bill tangibly recognised the special position of credit unions and provided for the appointment of a registrar which would be independent for its budget, have the right to report directly to the Oireachtas, the right to deal independently with evaluation of these issues and not be subject to direction by a regulatory authority. What were the arguments that convinced the Minister to change his mind? Were those arguments solely coming from the financial regulator, as would appear to be the case, and to what extent did the Minister weigh up other considerations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The registrar of credit unions was to be appointed by the authority and was to be required to present a draft strategic plan to the authority which would be approved by the authority. The registrar would also be required to provide information to the chief executive of the regulatory authority. Did those provisions not adequately ensure that the Registrar of Credit Unions would work within the general guidelines and terms of the Act while maintaining the independence important for protecting the ethos of the credit union? Was the huge protection given in the initial legislation not dramatically watered down by this slim provision in amendment No. 33? Only one crumb of comfort is offered to the credit unions in amendment No. 33. They lose their ability to report independently to the Oireachtas and must report through the regulatory authority. The only compensation the credit union movement receives is that when the regulatory authority is issuing public directions to the Registrar of Credit Unions, it will bear in mind the voluntary ethos of the credit unions and section 6 of the Credit Union Act 1997. Thus, the credit union movement has given up huge levels of independent protection, the right to report to the Oireachtas, the right to go to the Minister for Finance for its budget and the right to be inde<Col N="492" /> pendent in its operations within the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Government has thrown all this out the window and offered this minuscule protection in exchange. Why? What was the profound justification for that? I have heard none from the Minister for Finance on Committee Stage. I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, has come up with something better than pedalling the line of the regulatory authority that it would be more efficient for it to operate in this way. It believes that it can be more efficient than a regulatory authority that has vast experience over many years, the Registrar of Credit Unions. The credit unions themselves clearly favoured the old approach and defended it right up to the very end, until they had to concede and, as the Minister of State put it, &ldquo;live with&rdquo; this wording that has been offered in exchange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment. Any opportunity to assert the distinct and separate identity of credit unions, within the straitjacket of this legislation, should be availed of. I am hopeful, if not confident, that the Minister will give consideration to this. As Deputy Burton stated in moving this amendment, the Bill does not mention the not-for-profit motive of credit unions. It also fails to mention that credit unions are community based. This is significant at a time when the conventional banking system is retreating from many parts of the country, to the extent that large swathes of the country no longer enjoy close proximity to a bank branch.</P>
      <P>In accepting an amendment of this type, we would also give recognition to the fact that in terms of local economies, reinvestment by credit unions, as community-based entities, is far more successful than in the case of any other banking structure. Most of the reinvestment activity by banks, even at branch level, tends to take money out of local communities and transfer it to the centre by investing in properties and other opportunities in Dublin. The whole ethos of a credit union, on the other hand, is that money is generated within a community and recycled within that community to the optimum economic benefit.</P>
      <P>The effect of an amendment like this is to counteract and refine what the Minister hopes to bring forward later in amendment No. 33, which we probably will not reach because of the guillotine. I also object to the wording of that amendment, which makes the registrar subject to the control of the regulatory authority and states that it must comply with directions duly given by that authority. This enshrines a subservient relationship. It will not recognise the distinct and separate identity of credit unions. As Deputy Richard Bruton has said, the two opt-out clauses in that amendment do not give strength to the idea that credit unions can and should be treated differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue may need to be addressed in the context of a full overhaul of the Credit Union Act 1997. If the Government insists on pressing ahead <Col N="493" /> with this type of regulatory framework, the challenge for many of us in the House is to put forward suitable amendments to the Credit Union Act to give the credit union movement the recognition that we, and the vast majority of people who identify with the movement, feel it deserves in legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mystery as to what happened here. The lobby of the banks, and those who share their ethos and interests, was clearly very active and industrious. Fearing the continuing rise of credit unions in an ever-expanding base, they would do everything possible to curtail that competition.</P>
      <P>It is just over three decades since the two-headed hydra of banking in this jurisdiction was created, with the amalgamation, on the one hand, of the Munster &amp; Leinster Bank, The Provincial Bank and the Royal Bank of Ireland into the AIB, and, on the other, the amalgamation of the National Bank of Ireland and the Hibernian Bank into the Bank of Ireland. We have other players today of course, such as the Ulster Bank and the NIB, but the two-headed hydra remains the key force in banking in the State. Three decades ago, customer needs and customer care was very much part of the ethos of banking. There was real competition. The customers mattered and they knew it, but that is no longer the case. How different it has become. The banking sector is unrecognisable from what I knew in my early years in it, 32 years ago.</P>
      <P>What we have now is a big, brash culture within banking that is intolerant of the credit union movement in particular or of anything else that might, in the thinking of these people, represent a threat or, God forbid, competition. I wholeheartedly support Deputy Burton's amendment. We do not have to revisit the detail of what the credit union movement has meant to many people or of the opportunities that it has offered. However, as an elected local councillor of 18 years and Dáil Deputy for six years in a county that has the lowest uptake of third level education in the State, I am very conscious of how much the credit union movement has done in trying to address the terrible imbalance between those who can afford access to third level institutions and those who cannot. The credit unions have not been properly lauded for the role they have played in trying to address that imbalance. The Government needs to do much more in making access to third level education a fair reality for everyone, irrespective of where they are from.</P>
      <P>There is so much that could be said on this, but I will not delay the opportunity to proceed to other amendments. I wholeheartedly support this amendment. Perhaps on this occasion the Minister of State will offer a favourable response.</P>

      <P>I join the wholehearted endorsement by Deputies of the credit union movement. I share the sentiments of the Deputies about the unique contribution of the credit <Col N="494" /> unions to social, economic and community life. However, the amendment before us is of a somewhat technical nature. It proposes to amend the commencement provision of the Bill by requiring the Minister for Finance to report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the implications of the operation or proposed application of the relevant provisions of this Bill to credit unions. That is an unusual proposal. In general, the Oireachtas determines the principles of legislation in the relevant sections of the Bill and the issue of commencement is then an Executive matter for the relevant Minister. It is for the Minister to decide on the appropriate timing and implementation of legislation, whether on a phased or total basis. It is a most unusual amendment from the point of view of strict legislative clarity, but I accept that it was designed to allow the worthy discussion we have just had.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware, as a consequence of the Committee Stage debate, that the Irish League of Credit Unions expressed concerns about the amendments the Minister proposed to make to the provisions relating to the Registrar of Credit Unions and specifically, to the registrar's reporting relationship with the regulatory authority. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that an amendment is being introduced on Report Stage that arises from his discussions with officials from the league.</P>
      <P>I echo the Minister's comment on Committee Stage that there is nothing new in this Bill in respect of the legislation under which credit unions operate. As Deputy Ó Caoláin acknowledged, the Credit Unions Act 1997 remains the primary legislation in that regard. The league issued a press release stating that while it would have preferred the provisions relating to the registrar to remain in the Bill as published, it acknowledges that the amendment proposed by the Minister recognises the distinct voluntary character and social and economic role of credit unions. The Minister also pointed out that the interim regulatory authority, which he appointed in April 2002, has indicated in two letters that it will take into account the unique nature of credit unions when making decisions which relate to them. The Registrar of Credit Unions will be required to appear before an Oireachtas committee and Deputies will have an opportunity to question the registrar on any issues they wish to raise. Under the circumstances, the Minister is of the opinion that, with regard to the commencement of the provisions of the Act, there is no need to single out credit unions in the manner proposed in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the discussion of the relevant section in the time available to the House was raised, quite fairly. Deputy Richard Bruton asked me to explain why the Minister has introduced the new provision. I am sure the Chair will allow me to anticipate the discussion on the section. The Bill, as published, provided that the functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, under the 1997 Act, would be carried out independently by <Col N="495" /> a registrar of credit unions within the overall framework of the regulatory authority. The members of the interim Irish financial services regulatory authority and the Governor of the Central Bank expressed reservations about the reporting arrangements for the Registrar of Credit Unions within the proposed regulatory authority and the fact that the level of independence proposed for the registrar appeared to contradict principles of good governance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>The Minister has, therefore, proposed a number of amendments to alter the reporting relationship of the Registrar of Credit Unions and to bring the matter more fully within the framework of the regulatory authority. Essentially, the registrar's reporting relationship will be analogous to that of the consumer director. The Minister met the Irish League of Credit Unions, which has accepted the conclusions he has arrived at. The league believes that terms such as &ldquo;not-for-profit&rdquo;, &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;, &ldquo;social and economic principles&rdquo; and &ldquo;mutual benefit&rdquo;, which were used in meetings between departmental officials and the league, describe the ethos of the credit union movement.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State reached the net point, which is that the Minister for Finance's amendment to section 33 provides inadequate recognition of the special role and ethos of credit unions. The voluntary work of credit union officers, the overall voluntary ethos of credit unions and mutuality are specifically referred to in the Credit Union Act. There will be problems, however, as a result of the lack of recognition of the not-for-profit nature of credit unions. Two things may happen as a consequence of the new regime. It may prove difficult to establish new credit unions, as they will be subject to a banking regime which originates in the Central Bank. Second, credit unions will be subject to a regulatory regime which recognises only mutuality and voluntarism.</P>
      <P>I cite the example of building societies. Deputy Ó Caoláin mentioned that he has 32 years of experience in banking and anyone with such experience will recognise that there was a significant mutual and voluntary building society movement in this country 32 years ago. It cannot be exactly compared with credit unions, but parts of its ethos were rather similar. Most larger building societies are now owned and controlled by the larger banks, however. Many of my constituents, who are also the constituents of the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, do not have access to banking facilities. Access to the benefits of credit unions will not be facilitated by placing the credit union movement in a super-structure intended for large and rapacious commercial banking organisations with an absolute for-profit motive.</P>

On that basis, the Minister for Finance is not disposed to accept this amendment.</P>

It has already been argued that the Bill is inadequately weighted in favour of the regulation of banking and financial services in the interests of the consumer. This amendment calls for a report on the Minister's proposals for establishing the office of the financial services ombudsman to which the consumers of banking services &ndash; individuals, families and businesses &ndash; can have recourse if they wish to make a complaint.</P>
      <P>There have been continuous reports this year of astonishing losses incurred by individuals and pension funds as a result of investment in financial services. The Minister for Finance appeared before the committee and the House on a number of occasions to say that he is proud of throwing &euro;8 billion into the national pensions reserve fund, to be invested in equities throughout the world. This has resulted in a huge loss to the State. Because of current stock market trends, which look set to continue for another few years, consumers urgently need a financial services ombudsman to address the deficiencies and shortcomings in the financial services. Financial services operators charge very handsomely for their services and people who lose out have very little recourse in terms of righting wrongs that may have been done to them.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Finance published this Bill, he announced his intention to publish a second Bill which will implement other recommendations contained in the McDowell report, including the establishment of the statutory financial services ombudsman referred to by the Deputy. It will also contain provisions setting up the consultative panels of consumers and the financial services industry. The heads of this Bill have already been the subject of an extensive public consultation process and the Minister has stated he hopes to publish the Bill before the end of the year. Given that the proposals for the statutory financial services ombudsman scheme will be in the second Bill, I am not disposed to accepting the amendment.</P>

      <Col N="499" /> Deputy Burton put down amendments on Committee Stage to include in the Bill the Irish language versions of the titles of the regulatory authority and the appeals tribunal, the contents of which are repeated in amendments Nos. 16 and 39. The Minister for Finance agreed on Committee Stage to accept the amendments subject to having the proposed translations confirmed by Rannóg an Aistriúcháin in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Amendments Nos. 15 and 38 set down by the Minister for Finance are revised versions of those put forward by Deputy Burton, as amended by the translation section.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 inserts the Irish version of the title of the regulatory authority into section 33B of the principal Act, which is the section that establishes the authority. Amendment No. 38 inserts the Irish version of the title of the appeals tribunal into section 57C of the principal Act, which is where the appeals tribunal is established. Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Teachta i dtaobh na leasaithe seo.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced on Committee Stage his intention to amend the definition of the appeals tribunal within section 2 of the principal Act so the title will be consistent throughout the Bill. Section 57C of the principal Act establishes the appeals tribunal as the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. However, the appeals tribunal as defined in section 2 is amended by section 4 of the Bill as the Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. Amendment No. 5 changes the definition by inserting the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; at the beginning of the title Financial Services Appeals Tribunal and hence it will be known as the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is a similar change to the title in amendment No. 37, which concerns Part VIIA of the Act. The effect of the amendments will be that the formal title of the appeals tribunal will be consistent throughout the Bill. Upon the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel amendment No. 5 includes the definition of the appeals tribunal, a reference to section 57C where the tribunal is established. As the title will appear in both English and Irish the definition in section 2 should make express reference to this section. Similarly, the definition of the regulatory authority is being amended by amendment No. 6 to include a reference to section 33B, which establishes the regulatory authority.

Some of the rates of interest that apply to credit and loan instruments are little better than those that pertain to money lending. They cause great distress to many individuals and families.

      <P>It is with great pleasure that I address the sense of scandal and foreboding foisted on this House and an unsuspecting public in relation to the Government's proposal to restrict some of the generous provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, which permits to citizens access to vital information. It is never easy to roll back universal rights once they have been granted and it is no easy job to defend the Government on this issue. A Government will always court unpopularity when it admits a mistake and makes changes to legislation it put in place. It takes great courage on the part of a Minister or Cabinet to face the music on specific issues.</P>
      <P>The very words &ldquo;freedom of information&rdquo; convey a beautiful sense of a nirvana in which one can get every file and document one ever wanted. It gives the impression that files can be plucked from the Civil Service system at no cost to one, to the Exchequer, to the taxpayer or to the proper conduct of modern government. We are all aware that the world we live in is different. For every right conferred there is a duty and associated costs. Certain rights need to be trammelled in the context of those costs. When one has a freedom of information system which permits occasional and vexatious inquiries, what occurs is an abuse of the rights process freedom of information is designed to protect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No substantial rights of the citizen are being eroded by the Government's changes to freedom of information legislation. The modern process of giving the citizen a right of access to information is very much in its infancy and the healthy principle involved is one to which all Members of this House subscribe. At its most simple, it means our bureaucratic, administrative and ministerial decisions are up front and transparent. When people request vital information as it affects them, it can lead to the vindication of their rights. The danger implicit in freedom of information is that unscrupulous or eccentric people may request information that ties up the time of civil servants for many hours. It is with regret that I reiterate the example cited by the Minister for Finance in this House. An unnamed citizen made a freedom of information request which cost the State &euro;10,000, but incurred a charge of only &euro;600. How was the public interest served by the request for the diary contents of every Minister, Minister <Col N="502" /> of State and senior civil servant in the Administration? One would not mind if the citizen was alleging some gross conspiracy against him or her or the State by all of those ladies and gentlemen, but nothing of the sort was suggested. A cost of &euro;10,000 was incurred by taxpayers who are crying out for additional services and who rightly complain that hospital services are inadequate to the needs of a modern country.</P>
    <P>The significant costs incurred by requests of this sort are not met by the charging system and the Minister should have gone further than he has in amending the legislation in this regard. Opposition Members ignore the fact that the Government is not seeking to restrict the right of individual citizens to request, free of charge, information that pertains personally to them. It is rightly the case that individuals are not charged for requesting information about them held by any agency of the State. The change comes in the form of a new system of charges which will ensure that vexatious inquiries do not become the norm.</P>
    <P>As a former journalist, I recognise that freedom of information has been great for the media. My former colleagues do not have to work at all to conduct inquiries or investigations. Investigative journalism has always been described as absent from Ireland and circumstances have worsened since the State decided to supply journalists with every bit of information they wished to write about. We have seen the same thing with Members of the House.</P>

      <P>I do not mind being accused of being a poacher turned gamekeeper. I am a servant of the public in the first instance. I may occasionally write a few articles, but I am a full-time politician. It is ridiculous that this wonderful legislation has been used by the media over the last four years to inquire about the expenses of Deputies and Senators up to six times annually. That makes a mockery of investigative journalism and of our democracy. The public are treated to the spectacle of expense claims six times a year which gives them the impression of constant payments. Expenses are claimed on a continuous basis, but why go on about it? Is the public educated by these disclosures?</P>

      <P>Are they somehow ennobled and able to make better decisions about how to change our democracy? They are not. Complaints about expenses were most spectacularly made by Deputy Gogarty who is a member of the Technical Group opposite. He said he would not accept the latest increase, but he has not repaid his expenses or his salary increment. That is the kind of hypocrisy we have in this House and we should be man enough and woman enough to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" />The new leader of the Opposition, Deputy Rabbitte, is prepared to go to any lengths to debase himself in front of his media friends. I was amazed at his contribution which was over the top, but the House has heard over the top contributions from him before. We vividly remember the time when he told us that he had information in his possession which if true would rock the foundations of the State. We all know that related to Cardinal Daly.  We know precisely where that led &ndash; it was totally untrue. Cardinal Daly had not interfered in any degree and, of course, there was no apology, but that is hardly the point.</P>
    <P>I thought his contribution was tawdry and cheap and it was unfair to make this stupid and inane linkage to Cheltenham as if the Minister's presence in Cheltenham was somehow a grave sin against the public body because this important legislation was going through the House. It frequently happens that Ministers are absent from the House because of more serious matters than Cheltenham but when Deputy Rabbitte steps up to the microphone he is often prone to exaggeration.</P>
    <P>I remember vividly a quote from the novelist Evelyn Waugh who said that the problem with the Tories and the Conservatives was that they never actually turned the clock back. I am glad to say that this Minister is not afraid to turn the clock back. I am not a Conservative or a Tory but a left-winger&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are members of all political parties who are committed to an open and ethical political regime and they constitute the vast majority of all parties and of non-aligned Deputies. There is considerable disagreement as to the best means for achieving this regime. The Labour Party Bill which is before the House tonight and the Government Bill which is before the Seanad are very similar in a great many respects but they show some differences in approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin when speaking last night claimed credit, and perhaps rightly so, for his party's role in introducing three pieces of legislation which he claimed had an enormous and beneficial effect on public life in this country and on political life in general. They are the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Electoral (Amendment) Act and the Freedom of Information Act. It is a matter of historical fact that all parties supported the new regime to a considerable extent. It is also a fact that much positive change has come about under this new regime but it is also manifestly a fact that all three Acts have required amendments and that they will also require further amendment. The regime which has emerged under the various <Col N="504" /> Electoral Acts is patently daft and unworkable. I suspect that all those who had the misfortune to act as election agents during the general election last year would agree to a substantial extent with that view, as do most candidates. I understand that more than 80% of those who stood for election had inaccuracies in their returns.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government or the relevant committee to initiate a review of that legislation as a matter of urgency with a view to preserving the integrity of the legislation while weeding out the problem areas. The Ethics in Public Office Act has been improved by amendments in 2001. Both the Act and the code of conduct can be greatly improved and should come for review on at least an annual basis. One of the difficulties which our experience of the Acts has discovered is that a great many people are confused by the provisions of the Acts. In the hustle and bustle of political life it is easy to lose sight of the fact that one should have a yardstick against which to measure political actions.</P>
    <P>Most speakers have acknowledged that the Freedom of Information Act also requires amendment. The Bill before the House explicitly provides for a one year extension of the existing five year deadline for release of Cabinet papers. It also provides for a consultative process over that additional time. I have no difficulty in principle with such a process although for a variety of reasons I would not charge the Information Commissioner with overseeing that process. The Bill chooses to ignore the work done in reviewing the Act by a group of senior civil servants, which has become the basis for the Government Act.</P>
    <P>I tend to agree infrequently with my colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, but I agree with him about the cheap shots about Cheltenham. Those remarks are no credit to those who make them and they do not contribute to the betterment of political life. The references made last night to the provision for handicapped persons benefited no one and they came from a party which has a particularly bad record in that regard.</P>
    <P>As politicians we tend to look at the effect in electoral terms on people who have promoted regimes of ethics. Former Minister of State, Eithne FitzGerald, was a hard-working and pleasant Deputy but was given no electoral credit for the hard work she put into the original Act.</P>

      <P>The breathless headlines in the media coverage of a former Fine Gael TD for a minor and very insignificant transgression under the Electoral Acts made me think that the man must have robbed a bank. It was a very tiny transgression. It highlights two factors which create difficulty in relation to the entire regime and which all of us as politicians have difficulty in addressing. There is a deal of ignorance of the requirements of the various Ethics and Electoral Acts not on the part of the public but of ourselves <Col N="505" /> and that is sometimes compounded by changes in the Act. The sensational coverage by the media of the release of information on expenses has done some damage and will continue to do so. Some journalists clearly believe that the Government proposals will have an effect which I do not believe they will have, and they are fearful in that regard.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Opposition can be blamed for taking advantage of an opportunity where journalists are berating the Government and prepared to print what they are saying in this regard. In the same way as good politicians benefit from a regime where there is provision for ethics legislation and where ethical considerations hold sway, likewise, good journalists would benefit if there was a worthwhile press council. It would acknowledge the central role of the media in parliamentary life and in the dissemination of facts to the public. It would also bring under control the libel law regime which is the only current alternative.</P>
      <P>There are a number of negative aspects to the Freedom of Information Act and some have already been mentioned. One of the difficulties is that officials are becoming more reluctant to commit important facts and advice to paper. This has the potential to become a serious difficulty. Deputy Lenihan referred to the cost of the administration of the Act. In the particular case which he cites there are factors besides the amount of material to be waded through in the diaries. It must also be assessed, considered for release and have personal or sensitive material deleted. Any third parties who might be affected must also be notified. That takes time and a lot of administration and it creates difficulties when people pursue requests that are manifestly unfair and unreasonable. It seems officials have become more inclined to suggest that people seek advice and information through the Freedom of Information Act which would have formerly been made freely available to them. This is likely to become an even greater problem if charges are increased, which they must be if the Act is to operate in a meaningful way.</P>
      <P>There are particular problems relating to sensitive Cabinet papers being released. I think that virtually everybody would accept that the need for competent Government would override certain considerations under the Freedom of Information Act. To be fair, that is what is provided for in both Acts.</P>
      <P>On the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, the Ombudsman should not serve simultaneously as Information Commissioner because of the volume of work involved and the nature of the work. It would be better if the roles were kept separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Information Commissioner is interesting. I do not think it differs from the Government's approach in the way some people sought to illustrate. I thought it pointed to the conflict that would arise if the Information Commissioner were to be charged with the role of <Col N="506" /> overseeing whatever consultative process were in place under this legislation. As I said previously, much consultation has already taken place. Having read almost all the information, it is likely that virtually all the changes proposed by the Government would arise in any event on foot of the proposals.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to speak on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2003, which is connected to the original Freedom of Information Bill 2003. I am a supporter of the Freedom of Information Act. It is essential for good government at international and local levels. If it did not exist we would have more problems than Members seem to have with the release of information. In my few short years in public life I have seen no information released into the public domain about which I am concerned. I can think of nothing that has damaged a public body about which information was released.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I have a different view on the matter from some of my party colleagues. During the previous Dáil I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. We dealt with the Freedom of Information Act and the Information Commissioner on an annual basis. The Department of Finance presented an annual report to the committee. The two reports are not synchronised because one is published in April and the other covers the calendar year. I am pleased the legislation deals with that issue.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the information given in these instances has been personal information, which is important. Various Ministers and Ministers of State who attended the committee referred to costs. A small number of isolated cases of possible vexatious claims for information lead to excessive costs. Hard cases lead to bad law and I do not think the legislation should be changed on that basis. A proper appeals mechanism should be put in place to overrule the release of information if it is deemed vexatious. I would be concerned that a charge would cause unreasonable difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years motorway projects were proposed for County Laois. Various landowners sought information from the National Roads Authority under the Freedom of Information Act in regard to the work carried out on their land. As the National Roads Authority was not covered under the Act, I am pleased the previous Government succeeded in bringing the body under the Act. People had to seek information through the local authority. The local authority procured the information from the NRA and ultimately the people got it. I am concerned about the proposal that information could be refused under the proposed legislation because it might cause significant disruption to the functioning of an organisation. That is not a good reason for refusing information. Public bodies should organise information so that it is readily accessible. The <Col N="507" /> reason it causes such disruption is because they have no proper filing system in the first instance. It would be better if public bodies had a proper filing system rather than complaining about people seeking information that should be easily accessible.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that last week the committee considered an EU proposal called &ldquo;Commercial Exploitation of Public Documents.&rdquo;  This related to information across Europe being publicly available and the valuable use to which it could be put in the era of information technology. I would not like an Irish proposal to row back on what is the situation throughout Europe. Tomorrow the joint committee will meet on this matter, which is a worthwhile exercise. The Seanad is debating the matter all week. We are debating the issue tonight in the Dáil and the joint committee will meet for a full day tomorrow to deal with the issue. The Secretaries General who drafted the report, the Information Commissioner, representatives of the National Union of Journalists, national media proprietors and the Irish Council of Civil Liberties will attend the committee.</P>
    <P>I want to read a paragraph from a letter sent to the committee by Mr. Dermot McCarthy, Secretary General to the Government. The paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of classification in advance of Thursday's meeting, the members of the Committee may wish to note that the Group was set up by the Government to assist them in their consideration of a number of important aspects of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Our recommendations were prepared as advice to the Government and as a contribution to their deliberations on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is important for people not to attach too much weight to the report because they have stated that it is just a contribution to the wider review the Government is carrying out. That was not the beginning or end of the process. Just because something may or may not have been in the report does not prevent it from being included in the final legislation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Information Commissioner has provided a helpful analysis. While he is charged with the implementation of the Act, it is important that his role is kept separate from those who are responsible for drawing up the policies. It is the job of the Oireachtas to set out the policies and draft the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be pleased to discuss that issue tomorrow. In regard to future legislation, I hope there will be a clear demarcation line. I am making the point that these are two separate issues. While I am not attempting to be critical, I want to point out that there are two different jobs <Col N="508" /> to be done. The review of the existing legislation is absolutely within his brief, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>The issue of politicians' expenses has been referred to. It was news the first and second time it was mentioned, but it does not even make the newspapers now. The message from Government is that because officials may not want their memos released they will be less inclined to write controversial memos to Ministers. I view that differently. The Freedom of Information Act brought a change in culture to the operation of public bodies. For the first five, six or ten years there will be fear. Eventually people will become sufficiently confident to put their views on paper and stand over them. I would hate to think that civil servants were so narrow in their thinking that they would be afraid to commit something to paper in case it might be released in due course under the Freedom of Information Act. A lot of good could come from the Act.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the Government's proposed ten year timescale in regard to Cabinet papers. I am concerned about other issues. One paragraph states that if the release of information shows a public body in an adverse light, the head of the section could refuse to release information. I would take that to mean that information could only be released if it was positive propaganda, with which I would have a fundamental problem. If information is in the public interest and in our interest as legislators, we are entitled to access it, regardless of whether it shows an organisation in a positive or negative light. I would be concerned if the only information released was information which would show an organisation in a positive light. I say that having not been involved in the political process for too long. In many organisations throughout the country there is a culture of resisting the disclosure of information unless obliged to do so. The Act has forced welcome change in this attitude.</P>
      <P>I hope the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service holds a constructive debate on this issue, especially given the number of witnesses who have been invited. I do not share the concerns of those who have criticised the holding of the meeting at a time when the Government's Bill is before a House of the Oireachtas. It is a positive development. I hope that at the end of the meeting, members of the committee will be better informed and in a position to make positive suggestions to this debate when it resumes in this Chamber in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>When I first became aware of the Government's intention to amend the Freedom of Information Act, I considered it to be a cynical <Col N="509" /> rather than a sinister move. It appeared that the Government wanted to pull down the shutters and retreat to the bunker and that it did not wish to be exposed to the cold light of reality in terms of how it conducted its affairs in its previous term and how it will conduct itself during this Dáil. It then became apparent to me that its proposals are sinister. Under the guise of maintaining that the Bill is necessary to extend the period that must elapse before the release of Cabinet papers from five to ten yeas, it has included a raft of amendments that will radically affect the intent of the Act and its ability to act as a democratic tool for citizens. This became evident in the course of yesterday's debate on the Labour Party Bill, when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform ironically appeared to have adopted the role of witch-finder general when he attacked a public servant on the grounds that he told the truth. It was especially regrettable when the public servant in question has a particular responsibility to review the Freedom of Information Act and appears not to have been properly involved in the process accompanying the review. In view of this, the proposal in the Labour Party Bill to allow for a one year period of further reflection and consultation is evidently necessary and should be wholeheartedly endorsed by every Member in the House.</P>
      <P>If accepted, the proposal to hold a consultation process can only now take place after the Government's Bill has been presented to the Oireachtas. This is contrary to the usual practice, where consultation takes place after the heads of a Bill have been published. It means that a debate will take place at a time when most of the decisions have been taken by the Executive. It is especially regrettable that the Executive is prepared to behave in the least democratic manner possible in respect of legislation that is meant to enhance democratic behaviour. It is not acceptable to me or my party, nor to many other Members in this House. I commend the Labour Party for introducing this Bill and I believe it will receive sufficient support, at least from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>There are a number of substantive measures in the Government's Bill that are especially objectionable. I question the proposal to impose fees on members of the public who seek additional information to which they should have access as of right. I would have thought that following the fiasco with the EU Commission over the &euro;20 planning fee, the Government would have declined to take this approach. It stinks in terms of encouraging people to access their democratic rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this Parliament will be undermined by the proposal that background information regarding the questions we raise in our legitimate role as public representatives will be barred from us in terms of seeking information on answers that were compiled. I do not know the motivation behind this, but it appears to be <Col N="510" /> an attack on our role as elected public representatives.</P>
    <P>The most disconcerting aspect of the Government's proposal is the absence of a consultative process. While I accept Deputy Fleming's goodwill in this matter, I do not believe his assertion that the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service constitutes a consultative process. It is something that will occur after the event.</P>
    <P>The most sinister aspect of the Government's Bill is the proposal that it is for the Secretary General of each Department to decide on what may constitute relevant information for the purpose of disclosure. Such a provision in legislation that deals with freedom of information totally negates the concept. We might as well not have freedom of information legislation if this is what the Government seeks to achieve. I commend the Labour Party Bill to the House and offer it my wholehearted support.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Labour Party Bill and offer it my wholehearted support. In March 1997, a few months before I became a Member, the House debated the Freedom of Information Bill. In the course of the debate Deputy O'Donnell stated: &ldquo;Governments tend to preserve their interests and have gone to enormous lengths to retain information, the release of which would have prejudiced their being in government.&rdquo;  Deputy Woods stated: &ldquo;The presumption that everything is required to be secret unless proved to the contrary is the single greatest obstacle to openness under this Government.&rdquo;  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, stated: &ldquo;I can envisage the Government of the day or the public body which has possession of certain information being determined to plead the public interest in order to withhold information.&rdquo;  These are currently members of the parties in government, which is seeking to emasculate the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>Freedom of information legislation plays an important role in the promotion of openness, transparency and accountability in government, which in turn leads to an improved system of government. The exercise on the part of the Government on this issue is sad because the Freedom of Information Act has been acknowledged internationally as an example of best practice. The Government's efforts to curtail it are, therefore, all the more regrettable. The proposed amendments to the Act will be a considerable setback for participatory democracy and the involvement of active citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers in this debate have pointed out that the Government has failed to engage in meaningful consultation in the review of the Act. The Information Commissioner was not consulted, nor was the Government's FOI advisory group or the many other interested groups, such as the NUJ, the Opposition parties &ndash; God forbid that the Government should consult with us &ndash; or <Col N="511" /> the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. The review process, which commenced on the re-election of the Government, was carried out in a secretive manner. It was not independent, but was undertaken by a group whose interest is to restrict freedom of information legislation and access to information that should be in the public domain.</P>
    <P>The reasons put forward to justify the introduction of the Government's Bill are not credible. Recently, the Taoiseach explained that the five year rule on the release of Cabinet papers was impractical and dangerous because of sensitive negotiations relating to the peace process. That was totally misleading, especially as section 24 of the Act, dealing with the North, specifically prevents the disclosure of records where their release could adversely affect matters relating to the peace process.</P>

      <P>There are a number of proposals in the Government's Freedom of Information Bill which I find worrying. It would be difficult to enumerate them all or expand on them. I will only mention sections 19 and 20 now because I will not have time to go into detail. The exemption for letters between Ministers relating to matters before Cabinet, the exemption for records held by a State body relating to tribunals of inquiry and the extension on the exemption of Cabinet records from five years to ten years are all objectionable.</P>
      <P>The five year limit for Cabinet records corresponds with the maximum life span of a Government. This means that records relating to a Government currently in power could not become subject to disclosure under the current legislation. I am particularly concerned that the five year rule, which was due to commence on 1 April 2003, relates to the Government which formed the 28th Dáil and which is now coming into its second term of office. People are speculating as to why this change is being made. Is there sensitive material pertaining to the honey deal done between the former Minister, Deputy Woods, and the representatives of the religious institutions that the Government does not want to see brought into the light of day?</P>

      <P>Over the past few days I have listened to debate in the Dáil and Seanad on the freedom of information amendment. During that time I have heard a great deal about the expert group. The recommendations of this expert group have led to the drawing up of the proposed <Col N="512" /> changes in the Freedom of Information Act. I have heard no reference at any time to consultation with user groups, consumers, the advisory group set up to monitor the FOI or the Information Commissioner. It is as if the Freedom of Information Act relates only to senior civil servants, experts and those in government.</P>
      <P>Before I was elected to the Dáil, I thought, naively, that freedom of information related to all of us, experts and non-experts. I believed that the Freedom of Information Act was enacted to allow the non-experts get access to information. Information is power. When people have information they are empowered. It is they who have the power, not the State or Government, permanent or otherwise. If information is power, then the withholding of information from the people is the withholding of power. That is the start of the abuse of power.</P>
      <P>I have some serious concerns about this Bill. This legislation to restrict citizens' access to information is a significant setback to community and voluntary organisations. A core principle of the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity is &ldquo;openness, accountability and transparency in the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector.&rdquo;  This White Paper makes a further commitment to &ldquo;provide access to and to share information relevant to the pursuit of shared objectives.&rdquo;  That statement now sounds hollow. The promise is empty and those fine words are shallow in light of this proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>Another issue of concern regards what they have to fear. What are they afraid of and what could they be saying or advising that is not fit for the public ear five years later? Perhaps one explanation for this is the proposed definition of the word Government. The Information Commissioner has stated: &ldquo;The proposed extension of that definition would admit of the interpretation of the expression &ldquo;Government&rdquo; as meaning a committee of officials, not one of whom is a member of the Government and indeed some or none of whom may be civil servants of the State or Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Has the Government totally lost the plot? A meeting of spin doctors to concoct a possibly misleading presentation can be judged to be an exempted Government discussion and not open to public scrutiny. Perhaps spin doctoring has assumed such importance that it is now actually accepted as government. The fact that unelected people can be regarded as Government is a serious erosion of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of information to people is awkward at times. It can be messy, inconvenient, time-consuming, troublesome and embarrassing. It can also threaten those who have something to hide. It can be downright difficult. Surely the provision of information to citizens is the hallmark of a system that values democratic accountability above administrative convenience. It is the mark of a Government that values sincerity above spin, that employs health care workers <Col N="513" /> rather than media monitors and promotes truth, openness and accountability above image, image and more image.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told us that the Freedom of Information Act was being amended so that Government could reach decisions in the best interests of the community. I have only one question. Is the Minister telling us he cannot achieve that objective in the cold light of day? I commend this amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. I strongly support the legislation, particularly the section dealing with the year's delay in changing the Act. All those involved in public life must be open, transparent and fair. This is an essential part of public life and part of our public and civic duty. If anyone has a problem with that, I question whether he or she should be involved in public life.</P>
      <P>I was amazed earlier to hear that a former journalist, Deputy Lenihan, will vote against this Bill later tonight. It is also disgraceful that two Ministers responsible for restrictions on the Freedom of Information Act are in Cheltenham at the races. This is not a cheap shot but fact. This shows the arrogance and contempt the Government has for the people and for freedom of information.</P>
      <P>This is an issue of major national importance which also concerns taxpayers. The freedom of information legislation has already saved taxpayers approximately &euro;700 million. It saved them money particularly in regard to the national stadium. Freedom of information concerns not only journalists seeking information for the public good. It is important to remind journalists and the media that they too have a civic duty to be open, responsible and fair.</P>
      <P>In my eight months in this House I have seen examples of unfair reporting and lack of balance and fairness. This is particularly true of some of our Sunday papers which seem to have a problem concerning some TDs and will not give them the right of reply, particularly when the newspapers themselves are wrong. The public would like to see some freedom and some real information from the media. The people do not always get the truth in the news. We all have a civic duty to speak out on this injustice and must let the people know that we do not always have a free and balanced press. The press has a moral and ethical duty to report fairly and properly.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we stand up for our rights in regard to the broad issue of freedom of information. We have too long a history of scandals, tribunals and rip-offs to ignore the need for access to information. Sleaze has occurred in politics. A quality freedom of information Act can act as a preventative measure. There is nothing wrong with openness and accountability. It should be a central part of public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, I heard the Taoiseach say that we are among the most liberal in Europe regarding legislation and freedom of information. That is <Col N="514" /> wonderful. There is nothing wrong with that. If we are the most liberal let us use that as an example of good practice. It is something to be proud of in the EU and should not be taken back or destroyed. There is nothing progressive or democratic about this attempt by the Government to delete sections of the Freedom of Information Act. Deputies pretending to be liberal and democratic have now been exposed as frauds. If they are really serious they will support this Bill tonight.</P>
    <P>It is progressive legislation and should be supported by all shades of opinion in this House. The Bill before us is above politics and political parties and should be supported by us all. I urge Members to stand back and reflect on it. Let us not destroy the recent efforts to save politics. This Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill is an attempt to save politics and bring the public along with us so we have an open and democratic society. We must not forget that 38% of people do not vote because they do not like sleaze and have no confidence in the political system.</P>
    <P>It will be a major step backwards for Irish politics if the Government blows this Bill out of the water. It will also be a step backwards for taxpayers and citizens. I urge all Members to unite and support this progressive legislation which has the potential to enhance and develop our democracy, which is something we should never take for granted.</P>

      <P>When the history of this Government comes to be written I believe that the publication of its Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill will be regarded as a defining moment. It will be regarded as the point at which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste finally lost the plot.</P>
      <P>It is a political truism that the longer a Government remains in office, the more it loses touch with the public and with reality. Fianna Fáil has now been in Government for so long &ndash; 16 years with the exception of the two and half year period of the rainbow Government &ndash; that it has lost all touch with reality and no longer even bothers to disguise its contempt for the public and the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from their approach and demeanour that Ministers regard having to present themselves in, and answer to, the House as a bothersome experience. Nothing exemplifies this arrogant approach more than the decision of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Parlon, to absent themselves from the Oireachtas when both Houses are considering matters relating to the freedom of information issue for which they have ministerial responsibility. It is bad enough that they should decide not to be here, <Col N="515" /> but what makes it especially offensive is that they are absenting themselves from the House in order to be at Cheltenham. This is a deliberate snub to the Dáil and to the Irish public. What this gesture says is: &ldquo;You may consider this issue to be important, but we don't care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For democrats, freedom of information is a touchstone issue. I regard the Freedom of Information Act introduced by my colleague, Eithne Fitzgerald, as one of the most important legacies of the rainbow Government. The Act was introduced specifically to end the climate of secrecy and unaccountability that made the sleazy standards of the Haughey era possible. The Act has been an outstanding success. It has significantly increased the flow of information to the public. It has exposed the process of decision making in Government to public scrutiny. It has limited the capacity of Government to mislead the public. It has made it more difficult for Ministers to adopt one position in public and another one in private. Of course, these are some of the reasons Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats want to turn the clock back and revert to the Haughey era when citizens were kept in the dark.</P>
    <P>Neither the authors of the high level report nor any of the few Government members who have come out to defend the Government's proposals, have been able to point to a single instance where the public interest has been damaged by the operation of the Act as introduced by Eithne Fitzgerald. As a direct result of the Act, we know a lot more about the poor state of our health services and we know about the efforts of the Minister for Finance to impose further cutbacks in this and many other areas. Are the public not entitled to this information?</P>
    <P>The only consistent argument that has been put forward by the Government is that the existing Act somehow inhibits what it calls the deliberative process. In effect, what it is really seeking is a licence to say one thing in public and another in private. The amendments being pushed by the Government with such vigour are not minor technical amendments that will have little impact on the Act or on the rights of citizens to access information. Turning logic on its head in a way that only he can, the Taoiseach told the Dáil yesterday that the Act would be even more liberal if the Government's amendments are passed. It is pleasant to see that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, finds this amusing.</P>
    <P>Let me list just some of the more damaging consequences of the Government proposals: it will widen the definition of Cabinet papers to include sub-committees involving officials &ndash; as the Information Commissioner pointed out yesterday this involves a &ldquo;constitutionally unrecognisable definition&rdquo; of Government &ndash; Cabinet papers will now be exempt for ten years rather than five; the appeals process is being set aside for deliberative policy documents when the process is certified as ongoing; background documents relating to the setting up of tribunals are <Col N="516" /> to be exempt; background documents for parliamentary questions are to be exempt; charges are to be levied for all non-personal requests and charges to be levied on appeal. These changes represent a major gutting of the Act.</P>

      <P>The balance will be tipped away from the public interest and back towards Government and the interests of secrecy. In contrast, the Labour Party Bill offers a rational and logical alternative to the Government proposals. Our Bill would effectively put the Government proposals on hold for a year and would provide for a genuine process of consultation and discussions with user groups and interested parties.</P>
      <P>Any reasonable Government would accept that this is a reasonable proposal, but this is not a reasonable Government. As I said at the outset, Fianna Fáil has been so long in Government buildings that it has lost touch with reality. Arrogance has replaced answerability. I presume those on the Government side are familiar with the term &ldquo;hubris.&rdquo;  It is a Greek term meaning overbearing pride or presumption usually leading to retribution. Ministers in this Government are guilty of unprecedented pride and presumption. Retribution will be swift and complete when the people get their opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. The Freedom of Information Act, as it is currently constituted, represents an important link between the citizen and the State. The Labour Party's Bill recognises the need for a proper review of the 1997 legislation with widespread consultation, not just involving an expert review group but including all the relevant stakeholders &ndash; the public, consumers and, above all, we need the views of the Information Commissioner who has been monitoring the Act over a period of time. While there is an argument for tightening up its administrative workings the public should not, under any circumstances, tolerate the complete gutting of the Act as presented in the Government amendment to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the Government is intent on dismantling most of the important items of legislation introduced by the rainbow Government that were directed towards the reform of the State and changing the way public life was conducted. In terms of reforming public life, which was so badly undermined in the 1980s and 1990s by a series of scandals involving politicians and their dealings with businessmen, the rainbow Government introduced three significant Acts; the Electoral (Amendment) Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act. These were all attempts to clean up public life and introduce proper standards of openness, transparency and public scrutiny in the way the State is run. The Government has set on a course of destroying the main elements of these Acts, one by one. In the previous Government, the <Col N="517" /> then Minister for the Environment and Local Government made an absolute mess of the Electoral (Amendment) Act trying to fillet its main provisions. The Government is now trying to keep the public in the dark about how it is conducting its business. In doing so, I suggest that the Government has already compromised the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
    <P>Can we expect more? The Government is set on dismantling more of the radical changes to Irish society that the rainbow Government introduced &ndash; the re-imposition of third level fees appears imminent despite the meek whimpers we hear from time to time from Progressive Democrats backbenchers. The Labour Party will oppose any move to turn back the clock on these important decisions that were implemented during the period of the rainbow Government. We are proud of the Freedom of Information Act. We are also proud of the abolition of third level fees and we will oppose any attempt to reintroduce them.</P>
    <P>I detect mutterings of discontent from the Progressive Democrats with regard to fees. I assume the attack by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, on the Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, in the House last night demonstrates a raw nerve that has been hit by the Freedom of Information Act, as by so many other issues. Are the Progressive Democrats prepared to be the Fianna Fáil watchdog, as they promised before the election? Are they prepared to say that the amendments to the Act, as proposed by the Government, are a blatant denial of openness in public life, as they would have said previously?</P>
    <P>We should be making public life as open and participative as possible. The Government amendments shield and conceal information from the public rather than encourage citizens to inquire about how their State is run. I cannot imagine a more condescending or arrogant message being sent from a Government to the people it purports to serve. Excluding the public from accessing information will only alienate more people from politics and public life. How can the Government, on the one hand, openly advocate greater participation in politics while, on the other, present such a secretive and paranoid set of amendments.</P>
    <P>Jonathan Swift put it in a nutshell: &ldquo;Providence never intended to make the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended by a few persons of sublime genius.&rdquo;  Perhaps the geniuses on the Government benches will reflect on those words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saddened to have to address this matter and even more saddened that the Member representing the Government is a person, unlike his brother, for whom I have a lot of time and for whom, I believe, this is not a pleasant task. As a professional lawyer, he knows the intrinsic value of truthful evidence in any court of law to protect the innocent from wrongful pros<Col N="518" /> ecution. By extension, the value of truthful fact for citizens in relation to how they are dealt with by the State is something that very few of the 187 states represented in the United Nations demonstrate for their citizens.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to go back to the reason the programme for Government negotiated by the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil in 1992 attempted to address the issue of freedom of access to information. We were in the wake of what had precipitated the fall of the first Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil coalition. That was the confrontation in the Goodman beef tribunal and the statement made by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, who chaired that tribunal, that if questions had been answered truthfully in this House by the relevant Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Administration on the issue of insurance and agriculture the tribunal would not have been necessary. That was the first major tribunal of recent times and from it arose the momentum for freedom of information legislation. Ten years later and given the tribunals we have had since then, I would have thought the Government would not have lost faith in the necessity for openness, transparency and accountability.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to listen to Deputies Fleming and Conor Lenihan saying they were always in favour of this and that Fianna Fáil believes in the principle of openness. I recall negotiating with the Deputies who are now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Taoiseach and Minister for Education and Science who then represented Fianna Fáil. Deputy Howlin and former Deputy Mervyn Taylor sat across the table from them during Christmas 1992. The Labour Party had made the question of access to information a core part of our campaign in the election of November 1992. It was rejected out of hand by the Minister, Deputy Cowen. He said that under no circumstances would Fianna Fáil contemplate such legislation and that they could not possibly give a commitment to introduce it because it would make the workings of Government, in which he had been a Minister for less than a year, absolutely impossible. I paraphrase his sentiment but I accurately record the strength with which he conveyed it.</P>
      <P>What resulted from that? We failed to negotiate an agreement in respect of this matter and it was referred to the respective leaders of the two parties, former Deputies Reynolds and Spring. The compromise is contained in the programme for Government published in January 1993 where there is a long and comprehensive commitment to freedom of information, as would befit the Fianna Fáil Party. It states, &ldquo;We will consider the introduction of freedom of information legislation.&rdquo;  It was a face saving notification of the principle but no commitment to do anything other than consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Less than two years later, following the fall of that Government, the three parties that formed the rainbow coalition produced a programme for <Col N="519" /> Government that was published in December 1994 and contained the following commitment:</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for greater openness and accountability in Irish life to allow much better public access to information in the possession of the State Departments and agencies, both about themselves and the workings of the Government and Administration. We are, therefore, committed to the enactment of freedom of information legislation to cover both central Government and the broad public sector in 1995, modelled on the best practices in other countries. The legislation will be prepared so as to ensure that necessary exemptions are kept to a minimum and it will contain a mechanism for independent review and appeals.</P>
    <P>I accept that the time has come, following the implementation of that legislation, for an independent review and to consider how it is working. No such legislation could be deemed to be perfect. I do not believe the process the Government has embarked upon and the indecent haste with which it is pursuing the implementation of this legislation meets the sprit of that commitment or any of the sentiments expressed in this House or in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party proposal is eminently sensible and reasonable. Let us freeze-frame any change in the legislation for a year while we make a full and comprehensive review of the legislation so that we can achieve the best practice from everybody's point of view, including officials in the Civil Service, individuals, Ministers and Ministers of State, and elected representatives at national and local level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should extend for one year the current provisions of this legislation. It has done untold good for this republic and for its citizens. It has restored faith in our administration and has changed the culture of decision making within our Administration, for permanent civil servants <Col N="520" /> and elected representatives. The attempts to strangle it in the manner articulated by Deputy McManus will simply fuel the cynicism already out there in respect of the integrity of public office in the State. That is in nobody's interest, least of all elected representatives such as those in this House. I call on all of them to support this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Private Members' Bill but the discussion is on the contemporary controversy about official information and access to it. Naturally the Labour Party Deputies who contributed in the past few minutes pointed to the Freedom of Information Act as a Magna Carta of achievement in terms of their contribution in government. Nobody would take issue with that. The Act has been in operation for five years. It has been extended to cover 370 public bodies rather than 67 bodies. Were I to make a claim for the last Government, of which I was not a member, it would be that it implemented the Act. As many Deputies are only too well aware an Act and its implementation are two entirely different processes, one of the first lessons I have learned in government. When one looks at the culture of secrecy which we inherited from the British arrangement, the Freedom of Information Act was a remarkable revolution in our thinking about official information. We can overstate the extent to which the Government is proposing to alter matters. The Government is committed to openness and official information. It is important that we have that public access to official information but it must be consistent with the public interest and the right of privacy.</P>
      <P>I was struck by Deputy McManus who said that access to official information had weakened the Government on many occasions and had exposed the inner workings of Government. The Government is part of the Constitution as well. The proper working of the Government requires the utmost candour of communication between the members of the Government. It also requires that arguments about public policy within the Government are reduced to writing because the discipline of reducing an argument to writing is an important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the extent to which our official information arrangements expose the inner workings of Government because I believe they will lead to an arrangement where arguments are not committed to writing. When arguments are not committed to writing they do not receive the same scrutiny and analysis that argument requires. I am not convinced that if the Deputies opposite are fortunate enough, after the next general election, to form a rainbow Government of some type, it would not view this issue as a priority because the strength of the Executive is an important issue in our Administration as well. The Executive has to have the power to have some inner working of itself because it is the body which, under the Constitution, gives direc<Col N="521" /> tion to Parliament and to policy. We can all argue from time to time about whether that direction is present and whether it is the right or the wrong direction. We are not entering into that argument now but without that direction from the Executive our State does not have leadership.</P>
    <P>The official information question has to be looked at by the Government. We can and will, no doubt, argue when the Dáil resumes and when the Bill arrives here from the Seanad about the elegances and the inelegancies of how this matter has been transacted. The fundamental issue is that there has to be candour of discussion within the Government. We cannot have Ministers going around saying, &ldquo;Do not put that in writing, this is the position.&rdquo;  We cannot have public servants, when they formulate arguments for public decisions, saying, they had better not put that in writing because they would be reading their own opinions in a newspaper in a few weeks' time. Neither can we have Ministers in preparation for meetings exchanging candid views and questions because they will not exchange them in writing if we continue with the present arrangement. That is not a popular point of view and Deputies opposite will argue that the Government has transgressed in many respects. What it is proposing in this respect will be secretly admired and in the fullness of time will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I commend the Labour Party for tabling this Private Members' Bill and thank Deputy Rabbitte for allowing me a few minutes of his time. This is a debate which this House should not have. We are discussing a Bill which it should not have been necessary to draft. It is a response to a Government action which should not have been taken. Today the Government guillotined Committee Stage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill in the Seanad. Tomorrow it will ram it through Report Stage with supreme political arrogance and a new-found aggression. Tomorrow, at the request of the Fine Gael Party, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service will hold hearings to discuss the Freedom of Information Act and the recently conducted review and to hear from some interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has conducted what it calls a major review of the Act in a way that is completely contrary to its own policy of pre-legislative consultation. It did not consult the public, Opposition parties, the NUJ, the Information Commissioner or community and voluntary bodies. In the name of all these interested parties, surely somebody on the Government benches should point out, to whom the Minister for Finance called the numerically challenged people of the country, who ordered this review? Who in <Col N="522" /> Government initiated this review and for what purpose? </P>
    <P>This week was one where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could have done with some anger-management therapy. His fury at the Garda for leaking a report on the penalty points system soon stretched to the Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, an individual whose probity, impartiality, and eminence has always been beyond reproach but he dared to challenge the Government. The former Attorney General decided that the Information Commissioner needed the parliamentary equivalent of the belt of the crozier for daring to demur. Fianna Fáil's last election manifesto stated:</P>
    <P>We recognise the central importance of the Freedom of Information Act in ensuring transparent and accountable public administration. We will ensure that the Act covers all significant areas of public services involving those both currently in place and such new services as may be established in the future.</P>
    <P>What is the Government of Ireland if not the quintessential public administration? This new deal will specifically exclude both to save the Government's blushes. The postman always rings twice and events like the Abbotstown fiasco would land bang on the doorstep. Members will recall the memorandum on departmental spending that was inadvertently released. The prospect of that happening on a weekly basis was too much to handle. The bottom line here, saving the blushes of Government, wins every time over the public's right to know. In this and other areas the public knows it is being conned. It knows it will never receive the unvarnished truth and instead will get plenty of publicly-funded spin.</P>
    <P>By pressing on with this legislation the Government is putting a pebble in the shoe of every voter. They may be able to continue walking but that little irritant will still be there, that knowing feeling that one cannot trust the Government and what it is saying. There is more going on but the Government is determined to suppress it.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Labour Party Bill. The Labour Party, like my own party, is endeavouring to use reason and commonsense to persuade the Government to row back from its attack on the Act and to engage in a meaningful and open debate. Unfortunately, I have heard nothing from any Member on the Government side that convinces me that this Administration is for turning on this issue. The Government should learn one lesson from this debacle &ndash; when one is in a hole, stop digging. It should accept this Bill, take a year out, give the Freedom of Information Bill the time and space it needs for mature and sensible reflection and debate. It is the least Ireland and its people deserve from a Government that appears to have lost its way and adopted an utterly arrogant and uncaring attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny and his colleagues, the Green Party, Sinn Féin, Indepen<Col N="523" /> dent Deputies and Deputies from the Fianna Fáil side of the House who supported our Bill, but I am not sure whether they will vote for it. It is the first time I have ever been associated with a Private Members' Bill when the measure before the House attracted no criticism from the Government. Not one Deputy criticised the Labour Party Bill before the House. That speaks volumes in the absence of the two Ministers responsible for this measure who are in Cheltenham. Deputy Killeen, with whom I have a great measure of agreement, felt that was a cheap shot. I am not sure it is a cheap shot. The two Ministers who rail-roaded this Bill through the Upper House in the middle of the night as though it was an emergency measure do not bother to present to the House to pilot it through. I cannot see how that is a cheap shot.</P>
      <P>The Government, in the absence of those two Ministers in Cheltenham, sends in its two leading advocates, two eminent senior counsel, to present arguments why the Labour Party Bill should not be taken on board and they do not make any. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, says the Freedom of Information Act as we know it is the Magna Carta of Labour Party achievement in Government. However, he wants to reverse the Magna Carta because that is what his Government is about to do. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, could not find fault with the Bill other than to say in passing that he found it confusing and complex. If the Minister finds this Bill confusing and complex, Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda have gone to his head. It is neither confusing nor complex.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn said all that is required is to freeze frame the existing Act while we engage in proper public consultation. I have reason to believe Deputy McDowell can get his mind around that concept. I do not think he has any difficulty with it. It is extraordinary that, at the end of this Private Members' debate, no arguments against the Bill have been advanced. That illustrates the single-minded determination of the Government to see through a measure conceived in secrecy. We were not advised about it prior to the general election although the Taoiseach did make a speech at his Ard-Fheis prior to the general election praising the Freedom of Information Act and giving the impression, something he is very good at, that he had something to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn put on the record of the House an interesting historical titbit to the effect that when he sought to negotiate a commitment to a Freedom of Information Act in the then programme for Government of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, said: &ldquo;No way, over my dead body.&rdquo;  That seems to be the consistent position of Fianna Fáil. When it found itself confronted with this on coming back into Government it vowed to get rid of it. It kept its intentions a well guarded secret until <Col N="524" /> after the general election and then set about giving directions to a committee of eminent civil servants who, as Deputy Richard Bruton pointed out last night, are on one side of the argument, to get on with it.</P>

      <P>Claims that the Freedom of Information Act impedes good government are not true. I take Deputy Fleming's view that it will take a little time for this to bed down and when civil servants get used to it, they will work it. It will enhance quality. The Minister's arrival into the House reminds me of another argument he made last night about not releasing back-up information for parliamentary questions. He said we could not operate that way because the information is often rubbish which one could not rely on anyway. If that is the case, the quality might improve as would public information if this Act remains in place. The truth will out. If there is merit in the argument, why not accept the Labour Party Bill? We do not have closed minds on the subject. We should extend the Act for another year, let the Information Commissioner who is the watchdog convene a proper process of public consultation, and let us take evidence from the Government and Deputy Woods who, in 1997, thought it was a half measure &ndash; window dressing. He denounced it because it did not repeal the Official Secrets Act. Let us hear from Deputy Woods. I would like to ask him a few questions about how he slunk off into the night to negotiate with the religious congregations a deal for which taxpayers will be paying for the next ten years. I would like to hear what Deputy Woods has to say on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>They say the past is a foreign country. It seems the past is a comfortable country for the parties in Government. They want to revert to the culture of secrecy which dominated the past. I cannot see how the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, can argue that the changes are not major. Yesterday the Taoiseach went so far as to say the current Act is liberal and will be even more liberal when he makes <Col N="525" /> amendments to it.

      <P>The Information Commissioner concluded that the provisions of the FOI Act as they stand are more than sufficient to protect all the essential interests of Government. Nothing in the operation of the Freedom of Information Act during the past four years suggests otherwise. That was the view of Mr. Kevin Murphy when addressing the Freedom of Information annual conference on 10 October 2002. The Minister said last night he had not had an opportunity to read Mr. Murphy's report but I am sure he has since read it and noted that he is concerned about significant areas such as the widening of the definition of Cabinet papers which leads to a whole new definition of Government. Government, as <Col N="526" /> we all know, is defined in the Interpretation Act 1937 as being akin to the definition in Article 28 of the Constitution. We now have a situation where the new definition of Government includes any committee of officials. It is extraordinary that the Government has gone to the lengths, in this Bill, of devising and creating a new definition of something as straightforward as Government and as well understood not only in constitutional law, but in common parlance as Government.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that we are in a situation where something which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, believes to be a Magna Carta for the future character of our democracy is to be reversed. If there is anything in the arguments which justifies Secretaries General being able to certify documents as unreleaseable to the public because the subject matter is ongoing &ndash; we can think of a number of matters where it could be used by creative Secretaries General &ndash; that could be discussed within the framework that would be set up under this Bill. Why is Government determined to railroad this Bill through in this fashion?</P>

It has now removed the Teagasc office from that town, and is to sell the research farm in Ballinamore and the Teagasc office in Manorhamilton, among many others that other Members will mention.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the situation in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan where the Government intends to close and sell the office in Bailieboro. That office, which at least 1,000 people visited in the past 12 months, has four full-time advisers and one secretary. Five discussion groups hold their meetings there and some 250 student farmers studied there for different exams &ndash; computer and agriculture courses and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a unique situation. This centre is owned by Teagasc. Part of it is leased to the North-Eastern Health Board and it takes in more money than is <Col N="529" /> required to run the place. The advisers are based there and can therefore cover the whole of east Cavan without having to travel major distances. They are now being asked to go to Ballyhaise, which is not owned by Teagasc. They could spend an hour on the road going from there to Kingscourt to serve an individual client and then returning home again. Is this sensible or realistic? The only office that Teagasc owns in Cavan is now being put up for sale, but to what benefit? It will give them a small capital injection this year, but at the cost of having advisers travelling long distances on the road and removing the service from the people of that area.</P>
    <P>The farmers and people of the Bailieborough area in general are up in arms about this. I urge that this whole situation be looked at again. It is disastrous in the long-term. It offers ample proof that the Government is removing whatever service it can from farmers in the hope that the issue will eventually go away. This is no joke. On the Order of Business, I raised the issue of the &euro;20 million that will be removed from farmers' pockets through the imposition of regulations by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, on vaccines and so on. One could go on and on, but I urge the Minister of State to do whatever is necessary to ensure that common sense prevails and that farmers get a service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State is in the House and I hope that he will have some good news for us. I am told that, in real terms, the Teagasc budget has been cut by 19.5% and that there is a &euro;15 million shortfall. The main head office in Cork is closing, leaving no advice centre in the centre of the county. The closest will be Midleton and Clonakilty. At a time when agriculture is on its knees and at a time of great change and challenge for agriculture, the farming industry does not need this. It needs the help and support of a professional advisory service. This advisory service should be supported, in turn, by the Government and should not be put in the position of having to sell land to keep going.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to do everything in his power to reverse this decision, or at least review it, and to ensure that the advisory service has the resources it needs to continue doing the good work it has been doing. Young farmers need all the encouragement they can get now to enter farming. The training of young people for stamp duty exemption, for instance, is important, as is quality control in agriculture and food production, and Teagasc is the professional body providing that information, back-up and advice. I urge the Minister of State to reverse what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression exists that the Government is treating the farmers in the same way that Thatcher treated the miners, that it wants to drive the farmers into the ground and wipe out the industry totally. I hope that is wrong, but the evidence indicates that it is not. The industry is on its knees and now, when it needs support more <Col N="530" /> than ever, the Government is indirectly withdrawing further support by not funding Teagasc properly. Other costs have not been factored in. The cost of relocating the professional staff in Cork, for instance, has not been factored in. There is no free space anywhere else in the county for these advisers. What will happen when the office in Cork closes? It is strategically located, close to the planning and other offices in the city, and Cork, as the Minister of State knows well, is a very important agricultural producer. Farmers now need more support than ever. I hope the Minister of State will have some good news for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being here at a time when many Ministers are not. I appeal to him to take a personal involvement and interest in this. I have spoken in adjournment debates on many occasions and I hope this is not one of those occasions when the Minister of State will simply stand up and read a standard response from the Department. I hope he will take a personal interest and listen to the concerns being expressed. This is not an issue I would event attempt to play politics with. It is a very serious issue for agriculture.</P>
      <P>My concerns lie primarily with the situation in Cork. The only Teagasc office in Munster that is being sold is the most important one, at the heart of the flagship agricultural county of Cork. Advisers and ex-advisers have been on the phone to me today in a desperate attempt to get me to ask the Minister to reverse the decisions that have been taken by Teagasc. The office in Cork employs 14 staff and offers an advisory service to dairy farmers, cereal farmers, sugar beet and vegetable farmers. It covers a huge area in the heart of County Cork, including my own family farm. There will be a void in the middle of County Cork if this office is removed. It is arguably the most important Teagasc office in the country from an advisory point of view. That is not an exaggeration. It is certainly the largest in Cork, which is the largest county in almost every agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>This is crazy economics from an agricultural point of view. We are shutting down and selling off a site for short-term capital gain to try to fill a deficit in 2003. What does this say about the long-term viability of farming in counties like Cork? Whatever about disadvantaged counties without fertile land, we are talking here about the prime agricultural land in the country, and this advisory centre is in the middle of it. We are shutting it down in an attempt to maximise the capital value of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also issues relating to the sale of this site that involve the Minister of State because a right of way is required from Cork County Council for access. This will severely restrict the capacity to sell this site to anybody with a commercial interest because it is right in the Middle of Cork County Council's car park for County Hall. There are real practical commercial prob<Col N="531" /> lems in selling this site. The Minister of State needs to get involved, talk to Teagasc and review this situation so that we make a decision that is viable for the long-term future of agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise the Teagasc sell-off of the research farm at Ballinamore in County Leitrim and their offices in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim. The board of Teagasc has taken decisions without having surveyed these actions and their consequences. It has sent out all the wrong signals to those involved in agriculture. Only one member of the board of Teagasc visited the Ballinamore research farm prior to this decision. That is ridiculous. If one is going to sell something and is a member of a semi-State board, one has a duty to diligently carry out one's duties. In doing so, one should look to see what to sell first. That must be considered.</P>
      <P>Considerable investment has been made by Teagasc in the Ballinamore farm over the past two years. We know that it came under threat before, but on previous occasions Teagasc saw fit to maintain it. It gave a commitment the last time that it would increase the level of research being carried out there, and that has improved in recent times. There has been a considerable amount of investment in new farm buildings and office accommodation. Although offices have been upgraded at the Ballinamore site, Teagasc is proposing to sell it while continuing to rent offices in other parts of the county. It is false economics.</P>
      <P>Teagasc receives an income from the tenant at its Manorhamilton office. I believe that the tenant is responsible for maintenance of the office as part of the contract. This means that Teagasc wants to sell an office that it receives for free. Does Teagasc honestly believe that there should be no office between Carrick-on-Shannon and Donegal or Sligo? It is proposed that north Leitrim will be without an office or a permanent advisor, an idea that is totally unacceptable to anybody involved in this sick situation. If we are to encourage people in disadvantaged parts of Ireland to work in the agriculture sector, it is imperative that research is conducted to help them to succeed. Farmers may be disadvantaged as a result of poor soil or a bad climate. Climatic work has been conducted in Ballinamore in recent years. For example, the effects of rain on farming have been studied. Statistics for last year showed that rainfall in the north-west was about 50% above average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am calling on the board of Teagasc to review the situation in County Leitrim. The decision has been taken for short-term gain, as the farm in Ballinamore has been estimated to be worth about &euro;400,000. Such a sum is not significant when one considers that the annual cost of running a research farm is about &euro;200,000. In the context of Teagasc's total annual expenditure, it is a false economy to sell an asset for &euro;400,000. A <Col N="532" /> proper appraisal of Teagasc's proposals, in County Leitrim and elsewhere, would give a different and clearer view of the overall situation. Different proposals would result from such an appraisal. Why does Teagasc maintain large dairy quotas, not to be run as family units or typical farms, but to be run at a scale that will never be the scale of a farmer? Teagasc's dairy research has been concentrated in the best land in the country. It has not considered those who live in less favoured areas and who need research and help.</P>
    <P>The advisory service that will remain in County Leitrim if Teagasc follows through with its proposals will be almost non-existent. There will be a chief executive officer and two permanent advisors. It is wrong that people on contracts will be made redundant. When Teagasc becomes a commercial operation, it should decide whether those employed at present are making a financial contribution to Teagasc's income. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, to tell the board of Teagasc and its director, Mr. Flanagan, to reassess the organisation's plans. The board should outline the reasons, if any, for its proposals in relation to the research farm in Ballinamore and the offices in Manorhamilton. An overview of the service that Teagasc is providing throughout the country would also be welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to rescind the decision taken by Teagasc to close and sell its offices in Ballinamore and Manorhamilton in County Leitrim. Is it Government policy to permit Teagasc to sell off part of its property portfolio to redress the cut of about &euro;13 million in its budget? While we may be told that the decision to sell the offices in Ballinamore and Manorhamilton was taken by Teagasc last week, the decision was taken last November, when the Minister for Finance reduced Teagasc's budget by the amount I have mentioned. The decision to sell or not to sell is a political one that can be made by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I ask the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in the strongest possible terms, to reverse the decision taken by Teagasc to ensure that the organisation will have to go back to the drawing board to start again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offices in Manorhamilton were funded by EU investment just over 21 years ago, so they have not cost Teagasc any money. The organisation is in the happy position of renting a number of offices to Coillte. Although it makes money from Manorhamilton every week, month and year, Teagasc wants to sell the office and to close down the service to the farmers of north Leitrim. Having run down the service it provides, Teagasc wants to make money from a building that cost it nothing and wants to deprive the farmers of County Leitrim, which is heavily dependent on agriculture, of the advice that helps to sustain the maximum number of family farms and to maintain a viable rural economy. This disgraceful situation represents a slap in the face for those who <Col N="533" /> believe that agriculture and rural development have a future in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Equally, the studies that are carried out in the research centre in Ballinamore will play a large part in the future of the agriculture industry in County Leitrim. No other research centre has the same climatic and soil conditions. The research conducted in the centre applies to nine counties, including Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal and Mayo. The closure of the Teagasc facilities in County Leitrim is a further example of the withdrawal by the State of vital services from the north-west. I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to show faith in the farmers of County Leitrim and to bring a stop to Teagasc's plans to destroy the future of agriculture in County Leitrim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to close the purpose-built research and training facility at Ballinamore and the Teagasc office and training centre in Manorhamilton, to decimate Teagasc's advisory service and to sell all property owned by Teagasc in County Leitrim, is ludicrous in the extreme. It is economic madness to close and sell the Teagasc office in Bailieborough, County Cavan, which has five members of staff, is wholly owned by Teagasc and provides an income to Teagasc from part-letting. It is an act of treachery against the interests of the farming community. Teagasc is proposing to retain a skeleton staff in rented accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon and Mohill on the pretext of providing a service in County Leitrim. Teagasc has also proposed the centralisation of its services in County Cavan in Ballyhaise, again in rented offices. Where is the economic sense behind the proposals to close and sell the research station in Ballinamore and the offices in Manorhamilton and Bailieborough? I feel that no economic sense is involved and that the plans represent economic madness.</P>
      <P>My colleagues have referred to the various facilities. I wish to emphasise that the dairy research station in Ballinamore covers the drumlin counties of Cavan and Monaghan. Farmers in these counties, as well as those named by Deputy Harkin, have to contend with heavy and wet drumlin soil. This aspect of the Ballinamore research station is not replicated in any other facility. It is an absolute disgrace that the only research station that is available to help farmers in western and Border counties is being removed. I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, to show an independent appreciation of these facilities and services. I appeal to the Minister, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, to make a positive intervention to save services that are vital to farming communities in areas that are the least supported and worst affected by the ravages that are attacking the farming sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Crawford, Stanton, Coveney, Ellis, Harkin and Ó Caoláin for their contributions to this <Col N="534" /> Adjournment debate. The points that have been made also apply to the counties I represent, Kilkenny and Carlow. While I sympathise with the Deputies and the cases they made, particularly in respect of their constituencies, they will know that I am precluded from dealing with any day-to-day running decisions of the board of Teagasc.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has a very important role to play in supporting the Government's strategy for the development of the agriculture and food industries and provides a range of important services. Therefore, substantial Exchequer resources are provided each year to enable it to provide first-class research, training and advisory services for farmers and the food industry.</P>
      <P>Because of the national importance of agriculture and the food industries and the need for public investment to protect Ireland's status in these areas on the world stage and in competitive international markets, it is necessary to have an organisation like Teagasc which adds value and provides guidance to these sectors. The total funding provided by the Department of Agriculture and Food to Teagasc for non-capital purposes has increased significantly from &euro;81 million in 1999 to &euro;108 million this year. Given the tight budget this year, the allocation was increased from &euro;106 million in 2002 to &euro;108 million. This is an indication of the Government's continuing commitment to supporting Teagasc. By any standards, this is substantial funding. In addition, for the first time since Teagasc was established we have been able to provide very substantial additional funding to it for capital development purposes.</P>
      <P>From 2000 to 2003 my Department has allocated a cumulative total of almost &euro;35 million to enable Teagasc implement major capital development programmes at the training colleges and research centres. The resulting upgrading of the training facilities, in conjunction with the recent mainstreaming of agricultural education and the national accreditation of all Teagasc training programmes, has arrested the downward trend in enrolments and augurs well for the future. Similarly, the capital expenditure undertaken in research has greatly assisted Teagasc's efforts to develop world-class research centres and to strengthen its research capabilities generally. Despite a change in the client base of Teagasc and a decline in the numbers relying on farming for their main income, its number of professional advisory staff has been maintained and reorganised to deliver the most effective services for its clients in the changed socio-economic environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is entirely a matter for Teagasc and its board to prioritise its activities in the delivery of agricultural research, training and advisory services and to allocate its resources in accordance with these priorities. I do not propose to comment on individual decisions that Teagasc may have taken or proposes to take on the arrangements for the delivery of its services at particular locations <Col N="535" /> around the country. I understand only too well the local concerns that may arise. However, that is entirely a matter within the remit of the Teagasc authority and is not one in which the Minister has a function.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Teagasc has recently decided to concentrate the delivery of its services in fewer centres. However, the Teagasc authority has also stressed that, when these decisions are implemented, it will still have a network of over 70 advisory and training centres nationwide as well as nine major research centres and 11 colleges. Therefore, the ability of Teagasc to provide its range of services will not be diminished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Teagasc has a complement of almost 1,500 permanent staff, comprising advisers, teachers and research scientists with appropriate supporting services. These are complemented by about 250 contract staff, as well as teaching staff in the private agricultural and horticultural colleges. With proper resourcing and the adoption of modern technology and methodolog<Col N="536" /> ies for information transfer, Teagasc is confident that priority research, advisory and training services for the agriculture and food industry will be secured.</P>
      <P>Given the capital investment undertaken in recent years and the ongoing support of my Department, Teagasc is in good shape and now well positioned for the years ahead to provide the innovation and technology transfer necessary for the sustainable development of agriculture, the food industry and rural communities through its integrated research, advisory and education and training programmes. Therefore, there is strong evidence of full Government commitment to Teagasc.</P>
      <P>In recent years, consistent and growing financial support has been provided to enable the organisation to provide a range of services on a countrywide basis and to provide the standard and range of supports which the agri-food sector requires. I have taken note of the issue raised by the Deputies, which applies as much to me as to them, and I will convey to the Minister the points they have made so forcefully.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 March 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 246 and 247 together.</P>
      <P>So-called joyriding is a complex problem which, while requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, can only be tackled to lasting effect through a multi-faceted and multi-agency response involving both the community and relevant statutory bodies. Speaking primarily from a criminal justice perspective, a number of proven strategies are already in place to tackle the worst manifestations of the problem.</P>
      <P>First, targeted policing operations have been instituted by local Garda management in areas that have been identified as potential hotspots of joyriding. In particular, specialist Garda patrols and vehicles are concentrated in these hotspots, and they are often assisted by the Garda air support unit when required.</P>
      <P>Second, members of the Garda Síochána regularly liaise with community groups in areas particularly prone to bouts of joyriding. Preventative projects are in operation in many of these areas to deal with those responsible, including both a network of 64 Garda youth diversion projects and a number of probation and welfare service projects, most notably the auto-crime diversion project in Cork City.</P>
      <P>Third, the Garda Síochána and local authorities work together in relation to estate management and reducing the opportunities for joyriding. For example, physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps are used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fourth, the Garda Síochána impounds vehicles without tax and insurance and removes them to <Col N="538" /> car compounds. In the Dublin metropolitan region, there is a dedicated car compound located at the Talbot complex in Santry. Car compounds are also being provided at all newly built divisional-district Garda headquarters, wherever the site allows.</P>
    <P>Fifth, in relation to so-called &ldquo;company cars&rdquo;, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has been actively engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland and other concerned parties with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative to implement the main provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, or ELVs. A particular objective of the directive is to ensure that all ELVs are collected, dismantled and recovered by the industry in an environmentally sound manner at no cost to the final holder. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is preparing appropriate legislative proposals which will be brought to Government shortly to support implementation of the detailed ELV recovery scheme consistent with the requirements of the directive.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2002 are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner. The statistics requested on the number of deaths arising from joyriding in the past five years could not be compiled in the time available. I will, however, communicate with the Deputy directly in due course.</P>

      <P>It is essential that the victims of crime are, at the very least, made aware at the earliest possible time of the assistance that is available to them, particularly that provided by the Victim Support organisation. Of course, I share the Deputy's concern about the fall off in referrals of victims to Victim Support, as does the Victim Support organisation and indeed the Garda Commissioner as the Garda Síochána is the main source of referrals to the organisation. A number of factors have been cited in the reduction in referrals, including confidentiality issues arising from the provisions of the Data Protection Act 2000.</P>
      <P>In June 2002 my Department, jointly with Victim Support, commissioned a consultancy research study of the Victim Support organisation, the result of which was submitted to me recently. The particular difficulty for that organisation caused by the marked decline in the numbers of victims being referred was one of the issues highlighted by the study. It recommends that a strategy be developed jointly between Victim Support and the Garda Síochána aimed at securing a significant increase in referrals of victims by the Garda Síochána to Victim Support.</P>
      <P>I am happy to accept this recommendation and, indeed, I have already had discussions with Victim Support with a view to putting in place all the necessary monitoring arrangements at an early date. I am delighted to note that a partnership agreement between Victim Support and the Garda Síochána has been put in place recently to achieve that specific aim. The strategy will be monitored by the two bodies and my Department on a tripartite basis as the study recommends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of 4,861 referrals for 2002 quoted by the Deputy is in fact the full total of referrals to the Victim Support organisation, not referrals from the Garda. It is made up of 2,850, 59%, from the Garda, 1,331 self referrals, and 680 referrals from other agencies. The figure of 7,714 for 1999 comprises 6,170 referrals from the Garda, 80%, <Col N="540" /> with the remaining 1,544 coming from self referrals and other agencies.</P>
    <P>The research study sets out a blueprint for the future development of the Victim Support organisation to be implemented by Victim Support, with the support of my Department. Other key recommendations in this blueprint include: the agreement of a formal memorandum of understanding between Victim Support, my Department and the Garda Síochána in relation to victim services; a high-level monitoring committee to be put in place representing my Department, Garda management and Victim Support to oversee the referrals process; implementation of staffing and structural changes within Victim Support; and carrying out of detailed statistical research on victims' needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 242 to 245 inclusive, 248, 250 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>A broad range of strong legislation is available to the Garda Síochana to enable serious and organised crime to be confronted effectively. Our criminal legislative framework reflects international developments to respond to the growth of organised crime and specific measures enacted to meet our particular domestic situation. Factors which prompted action at both levels were the scale of profits available from drugs trafficking in particular, the organised nature of the illicit trade and the investment of the proceeds of serious crime in legitimate assets.</P>
      <P>In the area of financial investigation the measures directed at the offence of money laundering, and the related compliance obligations including the mandatory reporting of suspicious financial transactions, have been significant. A major feature has been the fact that, since the beginning, the offence of money laundering extended to the proceeds of both drugs trafficking and other criminal activity. This enabled our legislation to anticipate changes in the concept of money laundering as the nature of the offence developed. It is the view of the Garda authorities that the primary source of laundered money in this jurisdiction is drugs trafficking.</P>
      <P>The escalating activities of organised criminals prompted the Government in 1996 to supplement the measures already taken. A legislative package, also aimed at the proceeds of crime, was enacted which established the Criminal Assets Bureau and which gave the bureau the legal framework to identify and to deny criminals the proceeds of serious crime. Criminal assets targeted by the bureau include established high cash businesses, real property, vehicle and investment products. The bureau is also mandated to fully apply the revenue Acts to profits derived from criminal activity. Revenue actions have proven to be particularly effective in the bureau's execution of its statutory functions.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that organised crime in Ireland is not controlled by any one major group. Small groups tend to come together at different times to involve themselves in a particular crime and then disband. A number of these criminal groups resort to feuding from time to time related to their criminal activities. Other feuds may involve families and extended families.</P>
      <P>At a national operational level, the Garda Síochána combat organised crime, including drugs trafficking, in a number of ways. In addition to identifying and seizing the proceeds of crime, the Garda national support services deal with the major crime and enforcement areas. While the investigation of crime rests with local Garda officers, the national support services provide assistance to serious crime investigations through a range of dedicated expertise and skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" />These are provided in particular by the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit and, of course, the Criminal Assets Bureau. The specialised units liaise with regional, divisional and district officers to co-ordinate investigations into serious and organised crime, including drugs trafficking. Liaison takes place with the Customs and Naval Services to address international drugs trafficking in particular.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives to enhance international co-operation have also been taken. Garda liaison officers have been assigned to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and France, and to the international police support agencies, Interpol and Europol. Bilateral agreements continue to be developed with other jurisdictions to increase international co-operation in tackling serious crime and related matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 166 and 171 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current strength of the force stands at approximately 11,800. As I informed this House in an answer to a question from Deputy Costello on 6 February, the Cabinet has authorised me to make the greatest possible use of the existing capacity of the Garda training college at Templemore during the next two years, to bring the strength of the force to 12,200, its current authorised maximum strength. While it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond that point for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, the number will represent an all-time record level of strength. On 17 February 2003, 165 trainees were admitted to the Garda college. I have authorised the Garda Commissioner to make appropriate arrangements with the Local Appointments Commission to conduct another recruitment campaign, to be advertised in the coming months. It is anticipated that 642 trainees will be taken into the Garda college in 2003. The <Col N="543" /> commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that this level of recruitment will result in the maximum authorised strength of 12,200 being achieved during 2004.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am committed to supporting the Garda Síochána in every way. This will be achieved not only by increasing Garda numbers, but by facilitating and promoting change and reform, both in the force and in the criminal justice system, aimed at meeting the challenges of modern crime. I am finalising proposals for legislative change to significantly improve Garda powers of criminal investigation and I have already introduced a Bill to improve public order law. The increased use of technology can free up resources and enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The PULSE system has made a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the Garda, but I believe that there is considerable potential for greater use of technology across the range of criminal justice agencies.</P>
    <P>Many factors determine the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. I will not be content to raise the strength of the Garda to an historic high of 12,200 and higher when budgetary circumstances permit. The Government intends to make progress towards the target of 14,000 provided in An Agreed Programme for Government by 2007. I want the resources of the entire criminal justice system to be used effectively to combat crime and I hope I will have the support of the House for the measures I will bring forward to achieve that objective. I also intend to increase, as soon as circumstances permit, the number of Garda members available for front-line policing through a process of civilianisation. A study for further civilianisation in the Garda was completed as part of the bottom-up review of the organisation as recommended in the Garda steering group report of 1997. The study recommended a programme of civilianisation of 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by Gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing. It is envisaged that the posts will be civilianised on a phased basis over a number of years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 232 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my comprehensive replies to Question No. 290 of 5 March and Questions Nos. 135 to 139, inclusive, of 6 March. Access to retained data for the purpose of the investigation of serious crime and in the interest of the security of the State is already allowed in law. Section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, as amended by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, allows for the disclosure of information concerning the use made of telecommunications services in a number of circumstances on a request from a member of the Garda, not below the rank of chief superintendent, and a member of the Defence Forces, not below the rank of colonel.</P>
      <P>Following on from EU directives concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, it is proposed that a time limit be set on the period for which certain data on telecommunications usage must be retained for possible access, under specific circumstances and subject to specific safeguards, by the Garda Síochána for the investigation of serious crime and by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in the interest of the security of the State. The time limit being considered is three years, which is shorter than the period which licensed operators historically retained such information for billing purposes. On 24 February 2003, I hosted an information forum attended by a wide range of interested parties, including industry representatives, civil rights groups and members of the legal profession. At that forum, I stated that I have an open mind in relation to all aspects of the proposed legislation. I intend to have the proceedings of the recent information forum in relation to this matter made available on my Department's website, www.justice.ie, very shortly. The website will also have a facility for interested parties to post submissions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 162 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has a key role in the development of disability equality policy and legislation. As part of that remit, my Department collects data in relation to the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service, excluding Civil Service data which is collected by the Department of Finance's equality unit. Although the target has yet to be achieved, there has been a degree of progress in recent years. The <Col N="546" /> overall statistics for the public service, other than the Civil Service, at 1 January each year are as follows: 1998, 1.52%; 1999, 1.72%; 2000, 1.89%; 2001, 2.12%; and 2002, 2.21%. The figures given for 2000, 2001 and 2002 are provisional, as returns are outstanding from a number of individual public service bodies. These figures supersede previously publicised information due to updated data which has been received and processed in my Department.</P>
    <P>A Government commitment in the PPF requires that &ldquo;every Department will take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service at an early date&rdquo;. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of each Department to take the action necessary to ensure compliance by the public service bodies under their aegis. A monitoring committee, established and chaired by my Department, helps to monitor and guide progress in relation to the target. It has supported a number of initiatives in recent years including a draft code of practice for use in the public service, exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities, raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to, chief executive officers, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, publication of an information brochure, publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this option at the public sector careers expo in April 2001.</P>
    <P>Research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations has been commissioned. The report, Research Project on the Effective Recruitment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service, which was published in November 2001, provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress. It also includes recommendations to assist future progress. My Department, in partnership with the Equality Authority, launched an employer resource pack on 3 December 2002 to assist public service employers in the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is responsible for the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service. The 3% target is based on the definition of disability set out in the Civil Service code of practice on the employment of people with disabilities. This definition includes people with physical, sensory or psychological impairments. The statistical returns of Departments and offices do not specify the nature of the disability in order to maintain confidentiality. The table that follows this reply shows the percentage of employees with disabilities in each Department. The PPF included a commitment to review the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service to ascertain ongoing adherence to the 3% employment target. <Col N="547" /> While Departments met the target in the mid-1990s, the percentage has dropped below 3% since then. The percentage of people with a disability in the Civil Service at December 2001 was 2.78%. The Department of Finance has written to the heads of all Departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their legal obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target.</P>
    <P>In light of the commitment in the PPF and in the interests of improving adherence to the target, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with disabilities in the Civil Service. The research, which was conducted by a team led by Goodbody economic consultants, will be published shortly. The research examines career progression for people with disabilities, highlights the challenges they face in pursuing their careers and makes recommendations for improvements. The Department of Finance is considering the recommendations and will draw up proposals shortly. Officials from the Department of Finance are meeting with the Civil Service staff unions to consider the recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed under Sustaining Progress &ndash; Social Partnership Agreement 2003-05 to strengthening the parental leave scheme in line with the agreed recommendations of the social partners arising from the working group on parental leave.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 28 of the Parental Leave Act 1998 and a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the working group carried out a review of that Act in 2001. The working group comprised the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority and the report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 was published on 29 April 2002.</P>
      <P>The working group made 16 recommendations, ten of which were agreed and six by majority. Among the six majority recommendations, it was recommended that parental leave should attract payment and that employees should have a statutory entitlement to three days paid paternity leave per child, payable by employers. The Equality Authority supported both majority recommendations. The working group's recommendations are currently being examined in detail by my Department with a view to bringing concrete proposals to Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 147 and 152 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" />Racially motivated incidents are recorded by two bodies. The first is the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, NCCRI, which was established with funding from my Department. Its objective is to develop an integrated approach against racism and promote a more participative and intercultural society. The NCCRI, in partnership with a range of NGOs, has organised a system of reporting racist incidents. The system aims to profile the number, type and location of incidents and to identify emerging trends. These incidents are compiled into six-monthly reports. The first report was published in October 2001 and the second in April 2002. The third report, which covers the period from May to October 2002, has just been published.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities, conscious of the importance of the recording and monitoring of racist incidents, have, since October 2002, also put in place a mechanism to record and gather information on racist incidents and offenders nation-wide by means of the PULSE computer system. The definition of a racially motivated crime has been agreed and circulated throughout the Garda Síochána. It defines a racially motivated crime as any incident perceived to be racially motivated by the victim, a member of the Garda Síochána, a person who was present and who witnessed the incident or a person acting on behalf of the victim.</P>
    <P>In order to increase awareness of racism and racial discrimination, a national anti-racism awareness programme called Know Racism was launched in October 2001. The aim of the programme is to stimulate awareness of racism and a respect for cultural diversity. It does so by means of advertising, publicity events, funding for local anti-racism awareness initiatives, partnership ventures and other activities.</P>
    <P>Legislative measures have also been taken by the Government to combat racism and discrimination, such as the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000. The Government has established national bodies to monitor multi-ethnic issues, such as the Equality Authority, the Director of Equality Investigations, the NCCRI and the Human Rights Commission.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have established the Garda Racial and Intercultural Office, with responsibility for co-ordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of ethnic and cultural diversity. Details of a proposed national action plan against racism are expected to be published before the end of this year. It is an offence under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 to incite hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origin, membership of the Traveller community or sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>It is also an offence under the Act to publish or distribute material or use words or behaviour, etc., that are threatening, abusive or insulting and <Col N="550" /> are intended or are likely to stir up hatred against the specified protected groups.</P>
    <P>To prepare or possess material or recordings of a racist or such like offensive nature to be distributed or broadcast in the State or elsewhere is also an offence under the Act. It is open to any person to bring an alleged breach of the provisions of the Act to the notice of the Garda Síochána or the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>According to the annual report of the Garda Síochána for 2001, the number of headline offences reported or known to the Garda during that year under section 2 of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 was eight. Five of these cases were detected, proceedings commenced in two cases, and one case resulted in a conviction. During the same period, proceedings were taken in 12 non-headline offences under section 2 of the 1989 Act, resulting in a further three convictions.</P>
    <P>A review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 is ongoing in my Department and is being carried out in co-operation with the NCCRI.</P>
    <P>In 2001, the Council of Europe established a committee on criminalising acts of a racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks. Ireland participated in this committee, which drew up a draft protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime on this issue. This protocol was adopted by the Committee of Ministers in November 2002.</P>
    <P>In November 2001, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. Negotiations on the framework decision are ongoing. The review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 is a comprehensive one, and I consider it appropriate to await the outcome of the aforementioned framework negotiations before it can be finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to previous questions concerning my proposals to reduce the very high level of overtime in the Prison Service, which I answered on 27 November 2002 and 6 February 2003, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November, I outlined the background to the present overtime situation. I indicated that the Prison Service had drawn together a new framework to tackle the service's dependency on overtime working and that outline costings on a package of proposals for change, on which to consult the staff side, had been submitted to the Depart<Col N="551" /> ment of Finance for consideration. In February, I indicated that it had not been possible to finalise the requisite consultations with the Department of Finance prior to engaging in discussions with the Prison Officers' Association on an appropriate change agenda due to the ongoing deliberations on national pay issues, including benchmarking.</P>
    <P>The current position is that consultations between my officials and officials of the Department of Finance in relation to detailed aspects of the package of proposals for change are now concluding. The Prison Service management will very shortly be in a position to enter into negotiations with staff representatives on an agenda for change that will address the overtime issue comprehensively.</P>

      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General into Garda interview recording systems was presented to this House on 18 February last. The findings of the report, and in particular the need to address shortcomings identified in it, are being discussed with the Garda authorities in the wider context of proposed enhancements to the procurement process.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting, however, that although the report pointed up certain breaches of public procurement processes, the Comptroller and Auditor General concluded that these breaches did not materially affect the contract award decision.</P>

      <P>In May 2001 the Government approved the provision of one year's assistance of £162,000, about &euro;206,000, to the Justice for the Forgotten group, which runs a family service support centre, and further assistance for the operation of the centre during the remainder of 2002 of a level to be determined with the agreement of the Minister for Finance. Following a submission from the group to my Department, the level of <Col N="552" /> quarterly funding was increased in August 2002 from &euro;51,500 to &euro;64,000. Funding has been maintained at this level since that time.</P>
      <P>The remit of the family service support centre is to provide counselling and general support for persons bereaved and injured in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and other atrocities. The Deputy will be aware that &euro;3 million has been provided in the Revised Estimates for 2003 towards the establishment and operation of a remembrance fund to address the needs of the victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland and their families in this jurisdiction. Funding for Justice for the Forgotten, including its family service support centre, will be brought within the ambit of this fund on its establishment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda juvenile diversion programme is administered from the national juvenile office, Garda community relations section, under the supervision of a Garda superintendent who directs the office. The office has a complement of one inspector, two sergeants and four civilian staff. I am further informed that the juvenile diversion programme is delivered by 86 specially selected and trained gardaí who work from various Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme provides that in certain circumstances a juvenile under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The Children Act 2001 placed this programme on a statutory footing and the relevant sections in Part 4 of the Act were commenced in May 2002. Before this, the programme operated on the principle of Garda discretion on whether or not to prosecute. Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the juvenile diversion programme. A review is currently taking place within the Garda of the human resource and equipment implications of the introduction of the Children Act. I understand that this review, which is near completion, will address the issue of appointing extra Garda juvenile liaison officers.</P>

      <P>Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 requires the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider 11 factors when determining whether a deportation order should be made in respect of persons who have been notified under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Act that the Minister proposes to make a deportation order in respect of them. The granting of leave to remain applies only in cases where the making of a deportation order is contemplated. The obligations imposed on the Minister under section 3(6) arise whether or not the person in question is a failed asylum seeker and whether or not he or she has made representations of any sort. The vast majority of cases referred for consideration under section 3(6) of the 1999 Act refer to persons who have failed in their asylum applications following detailed consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, where applicable, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Both bodies are independent statutory establishments. A small number of cases relate to persons who are illegally in the State or who have overstayed their visa.</P>
      <P>It must be emphasised that prior to the making of a deportation order, all such persons have the option of voluntarily returning to their country of origin which would allow them to apply to enter the State legally at a future date on a visa basis. Each case is considered on its own merits and section 3(6) of the 1999 Act does not specify those factors which are likely to influence the granting or refusal of applications for humanitarian leave to remain.</P>

      <P>The Equality Authority was established on a designate basis on 8 March 1999 and on a statutory basis on 18 October 1999 with the coming into force of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The mandate of the Equality Authority is to work towards the elimination of discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity. Under section 54 of the 1998 Act, the Equality Authority is required to make an annual report to me within six months of the commencement of every calendar year. This report outlines its activities in the previous calendar year. There is also a statutory requirement to have copies of the report laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The annual report of the Equality Authority for 2002 was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 5 March 2003. I officially launched the report on behalf of the Equality Authority on 6 March 2003 and I welcome its publication. It outlines developments and initiatives undertaken by the authority in 2002 and details the number of queries for information on equality and related legislation in 2002. Almost half of these queries related to parental, maternity and adoptive leave entitlements. Case files on all nine grounds covered by the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 were dealt with in 2002.</P>
      <P>Among the initiatives undertaken by the Equality Authority in 2002 were the publication of two reports, entitled Implementing Equality for Older People and Implementing Equality for Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals, respectively. The first code of practice under the Employment Equality Act 1998 &ndash; the code of practice on sexual harassment and harassment in the workplace, was published in March 2002. The authority worked with the public sector to develop practical supports for the emergence of equality and diversity as key elements in the public sector commitment to quality customer service. Important initiatives were also developed by the authority in partnership with IBEC and ICTU, including the anti-racist workplace week in November 2002 and the second national family friendly workplace day in March 2002.</P>

      <P>While my Department has a key role in the development of disability equality policy and legislation it is not directly involved in the provision of services for people with disabilities or with labour market policy generally. In June 2000, my Department oversaw the introduction of the policy of mainstreaming in the delivery of services for people with disabilities. This placed responsibility for the provision of services to people with disabilities within the remit of the same bodies that provide the services generally. The Deputy will be aware that the responsibility for promoting enterprise and employment development lies with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In addition the Department of Social and Family Affairs also facilitates access to available training, education and employment for people with disabilities. Prior to the mainstreaming of services the National Rehabilitation Board provided a range of services for people with disabilities and on its dissolution, FÁS and Comhairle received additional resources in terms of both staff and premises to facilitate their work in this regard.</P>
      <P>The introduction of mainstreaming has resulted in the establishment of an integrated approach across all Departments and State agencies to policy development and service provision for people with disabilities. At the same time, my Department has established the National Disability Authority, NDA, as an agency which includes in its functions the support and monitoring of the implementation of standards in services for people with disabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the recent report of the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. There is an obligation on the State, as there is on all states, to effectively regulate the arrangements which apply to non-nationals seeking to enter or to remain on our territory. This is central to achieving the correct balance in ensuring, on the one hand, that the integrity, security and authority of the State and its economic and social fabric are protected and, on the other, that the rights and interests of immigrants are upheld. The migration of increasingly large numbers of persons from widely diver<Col N="556" /> gent social and economic backgrounds must be managed in a structured, transparent and legally sound manner to enable the State to derive maximum benefit from global migratory trends and to ensure fair treatment of the persons concerned. The arrangements that are in place to service the needs of our immigrant community must facilitate their integration in a way which acknowledges mutual obligations for both new immigrants and Irish society.</P>
      <P>In addition of course, Ireland must, as a fundamental expression of its humanitarian ideals, afford protection to refugees and fair consideration, accommodation and sustenance to those claiming persecution until those claims have been determined. The Government's policy regarding asylum and immigration matters is that it is committed to providing protection to refugees and the application of fair procedures in accordance with law to all immigrants both legal and illegal.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are charged with the enforcement of immigration law in this jurisdiction. While enforcement is not the only feature of policy in relation to immigration it is nonetheless an important element. I think it is fair to say that no system can operate on a basis of non enforcement of its core principles. Accordingly, it is a matter for the Garda authorities to determine the initiatives necessary to ensure compliance with immigration law.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they consider that Operation Hyphen was a success in that a number of people wanted for deportation were apprehended, a number were charged with offences before the District Court and a number who were here illegally are believed to have left the State voluntarily. As a result of the operation there has been a dramatic increase in the number of non-EEA nationals registering at the Garda National Immigration Bureau and at local Garda registration offices as they are required to do under the provisions of the Aliens Order 1946, as amended.</P>

      <P>The Irish Prison Service placed public advertisements in October 2001 seeking suitable sites for the location of a juvenile detention facility for young offenders aged 16 to 17 years, as part of the process of implementing the Children Act 2001. On foot of these advertise<Col N="557" /> ments, submissions were received by the Prison Service. In addition, other sites in state ownership, including all existing prison properties, were assessed with detailed feasibility studies completed by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works recommended that the site referred to by the Deputy was the most suitable location of those examined and, on that basis, a planning notice under Part 9 of the Local Government Planning and Development Act 2000 was served in December 2002. This involved placing public advertisements in newspapers as well as displaying notices on the actual site regarding the proposed development.</P>
      <P>I will shortly make a conclusive decision on the location of the proposed development. I have asked the Prison Service and the Office of Public Works to review possible alternatives in the light of the opposition of the local authority, local residents group and public representatives to this project in Clondalkin. The Office of Public Works is now preparing a report for my consideration on this matter which I expect to have within the next three weeks. That report will take on board all comments and observations received in connection with this project. I will announce the outcome of this process shortly.</P>

The number of stations and rooms fitted out with systems within these stations is such as to provide broad nationwide coverage. To date, approximately 225 interview rooms in 128 stations have been fitted out, and of these 222 are in use. A small number of stations remain to be fitted out and these will be completed as soon as practicable. It was never the intention, nor is it considered necessary that all 703 Garda stations be fitted out with the system.</P>

      <P>I am, of course, concerned that all members of society are well served by the jus<Col N="558" /> tice system and I am satisfied that this is the case. The Deputy may be assured, however, that where shortcomings are identified, I will take steps to rectify them as far and as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to the issue of addressing victims' needs &ndash; the rights of victims and services for victims. The model of victim rights in Ireland is a hybrid one covering both statute and administrative based provisions. This has evolved through the implementation of a number of significant victim related provisions contained in several Acts which reflected a growing concern to take account of the position of victims.</P>
      <P>The victims' charter introduced in 1998 attempted to bring together existing practice in the area of victim care. This was followed in 1999 by the publication of a more comprehensive victims' charter involving detailed commitments from all the relevant criminal justice agencies, including the Courts Service, the Prison Service, the Garda, Coroners Service etc., which sets out the rights and entitlements to services and the levels and standards of treatment which victims of crime can reasonably expect. It is proposed to proceed with a review of the effectiveness of the charter in 2003 to ensure that it is delivering on its provisions and to identify any further areas for improving the care of crime victims.</P>
      <P>Victims' services are in the main provided by the Victim Support organisation. This is a community based organisation dedicated to providing emotional and practical support to victims of crime. It also provides information about victims' rights, represents victims' interests in the formation of social and criminal policy and raises public awareness about victim issues. My Department provides the bulk of Victim Support's funding &ndash;&euro;1,077,000 in 2003.</P>
      <P>In June 2002, a major study of the Victim Support organisation was commissioned jointly between my Department and Victim Support. Its remit was to examine the structure and workings of the organisation and provide recommendations on its future direction. The study was received in my Department in January 2003 and work is progressing on the implementation of these recommendations.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the Garda authorities are fully aware of the need for sensitivity in any public comments made by members of the service and that their primary concern is to ensure that victims report the crimes in question to the Garda Síochána. Rape and sexual assault are serious offences which can have a traumatic effect on the victim. It is critically important that victims of such crimes continue to be encouraged to come forward and report these crimes to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána and, in particular, its domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit encourage, in liaison with the rape crisis centres, early reporting by victims.</P>

      <P>The position is that discussions took place last month between the European Commission and the US Administration with a view to finding a solution to the problems arising for airlines operating flights to and from the US as a result of the passenger name record, <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, requirements set out in the US Aviation and Transportation Security Act 2001. The main objective was to reconcile the US requirements with the requirements of EU data protection law.</P>
      <P>During these discussions, the US side provided information about safeguards to ensure appropriate processing of the personal data concerned. These safeguards will facilitate airline compliance with US law while at the same time providing adequate protection for the personal data of passengers. The European Commission consulted with the data protection experts of member states and received broad support for its negotiating position. The meeting in question was attended by a member of staff of my Department.</P>
      <P>The interim agreement reached between the European Commission and the US Administration enabled US Customs to have access to <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> data held by airlines in their computerised reservations systems for passengers travelling to, from or through the US with effect from 5 March.</P>
      <P>While the current agreement is of an interim nature, the European Commission intends that a formal decision recognising the adequacy of the US safeguards will be adopted as soon as practicable, under Article 25.6 of Directive 95/46 of the European Parliament and the Council on the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. This will require consultation with the European Parliament as well as the agreement of member states.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that under section 5(1) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, the principal function of the Legal Aid Board is to provide, from within the board's resources and subject to the other provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of the Act and the regulations made thereunder. In addition, under section 30 of the Act, responsibility for determining how legal services should be provided, including the location of law centres, the staffing required by these centres, and the use of private practitioners is a matter for the board. In this regard the function of the board includes identifying both the level of demand for its services and the most suitable way in which to meet the demand for services.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that that the private practitioners scheme will continue to operate. In reviewing the use of the scheme, the board has decided that priority should be given to cases involving domestic violence and that other cases, where domestic violence is not an issue, will be referred to the board's law centres. Where a domestic violence case which has been referred to a private practitioner includes matters concerning child access, custody and maintenance, these matters will also be dealt with by the private practitioner. I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that, in recent years, approximately 65% of the legal aid certificates issued included a domestic violence matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" />I can also inform the Deputy that a sum of &euro;17.075 million has been allocated to the Legal Aid Board this year. While this figure represents a slight decrease of just over 3% on the allocation last year, it still represents a significant increase in the funding for the board in recent years, up from &euro;10,563 million in 1997 to &euro;17.075 million this year. This represents an increase of almost 62% over the period in question. Sanction for the board to employ additional solicitors was also received during this period and that these additional resources, funding and staff, contributed to a significant reduction in waiting times at law centres during this period.</P>

      <P>One of my priorities as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to ensure that adequate and suitable accommodation is available for members of the Garda Síochána so that they can conduct their business effectively and efficiently. While this is a difficult task, in view of the large number of stations and properties involved, some of which predate the foundation of the State, I am satisfied that every effort is being made, through the ongoing co-operation of my Department, the Office of Public Works and the main Garda representative associations, to address the matter of Garda accommodation in a coherent, and structured, fashion. It is a matter for the Office of Public Works to ensure that the requirements of health and safety legislation are satisfied.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my comprehensive reply to a similar question, No. 26 of 6 February 2003. The budgetary allocation for the commission for 2003 is &euro;1.28 million. The staff employed by the commission at present includes a chief executive and one temporary clerical assistant. The commission is in the final stages of appointing its permanent staff and, while it continues its work in the areas indicated by me in my answer of 6 February, understandably its ability to service the public is limited until such time as its permanent staffing structure is in place.</P>

      <P>The relevant section of the Good Friday Agreement reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The Irish Government will also take steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction. The Government will, taking account of the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and the Report of the Constitution Review Group, bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights and the question of the incorporation of the ECHR will be further examined in this context. The measures brought forward would ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Irish Government will: establish a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within Northern Ireland; proceed with arrangements as quickly as possible to ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities (already ratified by the UK); implement enhanced employment equality legislation; introduce equal status legislation; and continue to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government, by establishing the Human Rights Commission, ratifying the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities, implementing the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 and by introducing the European Convention on Human Rights Bill has been meeting its obligations under this section of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A working group on equality proofing was established under the Programme for Prosperity <Col N="565" /> and Fairness. It represents an ongoing commitment to equality proofing issues. The working group is chaired by my Department and is drawn from relevant Government Departments, the Equality Authority and the four pillars of social partnership. The mandate of the working group is, <i>inter alia,</i> to monitor progress made in implementing equality proofing initiatives, including pilot projects.</P>
    <P>An interim report on equality proofing was produced by the working group in 2002. As part of its work the working group is monitoring research on statute-based proofing systems. In this connection, at the end of February the Equality Authority hosted an international conference on mainstreaming equality &ndash; towards a statutory duty. The purpose of the conference was to assist learning in relation to the rationale and purpose for a statutory duty and to examine a range of models with a view to defining an effective approach. Speakers participated from Ireland, Northern Ireland, Britain, Wales and Norway. The papers from this conference will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>The new social partnership agreement Sustaining Progress provides for the development of mechanisms for proofing of policies and services in the public sector for impact on any of the groups protected by equality legislation. However, it does not commit the Government to introduce equality proofing on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Gender Equal Treatment Directive, 2002/73/EC, which was adopted during 2002, requires member states to take into account the objectives of equality between men and women when formulating and implementing laws, regulations, administrative provisions, policies and activities in relation to access to employment, including promotion, and to vocational training and as regards working conditions. This provision has direct effect on member states. The directive must be implemented by 5 October 2005.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000 strictly govern the holding of a firearm, and the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 contains a number of controls regarding the availability and possession of knives and other offensive weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 of the 1990 Act provides that it is an offence to have any knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed in any public place without such good reason or <Col N="566" /> lawful authority. The penalty on summary conviction for this offence is a fine up to &euro;1,270 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the 1990 Act makes it an offence to trespass with a knife or any article made for causing injury to or incapacitating a person intended for such use. Section 11 makes it an offence to produce any article capable of inflicting serious injury in a manner likely to intimidate another person, in the commission of an offence or in the course of a dispute or fight.</P>
    <P>The penalty on conviction on indictment for the above offences is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both. My Department, in consultation with the Garda authorities, has considered all aspects of this issue and it would appear that the matter would best be addressed by the strict enforcement of the existing legislation and the exercise of a responsible approach by the vendors of these objects. Although I have no plans to amend existing legislation in this area, I would, of course, be prepared to consider any submissions which might be made to me in this regard.</P>

Particular attention is paid to nightclubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there is potential for disorder.</P>
      <P>Additional Garda resources have been made available, and plans have been drawn up by each of the Garda regional commanders to prioritise the deployment of those resources. Deployments vary from place to place and from time to time.</P>
      <P>The target hours of the operation are determined locally, based on the specific circumstances prevailing at each location. The Garda pay particular attention to ensuring that the owners and managers of premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that since the introduction of the operation and up to 2 March 2003, preliminary figures indicate that the following crimes have been detected: 9,269 assaults, including 3,056 assaults causing harm or serious harm; 22,404 incidents of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour; 33,792 incidents of public drunkenness; 10,027 cases of failing to comply with Garda directions; 4,993 cases of disorderly conduct; and 521 cases of sale or supply of alcohol to minors.</P>

      <P>I obtained Government approval on 18 February for the drafting of the legislation to provide for a new statutory mechanism for investigations, to be known as commissions of investigations. I hope to have the legislation published as a matter of priority with a view to its enactment in the next session.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation will be of general application but is informed, in the first instance, by the public concern over the handling by the Dublin Catholic archdiocese of allegations of clerical sexual abuse and by the meetings and useful discussions which I have had with victims' organisations, representatives of the Catholic hierarchy, the Conference of Religious in Ireland and other affected parties. While I believe that the new procedure could provide a means of examining, for example, the systems in place within the Catholic church for the handling of allegations and complaints, I think it would be premature to make a decision on the establishment of any commission of investigation prior to the enactment of the proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>I would, nevertheless, like to make clear that a commission of investigation, should one be established, will not replace or interfere with the processes of the criminal law for the investigation and prosecution of offences.</P>

I hope to have the legislation published as a matter of priority with a view to its enactment in the next session.</P>
      <P>The legislation will provide a general statutory framework for the operation of commissions of investigation. The legislation, which will be of general application, will aim, <i>inter alia,</i> to provide a more cost effective and timely means of investigation into matters of significant public concern. It is envisaged that commissions will be established as required and that several commissions could be in operation at the same time, investigating a variety of matters. In other words, there will not be a single or permanent investigations body.</P>
      <P>Commissions will be concerned with the taking and collection of evidence with a view to establishing the factual position in relation to the matter being investigated. The legislation will provide that, in so far as possible, commissions of investigation will encourage and facilitate the voluntary co-operation of witnesses and other parties. It is proposed that much of the evidence will be taken in private in a non-adversarial environment. Provision will be included for the publication of reports and, where appropriate, for interim reports. Despite the emphasis on voluntary co-operation, it will be proposed that commissions of investigation should be given a wide range of powers to compel attendance, to enter and search premises, to seize documents, to order the handing over of documents and to adjudicate on issues relating to confidentiality and privilege of documents. There will be provisions on perjury and obstruction. I expect that these operating methods and other provisions that will be included in the legislation will have a significant impact in reducing costs and will ensure commissions will be able to complete their work in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>The legislation will provide that, where appropriate, a commission of investigation may be followed by a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921-2002. In such circumstances, it is proposed that the evidence presented to the commission will be made available to the tribunal, thereby assisting the tribunal in expediting its inquiry.</P>

      <P>In its report on admission and service in licensed premises, which was published in December last, the commission on liquor licensing identified certain weaknesses in the existing law in relation to drunkenness and pointed to the need to strengthen legislative provisions in this area. The commission made similar recommendations in relation to violent, quarrelsome and disorderly conduct on licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered the commission's recommendations, I decided that an urgent response was called for and I intend, therefore, to bring proposals to Government at an early date for the necessary legislative changes, including stronger penalties, as recommended by the commission. The necessary preparatory work is already under way in my Department and I hope to obtain <Col N="572" /> Government approval for the amending legislation before Easter.</P>
    <P>The commission made no formal recommendations for legislative changes in relation to equality issues in the December report but the report does contain a number of suggestions for changes to existing equality structures and procedures. The commission stated that any such changes would require further consideration and wider consultation.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the report, I asked my Department to consult with the social partners as well as the ODEI, the Equality Tribunal and the Equality Authority about the equality issues raised by the commission, and to report to me on the outcome. I am awaiting the outcome of this consultation process before making any decisions in relation to equality structures and procedures.</P>

      <P>It is planned that when the Garda PULSE system and the courts criminal case tracking system, CCTS, are fully rolled out and the various technical and other issues are addressed, court outcomes will be electronically transferred from the CCTS system to PULSE.

      <P>The Government's road safety strategy 1998-2002 provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety improvement. The legislation necessary for this measure was passed by the Oireachtas in March 2002.</P>
      <P>Work is under way on the development of a computerised fixed charge processing system for the Garda Síochána to facilitate the introduction of an electronic system for notification of penalty point offences to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The computer system will facilitate the full implementation of the relevant provisions of the legislation. It is expected that implementation of the system throughout the country will commence in the second quarter of 2004 with the progressive extension of the system to cater for all penalty point offences taking place as quickly as possible. I am satisfied that sufficient resources will be allocated by the Garda authorities to enable the system to be fully implemented.</P>
      <P>Pending the implementation of the computer system, a manual system for speeding offences is in place since the introduction of penalty points for speeding offences in October 2002. I am informed by the Garda authorities that sufficient resources of personnel and equipment are being made available to operate the manual system. I am also informed that the operation of the manual system is kept under constant review by Garda management and that should further resources be required they will be provided.</P>

No. 639 of 2002), which came into operation on 1 March 2003. It was considered necessary to revoke the previous regulations to improve their transparency.

    <P>Regulation 5 of the new regulations provides for an exemption from the obligation to indicate the unit price of a product for any product which is sold other than in bulk &ldquo;in a premises in which the trader does not make use of equipment for <Col N="574" /> printing shelf edge labels or equipment for point of sale scanning, or by an itinerant trader&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The reason the unit pricing element of the new European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 639 of 2002) applies only to retailers who make use of equipment for printing shelf edge labels or equipment for point of sale scanning is that I decided, following consultation with relevant trade interests, this approach would best take account of the particular circumstances of the small retail sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 6 of EU Directive 98/6/EC permitted member states to exempt, for a transitional period, certain small retail businesses from the obligation to unit price pre-packaged products. In this connection, I considered using exemption criteria based on the size of retail premises but this pro<Col N="576" /> ved difficult on several grounds. Instead, I had regard to the fact that access to the technology for the printing of shelf edge labels and the use of point of sale scanning equipment can significantly reduce the time and other staff costs associated with pricing and recording sales. On this basis, I decided that the exemption from the requirement to unit price pre-packed goods should be confined to those retailers who do not make use of such technology.</P>
    <P>The aim of the regulations is to provide consumers with general price information, selling prices, and unit price information that will enable them to make accurate and immediate comparisons between competing products. In general, therefore, the obligation to indicate unit price is additional to the obligation to indicate the selling price. However, regulation 5(2) does provide for a number of exemptions from the requirement to unit price, in addition to the exemption for small retailers outlined above, including products where the selling price does not relate to quantity, e.g. cars, washing machines, where the unit price is identical to the selling price, products such as sweets and crisps which are less than 50 grams or 50 millilitres, products being sold at a reduced price due to damage or danger of deterioration, and assortment packs, e.g. hampers. In these cases the obligation is to indicate the selling price only.</P>

Meetings have been held between officials of the Department and the over-holders as well as with officials of Kildare County Council. In cases where houses have been offered for sale to over-holders, the Department has requested the co-operation of Kildare County Council in ensuring that mortgages are made available to eligible applicants. The Department will be in further contact with the over-holders in due course.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to animal vaccines is that because existing licences issued under the Therapeutic Substances Act 1932 no longer met current legislative or scientific requirements, it was necessary to review all such licences on an individual basis. Under this review, which has been ongoing since 1999, the detailed examination of application dossiers, submitted by sponsoring companies, is being carried by the Irish Medicines Board in accordance with current legislative criteria. On this basis, the IMB makes a recommendation to my Department which, as competent authority, makes a final decision on the grant or otherwise of a licence and on the conditions, including route of supply, accompanying such licence.</P>
      <P>With regard to routes of supply, I should make clear that the prescription only medicine exempt category is not itself new and is one of a number of possible routes of supply provided for under the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996. In terms of designating routes of supply for individual vaccines, my Department does not have a general approach which would as a matter of policy necessarily exclude any of the categories provided for under the 1996 regulations. Rather, the decision is taken on the basis of the characteristics of each individual product taking account of the relevant recommendation of the IMB and the objective criteria laid down in regulation 13 of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996.   </P>

      <P>My Department has not received an application for additional quota from the person named. I understand the named person is not a quota holder and, therefore, would not qualify for consideration by the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered extreme hardship as a result of the milk quota system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the named person may be eligible for a new entrant allocation under the milk quota restructuring scheme if he satisfies certain criteria in relation to age, education, etc. This scheme is operated on behalf of my Department by co-operatives-dairies and I recently announced some changes for the 2003-04 quota year which will <Col N="580" /> allow a qualified young person to purchase a new entrant quota allocation and set up as a milk producer in their own right on their parent's holding provided they form a milk production partnership together. Full details of this scheme will be published in the near future.</P>

The herd of the person concerned, has been listed to her private veterinary practitioner to have her annual round test for TB and brucellosis carried out between 17 February and the 6 April 2003.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>In The Finance Act 2001, I introduced a new scheme of tax relief on donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to eligible charities and other approved bodies including first and second level schools and third level institutions including universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An eligible charity is any charity in the State which has been granted exemption from tax for a period of not less than three years and which is authorised by the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of the new scheme. I am informed by <Col N="581" /> the Revenue Commissioners that the names of eligible charities for the purpose of the scheme can be found on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.</P>
    <P>The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes to an eligible charity or approved body is &euro;250 per annum. Donations for any one year can be on a cumulative basis. The relief on the donation will be at an individual's marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations will depend on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer or an individual on self-assessment or a company. For a PAYE taxpayer, the relief will be given at the donor's marginal rate of income tax and will be given on a grossed-up basis to the charity. This means the tax refund will go to the charity.</P>
    <P>In the case of a donation made by an individual who is self-assessed, the individual will claim the relief and there is no grossing-up arrangement. Similarly, in the case of companies, they can claim deductions for donations as if they were a trading expense.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information currently available is in respect of the short income tax year 2001 and relates only to donations made by PAYE taxpayers. The cost to the Exchequer of tax relief arising from the scheme is estimated &euro;12.7 million in respect of donations in favour of 407 approved bodies by approximately 23,700 individual donors.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a name check, it appears that approximately 36 religious orders have to date received tax relief to the value of about &euro;7.6 million from some 2,600 individual donors. It is not possible to state with certainty what proportion of this relief has been obtained through the income transfer method mentioned by the Deputy, but an examination carried out in September 2002 of refund claims by religious orders amounting to &euro;5.87 million at that time revealed that some 99% of those refunds were attributable to this income transfer method.</P>
    <P>In relation to the names of the approved bodies who have availed of the scheme, I should point out that taxpayer confidentiality requires that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about the tax affairs of an individual or body, other than when the Deputy asking the question is asking the question on behalf of the taxpayer. In this instance, it would appear that the Deputy is not asking the question with the consent of the individuals or bodies concerned. In these circumstances, I regret that the information sought cannot be divulged.</P>

      <Quest>if he has plans to remove the stamp duty exemptions on charitable trusts where they buy properties solely for investment purposes in view of reports that the Royal College of Surgeons bought the Ardilaun Centre as an investment property and avoided stamp duty on the purchase due to its status as a charitable trust, and in view of the fact that the State lost out on ?4.5 million when this deal was agreed.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 82 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 certain charitable dispositions are exempt from the charge to stamp duty. This exemption is confined to conveyances or transfers, whether on sale or by way of gift, or leases of land, to bodies or persons, or trustees of a trust, established solely for charitable purposes, and which are made for charitable purposes in the State or Northern Ireland. In order to own and hold property, a charity will normally have such authority in its founding charter. It is not unusual for a charity to own property and any income derived from such ownership would, for the purposes of the tax regime for charities, be required to be applied for charitable purposes.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that conveyances, transfers or leases in respect of which the exemption is sought must be submitted to them for adjudication, which is the process whereby the Revenue Commissioners formally assesses the liability, if any, to stamp duty of a legal instrument. In claiming the stamp duty exemption, a charity effectively declares that the transfer of the property complies with the requirements of section 82 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, in that the conveyance, transfer or lease is made for charitable purposes to a charity. There are various long-standing tax exemptions for charities in the taxation code and I have no plans at present to remove this particular stamp duty exemption for charities.</P>

      <P>Where a VAT registered builder makes a supply of property to an un-registered person(s), the VAT rate applicable to the supply would be the rate in force on the date the builder receives payments due to him/her in respect of the supply. For property transactions this would normally be the closing date of the sale. Any deposit or stage payments paid to a VAT registered builder before 1 January 2003 by an unregistered person for the supply of a house would be deemed to be advance payments and would be liable to VAT at the rate in force when the builder received the payments, i.e. 12.5%. However, the balance of payments paid to the builder on or after 1 January 2003 would be liable to VAT at 13.5%. I would not be in a position to comment on the <Col N="583" /> actual terms of a contract entered into between the builder and the private individual concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has consistently stressed that all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement need to be implemented fully, including swift and ongoing movement towards full normalisation throughout Northern Ireland, including in South Armagh. Under the Agreement, the British Government is committed to securing &ldquo;as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements, consistent with the level of threat&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There has been some welcome progress in recent years. Around 40 military installations have been closed, vacated or demolished since 1995. Troop levels have been reduced by 3,500. In the south Armagh area, installations have been dismantled, including Crossmaglen sanger, observation towers at Cloghogue, Camlough, Sturgan and Glasdrumman, and the &lsquo;super-sanger' and security barrier at Newtownhamilton police station. Land requisitioned by the British army at Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club in the early 1970s was returned to the club in 1999.</P>
      <P>However, the process of normalisation envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement has yet to be realised. Troop levels remain at around 14,000. Some 57 military installations remain in operation across Northern Ireland. In south Armagh, there remain joint army/police barracks in Crossmaglen, Keady, Forkhill, Newtownhamilton and Middletown and ten observation towers in south Armagh.</P>
      <P>Without doubt, the scale and pace of demilitarisation has fallen short of expectations, particularly in Nationalist communities such as Crossmaglen, and we need to see further early progress on this front.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, both the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have been seeking to achieve &lsquo;acts of completion' in regard to all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. I wish to assure the Deputy that the complete normalisation of security arrangements has been a key part of the intensive discussions between both Governments in this context, which culminated in the talks last week in Hillsborough.</P>

The question of Palestine is regularly discussed in the framework of the UN. It will be among the items considered this month by the UN Commission on Human Rights. As a member of the commission, Ireland will support the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. It is a matter for the appropriate committees of the House to consider whether a visit to the occupied territories by a cross-party delegation would be useful at this time.</P>

      <P>The post of resource teacher is an additional post allocated to assist a school or cluster of schools in providing an education which meets the requirements of children assessed as having special educational needs. Under the direction of the school principal, the role of the resource teacher is to provide additional teaching support for these children who have been fully integrated into mainstream schools and who need such support. In all cases, the model and level of support made available is based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has the services of two full-time resource teachers, one being on a shared basis. This allocation was examined by the national educational psychological service, NEPS, as part of a general review of resource teacher and special needs assistant allocations to ordinary national schools. In the case of two pupils in the school availing of resource teaching support, NEPS was unable initially to recommend that they continue to benefit from that support because the relevant documentation in their cases was unavailable. The school has since provided the documentation to NEPS and the continuance of resource teaching support has been approved for the pupils in question. My officials have been in contact with the school authorities to confirm the position.</P>

The revised procedure applies to schools intending to commence operation from 1 September 2003 onwards.</P>
      <P>The revised arrangements involve a number of stages including: formal notification of intention to apply for recognition; public consultation and identification of need; formal application for recognition; assessment of the application by a new schools advisory committee, which will consult interested parties and report to me; decision by the Minister; and provision for appeal by applicant to an independent appeals committee. Full details of the applications procedure and the timeframe for consideration of applications for schools intending to commence operation in 2003-04 were circulated to the primary education partners and are also available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.</P>
      <P>With regard to the funding of permanent accommodation for new schools in developing areas, the position is that the criteria used by my Department for prioritising large scale primary school building projects have been published and may also be found on my Department's website at www.education.ie.

      <P>The administrative grant towards the running costs of the National Parents Council, primary, has not been reduced. My Department also provides assistance, through its in-career development programme, to the National Parents Council, primary, towards the cost of training courses which it provides. In this regard the allocation to the National Parents Council, primary, in 2003 will be less than the allocation in 2002, taking account of the overall demands for inservice generally. I will continue to provide support to the National Parents Council on behalf of primary school parents generally.</P>

      <P>The family in question reside 1.5 miles from the route of service to the school attended. They were advised that their children had a level of service within guidelines and that an extension of service would not be granted. The family re-applied for an extension of service on medical grounds in respect of one of their children. The medical evidence submitted was forwarded to my Department's medical advisor who determined that the pupil's condition would make it difficult for him to make his own way to the pick-up point. My Department agreed to arrange for the provision of transport in the mornings and offered the family grant-aid towards the cost of private transport arrangements for the children in the afternoon. I have asked that this arrangement be reviewed as a matter of urgency and the Deputy will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In the case of school amalgamations, pupils residing in a closed school area, where the closed school would have been their nearest school had it remained open, may be deemed eligible for transport to the school of amalgamation only. The family concerned reside in a closed school area, which amalgamated with another school in the area. As the pupil concerned is not attending the school of amalgamation, he is not basically eligible for free transport. However, as there is no suitable transport to the appropriate school from the family's area, concessionary fare-paying transport may be allowed to the school concerned without the agreement of his appropriate school. Tickets may be purchased from the local Bus Éireann office. The current charge for concessionary tickets is &euro;26.00 per pupil per term. In the event that the family holds a valid medical card the fare may be waived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cancer registry was established in 1991 and began registering cancers nationwide in January 1994. Any report on incidence the registry can give is confined to the period of 1994 up to 2000, the year for which the most recent data is available. An examination of data for this time period would not support the view that there has been an increase in the incidence of cancer in children in Ireland. The national cancer registry has informed my Department that information on mortality is available since 1953. An examination of mortality data from 1953 to 2000 shows a clear decline in mortality during that time, which would also suggest that there has not been an underlying increase in childhood cancer. Significant developments and advances in the treatment of a number of significant childhood cancers have resulted in very significant improvements in survival for children with these cancers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately &euro;400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes the sum of &euro;29 million <Col N="592" /> which was provided this year to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services. This funding also includes &euro;0.75 million that was allocated to the ERHA this year for designated national centres for cancer services, including paediatric oncology services.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003 is being developed by the national cancer forum in conjunction with my Department. This strategy will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the first national cancer strategy and set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons lies with the health boards in the first instance. However, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis, including those services provided in the Western Health Board. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding thirteen den<Col N="593" /> tists from various health boards &ndash; including two from the Western Health Board &ndash; for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. Additional funding of &euro;0.640 million and &euro;0.894 million was provided for these training programmes in 2002 and 2003 respectively. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. The additional funding of &euro;0.628 million allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services, included &euro;0.533 million for an orthodontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that under the initiative, the board has, <i>inter alia,</i> recruited an additional specialist in orthodontics. Furthermore, two specialists in orthodontics who completed their training last year, have since taken up duty with the board.</P>
      <P>Last year, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Under the scheme, the Western Health Board received &euro;0.465 million for the treatment of patients in this way. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that, at the end of December 2002, there were 1,496 patients receiving orthodontic treatment from the board. This is an increase of 139 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in comparison with the equivalent number at the end of June 2002. For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, the initiatives and structural changes that I have set out above will bring about an improvement in waiting times for treatment and positively impact on the future delivery of orthodontic services in the longer term.</P>

      <P>The board submitted a proposal under the bed capacity initiative to provide for an additional three beds as a stroke care unit-observation beds at Portiuncula Hospital. I have provided additional capital funding of &euro;191,000 to allow the necessary infrastructural works to take place and revenue funding of &euro;780,000 to employ staff to open the additional three beds. The additional beds are open since the end of last year.</P>
      <P>My Department has been informed that the three additional beds are currently acute general medical beds which will provide enhanced services for stroke and other patients in the region.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Government is proposing to eliminate the words "protection of children's rights" from draft European constitutional treaty paragraph 4 of Article 3: on the Union's objectives and substitute broad language referencing the universality and individuality of human rights; and his views on whether this proposal, if adopted, would continue to deny reference to an explicit legal basis for children's rights in European treaties.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having consulted with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I can assure the Deputy that any suggestion that the Government is opposed <Col N="596" /> to the promotion and defence of children's rights at the European Convention is unfounded. It is correct that an initial draft article of the new constitutional treaty, dealing with the role of the EU in the world, contains a reference to children's rights. While this is positive the draft has also some shortcomings. For instance, it does not refer to any other human rights nor does it mention the United Nations. Like a number of other Convention members, my colleague, the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, proposed an amendment based on clearer and more comprehensive wording agreed earlier at a working group. His proposal refers clearly to the United Nations and to the &ldquo;universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms&rdquo;. This would ensure that all human rights &ndash; including children's rights, the rights of the disabled, the right of men and women to equality &ndash; were equally valued in the draft treaty. The aim is that the treaty should be as succinct as possible. If it is decided to list the different categories of rights individually the Government will work to ensure that children's rights are included.</P>

      <P>The board of the Courts Service has proposed the designation of an area encompassing Blackhall Place, the Kings Inns, North King Street and the Four Courts area of the quays as a legal quarter to encourage the development of the district, particularly the development of legal and courts services within the district.</P>
      <P>This area already contains a large concentration of court facilities, legal services, other court related agencies such as the Probation and Welfare Service and State Prosecution Service, the Irish Association for Victim Support, the Refugee Legal Service and over 60 law firms.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Courts Service is of the view that the momentum created by the designation of this area as a legal services district and by the progression of two major court projects i.e. a family law court complex and a criminal court complex would have the potential to complement the efforts of Dublin City Council to rejuvenate and regenerate this area of the north inner city and would, undoubtedly, stimulate further commercial activity in the area. Many of the sites in this area already hold tax designated status under the HARP project.</P>
      <P>I further understand that the Courts Service has arranged, through the Office of Public Works, for the appointment of a town planner to examine the proposal in more detail and to prepare a report on the impact of the designation of the area as a legal quarter with a view to identifying the benefits which will accrue to the area. The examination will take into account the historical, architectural, commercial, social and other implications of the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>County and Garda district boundaries do not correlate. There are two Garda districts in County Kildare: Naas district and Kildare district. Naas District is composed of Naas, Celbridge, Clane, Kill and Maynooth Garda stations. Kildare District is composed of Kildare, Carbury, Kilcullen, Monasterevin Newbridge, Rathangan and Robertstown Garda stations. The remaining stations listed above, while in the county of Kildare, form parts of four other Garda districts that are primarily in counties other than Kildare.</P>
    <P>Local Garda management is satisfied that the arrangements in place in the Garda stations in County Kildare are adequate to meet the policing needs of the areas. I am informed that the situation will be kept under review and, when additional personnel next become available, the needs of Garda stations in County Kildare will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations.</P>

The fourth and final phase of the system has already been developed and it is planned to deploy the system nationally later this year. No further capital expenditure is expected for the project.</P>
      <P>The PULSE computer system has been operational for three years and is available at 181 locations, including divisional and district headquarters and all major city stations. Under this level of coverage, 85% of all incidents are directly captured and more than 75% of Garda personnel have direct access to PULSE systems in their stations.</P>

      <P>My proposals to amend the criminal law are set out in the Government legislation programme. A Criminal Justice (Garda Powers) Bill will be introduced giving additional powers to the Garda Síochána in investigating serious crime. The new public order legislation going through the Oireachtas will greatly enhance the power of the Garda Síochána to deal with public order offences. If a need is identified at any stage to amend the law to deal with a specific crime problem, I will not hesitate to bring forward proposals for such legislation.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination in employment on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Equal Status Act prohibits discrimination on the same nine grounds in access to and provision of goods and services.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act 1998 provided for the establishment of the Equality Authority. The remit of the authority was extended under the Equal Status Act. The functions of the authority include working towards the elimination of unlawful discrimination, the promotion of equality of opportunity and the provision of information to the public on the provisions of the equality legislation.</P>
      <P>The Equality Authority annual report for 2002, which I launched on 6 March 2003, shows that, in 2002, the authority received 10,978 general queries for information about equality and related legislation. Nearly half the queries related to parental, maternity and adoptive leave entitlements. During 2002, the authority opened 532 new case files across all nine grounds. These figures compare with a total of 752 new case files opened in 2001. Some 227 of the case files opened in 2002 refer to the Employment Equality Act 1998 and 305 refer to the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act also provided for the establishment of the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, ODEI &ndash; the equality tribunal, to provide the main forum for redress in equality cases. Anyone who considers that s/he has suffered discrimination contrary to the equality legislation may seek redress by referring a case to the ODEI &ndash; the equality tribunal, the Labour Court, the District Court or the Circuit Court as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the equality infrastructure put in place on the coming into force of the recent equality legislation and the avenues of redress provided in the legislation are adequate to respond to discrimination in society whether in the workplace or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Although recent statistics for violent crime are a cause for concern, they also reflect, in part, increased activity by the Garda Síochána which has led to a greater number of offences coming to its attention. This is confirmed by the excellent detection rate of 75% in respect of assaults and 86% in respect of homicides. Nevertheless, the crime figures for 2001, the most recent available, underline the continued need for robust responses to offending behaviour and the need to readily adapt to changing levels and patterns of crime.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the current strength of the Garda Síochána is at an all-time high and prioritisation is being given to Garda recruitment and training to increase numbers to the authorised strength of 12,200 as soon as possible. In accordance with the programme for Government, these additional gardaí will be assigned to areas of greatest need.</P>
      <P>The criminal law is kept under constant review to ensure that the Garda Síochána has the legislative support to allow it to investigate crime effectively and bring to justice its perpetrators. For example, the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill will bring forward legislative proposals for new Garda powers of investigation. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002, which is going through the Oireachtas, aims to strengthen the law to deal more effectively with late-night public disorder and disturbance which mainly has its origins in alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána will also continue to target the menace of organised crime, particularly by means of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" />Following the implementation of special backdating provisions introduced by the then Minister in 1999, he received an additional 15 weeks of payment from 31 March 1995. These provisions do not provide for further backdating in the circumstances of this case. The person concerned has, therefore, received his full entitlement under the relevant legislation. The fact that he was not aware of his possible entitlement to pension would not in itself warrant any further backdating in this instance.</P>
