      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of urgent national importance prior to its being signed into law, namely, the implications of the ban on tobacco smoking introduced under section 47(<i>f</i>) of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act by the Minister for Health and Children for licensed premises, registered clubs, the hospitality industry, workplaces in general, psychiatric institutions and prisons, in view of the fact that this controversial legislation was not debated in this House and also because the licensed vintners have signalled their intention to defy this measure and to continue to permit smoking on their premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the urgent case for the metro from Dublin via Dublin Airport to serve the metropolis of Swords, the capital of Fingal which, we are told, is the fastest growing urban area in Europe, and the need to clarify which Government position on this matter is the official policy position and the timeframe for the implementation of that policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise the matter of the announcement yesterday that most of the 100 workforce at the Dubarry shoe factory in Ballinasloe, County Galway, will be put on a three day week. That shock announcement comes hot on the heels of the closure of the Square D factory with a loss of 400 jobs and the loss of 300 jobs at the AT Cross factory. I seek immediate Government and IDA Ireland action to attract an anchor industry to the town. I also demand that the Government decentralises a substantial number of civil servants to the town as part of the long promised decentralisation programme, given <Col N="226" /> that the Government has absolute control and authority in this matter. I am sorry the Tánaiste is not in the House this morning as it is her town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 5, Aer Lingus Bill 2003 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 2, Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage; and No. 6, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill 2003 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Aer Lingus Bill 2003 contains proposals to privatise Aer Lingus. A precedent has already been set with the Eircom debacle which led to difficulties. Will the Minister for Defence confirm that a White Paper will be produced before Committee Stage of the Bill so that Members of the House will have an opportunity to discuss in detail the options, given that the slots at Heathrow Airport are of considerable importance to this country, and to understand what proposals the Government has to dispose of these in the event of Aer Lingus being privatised? I ask him to respond to that question first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal by the Fine Gael leader for the publication of a White Paper on this issue. It is clear the Bill deals with more than just providing for the implementation of the ESOP for the workforce at Aer Lingus. It is an irrevocable step towards the privatisation of the national airline, probably in a trade sale. Before the House is required to make a decision on this matter, the proposal from Deputy Kenny would enable everyone in the House to examine the business case being made for this drastic decision and why the Government feels it necessary to proceed with legislation which is far wider than its initial purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government make time available for a debate on a White Paper which would deal with the strategic importance of the proposals in the Bill? The Second Stage debate will only deal with the technicalities, not with the strategic importance of a national airline. The Government must come clean on whether it sees that as the future of Aer Lingus or whether a privatisation agenda is being pushed.</P>

When might we expect publication of the tribunal of inquiry (evidence) (amendment) Bill?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal of inquiry (evidence) (amendment) Bill will deal with matters arising from the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood and other cost-related matters. The information I have at the moment is that it is intended to introduce the Bill this session.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful for me to make a brief statement on the other matter, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission. His Honour, Judge Alan Mahon, chairman of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, made clear in a public statement last night that prior to his appointment as a judge he had disclosed in his written application to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board the fact that he had concluded a tax settlement with the Revenue Commissioners in 1992. As the House will be aware, the board was established for the purpose of identifying persons and informing the Government of the suitability of those persons for appointment to judicial office. The proceedings of the board are confidential. That board recommended Judge Mahon as being suitable for appointment to the Bench. The Government accepts unequivocally the suitability and integrity of Judge Alan Mahon, both as a judge and as chairman of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Defence for the statement issued on behalf of the Government. However, it leaves one question unanswered. Yesterday, in the context of constitutional matters, the Taoiseach's proposals for judicial accountability were mentioned. As one who sat around the Cabinet table, I know the procedure for obtaining Cabinet approval of names for appointment to the Judiciary. Perhaps it would be appropriate for the Government to clarify the information that is available to it when it approves appointments based on recommendations from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's statement, but he should also provide for a statement from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who was involved in the vetting procedure. It is important to explain why we are only now hearing of this matter. I ask that the Minister come into the House and make a statement explaining why, knowing about this matter, he did not inform the Government. This matter needs to be clarified before we can go further. It should not affect the work of the tribunal, which needs to proceed as quickly as possible with its job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government make time available to discuss the consequences of the WTO conference in Cancún? The 2002 report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was published recently. No time has been allocated in plenary session for discussion of a number of important UN reports, including reports on population and development. We had statements before the meeting in Cancún, at which the Government successfully maintained its three different positions. We now need to debate the consequences. I would like an indication from the Government that it will make time available for this, ideally by way of a motion, so that we may have an opportunity of expressing our views and discussing these matters.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins's point is valid in that the House should have the opportunity of debating issues such as these.

Where people are not allowed to smoke and have no respite, will they be compelled to leave the home, or will the people they care for &ndash; possibly 200,000 people &ndash; have to leave, to enable them to enjoy a cigarette?

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the employee share ownership plan, ESOP, agreed by the Government and Aer Lingus unions and to provide for a legal framework to facilitate a process of external investment in the airline in the event that the Government embarks on such a process. The Bill also includes an enabling provision for the establishment of new pension schemes by Aer Lingus for general employees and pensioners and for amendments regarding the appointment of directors, including worker directors.</P>
      <P>While this is a short Bill, before I outline the purpose of each section, I want to make some general remarks. The original employee share participation scheme, ESPS, for Aer Lingus staff was agreed under the Cahill plan in 1993. This scheme provided that employees satisfying certain service criteria were entitled to receive the equivalent of 10% of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus as at 31 December 1995, valued at approximately &euro;30.98 million, earned out of profits of which 5% is by way of shares and 5% by way of cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the scheme was established in 1996, a total of &euro;15.5 million has been paid to staff in <Col N="240" /> cash and a total of 12.2 million shares in Aer Lingus Group pIc have been allocated to staff. No further shares or cash are due to be allocated or paid under the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision in December 1999 sanctioning an initial public offering, IPO, of Aer Lingus shares, negotiations commenced on an Aer Lingus ESOP to bring the employees share to 14.9% in line with Government policy. The Government's policy for the establishment of ESOPs in semi-State companies is that the total amount of equity which an ESOT can hold is 14.9%, of which up to 5% of equity may be given for organisational transformation and the balance of up to 9.9% must be paid for in cash to the Exchequer. The Government policy envisaged that the full 14.9% is only relevant in certain circumstances such as when the State is exiting from the company.</P>
    <P>While progress was made on some of the ESOP issues, negotiations did not conclude due to a number of external and internal difficulties including industrial relations problems in 2000 and 2001, the deepening economic downturn and the impact of the foot and mouth disease, all of which led to the eventual cancellation of the IPO process. These events were quickly followed by the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and the consequent devastating global impact. As we all recall, the aviation sector was badly affected. Some airlines did not survive while others are still struggling to recover from the impact.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September 2001 greatly exacerbated an already difficult trading position in Aer Lingus with the result that the company was on the brink of bankruptcy in late 2001. Faced with this crisis, the Government decided on 23 October 2001 to facilitate private sector and further staff investment in the company. This was contingent on support by Aer Lingus staff for implementing the survival plan in full. The survival plan agreed at that time included the reduction of over 2,000 in staff numbers, a pay freeze, substantial work practice changes and the sale of non-core assets. This plan was the subject of intense negotiations with unions with the assistance of the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge that it was the quick action to cut costs and stem losses, with the co-operation of staff, which resulted in the survival of the airline. The survival plan involved significant pain and sacrifice and the ESOP is the tangible recognition of that contribution. Agreement on a framework for the ESOP was reached in December 2001 following detailed and intensive discussions involving Ministers, unions, company management and senior officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Transport.</P>
    <P>I again refer to Government policy on staff shareholdings in State companies. Due to the unique circumstances of Aer Lingus in late 2001 when it was on the verge of bankruptcy, it was decided regarding the 9.9% element, the con<Col N="241" /> sideration would be the pay foregone elements of the survival plan. A judgment was made at the time by Ministers that this was the only course of action to ensure the survival of the company.</P>
    <P>During 2002, departmental officials, company management and unions took the basic framework already agreed and together with their advisers negotiated and finalised the necessary legal documentation culminating in the signing of documents such as the ESOP deed of covenant and the trust deed in March 2003.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation only allows for the distribution of up to 5% of the share capital of Aer Lingus for the benefit of staff. Full implementation of the ESOP, including the issuing of the additional 9.9% shareholding to staff and the appointment of an ESOP director, can only be completed with the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the key elements of the agreement on the Aer Lingus ESOP. An employee share ownership trust to hold shares on behalf of the participants will be established with an equity base of up to 14.9%, including the shares currently held by staff. The existing staff shareholding is open to purchase by the ESOT. Payment for the additional 9.9% will be by way of the pay foregone elements of the survival plan. The implementation of the ESOP is subject to verification by the chief executive of Aer Lingus that the relevant elements of the survival plan have been implemented. The ESOT will be entitled to appoint one director to the board of Aer Lingus with a further director to be appointed by the Minister from nominations submitted by the unions. For as long as the worker participation Acts apply to the company, the aggregate number of worker directors and ESOT directors cannot exceed four. In line with Government policy, for as long as the State holds any shares in the company, the maximum shareholding, which the ESOT and staff can hold, is 14.9%.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, this is a unique ESOP arrangement made in unique circumstances. At the time the ESOP framework was agreed, the company was arguably of very little value. Now, however, that stake is worth a very considerable figure by reference to analysts' valuations which appeared in media reports in recent times. Whatever the ultimate value, it should be acknowledged that staff now have a valuable stake in a valuable company and that all efforts should be focused on strengthening the company financially and operationally so as to increase its value in the interests of all stakeholders. Whatever the future circumstances and policy decisions of Government, the 14.9% will remain the limit of staff shareholding while the State holds any shares in the company.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, Aer Lingus has made a remarkable recovery and return to profitability since the aftermath of 11 September 2001. The board, management and staff have transformed the airline into a lower cost, flexible, efficient business model offering low fares with a quality <Col N="242" /> service. The airline is better placed now to withstand competitive pressures and economic and other external shocks which may particularly impact on the volatile, cyclical aviation sector.</P>
    <P>In 2002, Aer Lingus achieved an operating profit of &euro;63.8 million compared to a loss of &euro;52.1 million in 2001. The first half results for 2003 demonstrate that the new focus continues to yield results with an operating profit of &euro;14.3 million against an operating loss of &euro;12.6 million for the same period last year and an operating loss of &euro;38.1 million for the first half of 2001. This significant turnaround was achieved against a tough background including the war in Iraq and the SARS scare. Aer Lingus is on track to exceed its full-year operating profit forecast of &euro;75 million for 2003.</P>
    <P>On the operational side and despite the difficulties of the past two years, Aer Lingus has introduced services on 16 new routes, all from greater efficiencies in the utilisation of existing aircraft and staff resources. This brings the current number of destinations served by Aer Lingus to 29. Last week the company announced services on nine new European routes which will commence in 2004. This ability to respond flexibly and rapidly to new opportunities is a reflection of the developing new culture in the organisation since the introduction of the survival plan.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the improved performance and the continuing expansion of European services, I am examining a proposal for the upgrading of the European fleet. This will see the airline obtain a single short-haul fleet aircraft type for its European operation with the acquisition of 17 new Airbus A320 aircraft. These aircraft will replace existing but smaller capacity Boeing and Bae146 aircraft. The new aircraft will be on-stream by 2005, maintaining the total short-haul fleet at 27 but with increased capacity from the larger aircraft and lower unit costs. The company proposes to fund this investment from internal resources.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has also advised that it sees significant growth opportunities on the important transatlantic market if the current bilateral restrictions are eased. I am looking at this matter in the context of the EU-US &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; talks and the opportunities for growth in the tourism and aviation market.</P>
    <P>The airline has made, and continues to make, a significant and valuable contribution to the economic and tourism development of the country by providing a range of quality services to destinations in Ireland's main markets in the UK, Europe and United States of America. It is the Government's wish that it continue to play this key role for the future. To ensure that role continues, we must be open at all times to examining options crucial to the ongoing and future success of the company, taking account of the global aviation environment.</P>
    <P>For this reason, an enabling provision has been included in this Bill which allows both the sale of some or all of the State's shareholdings and for <Col N="243" /> the company to issue new shares. It is now over six years since the Government first decided to explore the ownership issue which led to the decision in 1999 to embark on an IPO of the airline. Since the cancellation of that planned IPO, the board and staff of Aer Lingus have focused on the implementation of the survival plan and more recently, on building on the progress made. I have taken the view since coming into office that the company needed to continue that focus on positioning the airline so that it could compete successfully and grow profitably. This it has done and is continuing to do.</P>
    <P>In that context, and taking account of progress in repositioning the airline, I asked the chairman last July to examine and report back to me on future options for the company. The chairman supplied me with that report recently. The company's view is that a private sector investment process should be initiated without delay. I am considering that report carefully and I will bring the Aer Lingus views, together with my own position, to Cabinet in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the current industrial relations difficulties in the cabin crew area of Aer Lingus. While I accept that change is difficult for all, I hope this matter can be resolved on the basis of the recent Labour Court recommendations, without further impact on customers and without jeopardising the company's progress to date.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1, the definitions section, is self-explanatory. Section 2 and the Schedule provide for the repeal of provisions, in whole or in part and on different days, of the existing legislation governing Aer Lingus. Section 3 provides for the sale of all of the State's shares in the airline. Provision is also made that any funds received in respect of the sale or disposal of the State's shareholding in the company will be paid into, and disposed of for the benefit of, the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes provision for Aer Lingus to issue and sell new shares. Section 5 makes provision to enable the Minister for Finance to enter into one or more agreements in connection with the sale of shares in the airline, including customary provisions contained in a shareholders' or underwriting agreement as the Minister may wish.</P>
    <P>Section 6, in order to facilitate ESOT board representation and, where and when necessary, third party board representation, provides for the full or partial disapplication from the company of the Worker Participation Acts, for the retirement of directors upon such disapplication and for the Minister to appoint new directors to fill vacancies so created. The overall number of directors does not change. Section 7 provides for employee shareholding schemes and their acquisition of shares in the company. Section 8 provides for an exemption from section 60 of the Companies Acts. Section 9 is an enabling provision to provide that Aer Lingus may establish a superannu<Col N="244" /> ation scheme for Aer Lingus employees and former employees of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a standard provision in relation to the expenses of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport. Section 11 provides for the repayment to the Exchequer of a loan and outstanding interest by Aer Linte. Section 12 provides for the disapplication of certain acts to Aer Lingus. Section 13 gives the Short Title and commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>Before I commend this Bill to the House I want to pay tribute to everybody at Aer Lingus for what they have done. They have turned around an airline which a few years ago was on the verge of bankruptcy, through the sacrifices of the staff in particular, led by the board, the chairman and by strong management. The current chief executive especially has shown great courage and skill in leading that organisation for many years. This House and I understand the sacrifices made by all the staff, the cost-cutting they had to bear and their absolute determination to turn the airline around. What they have achieved is unique because airlines around the world are in difficulty in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001. When the aviation history books are written it will be a source of some satisfaction and admiration that in the face of the troubles after 11 September and the hopes and aspirations of so many people in Aer Lingus the company was able to reach a point where it is looking at a possible &euro;75 million profit.</P>
    <P>The 14.9% is being transferred to staff. That is not just a token, it is a real decision. I am not today going to put a valuation on Aer Lingus but in the financial pages of the press one can read different estimates from &euro;300 million to &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million. Whether it is the former or the latter one does not need to be good at sums to know that 14.9% of that is very valuable, it could be anything from &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million up to &euro;100 million. Through this Bill this House gives effect to that percentage and that is the range of the current valuations of the shares which the staff hold. They deserve that. They worked hard for it and put up with considerable sacrifice to make it happen. They gave up increases in their incomes to pay for these shares and I do not believe this House begrudges the benefit to them. However, it is worth noting, from the taxpayers' point of view, that these are very valuable shares which are being entrusted to the staff at Aer Lingus, who will now own 14.9% of a very valuable company.</P>
    <P>Having outlined the main elements of this legislation, I also wish to make it clear the position regarding the enabling provision on possible future disposal of the rest of the shares in Aer Lingus &ndash; I should say, rather, the company itself. No Government decision has been taken to dispose of Aer Lingus &ndash; let me make that very clear. I have a recommendation from the company, giving me its opinion. As expressed to me by the chairman and chief executive, the opinion <Col N="245" /> of the company is that its future would be best secured by taking on board private sector investment so that it could expand its fleet into the future and secure funds for the airline in that way.</P>
    <P>There are arguments on both sides of this question and, no doubt, those will be expressed in the House. There are arguments to the effect that Aer Lingus is a strategic company&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Strategic for the Minister, perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that, as such, it is best in State ownership. I understand that point of view. There is also the view which the company put to me, as I have just mentioned, that, into the future, it is best to have access to the marketplace. It is also worth noting the EU situation in this regard, in that, in good times, all is well and, in bad times, it is not possible for the State, in future, to invest funds in an airline because of EU Commission state aid regulations. Accordingly, whatever decision may be taken &ndash; I wish to emphasise again that no decision has been taken &ndash; must be for the benefit of the airline and for no other reason. It is what is good for Aer Lingus that counts and it is on that basis we should study the future options for the airline, casting our minds forward, perhaps, five or ten years to consider what type of Aer Lingus we will have at that time.</P>
      <P>For all those reasons &ndash; and, again, I stress that no decision has been taken to dispose of Aer Lingus &ndash; I will take the report I have from the company and my own views to Cabinet. At that stage, we will discuss the matter, taking on board points arising from this debate and the state of the global airline industry with a view to reaching a conclusion which will secure the future of Aer Lingus and allow it to grow its staff numbers into the future. I commend the Aer Lingus Bill 2003 to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;prior to the publication of a White Paper on the privatisation of Aer Lingus, Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise some issues on this Bill. First, I wish to make a particular point. When the original legislation was published and debated in the House, that took place under completely different circumstances than are now applicable. As the Minister stated, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy in late 2001. Faced with that crisis, the Government looked at the issue of privatisation of the company. Now, however, the company's situation has been completely turned around. In the first half of 2003, Aer Lingus has shown a profit and its costs have decreased by over 14%. The company is continuing to drive down costs and the resulting savings are being passed on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, this was despite <Col N="246" /> the effects of the war in Iraq, the detrimental effects of 9/11 and a decreased perception of public confidence with regard to travel, particularly air travel. However, in this very difficult financial background, Aer Lingus has actually turned its position around. Its staff and chief executive must be given credit for that.</P>
    <P>There is now a very lean operation, unlike the situation when the original legislation was published. Throughout Europe, state airlines had operated on a monopoly basis for far too long. That is the reason many of them, such as Sabena, went to the wall. The cost of a flight from Dublin to either London or France, for example, was both exorbitant and unreal. One state company, Aer Lingus, had moved from being one of the first monopolies in this country to facing the full blast of competition. In 1986, my late colleague and then Minister for Communications, Jim Mitchell, authorised Ryanair to compete with the national airline. As a result, we now have two efficient airline companies.</P>
    <P>Although Aer Lingus almost failed to survive the effect of competition, it has now emerged as an efficient, State-owned company. This is due, in no small part, to the current management team and staff of the company. Clearly, Government policy and other semi-State companies should follow that example. The recently reported financial results from Aer Lingus confirm that the airline has transformed itself into a profitable enterprise. The chief executive, Mr. Willy Walsh, the management and staff have made great strides in reducing the cost base and increasing revenues through the adoption of their low fares strategy.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is now on track to make profits of between &euro;75 million to &euro;80 million this year, against the difficult environment for air travel, which was depressed by the war in Iraq and the impact of the SARS virus. There is still further scope for Aer Lingus to cut costs across its operations. For example, it is aiming for a sharp increase in the proportion of bookings made over the Internet. If successful, that could reduce its cost base by a further &euro;40 million. Clearly, the background and current status of the company have changed dramatically and that is a very positive development.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 7 of the Bill regarding the employees' shareholding. It is true that the employees have played a critical part in turning the company around and, undoubtedly, recognition should be given for that. I note the Minister's statement that the implementation of the ESOP is subject to verification by the chief executive of Aer Lingus that the relevant elements of the survival plan have been implemented. It is critical that that is tied into the legislation. I am glad the Minister commented on the industrial action which is currently taking place. In the past, there have been concerns that a great deal of the industrial action which took place has been to the detriment of the company. I hope the situation can be resolved through the LRC so that we can ensure the continuation of a <Col N="247" /> lean operation, with a good relationship between staff and management of the company.</P>
    <P>In my view, section 5 is the critical element of the Bill, which provides for the privatisation of Aer Lingus and gives the green light to Government to seek a purchaser for the national airline. With regard to the future control of Aer Lingus, we must think strategically and identify any potential future problems. In the past, there may have been merit in the sale of Aer Lingus on the grounds that the company was inefficient and constituted a burden on the State. Now that the company is competing successfully in an open market, we must ask why privatisation is being considered. This may be viewed in the future as a short-sighted decision that could threaten our national interests. The Minister deals with this major element of the legislation in four sentences in his script without outlining any business-based case. He said we should consider this legislation with the best interests of Aer Lingus in mind &ndash; we should consider it with the best interests of the State in mind.</P>
    <P>Due to Government reform over the years, competition and deregulation within the industry are not problems, but our future access to Britain and other destinations could be threatened under such a proposal, particularly in light of the Minister's view on it. I have yet to be convinced that this is the way forward so I want to hear the Minister's strategic plan for the company. The likely purchaser of Aer Lingus is British Airways, which could make more money by re-allocating Aer Lingus's valuable slots at Heathrow Airport to its long haul services out of London at the expense of the crucially important access to and from our country via London's principle airport. These slots are a strategic national asset, not just an asset to the company, which have been built up with taxpayers' money over a long period of time. Any decision on the sale of such an asset must be made by this House on behalf of the taxpayer and not solely by the social partners. This is a potential cash cow and should not be used by this Government to fatten its pre-election coffers to buy another election victory. Ireland is dependent to an almost unique degree on air services for access to and from the rest of the world and, from a purely economic point of view, it is vital that these slots are retained to ensure we have key links to Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>We do not want to repeat the mistake of Eircom, where the company was sold off for short-term gain and not in the strategic interests of the State. Eircom now has no interest in developing its network, the company is only interested in the cash generated by its assets. It cannot be blamed for this, as it is the objective of its shareholders. However, it is not in the national interest to have public policy which runs contrary to that of the private company. In light of what happened with Eircom, no one should be taken in by the assurances on issues of national concern that may be sought and given at the time of privatisation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> The Government justifies the sale of the company by suggesting that EU law prevents it from investing in the future growth of the national carrier and that it is only through privatisation that Aer Lingus can grow. This is false and misleading. While the Government is not permitted to subsidise losses by Aer Lingus, the company is no longer loss making. It is important to clarify this myth about the EU ban on State investment in Aer Lingus and other competitive State enterprises. The Government's plan to sell off Aer Lingus has nothing to do with the European Union. Speaking in Dublin recently, the EU Commissioner for Competition made it clear that the Government, as the shareholder in the airline, retains the right to make genuine investments in Aer Lingus that are needed to secure its continued expansion. The question for Government is whether it is prepared in the future to provide such investment and secure the slots which are in Ireland's economic interests.</P>
    <P>We must tread carefully and not dispose of Aer Lingus for short-term gains. The privatisation of Eircom is a salutary warning. It was badly managed because it was undertaken for the wrong reasons &ndash; partly ideological and partly to maximise the amount of money the Government would receive. The Government's attitude to public sector companies is being distorted because its only interest is in relieving the pressure caused by public sector borrowing through selling off State assets. This would be a lucrative way to achieve that objective. The question of whether a particular service to the public should be provided by the State or private enterprise should be decided on a case-by-case basis where the merits of each case, not the self-serving interests of the Government, are clearly evaluated. The Government must clearly set out the conditions under which the company should be sold and the policy objectives it will achieve by such a sell off.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister said we have a bit of this, that and the other, but we do not know what he is talking about. There is a report on his desk from the chief executive of Aer Lingus but we do not know what is in it. We do not know what proposals the Minister will put to Cabinet yet he expects us to adopt this legislation without any indication of his intentions. Will there be a partial sale? Are we putting mechanisms in place to ensure we can secure the slots in Heathrow Airport which are a critical national asset? We do not know what his plans are but he expects us to rubber stamp this Bill. We need a strategic view set out in a White Paper that states the terms of any sale or partial sale of the company. This has not been set out so far and four sentences in a speech did not throw any further light on the matter.</P>
    <P>It would, therefore, be irresponsible for Members to pass this Bill without any detail on the circumstances surrounding the sale when this matter will not come before the House again prior to its ratification. I await the Minister's <Col N="249" /> response on this because it is pointless talking about the legislation unless he elaborates on his plans. The Opposition is not prepared to rubber stamp something without knowing what it is and it is in that context that I have tabled amendment No. 2. The Minister should set out his plans when he responds at the end of this debate and a White Paper should be published to state the conditions under which certain measures will take place. That is imperative if we are to ensure that the sale of Aer Lingus is not the same as the sale of Eircom.</P>
    <P>Everyone would agree that a bad decision was made in respect of Eircom. I was in favour of that sale at the time but I admit my mistake. Eircom cut back on investment in infrastructure throughout the State after the sale. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources now has to invest in it because there is no private capital available. There are road hazards because Eircom refuses to remove telephone poles that are virtually in the middle of the road. The sale of Eircom did not serve this State, we went from a public monopoly to a private duopoly. I want, therefore, to see how the sale of Aer Lingus would serve the consumer and the State and not just the company itself, which seems to be the Minister's sole interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Aer Lingus's policy. It is currently examining its entire fleet with a proposal to operate a single make of aircraft as a further cost-saving measure. The company has opted for Airbus to modernise its short haul fleet by acquiring 17 A320 aircraft. I have a basic question to ask the Minister in relation to this policy. What happens if a flaw comes to light in the Airbus A320 fleet? Should Aer Lingus convert its entire fleet to the A320, the discovery of a flaw would leave the airline grounded until that flaw was addressed. Was this risk evaluated prior to the presentation of the proposal to the Minister and the board of the company? What protection is in place to ensure that the company would still fly if a flaw were found in the context of a single type fleet operation? This is a genuine and practical concern. In the past we have seen particular Airbus and Boeing models grounded after air incidents. Especially in the immediate aftermath of an air accident, it is standard practice to ground other aircraft of the relevant type which are flying throughout the world. If there is a serious disaster involving an aircraft of the A320 fleet, our entire short haul fleet will have to be grounded.</P>
    <P>As I am not an aviation expert, perhaps the Minister will look into the following matter for me. I am told that it is substantially more expensive to run the Airbus fleet than it is to run the Boeing fleet despite the fact that the A320s contain an extra row of seats. As that should be a consideration for a low cost airline, the Minister should examine the matter in the context of his review. This concern must be balanced against the cost savings involved.</P>
    <P>When the contract with Airbus was negotiated, <Col N="250" /> was any consideration given to an offset obligation? When the purchase of 64 aircraft was agreed between the Finnish state and McDonald Douglas in 1992, an offset obligation was tied into the contract. Over a 13 year period the company agreed to invest US$3 billion and to date Finland has received over US$2 billion of that sum in economic benefit well in advance of the return payments for the aircraft which it has purchased. This has created additional investment and jobs in the country. Offset programmes can significantly contribute to a country's industrial and economic base. The Finnish government seems to be a leader in this field with about 170 Finnish companies currently participating in more than 400 projects. In light of our current difficulties in obtaining private funding for public private partnerships and other measures, we should consider this success. A flight by the Minister or some of his officials to Finland to examine the manner in which they are operating these programmes would be very worthwhile. Whether money comes from State or semi-State funding, there should be some form of offset obligation to allow us to get at least some of that money back to benefit the economy generally.</P>
    <P>State airports are critical to the development of Aer Lingus and the chief executive of the company has made a number of comments in this regard. Independent airports at Cork, Dublin and Shannon represent great potential for Aer Lingus to compete for new air traffic. They could also facilitate the involvement of local commercial interests in the development of airport services. There is an opportunity in this to begin to develop a regional policy. It is the contention of those opposed to the break up of Aer Rianta that the airports at Shannon and Cork are inherently loss making, surviving only on cross subsidisation from Dublin. International studies, however, suggest that airports with passenger volumes of 2 million are viable and have the critical mass to make the provision of ancillary retail and franchising services attractive. Shannon and Cork cater for such passenger volumes. While all three airports are commercially viable within their current passenger numbers, they have the potential to increase volumes.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that publicly owned airports primarily constitute strategic infrastructure which serves local economic development. Their purpose is not to create State assets. These airports can become the engines which drive the implementation of a policy of regional development. While there are risks associated with such a policy, there are also major benefits which is why we want to see the Minister's plans for the airports and their boards. We await, however, any detail in respect of his proposals. If properly structured, a regional policy should tip the scales in favour of the air traveller and the consumer. It is imperative that the Minister publishes the new business plans for each of the three airports. The Minister has had discussions with the trade unions in Aer Rianta in relation to threatened <Col N="251" /> industrial action over the break up of the company and their demand for an independent chairman. If, as it should, the Minister's argument stands up, I do not see why an independent chairman cannot be appointed to facilitate talks. I ask the Minister to review the matter, to put the details of his proposals on the table and to make a clear and concise argument as to why he believes the airports at Shannon, Cork and Dublin can stand on their own feet.</P>
    <P>What will be the mandate and criteria of the airports in the future? Are they to be profitable and must they pay a dividend to the State? What business direction will be given by the Government? I presume the airports will have to break even. There is a need for high capital expenditure at our airports. The airports at Dublin and Cork have major development plans, but the latter will require additional investment to expand its services. Shannon Airport requires major investment to re-lay its 50 year old runways. Will the Government guarantee any loans airport boards require? Under the current Act, Aer Rianta is provided with an upper limit to the level of borrowing it can incur thus giving the company a guarantee should it approach a financial institution to obtain a loan. Will the new boards be provided with this facility? There are ongoing requirements for capital investments to maintain existing facilities and to upgrade emergency, safety and security provisions. It is envisaged, based on international comparisons, that simply to cater for existing traffic and passenger numbers Dublin Airport will be required to spend approximately &euro;100 million per annum while Cork and Shannon will be required to spend &euro;50 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister presented his plans on the proposed break up of Aer Rianta to the European Commission? If so, has he received a response regarding compliance with EU state aid and competition rules in the context of the proposed transfer of debt from Shannon and Cork to Dublin Airport? I demand that the Government furnishes the Commission with these details without further delay and that it publishes its proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister must look at the bigger picture when in the next week or two he appoints members to the new airport boards. He must discontinue the standard practice of appointing people on the basis of party political affiliation rather than suitability for the post. We must look outside the box to adopt a fresh and creative approach to the appointments of the new airport authorities. For far too long appointments to State boards have constituted political sinecures. In light of the significant reforms at the State airports, the Minister must look to international expertise as well as to home grown individuals when making these appointments. It has been the practice in this State for far too long to examine the party political affiliation of a particular individual. I could not care less what the party affili<Col N="252" /> ation of any board member is once he or she has the competence and ability to ensure that the new companies are run effectively. I urge the Minister to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>I hope, at a minimum, that at least one member of each board is an international expert as it is critically important that they have the opportunity to adopt a completely new perspective on the development of our airports. While some of those already mentioned are highly successful in their own business ventures, it is time to take a leaf out of the Competition Authority's book and consider the inclusion of international experts in the appointment process. If we are to see our State airports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon, continue to develop on a strong commercial footing, it is imperative that the best expertise is made available to those boards.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, my colleagues, Deputies Enda Kenny and Pat Breen, met the European Commissioner for transport in Brussels where they discussed the implications of the open skies policy and the proposed break-up of Aer Rianta. During the meeting the Commissioner confirmed that the Commission recognised the importance of Shannon Airport for the development of the mid-west region. She also confirmed that the Commission would consider any proposal for special arrangements for Shannon, provided they were transparent and non-discriminatory.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Transport to bring forward his proposals on the future of Shannon so that they can be considered in the context of the negotiations on the open skies agreement, which has just commenced. It is imperative that the Minister should outline his position in respect of the proposals on the open skies policy to allow it be debated in this House. We can either agree or disagree with them but at least we will know the Government's position on the issue.</P>
    <P>On section 9, will retired Aer Lingus aviation staff be covered in the context of this legislation? I understand their pensions have fallen by 25% behind their public service counterparts over the past ten years. We are talking about 4,500 people, between Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, who had similar pension rights up to 1969 until a directive issued from the Department of Finance which was implemented by both Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta but not by other semi-State companies such as the ESB, Bord Fáilte and An Post. As a result of that, the aviation companies made a contribution of only 6.375% to the pension fund. That has remained static. It means that an aviation worker who retired on a pension of £5,000 or &euro;6,350 per annum ten years ago has had that pension increased to &euro;8,000. If it was linked to the wage movements within the public service, it would now be worth &euro;10,060.</P>
    <P>The retired aviation staff are seeking a capital injection and that should be considered in the context of this legislation. Over many years those people built up Aer Lingus as a State asset. The point can be argued on the efficiency of the com<Col N="253" /> pany over the years but the fact remains that we had some of the most valuable slots available at Heathrow Airport. As I said in the context of the debate on privatisation, these staff were involved in building up that asset over many years and I ask the Minister to consider addressing some of the concerns of these employees in the context of Committee Stage. They were raised in the context of the previous legislation but very little was done at that time. Now that we have the opportunity and I ask the Minister to address them when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>Will he outline clearly his plans for the sale of part or all of Aer Lingus and the conditions under which that will be done? He should at least give us an opportunity to make a decision on what he is talking about rather than telling us in four sentences that he is considering this or that. We want to know what the Minister is talking about before we can agree this legislation.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party has tabled an amendment which states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting that while the Aer Lingus Bill 2003 has been presented as a vehicle to give effect to the welcome Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP);</P>
      <P>&ndash;believing, however, that the primary purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the privatisation of Aer Lingus, a move for which no convincing case has been made; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious of the national airline's importance to Ireland as an island nation and a valuable tourist destination;</P>
      <P>declines to give a second reading to the Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> The Labour Party believes that while this Bill has been presented by Government as a means of giving legal effect to the agreed ESOP, it is clear that the primary purpose of the legislation is to give a <i>carte blanche</i> to the Ministers for Finance and Transport to do whatever they like with the Aer Lingus company without reference to this House or anybody else.</P>
    <P>I strongly object to the outrageously dishonest manner in which this Bill has been presented and portrayed. It was flagged as a Bill merely to give effect to the ESOP. The Minister devoted 95% of his contribution earlier to the ESOP and the sacrifices that had been made by staff in Aer Lingus. We all agree with that, and a remarkable turnaround has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister gives a mere nine lines in his speech to what is, essentially, the main purpose of the Bill, that is, to get a free hand to do with Aer Lingus whatever he wishes without having any debate on it. This is the Minister, Deputy Brennan, up to his old tricks again, saying one thing but intending to do another. He does not even pay this House the courtesy of coming in here and being honest about his intentions. He went on with the rigmarole about the great work done by the workers in Aer Lingus. Nobody is denying that. He went on about the ESOP, which should have been dealt with long ago. At no stage did he go into any detail about his real intentions in regard to the Bill. He has used the ESOP as a cloak to cover his intentions to sell off Aer Lingus as quickly as possible and with as little public debate as possible. It is extremely disrespectful to this House to treat it in this manner and it is a dishonest way of doing Government business.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that the purpose of the Bill is to allow for the privatisation of Aer Lingus, most likely by way of a trade sale and probably to a buyer who is waiting in the wings. The Minister referred in passing to bringing proposals to Cabinet next week or shortly. I am sure he knows the name or names of the people at this stage and he should have the guts to tell us what he has in mind for the company. He should tell us who the predators are who want to get a share of it. What is their view of the board members, the directors and management? He should allow a decent debate on the future of the national airline and not come in here in this sneaky way and try to slip in major changes which will give him major powers by the back door route by suggesting that this Bill is only about the ESOP. He should be honest about it and be prepared to have a full and frank debate on what he is really trying to do. The Government is attempting to take on this power to itself despite the fact that no case has been made for the sale of a critical State asset which has performed remarkably well in recent years.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has made a truly remarkable recovery from the problems that beset it and other international airlines in the 1990s and in the early 2000s with 11 September, foot and mouth disease and other difficulties. The company is now in a <Col N="255" /> very healthy position and is expecting profits of somewhere in the region of &euro;75 million by the end of this year. The company, as we know, has plans to purchase additional aircraft to provide additional services and meet the demand there. It has said it is not looking for a handout for that. It is in a position to provide those aircraft from its own resources, so the situation is looking extremely healthy for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>All of this is thanks, in the main, to the hard work of the management and the employees of the company over recent years. Workers have made enormous sacrifices to assist the company's recovery. Staff numbers have been cut, productivity has increased and pay increases were deferred. In return for these sacrifices, agreement was reached on an ESOP. This agreement was central to the success of the survival plan for the company. That plan was delivered by staff and management and it is only right that the company side of the deal should be honoured in full. The Labour Party fully supports the sections of this Bill dealing with the ESOP.</P>
    <P>This legislation providing for the ESOP is long overdue and should have been prepared long before now. It was straightforward legislation, as the Minister well knows, which could have been dealt with in three or four pages. We should have had this legislation at least two years ago. Negotiations should have been completed but the Minister's Department dragged its heels for obvious reasons, as we now know. A Bill should have been brought forward as standalone legislation to deal with the ESOP and get it out of the way but it is now clear that the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet saw an opportunity with the legislation for the ESOP to use it as a cloak for their real intentions regarding Aer Lingus. On the list of legislation circulated over the past couple of sessions, the explanation of the Aer Lingus Bill is to provide a legal basis for the ESOP. There is no mention of providing a legal basis for the Cabinet to flog-off Aer Lingus. Again, this is no more than we expect from the current Administration and the current incumbent in the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>It is now patently clear that the real purpose of the Aer Lingus Bill 2003 is contained in sections 3 and 5. These sections will allow the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport to sell off the airline, our national airline, in whatever way they want, to whoever they choose and on whatever basis they decide, without any further reference to this House. This is being attempted under the cover of the ESOP and it is a shameful way for the Minister to deal with important matters of public policy.</P>
    <P>In a further attempt to deceive, the briefing note attached to this Bill states that it mirrors the Aer Lingus Bill 2000 which was passed by the Seanad but was subsequently abandoned. The clear function of that Bill was to provide for an initial public offering but that is not what is being provided for in this legislation which is an entirely <Col N="256" /> new Bill. I fully subscribe to the proposal made this morning by Deputy Kenny and supported by my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, that we need a White Paper on the future of our national airline. We do not want any strokes or back door approaches to this &ndash; we want a full public debate on what is in the best interest of our national carrier. No convincing case has been made to date for the privatisation of Aer Lingus and there is a very strong case for retaining it in public ownership.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is of crucial economic and strategic national importance to this country as an island nation. We are heavily dependent on the tourism industry. Ireland is the only current member of the EU without a land link to the European mainland. There has been no debate on the strategic importance of the national carrier and the critical issues facing the company in the future.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues we need to debate are as follows. What are the company's capital needs in the coming years? How can these best be met? Is there a case for a strategic partner and on what terms should that partner be sought? What are the implications of an IPO? It was interesting to note in the media this morning that management sources in the company have suggested that an IPO might now be the way to go. What are the arguments for and against the State retaining a golden shareholding? Where does Aer Lingus fit into our national spatial strategy? Does the Minister remember that? Does he see himself having any role in it? Does he see transport policy have a role in that? Will he make any changes to transport policy on foot of the spatial strategy? Does he see himself having any responsibility to put in place the kind of critical transport links and infrastructure required if we want to achieve some kind of balanced regional development?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister going to continue to sit on the sidelines, take a hands-off approach to all of this and leave it to the market to decide? The Minister should at least be honest and tell us what his intention is. He should not pretend he has the remotest interest in balanced regional development and delivering on the spatial strategy when all of his actions indicate he has no interest in them and has more interest in flogging-off anything he can within the responsibility of his Department.</P>
    <P>What role should Aer Lingus have in the context of a national transport policy? Of course, we do not have a national transport policy. The Minister hints at this and at that, issues press statements to beat the band and flitters from one issue to another, but there is no overall framework, policy or vision about transport. If there is a policy vacuum, how can we talk about the future of Aer Lingus and the role it should play in the context of transport policy? All of these questions need open public debate but that debate is being denied. The Minister is denying the Dáil and the public the opportunity to debate these issues and to come to conclusions based on objective facts. The Minister is expecting Members of the Dáil to <Col N="257" /> buy a pig in a poke regarding this legislation. He is looking for us to give him power to do what he likes with Aer Lingus. We are not prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus is sold off, even to Irish owners, there is no way to guarantee that it will not be sold on to other owners who would have no loyalty to this country and no commitment to maintaining routes of strategic value. We desperately need to have a calm and reasoned debate on what should happen to Aer Lingus, on what is in the best interest of airline passengers, primarily, of the tourism industry and of the Irish airline industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking us in this Bill to give him a free hand to do whatever he wishes. He is asking us to trust him. I assure him that, based on his record to date and that of his Cabinet colleagues, the Labour Party will not trust this Government on anything. It is entirely inappropriate and, indeed, underhand to bring in major changes which could potentially do serious damage to Aer Lingus by a sneaky back door route.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 of the Bill are wide-ranging and it is clear now that it would be crazy for this House to agree to such provisions. They are essentially saying that the Minister for Finance, in consultation with his colleague the Minister for Transport, can sell off any or all of the State share in Aer Lingus. One can only think of the pressures on the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy over the next few months coming up to budget time.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of the growth in the economy over the last few years and the resources available to tackle problems, and then one considers how these resources were frittered away by the Government, there was serious mismanagement of the economy, particularly by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, assisted by his Cabinet colleagues. The economy was in tip-top shape when it was taken over by the Government in 1997 and now it is in serious difficulties. When we think of these factors, we can imagine the pressures on the Minister for Finance. He sees he can flog off Aer Lingus to raise &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million. Selling the family silver to help him in his desperate attempts to balance the books. I am not prepared to trust the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, or the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to do what is in the best interest of the national airline industry and those who depending on it.</P>
    <P>What about the rights of the taxpayer? It was the taxpayer who invested the £175 million in the company in the early 1990s at a time when it was in serious difficulty. It was the taxpayer, through that contribution, who ensured that the national airline survived as a public company. That investment was put to good use as Aer Lingus has now returned to profitability. Is the value of that investment now to be flogged off at the whim of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, or the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan?</P>
    <P>Both Ministers are ideologically hostile to the <Col N="258" /> very notion of public service. It has been the ambition of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party to sell off Aer Lingus for some time. Plans by the previous Administration to sell off the company had to be abandoned as a result of the crisis faced by the international airline industry in 2001 and following the major fiasco of the Eircom sell-off. They are now clearly determined to push this through again in an obvious trade sale. This is not in the interest of the economy or our tourism industry. This is also a grave act of deception, pretending that we are talking about the ESOP when, in reality, we are flogging off a major State asset. This Bill is asking for <i>carte blanche</i> to be given to the Ministers for Finance and Transport to do whatever they wish with our national airline. There is no case for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport has put forward no proposals. He has said that he will be examining the situation, the report from the chairman of the company and giving careful consideration to it. His general response to problem issues within his Department is to &ldquo;look at it&rdquo;, whatever that means. He says in his speech, &ldquo;I am currently giving careful consideration to the report and I will be bringing the Aer Lingus views, together with my own position, to Cabinet in the coming weeks.&rdquo; The Minister owes us the courtesy of outlining his own position to the House. He has come to the House asking for the power to do whatever he likes with Aer Lingus, without the House knowing anything about his intentions. What about spending some time outlining his position? If he is not prepared to do that, then under no circumstances are we prepared to trust him and support this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supports the proposals on the legal effect of the ESOP which was agreed with staff. However, we will strongly oppose this rash and unjustified move to sell off Aer Lingus. To that end we have tabled this amendment and we oppose the taking of this Bill at the end of Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>While Sinn Féin will be opposing this legislation we are not doing so because we disagree with workers owning 14.9% of the company. If that was the only purpose of this legislation, we would be delighted to support it, though disappointed that the Government saw fit to reward the sacrifices and hard work of Aer Lingus employees with a relatively small share of the company they have done so much over the years to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably, however, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has put two separate and distinct issues in the same piece of legislation. One is the ESOP agreed by the Government and the Aer Lingus group of unions and dealt with in section 7 of the Bill. The other is what can only be described as the Government's enabling blueprint for achieving its long held objective of privatising our national airline. As much as I support the ESOP deal, we must reject the Bill as it cur<Col N="259" /> rently stands and support the amendment put by Deputy Shortall.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin remains adamantly opposed to the privatisation of Aer Lingus. This company has been built up over decades to become one of the cornerstones of the Irish economy, earning international respect for itself and for Ireland. It was founded at a time when the private sector did not have the will, the capacity or the courage to build such a vital strategic infrastructure. It was built up in difficult times and, when it prospered, it repaid the investment. It is an Irish company and should remain so.</P>
    <P>For the last few years, Aer Lingus has been under sustained attack by the kind of negative thinking that now sadly seems to dominate the Government. This drive for privatisation is not motivated by concern for the workers or customers of Aer Lingus. It is another example of the blinkered viewpoint that wants to break up CIE and Aer Rianta and part-privatise Dublin Bus. Opposition to public ownership of any kind now seems to be a core principle of this Government, regardless of the economic and social consequences of such actions.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago, economic commentators were circling Aer Lingus like vultures, predicting its imminent demise in the aftermath of the foot and mouth crisis and the events of 11 September 2001. Their only real concern was whether the Government would be able to get a good price for it, particularly if the company was sold at rock bottom, fire sale levels. We were told its collapse was inevitable and it had to be sold.</P>
    <P>Those economic gurus did not worry about the thousands of Aer Lingus workers who stood to lose their jobs, the consequent loss of revenue in our airports or with the implications for other airport employees and the wider community in the hinterland of these airports. Like this Government, they were concerned only with profit and what could be made out of the airline.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus rubbished their predictions and turned the company around. In 2001, it made a loss of &euro;139.9 million. A year later it turned around a profit of &euro;35.3 million. Not only has Aer Lingus survived, it is thriving, set to acquire 17 new planes for short haul routes, seven of which will be purchased outright at a cost of &euro;300 million. This will mean, if the deal is approved, 15 new routes by summer 2005, bringing to 30 the number of new routes opened since the end of 2001. Recent results for the first half of 2003 point to an operating profit of &euro;14.3 million for the first six months against an operating loss of &euro;12.6 million in the same period last year. Passenger numbers are also up since 2001. How do the stereotypes of lazy, inefficient public sector workers propagated by right-wing elements in the media and Government match the reality of successful companies like Aer Lingus? This profit and growth came about through new approaches, new ideas, hard work and sacrifice.</P>
    <P>The employee share option plan is intended as <Col N="260" /> the Government's reward for the accomplishments of the men and women employed by Aer Lingus. It is little enough reward for their achievements. Costs have been cut by 20% &ndash; a couple of thousand workers are gone. Difficult choices were taken which involved greater flexibility, productivity and hard work. It is a pity the Government could not bring itself to properly recognise this.</P>
    <P>There is a clear danger that if this legislation is passed the Government will use it to further its privatisation agenda. This could mean the break-up of a successful company, the loss of thousands of jobs and the destruction of a strategic pillar of the Irish economy. Instead of being a gateway to Europe and a bridge to North America this country could become a backwater in aviation terms. This must not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 5 of the Bill give the Minister for Finance the power to dispose of his or her shares at any time, to sell the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus. It is clear that the money received in respect of any such sale will be paid into and disposed of by the Exchequer. How can we trust the Government to spend it properly?</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Brennan, told Cabinet he has no plans to sell the company in the immediate short-term during the aviation downturn, but the Bill leaves the way open for the likely sale in the future, and has been deliberately crafted to do so. The Government remains committed to selling off this company without regard for the disastrous long-term implications of the sale of a strategic national asset. It is nothing more than an act of ideological vandalism. What kind of short-sighted thinking argues that Aer Lingus, and the Irish people to whom it belongs, would be better served if the company passed into the hands of private enterprise whose aim is profit and cost-cutting rather than the development of the country?</P>
    <P>We have witnessed this with Irish Shipping and Eircom. This threat also faces the ESB where a lack of investment in the development of infrastructure may, inevitably, lead to the selling off of another vital national resource. Aer Lingus must stay in public ownership.</P>
    <P>We need only look to the Eircom debacle to see the effects of ideological privatisation. In 2003 the company made a profit of &euro;357 million and paid Valentia over &euro;500 million in dividends. At the same time, we are crying out for investment in broadband access. Belgium has over 48 times the broadband penetration of this State. According to the World Economic Forum, we are 51st out of 82 countries in terms of broadband access, behind the economic powerhouses of Guatemala and Botswana. Rather than have a State-owned telecommunications company investing in broadband and the telecommunications industry, Eircom is paying hundreds of millions of euro in profit to Valentia. The Government made a big mistake then and it seems set on making a similar mistake with Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It is a dangerous precedent for the State to lose <Col N="261" /> control over key elements of its infrastructure such as transport and telecommunications, particularly to foreign companies whose only concern is their balance sheet rather than this country's national interest. These are dangerous times and there are few Ministers who will take actions more dangerous to the infrastructure of the State than the Minister for Transport with his daft plan to break up Aer Rianta, privatise parts of the public transport system and break up CIE.</P>
    <P>Currently trade agreements between the US and the State protect Aer Lingus from being majority owned by a foreign airline. If this legislation is passed, however, the Minister could sell 49% of the company to any airline or investor looking for a quick profit. Such investors will take a short-term view, aiming for the biggest profit in the shortest space of time. Are these the people the Minister thinks should be running our national airline? What if we sell it to another airline and that airline should encounter difficulties? It would run down Aer Lingus and any other subsidiary companies rather than its own core services and routes. In such circumstances we could see our national carrier reduced to the level of a feeder service while London or some other city would become the hub of international transatlantic flights for Irish people. In short, Aer Lingus would be run in the interests of a foreign company and not in the interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>What difference would it make if the company remained in the hands of Irish investors? It would be likely that a cabal of Irish tax exiles of the sort who always take an interest in such privatisation schemes would snap up Aer Lingus. The company should not be privatised. It does not require third party involvement. Consequently, we oppose the Bill and support the Labour Party amendment.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister has been joined by two of his colleagues, Deputies Glennon and Killeen &ndash; two wings on the backbenches to add to the ministerial launch of the Bill. What we need, and what I hope we will have today, is a debate on whether we should privatise Aer Lingus. I do not expect anyone will argue against the ESOP deal. I would be interested to hear anyone who would put an argument against the 15% reward. The question is whether Aer Lingus should be privatised. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputy Glennon and every other Government backbencher on this issue, if they have not already <Col N="262" /> departed the House at this late stage on Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall accused the Minister of dishonesty, duplicity and not being up front. In his speech the Minister said that Government policy envisages giving 14.9% in certain circumstances, such as when the State is exiting from the company. I welcome this proposal. In his response, will the Minister indicate if there are other circumstances where we would give 14.9%? If there is not, we are clearly in the business of selling the State airline.</P>
      <P>It is correct that, in a sense, we are paying for the savings which the staff have foregone in recent times. It is regrettable that share ownership is not proposed as a positive contribution because we believe in the contribution of worker directors and the role workers have to play in the strategic development of a company. Apart from that, I do not expect anyone in the House to question the provisions in the Bill regarding the increased share ownership for the staff.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the role of Aer Lingus in terms of making a significant and valuable contribution to the economic and tourism development of the country by providing a range of quality services. He then said that to ensure that role continues he believes we must be open to examining all options crucial to its ongoing success and for this reason he is introducing legislation to allow him to sell the company. Will the sale of the company to the private sector continue the role referred to by the Minister? He does not back up his assertion that to maintain that role we need to sell Aer Lingus. I am keen to hear the evidence as to why he thinks the private sector would be better at providing for the economic development of the country than the public sector has been.</P>
      <P>This company has been an example of the remarkable success of public enterprise. The staff we are in the process of rewarding and complimenting have been working in a company which has been under public ownership for the past two years, a period in which, in the words of the Minister, it has been one of the most successful airlines on the planet. That would seem to counter the argument he makes for the sale of the company. I do not understand why he feels that public enterprise cannot deliver this good strategic development and the economic, social and tourism benefits that Aer Lingus has been providing in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he has a report from the company advocating closure. That is not unusual in that it seems inevitable that management would wish to see itself freed of the shackles of some of the State intervention from Governments and boards. We should take such a recommendation with the proviso that the private sector is always seen as a more attractive option by management. The Minister made the following crucial statement in his opening speech, &ldquo;We make the decision on what is best for Aer Lingus.&rdquo; I argue that any Minister in any Govern<Col N="263" /> ment should always base his or her decisions on what is in the best interests of the State. That is a Minister's job, not deciding what is in the best interests of a corporate entity which can vary dramatically, depending on circumstances. Surely the role of the Minister and of the Government is to decide what is in the best interests of the State.</P>
    <P>The Green Party strongly contends that as regards Aer Lingus, the best interests of the State is to keep it in public ownership. We are an island nation which is cut off from the rest of Europe and there is a significant strategic interest in Ireland having a good air transport connection to the rest of Europe and North America. It is ultimately better for the State to have some say and some control over that transport connection. The Minister should take into account the interests of the State and not just the interests of a corporate entity such as Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he is giving careful consideration to the report and he intends to bring the issue to Cabinet and express his personal position in the coming weeks. I have heard the Minister state a number of times over the past year that something will happen in the coming weeks. I now tend to regard his references to &ldquo;coming weeks&rdquo; as meaning it will happen in the coming months or even years. I would like to know when exactly the Minister will present the report to Cabinet. If it is to go to Cabinet in the next couple of weeks the Minister should make the report available to the House so that all Members can debate on an equal footing some of the arguments being advanced by the company. It is a very significant strategic decision for the State and it is only right that this House has access to the same information as the Minister in formulating his decision.</P>
    <P>If I was a backbencher in the Minister's party, I would be scrambling to obtain a copy of the report. If I represented a constituency where there was a significant number of Aer Lingus workers I would want to read that report to find out how it would affect my constituents and the airline's customers. The Minister should make the report available prior to the end of this debate so that the House can have an informed debate on the sale of the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also inform this House of his position on this issue during the course of this debate so that we are aware of his stance. The Cabinet may take a different view but I do not believe that if the Minister is presenting this report to Cabinet within the coming weeks, he does not have a personal view on the possible sale of the company. It is unfortunate that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity in this debate to say what he believes is the right course of action, whether his Cabinet colleagues agree with his view or not. I agree with Deputy Shortall that if the Minister for Finance was asked his opinion he would say it should be sold tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The most interesting part of this debate will be <Col N="264" /> listening to the soldiers of destiny sitting behind the Minister. The Fianna Fáil Party has an honourable record. Historically there were members of the party whose faith in public enterprise was of benefit to the State. They were people who did not seek private profit or gain but who believed that this was a country where we could work together and provide for our future, and that this could be organised by means of public enterprise. I do not regard that as an old-fashioned or out-of-date virtue. When one sees the stock market scandals and the mistakes made by companies that chase short-term stock market gains rather than long-term strategic interests, I believe the concept of public enterprise achieving good strategic development is the right way forward.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a point about the aviation business and the environment. In the last two years the company has been very successful in developing a low fares policy. In terms of the strategic development of airlines we must be aware that a low fares policy will not always be possible given the cost to the environment as a result of the aviation business and jet travel in particular. There will be significant changes in the aviation business and there are environmental implications as a result of the pollution caused by the industry. The business strategy that works today may not necessarily be the best business strategy tomorrow. I suggest that Aer Lingus management and anyone involved in the aviation business should be aware of the significant environmental implications around the corner. I suggest they read the UK royal commission survey on the environmental effects of aviation.</P>
    <P>The issue is whether or not the company should be sold. I look forward to listening to the speeches by Government backbenchers to hear how they would advise the Minister. I wish the Minister was straight in giving the House his own view on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>From its modest beginnings in 1936 when the six-seater <i>Iolar</i> made its inaugural flight from Baldonnel to Bristol, our national airline has developed beyond the wildest dreams of its founders into one of the most respected and successful airlines in Europe and the world. In the emerging aviation situation after the Second World War, Aer Lingus adapted to the evolving market through judicious management and gained a reputation for friendly and efficient service. The fledgling airline graduated from turbo-prop to jet aircraft in the early 1960s and adopted wide-bodied aircraft in the 1970s. It catered for the Irish diaspora throughout the world. Aer Lingus successfully responded to Ireland's first low-cost airline, Ryanair, by restructuring its operation to become a low-cost airline itself, operating from a principal hub in Dublin to both Europe and North America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to facilitate the employee share ownership plan which was agreed between Government and the trade unions in Aer Lingus, <Col N="265" /> with an arrangement for private sector involvement in the future. Under the proposed statutory ESOP, Aer Lingus staff are entitled to 14.9% share in the company with the way open for a possible sale of the airline in the future. There appear to be no immediate plans to seek a buyer for the company, with many large carriers on both sides of the Atlantic facing bankruptcy, merger or entering strategic alliances or partnerships.</P>
    <P>The aftermath of 11 September 2001, rising levels of terrorism, economic slowdown and the SARS virus outbreak, have placed many airlines under severe financial pressure and the current economic climate is not conducive to seeking potential buyers.</P>
    <P>Corporate financial restructuring appears to be the order of the day. Companies such as Aer Lingus, which were once viewed as relatively insulated from financial problems, have been forced to seek cost reductions to remain competitive or merely to survive. Facing the real or perceived need to improve competitiveness, the Cahill plan proposed reductions in costs and employee share ownership plans became part of that solution. As participants in an ESOP, employees are able to enjoy the benefits of stock ownership in their employer and when the company is financially successful the value of the stock should increase. When employees leave the company they may sell their shares at market value either to the company or to the ESOP.</P>
    <P>From the viewpoint of fending off hostile takeover attempts, the allocation of 14.9% of shares appears to be somewhat conservative since employees would be less likely than other shareholders to support corporate raiders because of the potential for redundancies and other job-cutting measures. By placing a sufficiently large proportion of shares, for instance 40%, in the hands of employees, Aer Lingus would create an additional hurdle for potential corporate raiders and would make itself somewhat less attractive as a candidate for a hostile takeover.</P>
    <P>In the United States, the growing incidence of ESOPs is particularly evident in the airline industry. Employees at United Airlines successfully structured a transaction in which they received a majority of the company's shares by way of an ESOP. In exchange they agreed to accept rule changes and changes in work conditions and practices and other concessions worth billions of dollars over a four-year period. Employees at Northeast Airlines were also given share ownership through an ESOP in exchange for concessions. As a result of the concessions and an ESOP tax shelter, Northeast Airlines was able to renegotiate its debt and avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.</P>
    <P>In these and many similar situations, an ESOP in return for concessions is simply the best alternative for employees. Without such an arrangement there would be a temptation for the company to opt for laying off workers and creating redundancies. Employees can improve the viability of the company and increase the odds <Col N="266" /> of keeping their jobs by agreeing to the ESOP balanced with concessions. They will have the opportunity to recoup all or part of their work concessions if the company is financially successful. They can view their concessions as an investment which has the potential for future value rather than seeing it as a sacrifice.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Minister for Finance may dispose of his shares in Aer Lingus plc, thereby opening the way for a possible merger with other carriers, with national identities being submerged in the process. The facility for the Minister to dispose of his shares in the company clearly signals that the era of privatisation of the national airline has dawned. Aer Lingus will be viewed in a different light by the public in the future.</P>
    <P>Now that the airline has returned to profitability its acquisition will be seen as a more attractive proposition by prospective suitors. With the opening of new routes and the purchase of additional aircraft, shareholders will be in a significantly stronger bargaining position. Last week's merger agreement between KLM, the Dutch airline, and Air France is perhaps a landmark in the continuing integration of European aviation. It is perhaps just as difficult for a country to give up its gleaming airbuses or 747s which fly the national colours as it is to subsume its currency in a monetary union. The Dutch willingness to surrender KLM to a company based in Paris is a consequence not only of European integration but also of the promised and long overdue deregulation of the transatlantic market. Both airlines feel they can best capitalise on this prospect if they can offer a more extensive network to travellers, which such a merger would create.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of Europe's aviation industry will probably cause a reduction in the number of national flagship airlines, but an expansion in competitive airlines. Successful low cost niche players, such as Aer Lingus, will be free to fly anywhere. Recently we saw a spate of cash strapped carriers, such as Sabena, Swissair and American Airlines, either going under or seeking protection from creditors. The conventional wisdom is that having a national airline is not a guarantee of being on the world's flight map.</P>
    <P>Last June tight restrictions on cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the aviation industry were eased and the world's leading airlines made an unprecedented and unanimous call for the abolition of foreign ownership restrictions. They urged Governments to allow overseas take-overs of struggling national airlines. Some 273 airlines, including Aer Lingus, which amounts to 98% of the industry, argued that liberalisation was essential to the industry's recovery in what was called the Washington Declaration. They also gave the European Commission the leading role in the negotiation of thousands of air traffic agreements which member states have with other non-EU countries. The decks were thus cleared for a wave of consolidations or mergers among European carriers. Apart from the aforementioned merger <Col N="267" /> between KLM and Air France, two other national flag carriers, Alitalia and Olympic Airlines of Greece, are available for take-over.</P>
    <P>Europe is likely to have three major carriers &ndash; British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa &ndash; all of which are becoming increasingly dominant. There are indications that British Airways may target Iberia Airlines in which it already holds a 9% stake. In such a scenario, Aer Lingus would be best served by remaining a low cost airline and developing a variety of new routes, such as the nine announced within the past week.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 9 to establish a number of superannuation schemes for the employees and pensioners. I also welcome the amendments in section 6 in relation to the appointment of directors, including worker directors. I trust that the restructuring and streamlining of Aer Lingus, which this Bill encompasses, will enable the airline to continue its development and expansion in a rapidly evolving world aviation market. The airline will thus be ideally placed to successfully meet and surmount the aviation challenges of the new century, as it has done for the past 67 years of its existence.</P>

      <P>This Bill advances a number of processes which have been under way for many years, particularly in relation to the employee share ownership scheme which has been under way since the Cahill plan in 1993. The IPO procedure began in 1999 and was considerably advanced before a number of factors, which were outlined by the Minister, forced a rethink and a postponement. Many people will have mixed views on the ultimate outcome of the changes proposed for the national carrier.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many views. It was important to have a nationally owned airline when the national carrier first started. There has been considerable change in the world of aviation. The pace of change, as in many other areas of life, has quickened appreciably. It is also notoriously cyclical. The strategic advantage of having a national airline has diminished in the context of the forces affecting the airline business at present. There is possibly some ongoing strategic value, but that has been so diminished by the effect of other forces, it is not what it used to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years one would be forgiven for thinking that the national airline had been bedevilled by a history of financial difficulty. When one looks at the aviation industry and its cyclical nature, it is not surprising that the airline <Col N="268" /> seems to lurch from crisis to crisis. However, there have been some encouraging improvements in its financial standing. How is it possible for an airline or any employer or operator to manage without the services of up to 2,000 of its employees and without appearing to diminish its level of service? That question must be addressed to management. There have been enormous weaknesses in the management of Aer Lingus. It has always taken an immediate crisis to force everyone in the company to address it, although it is usually done under pressure from the Government. While one would love to be a proponent of the public service operation in this area, one must face the fact that enormous difficulties have arisen which have had to be addressed in a painful manner, particularly in recent years with the Cahill plan and more recently with the current survival plan.</P>
    <P>One element of this legislation, which was effectively agreed with the unions in March this year is the employee share ownership provision. I am happy with the provision in the Bill for the employee share ownership trust. I strongly support the principle of involving employees in the ownership of the company. This move has had positive results where it was done in a meaningful way. The right of workers to board representation is a step forward.</P>
    <P>Any debate on the future of Aer Lingus must look honestly at the difficulties which have beset the airline in recent years. While the difficulties arose in some instances because of international events, such as 11 September, foot and mouth disease and SARS, there is also an inclination to put up with weak management during times when there is less economic pressure on the airline. That has done Aer Lingus enormous damage.</P>
    <P>Even if it had not done such damage, there are other compelling reasons for the two principle objectives of the Bill &ndash; the employee share participation scheme and the investment of private sector finances in the airline. I was interested to hear the Minister say that the existing employee share participation scheme under the Cahill plan has already resulted in the payment of more than &euro;15 million to employees and &euro;12.2 million in shares. Many people will have forgotten that the original move in this direction had gone quite so far. People also conveniently forget that under EU rules it is effectively impossible for the Government to put further financial aid into the State airline or to invest in it further at this stage.</P>
    <P>As has been said previously, a substantial amount of taxpayers' money was invested under the Cahill plan &ndash; a total of £175 million. It must be conceded that the changes in work practices and other areas undertaken in tandem with the investment had the effect of restoring the airline to good health. People who were not in the House at that time may not have been aware of what the prognosis was and how much more negative it was than the fears expressed over the last year and a half. It was a real crisis for the airline at a time <Col N="269" /> when the country was less well positioned to address it. To be fair to those involved in the plan, very considerable progress was made. Nevertheless, as a public representative from my part of the country, I must point out that there was a widespread view that the changes made to Shannon Airport were more far-reaching and potentially more damaging than those made in other parts of the country. Although the ultimate outcome happened to be quite positive, what was originally intended would have had far more damaging consequences.</P>
    <P>In the context of considerations such as those before the House, it is well to consider the possible effects of these changes at national level, on the airline itself and its employees and on the regions, which have traditionally played a central role in aviation. The view that Shannon has historically been required to pay a higher price than elsewhere is widely held in the mid-west. It is acknowledged that the eventual outcome of the events of 1993-94 was nowhere near as bad as it would have been had the original plan gone ahead. The very same case could have been made by Deputy Breen's and my constituents in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001.</P>
    <P>There was a strong perception that when Aer Lingus was wielding the axe it did so with abandon in the mid-west but with considerable care in Dublin and, to a lesser extent, in Cork. There is evidence to support this view. Some services that were discontinued at that time have not yet recommenced. I am thinking in particular of the Paris service, but there are others. Fortunately, the airport management was able to attract other carriers on the transatlantic route and some European routes at exactly the same time as our national airline, with its concern for the national interest and for regional interests, was doing exactly the opposite. In the face of that kind of experience of the national airline, one tends to look on a debate such as this with a far wider focus.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his speech, as he has done previously in the House, that Aer Lingus is about to embark on another significant expansion in its transatlantic routes. This may well be the case and if it is, it is a valid exercise for the airline and one that deserves some support. It is not an exercise, however, on which the airline should embark to its own advantage and to the detriment of interests in and around Shannon Airport. If changes are to be made to benefit Aer Lingus, one must consider where those benefits will eventually accrue. If Aer Lingus were to remain the national airline the benefits would accrue to the nation. One's view could be coloured by that. However, in the context of this Bill and the 1999 decision, which was postponed for financial rather than strategic or ideological reasons, one must face up to the fact that the benefits in terms of immediate financial return will be to the airline, which is no longer entirely the State airline. That may be no bad thing.</P>
    <P>One must acknowledge that if the additional <Col N="270" /> routes resulted in the delivery of a substantial increase in numbers of passengers to Ireland, that benefit would have to be put into the equation. One must also admit, however, that should the changes affect Shannon Airport negatively, it would be incumbent on the State that facilitated or promoted such changes to ensure that what is lost is replaced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that in the event that Aer Lingus is facilitated in its current push for additional gateways to the USA, and if this involves changes at Shannon, the downside of such changes must be addressed and alternatives must be provided for people in the mid-west. There was a specific question about the IPO. It does make sense that the Government should pursue this at a time when the return to the taxpayer would be highest. The 1999 decision was a sensible one and the approach of the Minister in section 3 of the Bill in facilitating the sale of the State's shares is also sensible.</P>
      <P>The Minister also made reference in his speech to changes in provisions for the pension scheme. Nobody has adverted to the enormous difficulties that exist for some current pensioners under the various aviation scheme pensions. In the past, opportunities were lost to address this difficulty for people who had dedicated their working lives to Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. Their pension arrangements are truly appalling and reflect no credit on the State. It is unusual to have such an opportunity when the State will benefit financially from this legislation and it should not be lost. It would be a scandal if the State were to proceed without taking account of the difficulty in the existing schemes. I welcome the fact that some provision has been made in the Bill in this regard.</P>
      <P>The superb work record of Aer Lingus employees over the years should be acknowledged. I know a great many of them at Shannon Airport who have worked proudly for the airline and the provision extending the employee share participation scheme is an acknowledgement of that effort. It must also be recalled that these employees have dealt with pay freezes and enormous changes in work practices, by and large without a glitch, which is to their credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the real weaknesses in strategic aviation policy has been that the State has not addressed the question of access to airports. To be fair to Aer Lingus and other companies operating into and out of those airports, this point has militated strongly against their ability to be profitable. Regardless of who might be involved as future players in the airline sector, better access to airports will be of key importance. I welcome the report on rail access to Shannon, which was presented to the Minister at the weekend and <Col N="272" /> which indicates a willingness to provide considerable private sector funding.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has experience in alliances, such as One World, from which benefits have flowed both to the national airline and the economy generally. Huge changes have occurred, however, and some of the great names in aviation have either run into difficulty or exist no more. Swissair and Sabena, for example, used to be among the premier European airlines but they are no longer operating. The likely take-over of the Dutch flag-carrier, KLM, by Air France is currently being considered. Enormous changes are taking place in aviation worldwide, particularly in Europe. In the context of this Bill, we need to face the fact that Aer Lingus, as it is currently constituted, would have enormous difficulty in fending off some of the potential predators currently operating internationally.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Telecom Eireann-Eircom flotation experience has not been positive for a great many people. There were positive experiences for those who benefited in the short term during the IPO process but, at a later stage, the experience was negative for the small investors who thought they had made a good long-term investment but were wiped out by the take-over. If the Government is proceeding towards an IPO for Aer Lingus, lessons should be learned from the Eircom experience. The model employed on that occasion, from relatively early on, is not one that I would favour now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which gives effect to the employee share ownership scheme agreed by the Government and the Aer Lingus unions. It also provides a legal framework to facilitate private sector investment in the event that the Government embarks on such a process.</P>
      <P>As most speakers have said, the aviation industry has changed dramatically since 11 September 2001. Deputy Killeen mentioned large carriers that have gone out of business, such as Sabena and Swissair. Both companies were major business concerns, yet they were lost in the upheavals affecting the international aviation business. A new, smaller airline called Swiss is now in operation out of Switzerland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus is a small carrier in world terms, catering for a population of four million. The airline has had to face a number of problems, including a difficult trading year in 2001, particularly in the early part of that year during the foot and mouth disease outbreak, and a number of industrial disputes that have affected the airline from 2001 onwards. However, Aer Lingus rose to the challenge in 2002 and responded quickly. Last <Col N="273" /> year the airline improved its performance, with profits rising to &euro;49 million. This was achieved by shedding nearly 2,000 jobs, radically changed work practices and cost reductions of approximately &euro;190 million. The group returned operating profits in 2002 of &euro;63.8 million. One must compliment the Aer Lingus management on this achievement and this year the airline is expecting profits in the region of &euro;75 million to &euro;80 million.</P>
    <P>This achievement has come at a high cost, however, particularly for balanced regional development. Shannon Airport has been one of the major casualties of the Aer Lingus cuts. I was disappointed this morning to hear the Minister saying that what is best for the country is best for Aer Lingus. He should have said that what is best for Aer Lingus is best for the country. The mid-west has been a major casualty in the restructuring of Aer Lingus, losing the early morning and late evening services from Shannon to Dublin. These were important links for the business community in the Shannon region, linking up with corresponding continental flights. The closure of these flights constituted a major loss to the region.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus also shed its only continental link to Europe, which was the Paris service mentioned earlier by Deputy Killeen. The airline does not provide any service to continental Europe at the moment &ndash; the only overseas services remaining are those to North America and London. The loss of a continental service was a tremendous blow to the region but Shannon Airport's management got other low-cost carriers to take on new routes.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus's transatlantic business has been the cornerstone of Shannon and is the reason the airport has been so successful over the years. It has been particularly important for tourism and related businesses on the west coast. One only has to look at the success stories in the region, such as Shannon Airport's duty-free shop, the Shannon free enterprise zone, the first pre-immigration clearance service and the medieval banquets and folk park at Bunratty Castle, to name a few. Yet, for a number of reasons, I have to question Aer Lingus's long-term commitment to the future of Shannon.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus's management is on record as having stated earlier this year that it was anxious to change the current bilateral agreement, thus opening up new routes to the United States. The routes they had in mind were San Francisco and Miami, or Orlando. They have ordered new planes and last week Aer Lingus announced eight new continental routes &ndash; again to Europe, all out of Dublin. Despite the events of September 2001 they have opened up 28 new routes and not one new European route has commenced out of Shannon Airport. As Aer Lingus now emerges as a low cost airline, what kind of commitment has the national airline to our region? Ryanair at least has proven one thing. It has three continental routes out of Shannon, Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt. Michael O'Leary has shown that a <Col N="274" /> passenger will go anywhere if the price is right. An exception is SkyNet, which now operates an Amsterdam service to Moscow. That is going to change shortly as SkyNet concentrates its services to Moscow out of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the loss of the early service from Shannon to Dublin. Aer Arann took up the route after Aer Lingus had left. Unfortunately, it proved uncommercial because it was competing with Aer Lingus on the morning service. Also, they had poor time schedules and again, they had to compete with Aer Lingus on the transatlantic morning service. At this stage one cannot get from Dublin to Shannon Airport after 2.15 p.m. What kind of service is that? Earlier this year Aer Lingus pulled out of the Cork domestic service as well, ending a 42 year link with Cork city.</P>
    <P>Another example of Aer Lingus's commitment to Shannon was the changing of its winter schedule last year with regard to flight EI 111, the only scheduled New York flight Shannon had. Aer Lingus changed that flight so that it started from Dublin where it took on 25% of the passengers, and in this way cut down on the numbers embarking from Shannon. It has been very hard over the last year to get a flight with Aer Lingus from Shannon to New York, because we do not have the capacity. I acknowledge the facts as well, of course. Aer Lingus did put on a twice weekly service to New York for the summer.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister put pressure on Aer Lingus to keep EI 111 on a direct service from Shannon? It is important that we have full capacity from the airport for the winter. There is no doubt that service can operate profitably.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides enabling powers to facilitate a sale of Aer Lingus, or part of the State's shareholding in the national airline. I believe the Government, which has an 85% share in Aer Lingus, should be wary of trying to sell the company at this stage to try to solve any short-term budgetary crisis. We know that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is in favour of selling Aer Lingus to get more money into his coffers for the forthcoming year. I think, however it would be a terrible mistake. SIPTU, which represents over 3,000 Aer Lingus workers, has stated it does not want this to go ahead. We take pride in our national airline and given the current EU-US agreement I believe it is important to recognise that small airlines like Aer Lingus could get gobbled up by the megacarriers. Other speakers have mentioned the recent merger of Air France and the Dutch airline, KLM. There are now indications that British Airways may be making merger overtures to American Airlines, again. That is, if the regulator approves the Air France-KLM arrangement. I know Aer Lingus wants to move into the US and open new routes. It is a very small carrier, however, in terms of overall transatlantic business. The current population of the European Union is 600 million. That is a huge figure, given the Irish population of four million. Aer Lingus, therefore, is not a big player. The <Col N="275" /> current bilateral agreement has worked well, I believe, for Aer Lingus, because it does not have competition.</P>
    <P>The European Union is negotiating an open skies agreement that would improve competition. There is a danger that competition might be reduced because of mergers on the north Atlantic route. There is also a danger that Ireland could end up with no direct service to the US and that we would only have a back tracking service from Britain or mainland Europe. It is important therefore that Aer Lingus markets the Irish business equally between Dublin and Shannon to trap the huge US tourism potential that has not been availed of up to now. Shannon Airport, as a hub, has an important role to play in that. I know the Minister is a west of Ireland man and that he has said on numerous occasions he is committed totally to Shannon Airport. Given the current negotiations that are under way could he not try and develop Shannon as a hub airport at European level? Shannon could act as a hub where US flights would terminate and low cost feeder services could link European cities that do not have direct access to North America.</P>
    <P>The mid-west airport has many advantages over its rivals. A new terminal building was opened in recent years. This can cater for 5.5 million people and if necessary can be expanded. There are currently up to 2.2 million passengers going through the airport annually. So it has spare capacity and the infrastructure is in place. The airport has one big advantage &ndash; it does not have congested skies like London, Frankfurt or Paris. It has the US pre-immigration clearance that I mentioned earlier. It has easy parking and there are plenty of vacant slots. These are all very important. Shannon is also ideally located in geographical terms. The road infrastructure is improving, particularly on the Clare side at present. There are new stretches of bypass such as the recently opened one at Newmarket. The Ballycasey stretch is open now and will be an improvement. A huge amount of money has been spent on infrastructure in that area.</P>
    <P>The long-awaited Ennis bypass will be going out to tender shortly and this will improve access from the west, which is so vital for business in Shannon Airport. Not only would this concept contribute to the airport, but it would have huge benefits for tourism in the west and south of Ireland. Again I would plead with the Minister for Transport to put this concept in place. The current bilateral agreement has worked well and it must stay in place, I believe, until something better is found for Shannon Airport. Another benefit for Shannon could be the development of the air control base to serve the single skies agreement. Ministers should make sure that Shannon is chosen as a base arising from this.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, with other members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, I met Mr. Van Hasselt, the head of the EU air agreement section of the European Commission in <Col N="276" /> Brussels to discuss the EU and US open skies agreements. He was very supportive of including Shannon in any arrangements in the open skies agreement. Later with Deputy Kenny I met Loyola de Palacio in Brussels, who also expressed support for making a special case for Shannon. She pointed out that there were a number of other airports in Greece and Portugal which were in the same situation as Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I have questioned Aer Lingus's commitment to Shannon Airport and to the mid-west and west. When booking a flight from America on the Internet, the Aer Lingus website will lead one to Dublin first. There is a huge market that must be tapped.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's appointment of independent boards for Shannon and Cork airports and particularly his appointment of Pat Shanahan as the chairman of the Shannon Airport board. Mr. Shanahan has many qualities and will be of great benefit to the board. It is good that Shannon will have its independence. The service between Shannon and Frankfurt-Hahn was reduced from four days per week to one day per week because the local management could not make a decision without getting permission from the board of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will soon announce the new board and that it will be made up of people with experience in the aviation sector and particularly in marketing which is required to encourage people to come to the country. This applies equally to airports and airlines. The more people we bring in, the greater will be the profits for the airline and the money being spent in the country. The appointment of the board of Shannon Airport will complement the infrastructure that has been installed throughout the airport.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Railway Company has submitted a document to the Minister, which I hope he will review. Now that we have people with confidence in the area who are willing to spend their own private money, I hope the Minister will give his backing to that proposal so that there can be equal opportunities for our airports. We have three international airports to which Aer Lingus should be committed and not just to the one major one.</P>
    <P>I welcome certain sections of the Bill, particularly section 7, which provides for an employee shareholding scheme, and section 9, which provides that Aer Lingus may establish a superannuation scheme for Aer Lingus employees and former employees of Aer Lingus. We all know that many Aer Lingus workers had trouble with their pensions some time ago.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. To listen to the debate so far, one would be forgiven for believing <Col N="277" /> there were only two issues in the Bill, the privatisation of Aer Lingus and maintaining the viability of Shannon Airport. Such a view is somewhat misguided. There are four major purposes, the first of which is a technical one relating to the appointment of directors, including worker directors.</P>
      <P>The second purpose, which is of considerable importance and of which we should not lose sight, is the establishment of new pension schemes by Aer Lingus for general employees and pensioners. There has been an issue in Aer Lingus for a number of years in relation to long outstanding difficulties concerning pension arrangements for pensioners, particularly some senior pensioners. The matter has tended to get lost in the more urgent issues of the day for the company. We all know that Aer Lingus has been through a difficult period in the past ten years, particularly in the past two or three years.</P>
      <P>There are major outstanding issues, which have been the subject of significant representations and lobbying by successive committees from the Retired Aviation Staff Association. I know the Minister will consider these in processing this legislation. It would be remiss of me as a Deputy for the constituency where Dublin Airport is located not to avail of the opportunity to mention the issue and to urge the Minister in the strongest possible terms to take account of the representations that have been made for the best part of ten years' and to see if he can find a mechanism to address these genuine issues which in some cases are leading to genuine hardship.</P>
      <P>Employees of Aer Lingus brought the company from being a very minor player &ndash; basically an island airline &ndash; to what it is today. Over many years the employees took immense pride not only in their airline but also in the identity of their airline as a flag carrier for Ireland abroad when flag carriers for our country abroad were not nearly as numerous as they are now. For decades Aer Lingus was the principal standard bearer for Ireland abroad. I have spoken to the Minister about this issue and I know he is aware of it. I look forward to the implementation of that aspect of the legislation as it is of particular importance to look after that group.</P>
      <P>The third purpose of the legislation is to provide the legal framework to facilitate a process of external investment in the airline in the event that the Government embarks on such a process. That has been the subject of the bulk of the debate thus far and I will come back to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the employee share ownership plan agreed by the Government and the Aer Lingus unions. The origins of the share ownership plan are worthy of discussion as it is vital that we know where we have come from. It is relatively easy to forget that three years ago Aer Lingus was in serious trading difficulty, with in excess of 6,000 employees. In the opinion of many it was an unrealistic workforce when compared with the workforce at the company's principal competitor, Ryanair. With the <Col N="278" /> emergence of several additional and unexpected factors, particularly the catastrophe of 11 September 2001, a series of events conspired to produce the situation in which we now find ourselves, tidying up the loose ends of what was a survival plan.</P>
    <P>Since coming into the Oireachtas three years ago, I have noticed the grand titles given to many of the projects we discuss. However, the word &ldquo;survival&rdquo; in the context of the Aer Lingus business plan of recent years is probably the most appropriate, and one of the milder titles. We gave our customary knee-jerk response to extraneous events over which we have no control, and looked to Brussels to dig us out of the hole. Brussels did not have a shovel at that time and left us to dig ourselves out.</P>
    <P>To the eternal credit of the Aer Lingus workforce, it dealt with this crisis despite considerable pain and difficulty in negotiation. This has been a feature of the company throughout its history. Not only did it survive but it moved on, using the survival plan agreed by the workers and management, to emerge under the highly creditable leadership of Willy Walsh and his colleagues as a serious commercial, viable, and profitable entity. It is again leading the way for Ireland internationally and still has major scope for further improvement and profitability.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that I was born and reared within 15 miles of Dublin Airport. Some of my colleagues may think it unlikely but my first recollection of Aer Lingus is of being carried on my father's shoulders, across a cornfield, for about a mile because the roadway, which was the main Dublin-Belfast road at the time, did not provide direct access to the old Collinstown terminal building. That was only about 35 years ago but the changes that have occurred at Collinstown since then have been dramatic, and they reflect the changes in Irish society over the same period. Aer Lingus has been one of the major contributors to those changes, in line with the changes that the company has undergone. It gave Ireland an international dimension when that was badly needed. There was the Cahill plan, the difficult times of ten years ago, and the survival plan of the past few years. The outstanding feature of each of those plans was the ability, capacity and willingness of the staff of Aer Lingus to give tangible expression to their pride in the company and to make the sacrifices necessary to ensure its ongoing viability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I will continue to answer the Deputy's question, with my colleague's permission. We, the people, own Aer Lingus. The people appoint different Governments from time to time to mind their interests in running the affairs of the country. In principle, a Government should be fully facilitated to sell any interest in any State company in which it has a direct interest, when such a situation arises. On a personal level, I have major difficulties with privatisation generally. We all agree that the Eircom experience was not a good one and I am not referring only to the share price. I have serious personal difficulties with the sale of a major national resource into private hands. It is an issue which must be dealt with in the detail of any transaction as it arises. We have no specifics before us today and I assume that if and when such a transaction is put together we will have an opportunity to discuss it. It will be judged at such time on its own merits. I hope that answers the Deputy's question comprehensively enough.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Mulcahy, is anxious to get in and I will be brief in conclusion. The Government must have not only the power to dispose of the company, as it does in any event, but it also must have the power to dispose of it swiftly and in a commercial light. I acknowledge the views of some of the Opposition Deputies on privatisation in principle but we should leave the question on the detail of the privatisation of Aer Lingus to a specific deal if and when that comes before us.</P>
      <P>There is more to this Bill than the possible privatisation of Aer Lingus. It is intended to tidy up the detail of the survival plan which has been so successful. In that regard, I have copies of letters circulated by SIPTU and IMPACT to their members in Aer Lingus, encouraging all their colleagues to take part as fully as possible in the employee share ownership trust. I heartily endorse that. The Bill which is before the House will facilitate private shareholding in the company. If anything else arises, it will, no doubt, be debated fully.</P>
      <P>In commending the Bill to the House, I draw the Minister's attention to the provision, which has been somewhat overlooked in today's debate, in relation to pension schemes, particularly the long outstanding difficulties of the Retired Airline Staff Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on his initiative and warmly support this Bill. Aer Lingus is, perhaps, the jewel in the crown of State companies. It has an honourable and noble tradition and has been held warmly and affectionately in the hearts of Irish people since its foundation in 1936. I endorse a point made by Deputy Glennon. Survivors of the earlier Aer Lingus era, workers who may have retired five or ten years ago, having put their lives and souls into the company, should also be entitled to some share in the 15% ownership of the company. I see no reason that people who may miss out on the deadline by a year or six months would not be entitled to some percentage share in the company. As the Minister will be aware, many people gave the best of their working lives to make Aer Lingus the great company it now is.</P>
      <P>Is Aer Lingus a vital national interest? I believe it certainly was. There is now much more capacity and competition on the Irish routes. I believe there is still a vital national interest involved. It is essential that Irish people, particularly for business travel but also for tourism, are able to access Europe and America without having to go through London. From a business perspective, there is a case for Aer Lingus to service as much as possible of Europe, even if some routes are not particularly profitable. In the national interest, there is a case for cross-subsidisation in certain instances so that Irish people will have access, having regard to our location on the extreme edge of Europe. To that extent, there is a vital national interest in relation to Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>Of course, the airline must be profitable. I wish to compliment the chief executive, Mr. Willy Walsh, and the management and staff of Aer Lingus, who have worked incredibly hard and sacrificed a great deal of time &ndash; and money, in some cases &ndash; to make Aer Lingus the profitable business it now is. The projected profit of the company for this year is &euro;75 million &ndash; last year it made &euro;63 million. In that context, I question the need for fresh capital. I understand that the purchase of new aircraft by Aer Lingus will be funded from current revenue of the company. However, in his speech, the Minister quoted the company's view that a private sector investment process should be initiated without delay. Why is that the case? If the company is in a position to pay for its new fleet out of current spending, why does it need new capital investment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am in favour of new capital investment if it is required and, accordingly, I fully support this Bill, particularly section 5. This section not only permits the sale of shareholding in Aer Lingus, it also permits the company to issue new shares &ndash; there are two aspects to the section. On the question of fresh capital being required, EU rules would, of course, prohibit State subsidy in that regard. However, there is certainly a case for the State to hold on to a golden share in Aer Lingus so that, at least, where vital national interests are concerned, the people of Ireland would retain some control over Aer Lingus. Will <Col N="281" /> the Minister give an assurance that, if there is an intention to sell off a certain shareholding in Aer Lingus, he will come back to the House with full details for approval? I feel sure he will.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on a point which some may consider flippant, though I do not consider it such. I note that the colours of four Aer Lingus aircraft were recently changed from the traditional green to white. Having regard to the position of Aer Lingus as part of the international image of Ireland, together with the shamrock and green, did the company have the Minister's consent to change from green to white? Will he tell the company there are to be no more white Aer Lingus aircraft and that our established green image, with the shamrock, should be retained? I consider it a bad business decision to change that image.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the level of consultation about painting the planes in Aer Lingus was similar to that in relation to the reduction in DART services at weekends. Is it becoming the norm that major changes are made by semi-State bodies without the knowledge of the relevant Minister or his personnel?</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. A few years ago, in view of the media hype at that time, there was some concern that Aer Lingus might not be there for us to discuss. In that regard, I congratulate all concerned, from the Minister down, but especially Mr. Willy Walsh and his staff, on having turned around the company in such a positive way within such a short time. Each of us can recall the impact of the foot and mouth crisis on tourism and air travel, followed by the events of 11 September and other developments which created many problems for airlines throughout the world. It is to the credit of Aer Lingus that it has managed to survive the competition from Ryanair which has had a major impact on air access to this country, notably in relation to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party is concerned that Aer Lingus should remain as an independent carrier within a profitable State structure. As the Minister has stated, a first objective of this Bill is to regulate the situation with regard to share ownership by workers in the company. It goes into detail with regard to the re-introduction of a possible buy-out scheme, which the Government had intended to bring before the Dáil in 1999 but it was withdrawn due to the difficulties which existed at that time. Since then, there has been agreement that the workers should have shareholding in the region of 14.9%. A major involvement by workers in this or any other company gives them the incentive and urge <Col N="282" /> to make the company more profitable. The industrial action and cut-backs of recent months were a worrying development which caused significant problems for passengers. If Aer Lingus is to be a major player that continues to make profits, it is vital that all its workers give a commitment to ensure people arrive at their destination.</P>
    <P>Since I started in public life as a member of a farm organisation, I have seen Dublin Airport and Aer Lingus change dramatically. When I started travelling to Europe with IFA delegations, the late T. J. Maher, if he was in a hurry, would pull up in his old banger of a car at the footpath outside the airport and everyone knew who he was and he would carry on to his destination. Now a person must be there two hours before the flight or he is not guaranteed a place. Things have changed dramatically and the airport has grown considerably in size.</P>
    <P>The cost of parking at Dublin Airport is scandalous. We are talking about privatising Aer Lingus but we must examine this issue. I hear many complaints about this problem. Between Aer Lingus and Ryanair, it is possible to travel abroad very cheaply and often the car parking costs more than the flight. This must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has gone from making a loss of &euro;52 million in 2001 to a profit of &euro;63.8 million in 2002. It has introduced 16 new routes, raising its number to 42, with a potential profit of &euro;80 million this year in spite of problems in Iraq. The Minister must think carefully about selling off this airline. He stated that the proceeds of any sale will go to the Exchequer, and that is a guarantee to us all, but what is the Exchequer? It is a bottomless hole and there is a danger that this company could be sold off to cover up problems elsewhere in the Government. Fine Gael will not stand for that. If Aer Lingus is to be sold for strategic reasons, we must be clear what they are.</P>
    <P>I was part of a group on a short visit to Canada some years ago. My colleagues and I arrived in Toronto Airport at 6 p.m. for a flight at 8.30 p.m. We were told at 8 p.m. that the flight had been cancelled. Eventually we got a flight at 9.30 a.m. the following day. Because there is a monopoly in operation, the staff could not care less. If I had not had my diplomatic passport with me, God knows when we would have got out. I did not want to use it but another member of the group encouraged me and once it was produced prompt action was taken. Experiences like that make me anxious about monopolies operating in their own interests. The staff of Aer Lingus, from the moment a person walks in the door of Dublin Airport to the moment he leaves the aircraft, are hospitable people who make one feel at home. We must not lose that.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus is sold there is a danger that it could be taken over by British Airways. I have nothing against that company &ndash; I have flown with it many times. British Airways, however, would not be committed to this country. The slots <Col N="283" /> available to Aer Lingus in Heathrow Airport are among our most valuable assets. Can the Minister guarantee that if Aer Lingus was taken over by British Airways those slots would not be used for other purposes to earn greater profits? Would the company ensure we have access to and egress from this country?</P>
    <P>If we are to build on the success of the tourism industry, there must be direct access to the island. Aer Lingus and Ryanair are building up a portfolio of direct routes that have improved Ireland's image as a place that is easy to get to. I visited Prince Edward Island in Canada recently and it took 24 hours to get there. Such long journey times put people off. We must carefully consider the national interest before we tie ourselves to a group that does not have the interests of Ireland at heart. I urge the Minister to bear this in mind before selling Aer Lingus just to gain money for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It has been said that if we do not sell Aer Lingus, we have no means of funding it. The EU does not allow us to bail out Aer Lingus, an option we considered two years ago, but there is a difference between bailing out a company and funding it to improve its structure. Under EU rules the potential exists to do that and the Minister should make that clear.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of Aer Rianta is welcome, with the establishment of a board for each of the three airports. None of them will be able to claim in future that the other airports are holding it back. That is in the interests of the regions and gives Shannon Airport and Cork Airport an opportunity to restructure and market themselves. I remember when those arriving from Canada and the United States had no choice but to land in Shannon Airport and we had to drive all the way from Monaghan to collect them. While I appreciate the problems of those in Clare and Limerick who wish to retain the status of Shannon Airport, it is equally important to the northern region that there are direct flights to Dublin where possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the participation of the unions and the fact that when this legislation is enacted, they will have 14.9% involvement in the company. We have had monopolies in the meat industry and many other sectors and I strongly advise the Minister that large size does not necessarily mean the best delivery will result. I cannot help but think of the liquid milk business. We were told that when Avonmore received a bigger slice of the various companies it would be able to get a proper deal for farmers and suppliers from Dunne Stores and Tesco. The exact opposite has happened and Avonmore has been the quickest to cave in to the supermarkets. Certainly the producers &ndash; in that case the farmers &ndash; have been the losers. They are now down to about 35% of the actual value of the finished product on the shelf. The Minister should think hard and clearly before he sells off Aer Lingus solely to prop up the Exchequer. I ask him not to sell off the golden <Col N="284" /> egg but to address needs which should be dealt with in other ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said at the outset that the principal purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the employer's ownership plan and to provide a legal framework to facilitate a process of external investment in the airline should this or any future Government decide to adopt that approach. A number of speakers have referred to section 9 which addresses the issue of pensions. I reiterate the point which has been made that quite a number of people were affected in this regard in Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the aviation industry generally. I would like to see their cases dealt with. All Members of the House have been the subject of lobbying in respect of this matter and it is to be hoped that something practical can be done. This is very important to staff.</P>
      <P>The immediate reaction to the Bill was to talk of a total sell off. The last speaker referred to a sell off to prop up the Exchequer which is a knee jerk reaction to the issue. There are many other methods to involve the private sector and to obtain funds from outside the State. A joint ownership approach could be adopted or shares could be sold to accomplish that goal. Options of this sort are being facilitated as it is important to have mechanisms and rules in place when we sit down to make decisions on these issues. There are beneficial ways to conduct a sell off and the rules are right in this deal. It may well be that the public owners &ndash; the taxpayers &ndash; will decide that this approach is of benefit to the State.</P>
      <P>There are good and bad deals and I saw an example of the latter in Irish Steel where I was formerly employed for 25 years. It was sold for £1, but we now face a potential liability of &euro;30 million simply to repair damage to the island the company operated from because of the looseness of the agreement made. I appreciate that four Departments were involved in that case, but it was mismanaged. While I had an emotional interest in the deal due to my attachment to the place, I had a practical interest in that Irish Steel was located in the middle of my constituency. That was the worst possible operation any Government could have conducted and we saw the worst possible result. It did not happen simply because the Rainbow Coalition was in office. As an employee at Irish Steel, I supported the concept of private sector investment which is examined in the Bill before the House. The late Willy Korf, a German and one of the world's great steel industrialists, would have been a most welcome partner in that business, but instead we went for people who were not involved in the industry. We made the worst possible deal. While I draw attention to that example to point out the dangers of making a bad deal, it may still be beneficial to sell off some State assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what kind of offer we would have got for Aer Lingus two years ago. I am sure people would not have rushed from around the world to buy it. The company was a disaster area and <Col N="285" /> ready to go belly up and until the survival plan was put in place it seemed quite likely that we would lose our State airline. After 11 September 2001, the company could not meet its insurance costs. People moved rapidly and I am pleased with what happened. Many people have referred to and complimented the staff of Aer Lingus, but every speaker should add to that given the company's almost miraculous survival. Various reasons for the survival are given, including the shedding of 2,000 jobs and changing work practices, but the driving force came from outside the Government in the person of Mr. Walsh. I do not know the significance of the fact that Mr. Walsh was a former employee of Aer Lingus and therefore knew the angles and methodologies used to arrive at decisions and to make appointments but what is certain is that Mr. Walsh and the rest of the staff have done a magnificent job.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties a State or semi-State body faces is that it is subject to directives from the Minister or, more usually, from this House. Needless to say, I will get in my plug for Cork. We also had a great survival plan and turned a situation around to make it profitable. The figures are magnificent. However, we all have an opinion regarding the routes Aer Lingus should service from our neck of woods. People say they should run this or that bad route no matter what it costs. We ask the company to implement a survival plan, but we tell it not to interfere with our neck of the woods. We may have just lost the direct connection from Cork to Dublin, but I credit Aer Lingus that when the pressure was on after 11 September 2001 the company maintained all the crucial routes it could. Shannon Airport suffered because there was an artificial entity there. Many things were done which were not essential to the national plan. The airport was protected by an artificial entitlement whereby it was argued that Shannon should be kept going. If it had not been able to make the changes, Aer Lingus would have gone belly up.</P>
    <P>I argue that nine new European routes are being opened on top of the existing 42. The complaint has been made that all are from Dublin and none is from Shannon Airport. I subscribe to that because none of them is going from Cork either. Although none of the American flights was from Cork, no one in Shannon, the mid-west or any place else was troubled in the least about the survival of the State's third international airport. My argument has been consistent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Glennon said he lives nine or ten miles from the airport. I am practically living at the airport, being located half a mile from it, but my point to the workers in Cork is that we will survive. We have a good product. We exist because people want the service. They are coming to Cork, they are not being diverted to Cork. If they are travelling from another continent they are not told that they must fly into Cork. There is nothing artificial about the arrangement. Cork will survive, given a level playing pitch and that an advantage is not given <Col N="286" /> to any of the other two airports with which Cork will compete. I welcome the competition and the changes made by the Minister. I welcome also the opportunity for Cork to show what it can do and to compete.</P>
    <P>Arguments about marketing subsidies have been made for the past 20 years. I could never unveil the full extent of the marketing budget available to Shannon, despite putting questions in the Committee of Public Accounts and other fora where people came to make known their information. It might have been Mr. O'Leary of Ryanair who said at the time when Cork appeared to be losing out that we could not be offered the same stimulation or the same cosy deal, so to speak. That should not be the case when the taxpayer is paying for everything. There should be a level playing field. We must take up this opportunity. People are working hard in Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports and that has to be recognised. Administration must be the same for all and they must get an equal opportunity. Let there be competition. If people want to drive from Thurles to Dublin to fly out from that airport rather than drive from Thurles to Cork, which is almost an equal distance &ndash; Urlingford to Cork would be an equal distance &ndash; let that be their decision based on the ability to get there, the service they get and the cost to fly out of that airport. Let there be nothing artificial about it.</P>
    <P>Despite all the difficulties, Aer Lingus staff have done a magnificent job and they are to be complimented for it. I would like that to continue. An important part of the recovery was the change in work practice etc. As a trade unionist for more years than I care to enunciate, I would not dream of calling the rights and wrongs of any dispute, particularly the current one in Aer Lingus, but speaking from personal experience I can say that nobody wins in a strike or a work to rule, which is the next step. The person involved usually suffers some kind of deprivation, financial or otherwise. I appeal to all sides involved in the Aer Lingus dispute to try to resolve it quickly before further damage is done to our national carrier. The staff have come through a traumatic time and they have done a magnificent job. I appeal to them to resolve this difficulty. Everything appears to be going well for the company but there are internal dynamics at work in any company, particularly one with such a large staff doing a wide variety of work. The dispute has to be resolved, however, and having seen what the staff have gone through I hope they will resolve it.</P>
    <P>On the changes being made on the operational side and otherwise, we want to have our cake and eat it in that regard. I want to spell out to Mr. Walsh, or his man on the ground in Cork, the number of flights we should operate out of Cork. I want him to make the company viable but there can be conflict between those two aspects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the confidence shown by the Minister in fully supporting the company at this early stage. I discussed with the marketing manager last week the change to the 17 Airbus, the A320 type <Col N="287" /> aircraft they are buying, which I welcome. I questioned the need for that and he mentioned the repair service, how long it takes to train people in and so on. He put forward a logical argument in favour of this type of aircraft but that decision required the support of the Minister. I welcome the fact that the Minister had the confidence in the company to accept the replacement of the Boeing aircraft and the BAe 146. That shows confidence in the staff and the work they do, and that is reflected in their approach. Workers will say the equipment was needed for the job and it was for the Minister to make the decision, which was welcome.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister will not solve all the problems regarding pensions but I ask him to examine the overall situation regarding pensioners and others who have been affected in Aer Rianta and elsewhere and come back to us on that. There is a good atmosphere in this business, despite the difficulties. There is a feeling among all the staff involved in Cork Airport &ndash; I cannot speak for Shannon but I presume it is the same there &ndash; that business is booming. Recently the Minister turned the sod &ndash; he nearly threw it on top of me &ndash; on another &euro;120 million development which is a vote of confidence in the company. I have no doubt we will be back to the Minister before his term of office concludes in three years&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;looking for an extension of the apron to allow us fly directly to the United States. With the confidence the Minister has shown in the company and the fact that he sanctioned the earlier funding, I have no doubt he will do the same in that regard.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the point made by Deputy Killeen about access to the airport. We have a difficulty in Cork also with the flyover at the Kinsale roundabout, which is programmed to commence work in January at a cost of &euro;120 million. A major amount of money is required but we must be able to access it. I have not read the details of the offer at Shannon, which became known over the past few days, but it is critically important. Dublin was a bit of a shambles. I do not know how the new bypass will affect it. I have driven past it twice in the past three or four weeks heading north but access is crucially important. Airport people forget about access at the airport gate, and it is probably up to us to facilitate them but good access is important because time is of the essence. People want to travel speedily and safely. With the new security restrictions people have to be at the airport much earlier and we do not need to add to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of private investors, all of us would have an open mind on the issue. It is easy to take a stance and say that we should not sell off the national carrier for strategic reasons. For 25 years I made an argument for selling Irish <Col N="288" /> Steel until I realised the difficulties in which we found ourselves. We needed outside expertise and a niche market. We were selling to 27 countries but we needed more. It took me a long time to come round to the view that there may be a reason for selling. We need to go down that route rather than have a knee jerk reaction.</P>
    <P>What is significant is that Aer Lingus came to the Minister on this issue and said it is time for outside capital. It made &euro;49 million this year but there must be cognisance of the fact that Aer Lingus told the Government that the time is right for private sector investment. They are the people who fly the planes and provide the service and I am aware that the Minister is very positive in his approach to them.</P>
    <P>Six years ago we started on the route of an initial public offering of the airline but so much has happened since then that we are talking about a totally different situation. The concept of these deals, whatever we call them or however we frame them, is to give the employee a share ownership plan. Where employees have a stake in a company, it is good for morale, for financial standing, for collateral and for work practices. It is a win, win situation. It is a route which should be followed and encouraged. I appreciate there is a cap of 12.5% or 14.5% which is, as the Minister was at pains to point out, unique. I presume it is unique because we might be thinking of selling off, but the concept should be followed. It is an excellent one.</P>
    <P>People have worked for 40 years in some companies. It has been said that those who worked in the State or semi-State sectors had security of tenure and great pensions, but that is not so. The situation in the State and semi-State sectors has not been as good as it has been painted. There is a need for further input and this is the route which should be taken. It will make people think differently about their jobs in that they will no longer be just another number. It will benefit everybody. I would like the issue of pensions hammered out satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I wish to use this opportunity to tell the Minister about the situation in Cork. My dealings with Aer Lingus since the difficulties have arisen have been positive. When we needed it most, Aer Lingus maintained the service. Changes were needed. Air fares from Cork to Dublin were crazy &ndash; they were more expensive than to anywhere in Europe. All of the changes have not been made by Ryanair. Aer Lingus has made changes. There is a positive atmosphere at the moment and I would like to see it continue. It is good for this country, for the national airline and for the customer who is most important of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the rest of the Labour Parliamentary Party, I was very taken aback by the detailed contents of this Bill. The Bill has two halves. One is to provide for an ESOP and for enhanced participation by workers, management and staff in Aer Lingus in a greater share in the ownership of the company through an ESOP. <Col N="289" /> The Labour Party in Government strongly supported that development in relation to a number of State companies but with some critical differences to the model Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats subsequently went on to develop. A critical issue in relation to the Labour Party's views on that was that the workers' interest in the company should be long-term and permanent and should be effectively recycled into the company, as was done very successfully in a number of other European countries. That first half of the Bill is not hugely contentious. It has been discussed. The Minister, after much difficulty, finally concluded negotiations with the staff of the company. The staff and their representatives in the various unions seem to largely accept it.</P>
      <P>As regards the other half of the Bill, particularly the elements contained in sections 4, 5 and 6, the Labour Party has really serious concerns about it. Under the guise of the provision for an ESOP, it seems as if the Minister is basically providing for another Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats sale of the century of State assets to God knows who in this case. The indication from the Minister's speech is that it may be a trade sale rather than a privatisation as in the case of Eircom. Obviously, the Minister is reluctant to submit himself to the same kind of publicity in which his predecessor, the Leader of the Seanad, Senator O'Rourke, indulged and enjoyed enormously until it went&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the Minister enjoys publicity but perhaps he is more cute and cannier. I do not think we will hear him on radio or see him on television with a hammer advertising the knockdown sale of Aer Lingus and its assets to the public in the same way Senator O'Rourke did with Eircom over a prolonged period.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he asked the chairman of Aer Lingus to examine and report back to him on future options for the company. He said the chairman has given him the report and that the company's view is that a private sector investment process should be initiated without delay. The Minister is currently considering that and will report his views to Cabinet in the coming weeks. The critical aspect of this Bill is that under the guise of providing for an ESOP, with which everybody broadly agrees, it is designed on the quiet and by the backdoor to provide for the sale of some, or all, of the State's shareholding, for the company to issue new shares and, I suspect from the Minister's speech, for a trade sale of all, or the bulk, of Aer Lingus to as yet unidentified partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is ideologically very right wing and has, in terms of the Progressive Democrats members of Cabinet and half the Fianna Fáil members, a very right wing bias. We know from statements by people like Deputy Ned O'Keeffe that this is one of the most right wing <Col N="290" /> Governments this State has ever seen. We heard this at length from the former Fianna Fáil councillor from Wexford on radio the other morning. One has to ask why. Is this just to satisfy the ideological needs of people like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister, Deputy Brennan, so that they can say they have privatised so much in terms of State assets or has it been, in any way, thought out in terms of our strategic national interest and our need to have a profitable and functioning airline serving the connections between this country and the United States and Europe?</P>
    <P>I have no problem with a detailed debate but for the Minister to come in and try to sneak in the trade sale of Aer Lingus by the backdoor without any detailed discussion of why he proposes to do that, other than to say the chairman has examined the situation, has reported to his satisfaction and he is going to come up with a deal, is not the way to deal with the strategic future of air transport in this country by the main provider of European services and pretty much the principal provider of North Atlantic services. The air connections to Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom from this country are critical.</P>
    <P>We all know the role they have played in opening up the market, just as increased competition levels in the communications market have been enormously important. However, we have strategic interests as an island country and we have no indication what this proposed trade sale will do to strategic air links.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport is proposing this Bill without giving the Dáil an opportunity to discuss it. He is bringing it in through the backdoor. I say this against the background of the Government's performance. It has been in power now for more than six years. In that time we have had debacle after debacle. We had the former Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke, with her non-stop advertising campaign for Eircom privatisation, when small and big investors were fleeced. What is Eircom's position today? It is owned by a group of venture capitalists who have made no secret of their desire to sell off Eircom as soon as they have got it to a critical state. Because of the debacle of Fianna Fáil's and the Progressive Democrats Party's handling of the Eircom privatisation, this country is now seriously lagging behind in all types of communications technology, such as broadband, particularly affecting the west coast of Ireland. It is costing us dear in terms of our competitive position on the European and world markets.</P>
    <P>As a representative of the Dublin West constituency, close to the airport, I note there has been an enormous amount of foreign direct investment over the last decade. When I was a Minister of State in the 1992-1997 Administration, I was happy to see companies like IBM coming to the constituency and providing thousands of jobs. All I hear now from those compan<Col N="291" /> ies is that Ireland is no longer competitive with regard to communications technology, broadband and pricing.</P>
    <P>The reason for the fall in our competitive position is not simply wage inflation arising from the Celtic tiger. It is also to do with the Eircom privatisation debacle, led by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. That privatisation was partly a response to changes in market forces, but also arose out of a deep ideological conviction of the benefits of getting the State out of any type of investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport is proposing in this legislation that <i>carte blanche</i> be given to him for a trade sale of Aer Lingus without debate in the Dáil about the strategic considerations involved in such a move. That is an act of national vandalism on his part.</P>

However, the so-called PPS is now going to cost the taxpayer up to &euro;200 million, while Cork city will still not have a school of music. We have the debacle of the road and transport infrastructure around Dublin and throughout the country. Spending by this Government on the health services has gone up, for a lesser service. The Government's record in management is pathetic. Why should anyone trust the Minister for Transport to have a serious formula for the needs of Aer Lingus as it goes forward into the future?</P>
    <P>There is no indication as to how Aer Lingus is effectively to be valued. No doubt, the private trade sale partners will perform a due diligence examination of Aer Lingus. From the strategic viewpoint, one of the most important assets Aer Lingus has is its landing rights in certain US cities. There is no indication as to how these rights will be valued. I can see a number of middle-sized airlines in Europe, and even in the US, being interested in Aer Lingus because of the availability of these rights within Europe and America.</P>
    <P>What is to prevent the recurrence of the Eircom scenario? Having acquired these rights, it will be far easier and more logical for a company to follow the route of current retail sector servicing in Ireland. That is to make the whole of the Republic of Ireland a hub for north-west England, particularly around Manchester. I am not suggesting this will happen today or tomorrow. However, what would be wrong with people in the future, instead of going to Dublin or Shannon for their transatlantic flights, simply using the hub services of either Manchester, a city in Scotland or a hub on the European mainland? Once we allow Aer Lingus to go entirely out of national hands, as is clearly the intention, we will lose critical power over our capacity to decide how our national airline policy should operate. To do that without discussion in the Dáil is a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>The EU has advanced the notion of TENs with regard to strategic transport routes linking <Col N="292" /> Europe. Ireland has not been in a position seriously to avail of this. In the current discussions in the EU, the competitive policy has been driven by a particular ideological model for the last five to ten years. In the context of a more balanced discussion of Europe's economic future, island states like Ireland would merit serious consideration of their transport linkages whether by sea or by air to other destinations within the EU and the US, the major trading partner of the Union. I know it is not directly within the Minister for Transport's power, but to let go of our strategic control of the national airline at this point, together with Aer Rianta when he turns to privatise that, will historically be the wrong move. I remind the Minister that the privatisation of Eircom lost us critical strategic investment in third and fourth generation communications technology because it went so badly wrong.</P>
    <P>If one makes a bad decision now for short-term ideological reasons, in order to keep the Minister, Deputy McDowell, and the Progressive Democrats Party happy, then in ten or 15 years' time when the discussion in Europe will more comprehensively address the island nature of Ireland, we will have sold the path. We will have nothing left if we end up becoming a subsidiary hub to airports in the UK or Europe. We will have only the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to blame.</P>
    <P>There is enormous potential to develop both Shannon and Cork airports. In the case of Shannon, if faster access to the airport was provided by better rail and road infrastructure, a considerable part of the island of Ireland, using it for linkages and as a hub for the US, would find it more attractive. To some extent the same would apply to Cork, particularly in regard to Europe and perhaps in future in regard to the United States as well. This scenario is worth examining in detail and developing. By going in his chosen direction, the Minister is pre-empting decisions. He is going for a trade sale without a detailed discussion or teasing out of the important issues involved.</P>
    <P>For the past ten years my constituency has had a high level of success in terms of foreign direct investment. For those mobile international executives from companies like IBM and 3Com, which unfortunately is now leaving, direct access to the country in which they wish to invest is of critical importance. It is not something to be lightly thrown away. If we wish to maintain a high level of foreign direct investment and remain competitive, it should be central to our discussions.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's congratulations to the staff of Aer Lingus but it would be extremely short-sighted of the staff, on foot of the sacrifices they have made, to accept the privatisation of the airline by the back door. The staff may decide to go with that but for the rest of us, particularly those who want to see sustainable employment and foreign investment continue, the decision to let go of Aer Lingus without a proper discussion will turn out to be a historic mistake.</P>

      <P>Will Deputy Burton give me half a chance of getting a word in edgeways? Unless we are prepared to encourage the evolution of our semi-State companies Aer Lingus will become the aviation equivalent of Aeroflot. I certainly do not want that to happen. Our national economic life is dependent on a vibrant aviation sector, which can be achieved by Ryanair and also by Aer Lingus as the national carrier.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton is more skilful in the area of economics than I, but when the economic history of the country is written, the contribution of the semi-State and State companies to our industrial and commercial development will be seen as extraordinarily significant, as will the contribution of the chairmen and chief executive officers of those companies. Aer Lingus needs to be allowed to evolve. The same is true for Aer Rianta. The sugar company was allowed to evolve, as were CIE and Bord na Móna. Who would have believed Eddie O'Connor would have been able to turn around Bord na Móna in the manner in which he did. I accept that he was sacrificed for his efforts but the rewards are there and the company is thriving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be allowed to encourage the further <Col N="294" /> development of Aer Lingus as a thriving company with private sector investment. I would be very careful about that.

      <P>I listened to Deputy Shortall's analysis, which was a valid one. Perhaps I will be allowed to indicate where we are coming from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat, we need to allow semi-State companies to evolve in response to events such as 11 September, the SARS crisis and the international downturn in the economy. The aviation sector has been affected by all these events. Aer Lingus has responded magnificently, in contrast to companies on the mainland of Europe which have been sold off and liquidated by various states. We have seen the transformation of Aer Lingus into a high quality, low fares airline. While it has a fair distance to go, the contribution of management <Col N="295" /> and workers to the company's transformation needs to be recognised.</P>
    <P>The measures that have been talked about here are required to allow for further flexibility to take place. While I am not an aviation expert it clearly makes a great deal of sense from a maintenance point of view as well as in terms of cost control and the training of staff to have a standardised fleet. It is equally desirable that the purchase of new aircraft, for example, be funded from existing company resources.</P>
    <P>Who would have thought even a year ago that Aer Lingus would now be a thriving company and looking at new opportunities. I listened to the chief executive of the company who was in the House in recent weeks speak about the vision he has for Aer Lingus playing its part in an enlarged Europe. As Deputy Burton said, the opportunities are immense. A community of 500 million people is a vast customer base which presents great opportunities in the emerging new countries in eastern Europe and our new member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is more than capable of answering for himself. I suggest that until such time as there is an injection of further investment into the company, it will not be able to respond to the challenges that are being presented to it, including the change in the Shannon stopover policy. I come originally from that part of the country and I can understand that there are good emotional and other reasons for it but it has always bamboozled me why we have insisted on the arrangement at Shannon which hinders any real development in the North American market. The opportunities for tourism and investment are clearly there and they need to be maximised.</P>
      <P> The need for further streamlining of Aer Lingus goes without saying. I urge those involved in the current phase of development to continue on that courageous path. Aer Lingus has been a very loyal employer on the north side of Dublin. It has made a significant contribution to the economic life of the area&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest in other areas as well. I ask the Minister to listen carefully to cross-party urgings for further investment in infrastructure in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. The rail network is entirely absent. There needs to be a commitment to provide a rail network and to further develop the road network around the airport. I believe that is possible if there is investment in Aer Lingus and further development of Aer Rianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> Contrary to what the Labour Party wishes to see in this Bill, I believe the Government should press ahead. The Minister is to be lauded for the options he is making available to Aer Lingus and to its workforce. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had her opportunity this morning and the House listened to her. The Deputy asked the Government side to respond to her views on the ideological debate, the debate on our strategic national interests, and that is what I will do.</P>
      <P>I want to explain the context in which modern national airlines operate. We must realise that Aer Lingus is now operating in an ultra-competitive environment. Ryanair is now one of the foremost aviation companies in the world and one with which Aer Lingus competes on a daily basis. The aviation business is cyclical and aviation companies require major capital investment, as evidenced by the amount of money which Ryanair borrowed in the last few years to fund capital investment of &euro;7 billion. We are now in an environment where we cannot lend money for development of a capital base to aviation companies such as Aer Lingus because it would be in breach of EU rules of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shortall has asked for a debate on privatisation and a debate on investment, but that is missing the point of this legislation. It is to give Aer Lingus the ability to invest in its own future, which in my view cannot be achieved by simply asking the existing shareholder to borrow to expand. In the modern aviation environment it is generally recognised that airline businesses must expand and grow in order to survive. The airline cannot ask the existing shareholder for &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion to expand because it would be in <Col N="297" /> breach of the Stability and Growth Pact and in breach of EU legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government is the primary shareholder in Aer Lingus. What should it say to the company? Should it say it is not interested in giving money, that the company will have to fly its own plane and sail its own ship and that the Government wants nothing more to do with it? Should it put in place a concrete legislative framework to allow the company access to the sort of massive capital required by aviation businesses? This Bill seeks to take the latter course of action. To argue the case on the ideological grounds that this represents a sell-off of the national silver or that it will be used to prop up the budget deficit, is fundamentally to miss the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF" hpid="Mr. P. Power Mr. P. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now seeking to do so but the Deputy will not allow me to speak, which is typical. Nevertheless section 4 of the Bill makes provision for Aer Lingus Group plc to issue new shares and to create shares of different classes with different rights, subject to the Companies Act. If the Deputies really understand company law &ndash; and I doubt if some people do &ndash; that provision is clearly designed to allow sophisticated <Col N="298" /> financial arrangements and share arrangements with other entities, be it by way of strategic partnerships or by way of limited ownership or the retention of a golden share, as was mentioned by Deputy Shortall. To suggest enacting this legislation and selling off Aer Lingus tomorrow morning is a very blunt method which does not take account of the nuances of the international aviation business. That may be the Deputy's view but I do not think she appreciates the realities with which aviation companies are now working.</P>
      <P>To bring Deputy Shortall's argument to its logical conclusion, on the one hand she is saying that she is in favour of the ESOP and all for giving 15% of this company to the workers. That in itself is a very real and concrete form of privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It was part of the deal which must be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF" hpid="Mr. P. Power Mr. P. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It means the privatisation of 15% of the company. On the other hand the Deputy is saying that she is not willing to tolerate any form of privatisation whatsoever. She is either on one side of the fence or the other. The Labour Party is trying to have it both ways. Why should 15% of a company be given to the employees? It is done for genuine commercial and capital reasons. The reason the company made such an offer and such an arrangement is that it received a return for it in the same way that any company would seek strategic partners and sell off its shares to introduce fresh capital. In this case the company did not bring in fresh capital. It got genuine and substantial concessions from the unions to allow it to operate in a new competitive environment, which the Labour Party is ignoring.</P>
      <P>Some 15% of the company has already been sold off. That is privatisation, but the company has got something in return. If power and authority are given to the Minister to allow Aer Lingus to enter into strategic arrangements with other companies to provide the new airplanes for its new routes, that would be a genuine commercial business decision. It should be allowed to do that. Deputy Shortall is saying, if I interpret her correctly, that she would not allow the Government to do that or to pass this legislation, thereby completely tying the hands of the Government and the Minister so they would not be able to enter into commercial arrangements with other companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything is fine for Aer Lingus now due to the great endeavours of Willie Walsh and others who have made the company profitable. However, aviation is cyclical by nature. When the downturn comes and Aer Lingus needs a massive injection of capital from banks <Col N="299" /> or partners and there is no legislative framework to underpin such activity, it will look to the Labour Party which denied it that opportunity. Deputy Shortall asked for a fundamental debate on the reasons for the legislation. I have given her the reasons. Her comments and those made by others highlight a fundamental misunderstanding of the huge capital requirements of such companies in a modern environment.</P>

      <P>I concede the Deputy made that point. The best way to subscribe to the interests of the consumer is to give the provider of those services the flexibility in a modern environment to expand and to raise fresh capital to provide passengers with the new airplanes, routes and services to which Deputy Shortall referred. However, that cannot be done under the model proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to speak on this legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the employee share ownership plan agreed by the Government and the Aer Lingus unions. This Bill includes an enabling provision for the establishment of new pension schemes by Aer Lingus. While I strongly respect and support the democratic wishes of the trade unions on this issue &ndash; I will always give them my total support &ndash; I am concerned about the Bill in terms of providing a legal framework to facilitate any private sector investment process in the event that the Government embarks on such a process. Having listened to the debate on privatisation, I am concerned that this will not be the road ahead. I hope we do not see the destruction of a great company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves of the economic arguments. We are an island economy and we will always need a national airline. We have seen <Col N="300" /> recently how well it is able to compete with the so-called low cost airlines. When we are discussing this Bill, we should also remember the staff at Aer Rianta. I am totally opposed to the break-up of Aer Rianta. It is our jewel and it is the taxpayers' national asset. The proposed break-up is economic and social vandalism. Aer Rianta made &euro;36 million in profits and returned &euro;8 million in dividends to the Exchequer. Its charges are &euro;5.36, which the regulator said are too low. It is time to challenge the people on the economic side of this issue and the Michael O'Learys and mainland Europe Deputy Careys of this world and tell them to look at the real issues in the debate. We all agree with and support modernisation, change and efficiency. However, privatisation is not always the solution &ndash; we could look across the water for many examples of that. I have heard no good economic or social arguments, therefore, I am not convinced by the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>The staff have genuine concerns about their terms and conditions of employment and the Minister must listen to their constructive ideas. There are 1,400 workers at the airport and I stand with them on this issue. I want to ask the Minister a number of straightforward questions. Is it right during a time of so-called partnership that the Minister refuses to provide reasons for the break-up? Does a 15 minute discussion with union leaders in eight months, particularly during the summer, constitute respectful recognition of airport workers' concerns? Is it understood that as a consequence of the Minister's proposals hundreds of millions of euro, which were returned to the Government through the efforts of Aer Rianta workers and which could help in the housing, health and education crises, will be lost forever? We should discuss those issues in this debate on Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for employee shareholding schemes and the acquisition of shares in the company. Parts of the Bill are valuable and progressive and have the potential to give staff a sense of ownership of the company. That could lead to more productivity, efficiency and modernisation. The staff of Aer Lingus are in favour of that. I also welcome section 12 which includes the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and 2001, the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 and section 521 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Good legislation will always be required to ensure openness and transparency in business. We owe it to the people, to the taxpayers and the staff of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity to put on record our appreciation of all the staff at Aer Lingus and our thanks for their great contribution to Irish society. I put them on the same level as our international football team. They deserve our support and they have earned our respect. Aer Lingus has one of the best safety records in the world. I encourage the management of Aer Lingus to pay the outstanding 4% increase under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and allow the <Col N="301" /> IMPACT members to get on with their jobs. Until now they were paid only for 35 hours even when extra hours were worked. They have been flexible for years. I urge senior management to pay the staff and allow them to get on with their jobs. I urge both sides to meet as a matter of urgency and to break the impasse.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Shortall's amendment because the primary purpose of the legislation seems to be to facilitate the privatisation of Aer Lingus. I am not convinced by any sound economic, political or social justice arguments. I urge all trade Unionists and taxpayers to row in behind this position. We cannot sit back and watch our national airline being taken over or damaged by the privatisation wing of the Government. When one looks at the detail in the legislation, one has no option but to support the Labour Party amendment, particularly if one cares about our national airline. I urge all Members of the House to do that. This issue is too serious to play politics with it. It is above politics. Hence my support for the amendment.</P>
    <P>I note the drift to the right by some sections of Irish society and our national media. Semi-State workers and public servants seem to be under pressure. It is time to draw a line in the sand on issues, such as Aer Lingus. The fat cats in our society are trying to bully their way to the top of the political and economic agenda. That level of arrogance must be tackled. It seems to be getting more difficult to defend the interests of working people, particularly the weaker sections of society. We have undergone rapid social, economic and political change in the past decade which has had a profound impact on our value system. Difficult decisions about the distribution of resources raise awkward questions for society.</P>
    <P>There is a tension between the rights of individuals and the overall good of society. How will this be resolved? Our people are looking for guidance. The political elite and big business interests seem to get away with anything they want. We need real debate and real leadership and vision. This debate on Aer Lingus is part of the analysis of the ethics and values of our society. We need a society that is able to create wealth and distribute it equitably. Aer Lingus is a great company, providing jobs and services for our people. It should never be threatened with privatisation. Hence my concern about this legislation.</P>

      <P>This Government and the last one have been responsible for many fiascos over the past six long and tortuous years, and I hope the electorate will not allow it to forget that. I cannot address this Bill without touching on one of the biggest disasters of those six years, the privatisation of Eircom, a semi-State company like Aer Lingus. In July of this year we learned that a &euro;446 million dividend was awarded to itself by Valentia, the current owner of Eircom. The dividend, of course, was distributed by a British shelf company. This exposed how the public <Col N="302" /> has been robbed not once, not twice, but three times by the marriage of interests between this Government and the privateers who are ever waiting for opportunity. The Government provides them with opportunity aplenty.</P>
      <P>First, a valuable State asset was broken up and up to half a million people, the vast majority of whom had never had share investments, were encouraged &ndash; persuaded, indeed &ndash; by the Government to purchase Eircom shares at inflated prices. Many ordinary citizens borrowed to buy these shares out of a sense of duty and patriotism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>All who retained their shares lost out. Second, in November 2001 people who had bought the Eircom shares were faced with a dilemma as the so-called offer to sell to Valentia was launched. It was a case of take it or leave it &ndash; either they took the offer or they lost out. Finally, during the past summer we saw a &euro;446 million dividend being paid to the owners of Valentia, including a &euro;20 million dividend paid to Tony O'Reilly personally. These were moneys that could have been invested in developing an effective telecommunications, broadband and Internet system in this country, something the Government has failed to do. It clearly allowed this rip-off of the people of this State and the destruction of their hopes and aspirations for the future. This debacle has clearly exposed the privatisation agenda of the Government.</P>
      <P>The most recent manifestation of this policy is the Aer Lingus Bill. This is a deceitful and duplicitous Bill. The sugar coating of employee share ownership hides a very bitter pill for the people as a whole. Aer Lingus belongs to each and every one of us. What is the reward for the loyalty of so many people who, through the years, would never opt for a cheaper airline offer or another airline in the competitive market, staying solidly, rigidly and loyally with Aer Lingus through all its difficulties? Does that merit nothing? The Aer Lingus unions naturally negotiated in the interests of their memberships and nobody can fault them for that, but our concerns must be wider. They must be for the Irish people as a whole, not the current workforce at Aer Lingus. What about the future workforce? What about the strategic interests of the people of this island nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking to the media at the Labour Relations Commission on 21 July last, the Taoiseach, in his much-reported commentary, stated that he was not a supporter of privatisation, &ldquo;even if that is not the view of my colleagues&rdquo;. This is a most extraordinary view from the leader of a Government, a person who obviously sits at the Cabinet table. Is it possible that the Taoiseach refuses to express himself at the Cabinet table? Does he refuse to engage with his colleagues and impress his views on them? I cannot for a moment believe <Col N="303" /> that he keeps his views to himself, yet that is the inference in his commentary.</P>
    <P>We have seen Aer Lingus recover in recent years from a very difficult period, especially the period following the events of 11 September 2001. We have seen the workforce accept job losses and the company increase its efficiency and enhance its place as a world-class player and competitor in the airline market. In other words, the airline has repaid very well the trust, investment and support of the people.</P>
    <P>We in Sinn Féin will strongly oppose the privatisation of Aer Lingus. We will strongly oppose this Bill because we do not see it as the cloaked presentation that the Government wants us to see. We see it for what it is. It is not just the thin edge, but a clear, signalled intent on the part of the Minister and his colleagues at Cabinet to move towards the privatisation and the sell-off of one of the most important assets we have. We will rigidly oppose this at every opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several areas in which Aer Lingus has abdicated its responsibility as a national, flag-carrying airline. I represent the constituency of Cork South-Central and Aer Lingus, while it has made a remarkable recovery in balance sheet terms, has made decisions that call into question its role as a national airline &ndash; I speak of the decision of Aer Lingus to absent itself from the Cork-Dublin route. How any national company can seek not to provide a service between the two largest urban areas in its country beggars belief. The response from the Government has been lacking, as has the response from the company.</P>
      <P>Last week I tabled a parliamentary question in which I asked the Minister to what extent his office had communicated with Aer Lingus about its decision not to continue services on this route. The answer the Minister gave me, while honest, says something about the willingness of the Minister to employ Government policy in this area. He has not put one word down on paper, nor has he uttered one syllable to the company about whether this decision was the correct one for the Cork region or for the country in general. Deputy Brennan might claim to be a hands-off Minister, but at the same time he is prepared to tell Iarnród Éireann how it should conduct its construction works, at a possible cost of &euro;900,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy for the area, I am unhappy with the Minister's reply and with the response of the company. I, with others in the constituency, have written to the chief executive and have not received one word in response. The Minister will argue that the service will continue to be provided by Aer Arann and, to a small extent, Air Wales. However, Aer Arann has no service facilities in Cork Airport. If anything goes wrong with an aircraft, maintenance must be done in Dublin and spare parts and alternative aircraft must be flown to Cork. I have experienced the quality of service offered by Aer Arann and I do not think <Col N="304" /> it is suitable. There have been several dozen cancellations of flights from the Cork area.</P>

      <P>Fair enough. Aer Lingus now operates on the smallest possible margins, providing the least possible service. The additional services that Aer Lingus has chosen to provide from Cork to mainland European locations are not new &ndash; the company is piggy-backing on routes that have been opened by a private enterprise company. If this is the business practice of the new, streamlined Aer Lingus, we in the House need to ask serious questions about where the company is going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in emergency medicine or accident and emergency departments reflect system-wide issues, such as the demand experienced by each hospital and the resources available to it, as well as the structure, organisation and staffing profile of the hospital. Therefore, in tackling the problems in emergency medicine it is necessary to take a whole-system approach involving primary care, acute care and sub-acute and community care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal has undertaken a detailed review of the structures, operation and staffing of emergency medicine departments. The report, entitled Report of the Committee on Accident and Emergency Services, not only deals with the staffing of emergency medicine departments at consultant level but also links reform of emergency medicine departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows through the hospitals. The report provides valuable advice on the structure of our emergency services and the necessary linkages which <Col N="305" /> will be required to eliminate delays in emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Emergency medicine departments are subject to peaks and troughs but can become particularly busy in the winter months. This is mainly due to the high number of patients presenting with circulatory, respiratory and viral conditions, especially among the elderly. To deal with the current pressures on acute services both in the shorter term and longer term, I would like to outline to the House some of the key actions I have taken.</P>
    <P>Pressures on emergency medicine departments can be due to the lack of available beds within the hospital. Increasing the bed capacity of the acute hospital system nationally is, therefore, a key priority. Following a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed needs, the Government decided to provide an additional 3,000 acute beds in the period to 2011. I introduced the first phase of this process in January 2002, which provided funding for an additional 709 beds. Over 560 new beds have been provided in hospitals throughout the country. Some hospitals that were not part of that initiative, particularly in the Dublin region, have temporarily closed some beds this year for financial reasons to remain within budget. These closures are in addition to the normal seasonal closures that take place in hospitals around the country during holiday periods. Currently the number of beds not in use represents less than 3% of overall capacity in the acute hospital system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>It has been widely documented that there are a number of patients in acute hospital beds who have completed their acute phase of treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. The availability of suitable sub-acute beds is a particular problem in the eastern and southern regions. In this regard I have provided additional funding of &euro;5.5 million in 2003 to the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash;&euro;3.8 million &ndash; and to the Southern Health Board &ndash;&euro;1.7 million &ndash; to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting thus freeing up acute beds. This money allows for the funding through the subvention system of additional beds in the private nursing home sector and ongoing support in the community. I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that more than 200 patients are expected to be discharged from acute hospitals as a direct result of this funding.</P>
    <P>A total of 15 beds in St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny, for use as acute rehabilitation beds are due to come on stream in November once refurbishment is complete. These additional sub-acute beds will further assist in the discharge of patients from Beaumont Hospital to a more appropriate setting.</P>
    <P>As part of the winter initiative package in 2000-01, I announced additional funding of &euro;40 million aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients. Part of this invest<Col N="306" /> ment package was aimed at the recruitment of additional emergency medicine consultants and consultant anaesthetists. To date, 20 additional accident and emergency consultants have been recruited. Further appointments are being progressed by the health boards and the ERHA. The availability of senior medical staff in emergency medicine departments should facilitate rapid clinical decision making, enhanced management, diagnosis and treatment of patients.</P>
    <P>In relation to staffing of emergency medicine departments, nursing management has been strengthened by upgradings and the assignment of additional staff in recent years to ensure that appropriate senior nursing staff are available at all times.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the bed management function is fundamental to the consistent application of admission and discharge policy within acute hospitals. In May 2002, CAPITA Consulting were commissioned by the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, to carry out a national review of the bed management function. This review found considerable evidence of good bed management practice around the country. However, in areas where the bed management function was underdeveloped, CAPITA made specific recommendations that will assist hospitals to structure more effective and integrated bed management departments. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the CAPITA report are now being progressed by a combined management and nursing union steering group under the chairmanship of the HSEA.</P>
    <P>The integration of emergency services into the overall hospital framework provides the opportunity to deliver emergency care through the collective efforts of the entire hospital staff. One such hospital is St. Luke's in Kilkenny where innovative solutions and a hospital wide response have improved the delivery of emergency services to patients. The benefit of having a medical assessment unit on site has facilitated the rapid assessment and treatment of medical patients to a point where approximately one third of all medical patients referred to the unit by general practitioners can be discharged on the same day.</P>
    <P>Improving the physical capacity and surroundings is an important element of the provision of an efficient emergency service. A number of capital developments have been completed in recent years and others are under way around the country aimed at improving emergency medicine departments. Examples of major new developments can be seen at Cork University Hospital and Tullamore General Hospital and an extensive refurbishment of the emergency medicine department is taking place at the Mater Hospital. Another recent development is the acute medical assessment unit at St. James's Hospital, which opened earlier this year. This unit has contributed to a noticeable improvement in the delivery of emergency services at the hospital.</P>
    <P>As the House may be aware, I launched the influenza vaccination campaign 2003-04 on 24 <Col N="307" /> September 2003. Many respiratory diseases occur every winter but influenza is one of the most severe. In those with underlying diseases, especially the elderly, complications are common and hospitalisation rates are high. Considerable resources are devoted each year to treating patients in emergency medicine departments and as in-patients in hospital who contract influenza and subsequently develop complications.</P>
    <P>The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland advises that influenza vaccine should be considered for all health care workers who have direct patient contact in both the community and health care institutions, such as hospitals and nursing homes. I have asked that the health boards encourage health care workers, particularly those on the front line to be immunised annually against influenza. My Department has written to the health boards' chief executive officers requesting that they encourage their staff to be immunised as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Emergency medicine departments sometimes have to deal with injuries and conditions which are more appropriate to a primary care setting. There are out of hours co-operatives in all health board areas at present, the majority of which provide full out of hours cover while others in the eastern region provide limited hours of operation. The level of patient satisfaction with the service being offered by the co-operatives is very high from both the patient and provider perspectives. Government support for the development of general practitioner out of hours co-operatives nationally for the period 1997 to 2003 amounted to &euro;46.5 million. In time, these co-operatives can be developed to provide a much wider range of services to ensure that communities, irrespective of size and distance from major urban centres, enjoy appropriate access to primary care services.</P>
    <P>The nature of emergency medicine presents a particular challenge in relation to the appropriate measures needed to deal with the issue. As I have already said, the various problems can only be addressed on a system-wide basis. I want to assure the House of my continuing commitment to ensuring the appropriate management response to the provision of emergency services.</P>

      <P>The chaos over the summer period in accident and emergency units, especially in the Dublin area, is totally unacceptable. Patients were left on trolleys for days, while others were treated in ambulances in hospital car parks. Given that such serious overcrowding took place over the summer and continues to occur now, which is traditionally a period of low demand, how does the Minister expect these services to cope during the winter months? Will he open any of the beds that have been closed around the country in recent months to ensure that the accident and emergency services are ready for the dif<Col N="308" /> ficulties he has mentioned are likely to arise from now to next March or April?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional part of my reply dealt with that issue. In July, I allocated about &euro;5.5 million to the system, particularly to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which received &euro;3.8 million to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting, thus freeing up beds for other patients. I met the ERHA, and the management of the two hospitals that were particularly concerned at that stage, and received a breakdown of the application of that money to free up beds in the acute hospitals. The ERHA has informed me that more than 200 patients are expected to be discharged from acute hospitals as a direct result of this funding, which will alleviate pressures on accident and emergency services.</P>
      <P>Every hospital in the region will benefit from this initiative. In addition, I have provided funding for the opening of 15 acute rehabilitation beds in St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny, which will be used by Beaumont Hospital. Some years ago, I purchased St. Joseph's for Beaumont Hospital from private concerns to be made available for public patients but, to date, it has not been used for that purpose. I spoke with the Northern Area Health Board in July and I insisted that something had to happen in this regard. I provided additional funding to open those 15 acute rehabilitation beds, which will again alleviate pressures on Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>Since the winter initiative 2000-01 &ndash; there was much scepticism at the time about the number of accident and emergency consultants who would come on stream as a result &ndash; about 20 consultants have been recruited, of the 25 agreed. Some 18 anaesthetists have also been appointed as a result of that initiative.</P>

      <P>In the programme for Government, the Minister stated that he would implement a full range of measures to improve accident and emergency services by significantly reducing waiting times and by having senior doctors available at all times. Progress has not been made in this area, however. Will the Minister respond to the concerns that have been expressed about the fact that waiting times have not been reduced, despite the promise in the programme for Government? The Minister commented on Beaumont but will he also comment on the situation in Birr and Mullingar?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have outlined, additional measures have been taken. More than 20 extra senior clinical decision-makers have been recruited as a result of initiatives I have taken. That is a quantum leap forward, historically, in terms of the numbers of emergency medicine consultants we had.</P>

      <P>In addition, chest pain clinics have been established in many hospitals, which have had a dramatic impact on waiting times for those with chest pains, including cardiac conditions. Other hospitals have examined different ways of managing admissions and emergencies. There was a good article recently in <i>The Irish Times</i> dealing with the example of St. Luke's in Kilkenny where an innovative solution involving a hospital-wide approach to the delivery of emergency services was developed. That has had a significant impact. About one third of all medical patients referred to that unit by general practitioners can be discharged on the same day. That is the type of progress that can be made by reorganising and looking innovatively at solutions to this issue.</P>
      <P>The other example concerns the acute medical assessment in St. James's Hospital, which is another major development that we have funded. That has also made a significant impact on the admissions issue there.</P>

      <P>The health reform programme was announced on 18 June 2003. The programme's priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management. The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Heath System, which were published on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government considered the recommendations made in both reports and has decided on a number of priority actions to move on system reform. The new structure set out in this reform <Col N="310" /> programme will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management. It will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed that to succeed it would be necessary to clearly set out the Government's vision of reform to all within the existing health system, including board members, staff and staff representatives. This engagement was undertaken as a vital first step in the implementation process. This is the process on which we have been engaged in recent months.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General and I briefed every senior manager of every agency in the system in the days after the Government's decision. There followed a visit to every health board area, meeting large numbers of staff and board members. The Department commissioned the office for health management, OHM, to conduct an information and consultation exercise to reach as many people and agencies as possible in the system. Over 20,000 staff were directly engaged with throughout the summer months and into September. The draft report of the OHM is currently with the Department and will be made public shortly.</P>
    <P>Overall co-ordination of the change programme is supported by a project office, led at assistant secretary level, which reports to the Secretary General of the Department. Output to date from the project office includes a draft project plan for the reform programme, identifying manageable phases of implementation, and the establishment of 13 action projects to advance specific elements of the programme by end of year.</P>
    <P>The next steps will involve the appointment of a national steering committee to oversee the implementation process as well as the establishment of a board for the interim health service executive, HSE. I am considering possible nominees for both bodies at the moment. I intend to report back to Government shortly with proposed appointees, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>The reforms will require legislation to implement them. Work has commenced on the preparation of this legislation, which will provide the statutory basis for the establishment of the new health service executive and related structures. The new legislation will also incorporate other legal changes required and my aim is to introduce the necessary legislation next year. I am satisfied that the preparatory work on which we have been engaged has been undertaken with the appropriate degree of professionalism and urgency. This programme affects every aspect of the health system and everyone working in it &ndash; close to 100,000 people. If it is to have lasting impact, particularly for patients and clients, it must be professionally planned and executed. I am more than satisfied that the planning and initial consultation phase we have just completed will pay dividends in the longer run.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the great promise presented to the Irish public with the launch of these reports has now run into the sand? Even the person who chaired the Brennan report has been strongly critical of the lack of progress. Could he comment on these criticisms in relation to the delay, the lethargy and the lack of commitment in terms of dealing with the very urgent issues relating to lack of management? Will he not recognise also that to leave it to Department officials and chief executive officers of health boards to devise the programme for reform in a sense is to leave it to the inmates in the asylum to get things right? These are the people who are criticised very strongly in both reports, not personally but in terms of management. Yet these are the people who appear to be in charge of any reform package. Does the Minister not accept that is simply a guarantee of failure?</P>
      <P>What does he think of Professor Brennan's point that the implementation body needs to be headed up by an independent person and that anybody in that capacity within the health service would have a conflict of interest? In terms of his comments, could he deal with that particular issue and when the implementation body will be set up, when the interim HSE will be put in place? How are these to be funded this year since the Minister for Finance has made it clear that this is about cost cutting and cost saving rather than fundamental health service reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government took its decision on 18 June, it then decided that the head of the national steering group would be an independent person. The Government also decided, at my suggestion, that the chairperson of the HSE would be an independent person, external to the health community. That has always been the position. There is nothing new there. To suggest that those who currently work at management level in the health service are the equivalent of inmates of an asylum is wrong, and possibly not fair to those operating within the system and structures and legislative framework they have been mandated to work within.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to change that legislative framework but ultimately if you have 96,000 people in a service it is necessary to bring people with you. In terms of the partnership models we have developed in this country which have been good in terms of economic performance, productivity and so on, I believe part of our success to date is the enthusiasm that has followed the lengthy tour the Secretary General and I took right throughout July to every board. We spoke to meetings that had up to 600 people in attendance. People had concerns as to where they would fit, timetables, 'road maps' forward and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was surprisingly little hostility to the reforms, however, or negativity about them. I take the view that many people working in the health service are enthusiastic about the reforms. <Col N="312" /> This has been reflected in terms of the project teams we have established. The numbers applying who want to be part of the change and who want to lead it are significant and reflect a sense of people wanting to get on with it.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the thesis that just because someone works in the service they cannot be part of a reform package. Given the complexity of the health service it is inevitable that people will have to be involved in terms of organising the change, transition processes and so on. Broadly speaking, the broad management of the health care system has accepted the reform package, which in essence means the abolition of the health board structure as we know it and the establishment of new structures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question in relation to the interim bodies, the HSE and the implementation body. Does he not have concerns, if this is such an acceptable process, that the difficult decisions are not going to be made? There are clearly major problems in terms of the management and structures across the country. He set up two reviews to examine the problems. The impression he is now giving is that there are no difficult issues to be addressed and no hard decisions will have to be made, that the health service can meander along nicely and everything will be all right. That was not the impression he gave in July when he launched these reports. There was an impression of a dynamic that had taken off and but it would seem it has run out of steam already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The key fundamental decision has been taken. The rest is operational process, detailed hard work which has to happen. We have said that we are going to change the structure. We are abolishing the existing health board structures. We are establishing a new national health service executive and reducing the number of agencies currently in place. Those decisions have been taken, but there is a huge amount of detail involved in bringing about the legislative and human resource changes, the merging of different offices etc. There are difficult decisions in the operational sense and in terms of processing&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>the number of GMS lists in each health board that do not have a full-time contracted general practitioner; the length of time the post is run by a locum doctor; the number of GMS general practitioner lists that are under the direct supervision or management of the health boards; and if their attention has been drawn to the manpower problems in general practise.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22646/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently 27 GMS lists in nine health board areas which do not have a full-time contracted general practitioner. There are 11 GMS lists under the direct supervision or management of the health boards. The length of time varies, in the main, from between two to 24 months.</P>
      <P>There are a variety of reasons why GMS lists either do not have a contracted GP or are under health board control. Of these, seven relate to the resignation of the GP, four to approved leave of absence, three to extended sick leave and two to retirement. One is due to the reorganisation of a panel and one is a vacant post. A further three panels are occupied by &ldquo;assistants with a view&rdquo; to becoming partners in the practices, and taking over the lists. There are approximately seven further panels, covered by a locum, where clarification is still being sought by my Department.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will have noted, vacancies in the GP panels arise for valid and understandable reasons, such as sick leave or approved leave of absence. The Department and the health boards are acutely aware of needs in the area of general practice and meet routinely with the Irish College of General Practitioners to discuss the development of general professional and general practice training. The Department is committed to ensuring adequate cover for GP panels and also supports other important initiatives to enhance GP working conditions. It will also encourage the development of training programmes towards the achievement of both the highest standards of GP training and the provision of the increasing number of general practitioners required for primary care services in the future, as resources permit. The number of GPs with full-time GMS contracts has increased from 1,679 in 1999 to 2,134 in 2002.</P>

      <P>There was a large increase in GP numbers shortly after the introduction of the over 70s deal. Some of us felt this deal discriminates against means tested medical card patients. However, that is an argument for another day. Manpower in general practice is based on supply of general practitioners and the demand on the service from patients. On the supply side the vocational training schemes are not producing enough general practitioners and many of those who are coming through do not want to work outside the affluent areas. Nobody, even those established in general practice, wants to work on call, especially on the very onerous rotas that exist in isolated rural areas.</P>

      <P>None of these factors has been addressed. Only 1% of graduates from universities have expressed a willingness to work in single-handed practices. However, half of the doctors who will retire in the next ten years work in single-handed practices. On the demand side, the population in my constituency has increased by 10%. Thank God, the expectations of younger and older patients have increased. Younger people are presenting for tests such as cholesterol, diabetes and blood pressure, and we have an increasing elderly population for which we are making no allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the same question without the need for a supplementary. What will we do about the impending crisis in general practice when the population of GPs is ageing and young people are not coming into it in the numbers required? We seem to have our heads in the sand about this as appears to be confirmed by the Hanly report, which will suggest moving more workload into primary care. There is no capacity in primary care to take that on. As the Minister knows, the primary care strategy is moving so slowly that it is almost deemed irrelevant. These are the issues about GP manpower and service that need to be answered. Some doctors are no longer in their practices and we are finding it difficult to replace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising some valid concerns about the future of general practice. Hanly has looked at certain elements of medical manpower as part of its remit. In conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, I have recently established a group involving the deans of medicine in the universities, the Higher Education Authority and the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science with a view to having a complete re-examination of undergraduate medical education and to establish recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept there are difficulties in certain areas. For socio-economic reasons we have a greater preponderance of GPs in certain areas as opposed to others. We need to look at that in a more focused way. The GP co-operative initiat<Col N="315" /> ive, which was designed to improve the quality of life for GPs, was effective in giving viable career options of quality in rural and urban areas. We have developed those very quickly and we do not get enough credit for the rapid development of GP co-operatives around the country. Every health board area now has a GP co-operative and cumulatively we have spent about &euro;46 million in a relatively short time towards the provision of GP co-operatives, which has a direct relationship with attracting and retaining people in general practice. Dublin is one area where the GP co-operatives have not taken off with the same effectiveness as they have around the country and one does not detect the same degree of enthusiasm in certain parts of Dublin for the general practice co-operatives as elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Organisational reform was a key framework for change proposed in the national health strategy with the aim of providing a responsive, adaptable health system, which meets the needs of the population effectively and at affordable cost. To this end action 114 of the strategy provided that an independent audit of the structures and functions of the Irish health system would be carried out. Prospectus Strategy <Col N="316" /> Consultants were commissioned to carry out the audit in 2002.</P>
      <P>In his budget statement in December 2001 my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, indicated that a commission would be established to examine, evaluate and make recommendations on the relevant financial systems, practices and procedures throughout the health services. In April 2002 the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service was established. Both reports were published on 18 June and both concluded that the system was highly fragmented with overlap and uncertainty in terms of who was responsible for services delivered. This fragmentation means the system is increasingly hard to manage as a national service.</P>
      <P>The Government made key decisions relating to reform of the health service. The key elements of the programme include a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies to reduce fragmentation, including the abolition of the existing health board and authority structures; the reorganisation of the Department of Health and Children to ensure improved policy development and oversight; the establishment of a health services executive which will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single national entity, the executive of which will be organised on the basis of three core divisions, a national hospitals office, a primary, community and continuing care directorate and a national shared services centre; the establishment of a health information and quality authority; the modernisation of supporting processes; and the strengthening of governance and accountability across the system. In an earlier reply I detailed the steps that I have taken on the implementation of these reforms.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General and I briefed every senior manager of every agency in the system in the days after the Government's decision. More than 20,000 staff were directly engaged over the summer months with the Office of Health Management in a very detailed consultation exercise.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>The draft report of the OHM is currently with the Department and will be made public shortly. Overall co-ordination of the change programme is supported by a project office led at assistant secretary level, which reports to the Secretary General of the Department. Output to date from the project office includes a draft project plan for the reform programme, identifying manageable phases of implementation, and establishment of 13 action projects to advance specific elements of the programme by end year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next steps will involve the appointment of a national steering committee to oversee the implementation process and the establishment of a board for the interim health service executive. I am considering possible nominees for both bodies at the moment. I intend to report back to Government in the coming weeks with proposed <Col N="317" /> appointees, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The reforms will require legislation to implement them. Work has commenced on the preparation of this legislation, which will provide the statutory basis for the establishment of the new health service executive and related structures.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the public have lost confidence in all reforms as they see no tangible improvements &ndash; as discussed earlier, there are disimprovements? There is a view that we will get more reports and information but no real reform. How many positions will be abolished under the health services to ensure that improvements take place? Does the Minister not agree that there is more centralisation at a time when more countries are discovering that centralisation simply does not work? Does he agree that his decision to abolish the health boards is the only decision he has taken so far?</P>
      <P>Given the need to implement the European working time directive, Ireland's non-consultant doctors' working hours will have to reduce to an average of 58 hours per week by August 2004. If that is not done Ireland will be liable for a fine of &euro;10,000 for each day the directive is breached. What proposal has the Minister to ensure we meet that directive? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention on the reform programme. Reform is going to happen. We have made the decisions, not just about abolition of health boards; it is a major contraction in terms of the numbers of agencies. Both reports took the view that there was a multiplicity of agencies within the health service which had grown up over the previous decade or so.</P>
      <P>It is not just one particular dimension that is being examined, it is an integrated programme of reform. Announcing reform and organising the detail of that reform are two different things. One needs to set up a process by which the reform can happen realistically and professionally. We need realism in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put in a professional process to bring about the detailed change that will underpin the reform. I make no apology for engaging in a very wide consultation process. I said on 18 June that <Col N="318" /> I would do this and that there would be three months' consultation with the stakeholders in health. If I did not do that I can guarantee that Priority Questions Nos. 1-3 today would be inquiries from Deputy Neville as to why the Minister did not consult with staff and workers in the health service and claiming it is a disgrace that he did not do so.</P>
    <P>The workers and the stakeholders in the health service have done a very good job in terms of delivering services on the ground. They are entitled to be consulted on rolling out the reform programme, their concerns and views.</P>

      <P>There may be some repetition here. I have outlined to this House in some detail the scale and scope of the reform programme in the health sector. This programme affects almost every aspect of the system, in terms of structures and in terms of governance, accountability, planning, monitoring and evaluation.</P>
      <P>It has implications for every organisation in the system and, of course, there will be new structures in some cases. Inevitably, this will require a fundamental reform of the existing statutory provisions for the roles, functions, organisational structure and management of the health system.</P>
      <P>In line with the Department's approach on the reform programme, an action project has been established to prepare this legislation, which will provide the statutory basis for the establishment of the new agencies, consistent with the Government decision on the implementation of the Brennan and Prospectus reports recommendations. The new legislation will also incorporate any other consequential changes which may be necessary to give effect to the new reformed health system. It will also incorporate legislative proposals arising from the other action projects. I envisage that I will be in a position to introduce the necessary legislation next year.</P>

      <P>The Minister is right, the reply is somewhat repetitive. I want to know when this Bill will appear on the list of promised legislation so that we can hold him to account. It is still not on the list, as he knows. Perhaps I can be repetitive and ask the Minister, as Deputy Neville did, how this reform package will result in savings. Would he agree that the reform programme will not deal with the real problem in Irish hospitals, which is capacity? Is he aware of the recent state<Col N="320" /> ment by Dr. Colm Quigley, President of the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association, that no matter how one redesigns a litre bottle it is still a litre bottle? How are he and this reform package going to deal with the capacity problem? Is it not really a matter of investment and is it not the case that he has failed to convince the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to invest more in our health service?</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to react to the statement by Mr. Maurice Neligan that the services are now in such a state of chaos that the Minister should resign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>A matter so fundamental as a new health Act is not produced in a matter of three months. There is fundamental change in the legislative underpinning of health for the future. That is envisaged by the health reform package, and as I said in my reply, it will be next year before the full outline of that new Act will be ready. We have appointed people specifically to look at the legislative framework because when one dissolves some organisations one creates others and one has to look at the sets of relationships between them and the Oireachtas and the Executive, and the remaining agencies within the service.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the Prospectus Report he will see that it points to the complexities in any health system globally. It says in particular that this is a major undertaking in terms of reform of this health package. It cannot be understated and therefore needs a considered, detailed and planned approach to its execution. That is what is in hand. Prior to the drafting of the legislation we will appoint an interim health services executive board which will prepare the ground for the appointment of a chief executive officer and other officers and will put out the fledgling board itself. In tandem with that, the legislative work will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one ever said we would achieve this under <Col N="321" /> a new health Act in four or five months. We all have enough experience in this House to know that even legislation far less significant than this has taken a considerable time to prepare, draft and pass through the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;no one can argue with the fact that in recent years we have secured very significant additional funding for health, particularly since 1997, rates far above those of any other country's annual rates of increase and investment. Health covers much more than acute hospitals. It includes disability, child care services, the elderly and homelessness. That said, the increase has been staggering by any yardstick and has brought significant improvements in service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Already, the stock reply to questions on operational matters or health board policy or strategy is that the Minister has written to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board with a request to communicate directly with the Deputy concerned.</P>

      <P>No. In the operation of the health services, the health services executive will be responsible, but will be accountable to the Minister of the day and, through the Minister, to the Oireachtas. The legislation will have to reflect this. In addition, we have signalled in our reform programme that the Oireachtas Joint Committee <Col N="322" /> on Health and Children should have certain oversight roles in relation to accountability of the health services executive.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the changes proposed by the Minister for Education and Science for entry to the medical sciences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Education and Science requested the Higher Education Authority to commission a report into alternative methods of entry to high points health science courses at third level. The main drivers of this initiative were a perceived distortion of the points system and a fuelling of pressures on leaving certificate students because of the high points required for these courses. The report recommended that entry to a range of health sciences programmes should be on a postgraduate basis. It is proposed that the revised arrangements would be introduced initially in medicine, with other disciplines to follow.</P>
      <P>These far-reaching proposals will require careful consideration and examination, especially in view of the impact that change would have on the supply of doctors and other health professionals to the health system. The need to produce health science graduates, including doctors, who are equipped with the broad range of professional skills and technical competencies which education currently provides is essential. There will be an ongoing requirement to meet the needs of the health system for staff in appropriate disciplines and numbers. It will also be important to ensure that all levels, including hospital, community and primary care, have the necessary capacity to provide the training opportunities required of undergraduate education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the Minister for Education and Science, I have established a working group on undergraduate medical education. The membership of this group includes the five deans of the medical schools, representatives from the major teaching hospitals, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Finance, the national task force on medical staffing, the Medical Council, the Higher Education Authority, the nursing profession, the university sector and public interest representation. As part of its work, this group will consider the issues involved in the changes proposed in the report. It is expected that this group will report next year. At that stage a clearer indication of the implications of these proposals and <Col N="323" /> the detailed implementation issues which need to be addressed will emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a basic problem which is not being addressed in this regard? Universities and colleges have a vested interest in attracting foreign students to study medicine in Ireland. It is to their benefit to do so. Is the Minister aware, as indicated by the most recent figures available to me, that less than half the students currently studying medicine in this country are Irish? While nobody objects to foreigners being invited to study medicine in this country, does the Minister agree we have now reached a stage where we are not producing sufficient Irish medical graduates because of a distortion in the system? Universities and colleges find it more attractive, from their perspective, to bring in foreign students, because the money follows them. This matter is not being addressed in the arrangement which the Minister has set up.</P>
      <P>Having regard to Deputy Twomey's comments in this context, does the Minister recognise there is a serious problem in GP areas, and in other areas also, in terms of shortage of doctors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we are taking the right approach. First, the deans of medicine came to my Department, not just on issues of capacity and numbers but also on broader issues of curriculum content, the future quality of graduates, international best practice and so on. The remit is necessarily broad and it is important to get it right. I accept the Deputy's point with regard to the incentives which universities have in terms of attracting overseas students who pay full fees. That structure has existed for a long time. The reality is that it has become an important revenue strand for universities and medical schools. However, the issue at this stage is not only in relation to doctors, it also relates to entry to the wider area of general medical science degrees before one proceeds to a particular specialty. For the first time in a long period, we are developing programmes within the ambit of the medical schools for the allied health care professionals, including speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Nursing also comes under that remit. It is important to get matters right. I believe the structures we have put in place will give us that result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has diverted from the point of my question. Nobody objects to the development of this approach to medical education. Does he agree he has a responsibility to ensure there are sufficient places available to cater for own professionals? He is not dealing with that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put three questions to the Minister. Does he agree there are downsides to his consensual, slow-motion style of decision making and that he could make decisions on the <Col N="324" /> excellent report of the Higher Education Authority by simply calling all the interest groups which he listed to his office for a day and making decisions on the basis of what they have told him? He is losing months in the process of setting up a working group to look at a report which has already covered all the ground.</P>
      <P>Taking my second and third points together, what are the Minister's views as to the impact on the supply of doctors as a result of acceptance of the proposed recommendations? Will he also elaborate on the capacity issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch the second part of the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to an impact on the supply of doctors, about which he was worried in relation to accepting the Higher Education Authority recommendations. He also referred to a capacity problem with regard to training. Will he elaborate on each of those aspects, as well as answering my initial question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's second point, if one develops a new system of entry to the medical profession, there is liable to be a transition period during which one must ensure there is not an interval of a year or two during which there are no graduates emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The same could apply in this instance if we adopt a new method of entry. There could be a period without graduates. We need to ensure that does not happen or, alternatively, provide contingency plans to avoid the downside of such a situation. That potential currently exists in relation to the nursing profession and we are taking contingency steps in that regard. On the question of capacity, additional training places would be required in the universities.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board proposes to develop eight CNUs in the following locations: St. Finbarr's Hospital, Farranlea Road and Ballincollig in the Cork south Lee area; St. Stephen's Hospital, Glanmire, and St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranbraher, in the Cork north Lee area; Mount Alvernia Hospital, Mallow in the north Cork area; Bantry in the west Cork area and Ballyard, Tralee in Kerry. These additional beds are currently not available, as the process of providing services under a PPP arrangement requires the health board or authority to abide by the Department of Finance guidance on PPPs, Interim Guidelines for the Provision of Infrastructure and Capital Investments through Public Private Partnerships, and the EU procurement legislation for projects of this size. There are a number of stages in the process which must be completed before these facilities will be provided. The first phase involved the preparation of a preliminary business case and the appointment of business advisers in respect of each of the projects.</P>
      <P>The current phase of the project involves the preparation of a public sector benchmark, PSB, by the ERHA and the SHB, with the assistance of business advisers and the National Development Finance Agency. On completion of the PSB, it will be submitted to my Department which will examine the proposal before it is submitted for approval to the Department of Finance. It will analyse whether the PPP proposal offers value for money in comparison with the most efficient form of public procurement. If approved by the Department of Finance, the next stage for the ERHA and the SHB will be to advertise in the official journal of the European Union for consortia to design, build, finance and partially operate the facilities. It is expected that a preferred bidder will be selected by the end of 2004 and the facilities to become operational on a phased basis during 2006-07.</P>

      <P>In 2001 the Government promised an additional 709 acute hospital beds and the Department's report in June indicated that 303 extra beds had been created for patients at that time. Will the Minister confirm that information? How does that tally with the situation where in the last week of September, the Eastern Regional Health Authority closed 184 beds, of which only 11 were private beds, with 173 being public beds?</P>
      <P>This is another example of the two-tier system and the critical imbalance in favour of those who can afford to pay as opposed to those dependent on the public health system. Should the Minister not concentrate on increasing beds in that sector instead of looking now and again at public private partnerships?</P>

      <P>When I was Minister for Education and Science, I decided to seek involvement in the first public private partnership in education and it delivered five secondary schools in a most expeditious and efficient manner. Those schools are now open and people should visit them to see their high specification. When the opportunity came up to try a pilot health project under the public private partnership initiative under the NDP, I decided again to have a go and see if we could involve help, particularly in the context of community nursing units.</P>
      <P>The ESRI will be advising that public private partnerships should continue to form part of the overall infrastructural agenda for the next five years for efficiency purposes, from design to completion of building. In the initial phase there is a lot of work involved with public procurement and the EU. I accept that can be protracted but there is now an official in the Department who focuses on that and does nothing else, and a review of the processing of PPPs is under way. The traditional procurement process is ongoing for other community nursing units.</P>
      <P>We have a particular problem in the two regions from which the PPPs have come in terms of historical under-provision of community nursing units. The judgment is that if we can successfully execute these PPPs, we will bring on board a significant number of beds in key areas where there has been under-provision leading to problems in accident and emergency wards in the eastern region, overcrowding and the long stay situation in Dublin hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> Deputy Ó Caoláin's question relates to a separate issue, acute beds. We have commissioned over 560 beds as a result of the bed capacity initiative, even though the health strategy called for 450, with another 200 in the private sector. The treatment purchase fund spending has introduced a further 200 on a rolling basis since its introduction and more than 7,000 patients have been treated under that scheme.</P>

Given the fact that neurologists can be of great help to migraine sufferers, what is the Minister doing to deal with the very serious deficit in their numbers? The joint committee was told that the Migraine Association of Ireland was lobbying for the establishment of a headache and migraine clinic at University College Hospital, Galway.

      <P>I am due to meet with the Neurological Alliance to hear proposals for moving on the report in terms of a broad, multi-disciplinary approach to neurological services.

      <P>The Migraine Association of Ireland has been to the fore in creating awareness and providing information for many people. I will be meeting with the association in the context of my meeting with the Neurological Alliance and I will examine possible ways to give effect to a migraine clinic in Galway.

Is it possible to find out by looking at that particularly detailed survey how many work days have been lost? We are losing huge amounts of money as a consequence of this problem. As the Minister has established how many days are lost due to the smoking of cigarettes, it should be quite easy to work out how many days have been lost as a result of migraine.

      <P>The administration of the registration system, including the registration of deaths, is a matter for an tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The details to be registered in relation to a death are set out in section 30 of the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act of 1863 and the Schedule to that Act. These include date and place of death, name and age of the deceased, occupation and cause of death. Certified copies of entries in the register of deaths include all details contained in the relevant entry in the register of deaths.</P>
      <P>I understand that applications were made to the General Register Office in 1993 for death certificates relating to persons interred in the graveyard in High Park. With the information supplied, the General Register Office was able to issue 75 death certificates. The office issued &ldquo;no trace&rdquo; forms for a number of others where it was unable to trace a death entry in the records with the information available to it. The office was unable to conduct a search of the records in some cases in respect of which insufficient details were supplied. The deaths may be registered, but the details upon which the searches were based were insufficient or may have been incorrect.</P>
      <P>It is important that the name and the date of death are accurately provided. The normal procedure in cases where records cannot be found based on the information supplied is that the applicant is so informed and invited to provide further information which may enable the entry to be located. In addition, there is a provision under section 15 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland) 1880 for late registration of deaths with the authority of an tArd Chláraitheoir. It is understood from recent press reports that the religious order concerned has stated that it complied with regulations in relation to the registration of deaths of persons in their care.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not disturbed that when a religious order was requested to exhume the bodies of 133 women, 22 additional bodies were discovered? The deaths of only 75 of the women had been properly registered. Does the Minister accept that it is illegal to fail to register the death of a person and that people should be held responsible to ensure that registration is carried out in all cases? Simply accepting the word of a religious order in this day and age is not terribly satisfactory considering the circumstances.

    <P>The health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within its lifetime.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean&mdash;</P>

      <P>In January 2001, the total medical card population was 1,148,055, or 30.32% of the <Col N="335" /> population. In January 2002 the figure was 1,199,454, which represents 31.24% and in January 2003 the figure was 1,168,745, which represents 29.84%.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined the discretion given to the chief executive officer. Having an income, therefore, that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
      <P>The health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF, which include proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency.</P>
      <P>The health strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services. Shorter waiting times for public patients is prioritised, with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of the national treatment purchase fund.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, including continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people; initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers-refugees and prisoners; and implementation of the NAPS targets relating to health.</P>
      <P>Access to primary care services is of crucial concern in terms of the overall issue of access to services and equality. The health strategy sets out an implementation plan, which recognises the breadth of the change which will be required to support the rolling-out of the new primary care model over the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>As the new model is developed, a wider primary care network of other primary care professionals will also provide services for the population served by each primary care team. Last <Col N="336" /> year I approved the establishment of a number of initial implementation projects, which involves putting in place an integrated primary care team in ten locations around the country. A number of these have already become operational and are providing enhanced primary care services to their target populations. This is enabling us to see, in a real and practical way, how the new model operates in practice, the benefits which we hope will flow from this new way of working and to explore some of the implementation issues in a practical way.</P>
    <P>This is only one of the first steps along the way. The implementation period recognises that there are major structural changes which must occur in order for the new primary care model to be implemented. It is also necessary to ensure that the required numbers of health professionals are trained and retained in the system over the coming decade and beyond to meet anticipated needs.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of the plans for the modernisation of our health service structures which I recently announced is that the system should be structured to enable the health strategy, including the primary care strategy, to be delivered. As part of the reform plans, therefore, the system for the planning and delivery of primary care services at national, regional and local level will be reorganised in line with the vision contained in the primary care strategy.</P>

      <P>To give a classic illustration of what I am talking about, this morning I launched a radiotherapy report. It could be argued that in terms of equity and access to services, that is a key intervention in cancer care. Historically, we have not provided the requisite capacity to provide that service to a range of people, particularly those on low income. There are always competing priorities and I have to make decisions within the envelope I have received. I accept the point that this causes hardship for people, particularly those above the threshold, but I would point to the drugs payment scheme. Over 200,000 additional people have come on-stream in the DPS since we reformed it. We proactively brought people into that scheme. We have dramatically increased the investment.</P>

      <P>Loch an Iúir national school is a three teacher school built in 1929 with a current enrolment of 65 pupils, 41 boys and 24 girls. The classrooms are utterly unsuitable for modern day curriculum requirements. Space is cramped and restricted and geared towards teacher-centred rather than child-centred teaching methods.</P>
      <P>There is only one exit from the school. Windows cannot be opened. There are above average levels of radon gas. The boiler room is insulated with a thick layer of asbestos, all of which leads to serious concerns for the health and safety of pupils and teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is well aware of these conditions, as reports have been submitted by the relevant authorities. Toilet and washing facilities are <Col N="339" /> completely inadequate. There is one cubicle for 41 boys, two cubicles for 24 girls and no facilities for teachers. These are 19th century conditions for 21st century requirements.</P>
    <P>The board of management applied for a three classroom extension with ancillary accommodation some years ago. Six months prior to the general election of May 2002, the Department's architect arrived at the school and plans for the extension were promised within weeks. Almost two years have elapsed and no plans have materialised, which leads to the conclusion that the pupils of Loch an Iúir are the victims of another broken election promise.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder the patience of parents is exhausted and that they have reached the end of their tether? Due to total exasperation they have unanimously decided to take the unprecedented step of withdrawing their children from the school. I can categorically state that these parents, neighbours of mine, acted in a manner alien to their nature but it was the only avenue open to them to obtain proper educational facilities and justice for their children. They are determined not to return to the school until the necessary works are carried out.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give Loch an Iúir school priority. It should be immediately included in the pilot scheme project and the processing of its application should be fast-tracked. In the meantime, alternative accommodation must be arranged until the necessary works are carried out so that the pupils have a school that meets all the health and safety standards as well as the educational requirements of the 21st century. Prompt action is required and nothing less will be accepted.</P>

Tá foighid na dtuismitheoirí caite agus ní raibh an dara rogha acu ach na páistí a tharraingt amach as an scoil.

      <P>This is a health and safety matter not only for the children, but for the teachers. It is a scandal and a disgrace. There are 65 pupils and only three toilet cubicles. There is one tap for the entire school for drinking, washing hands, making tea and mixing paints for arts and crafts. When the tap is turned on, the toilets do not work. If someone uses the bathroom and goes to wash their hands, none of the toilets will flush.</P>

    <P>Levels of radon gas, a lung carcinogen, are 35% above the norm. Some 22,000 people die in the United States from lung cancer resulting from exposure to indoor radon gas. When one reviews the evidence &ndash; higher than safety limits of a dangerous gas, inadequate and unsanitary toilet facilities and chronic shortage of space &ndash; how <Col N="340" /> can one be surprised at the decision of parents to withdraw their children?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGinley and Crowe for raising this matter as it affords me, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science who apologises for not being here to take this matter as he is out of the country, the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding accommodation and conditions at Loch an Iúir national school, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>The principal, acting on behalf of the board of management, advised the primary administration section of the Department of Education and Science on Wednesday morning that the parents had withdrawn their children from the school and were carrying out a protest outside the school gates. The principal confirmed also that all the teachers were present at the school.</P>
      <P>Loch an Iúir national school is one of three primary schools in the parish of Annagry. Enrolments at this school have shown a slight decline in recent years, down from 73 in 2001-02 to 65 this year. The current staffing consists of a principal teacher, two mainstream teachers, one shared learning support teacher and one shared resource teacher. The school also has a special needs assistant post.</P>
      <P>The existing building dates from the 1920s and consists of three classrooms, an entrance lobby and boys and girls toilets. The school has also been renting a portacabin since September 2001. This accommodation was acquired at the time to cater for the learning support and resource teachers at the school. The Department of Education and Science is providing grant-aid to the school at a rate of 95% of the overall cost of this accommodation. In addition, in 2002 the Department provided grant-aid to Loch an Iúir national school in the amount of &euro;8,505, that is, 90% of the final cost of resurfacing of the school yard.</P>
      <P>A devolved grant to be used for minor capital works and to cater for essential health and safety issues has been paid to all primary schools since 1997. In regard to the issues of health and safety raised by Deputy Crowe, a grant is available to deal with those issues. The funds are intended to be spent on the physical infrastructure of the school or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use. Works covered under the scheme include improvements to school buildings and grounds. Items such as the replacement of windows, roof repairs, resurfacing of school yards, re-painting and redecorating may also be paid out of this grant.</P>
      <P>The school was included in an audit designed to gather information on the use of moneys paid to the school authorities under the devolved grant scheme. However, no response has been received from the school despite reminders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a national radon survey commissioned by the Department in early 2001, the school's radon readings were well below the <Col N="341" /> statutory reference levels of 400 bequerels. However, under the provisions of the Department's scheme of radon mitigation for schools, grant-aid for the purposes of radon remediation may be paid to schools where the level of radon readings in rooms falls between 200 to 400 bequerels. On this basis, grant-aid was paid to the board of management earlier this year to have remediation works carried out on a classroom where radon readings totalled 217 bequerels. It is the responsibility of the board of management to ensure that these works are carried out.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general conditions at the school, in response to an application from the school, a building project designed to provide a one classroom extension had reached stage three of architectural planning in January 2000. At that time, the board of management requested that the accommodation brief be changed to provide a three classroom extension and convert the existing classrooms into a general purpose room.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy McGinley and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, made forceful submissions at the time outlining the school's position. I understand from the Minister of State that there was also a wish that the school qualify for a pilot scheme. Unfortunately, that has not been possible to date.</P>
    <P>In order to determine the appropriate level of accommodation which should be provided at the school, factors such as current and projected enrolments, staffing and the demographic trends in the area must be thoroughly examined. In addition, there are technical issues which must be resolved before further progress can be made. A technical examination indicates that the building is structurally sound but that the site may be restrictive for the proposed extension.</P>
    <P>When all these factors have been considered, a decision will be made on how best to provide for the accommodation requirements at the school. The progress of individual projects to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary provision for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress of existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. The annual school building programme will outline details of projects for which funding is to be made available. In the meantime, the school should use the devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works required.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy McGinley, in particular, and Deputy Crowe for raising these issues. I urge that, in the educational interest of their children, the parents reconsider their actions, which I understand are not their norm, at the school and ensure the children attend their classes.</P>

      <P>I have approximately ten questions to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, in relation to the James Connolly Memorial <Col N="342" /> Hospital in Blanchardstown. Why is the &euro;97 million building lying virtually unopened and unused at a time of great medical need in the area? Why were patients treated in the car park of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital last week while a beautiful state of the art accident and emergency unit lies completed for nine months but unopened?</P>
      <P>Why is the accident and emergency unit currently in use in the hospital dilapidated and overcrowded, to such an extent that families and relatives cannot even stay with the patients while a new building remains unopened? Why did the patients have to go on strike &ndash; it must be a first in Irish hospital history &ndash; because of the dreadfulness of their conditions while the new &euro;97 million building lies unopened?</P>
      <P>Why do the Northern Area Health Authority and the Minister for Health and Children not recognise the massive increase in population in Blanchardstown, acknowledged by the county council this week to be over 90,000 people? Is the Minister waiting on the Hanly report to be published to effectively downgrade the James Connolly Memorial Hospital? Why are the major teaching hospitals in Dublin now referred to in press releases by the Department as the &ldquo;five major hospitals&rdquo;? Those five major hospitals no longer appear to include the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, although it is serving one of Ireland's biggest built-up areas.</P>
      <P>What is the cost of keeping the new wing closed with just a small area in operation for some emergency cardiac cases as compared to the cost of fully opening the new &euro;97 million building? Can the Minister give a definitive date for the full opening and commissioning of the building? Why are the wonderful staff of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital extremely demoralised? Why are many of the staff choosing to leave? Why are many of the Filipino nurses, brought here and trained at great expense, deciding to leave? This is another debacle of Government management.</P>
      <P>This debacle at the James Connolly Memorial Hospital is affecting the 90,000 people who live in the Dublin 15 area, plus the other 20,000 people in the County Meath area who use the hospital. Why does the Minister for Health and Children not follow the advice of Dr. Neligan on radio recently and resign as a response to the disgrace of his lack of management of the hospital? This is despite the fact that over &euro;100 million of public capital funds was spent on the building and the project completed some time ago. The Government is going slow on the final stages of commissioning the building to delay the opening. How can the Government claim serious management of the economy when we have a public scandal of patients in the car park and the accident and emergency department which one would not see in most parts of Africa? I say that from personal experience, having been in the accident and emergency department frequently.</P>

      <Col N="343" /> A wonderful staff who give a service second-to-none are now largely demoralised. These are expensively recruited nurses, many who come from the Philippines, who give this excellent service. They are now being recruited by the British health service when many of them, if the options were there, would choose to stay in Ireland. Why does the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, not hand in his resignation?</P>

Deputy Burton is wrong. We have an excellent Minister who is doing a tremendous job with the 100,000 people employed in the provision of health services. It is disingenuous for Deputy Burton to say to them that they are not doing a good job. A great job is being done in health by 100,000 people&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region and those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment. James Connolly Memorial Hospital provides acute medical and surgical services to the catchment area of north-west County Dublin, north County Kildare, and south County Meath. Deputy Burton indicated that the population catchment is 90,000 people with the additional 20,000 from County Meath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The population is 256,000. It is the fastest growing catchment area in the eastern region. There are currently 348 beds in the hospital, 110 of which are extended care beds and 1,000 staff are doing a tremendous job. Accident and emergency services are provided in James Connolly Memorial Hospital on a 365 day, 24 hour basis as part of the eastern regional network. My Department is advised that construction of phase 1 of the new hospital development at James Connolly Memorial Hospital is complete, with the exception of some snagging work <Col N="344" /> being carried out by the contractors. We know the process in this regard and that is the way we want it to de done &ndash; work complete, snagging complete. This major development is being funded jointly by the Northern Area Health Board and my Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton continually referred to &euro;97 million funding. I am pleased to state that the project cost is &euro;101.4 million, and I hope it will not stop at that figure. I have no doubt there will be more funding.</P>

These are necessary as part of the transition process to the new hospital and to facilitate a land transfer in line with the project development arrangements.</P>
      <P>There has been progress recently in commissioning the new facilities, again following the intervention by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The coronary care unit, formerly located in unit 7, has recently moved to the new building together with 35 medical and cardiac beds. In addition, the therapeutic treatment centre has moved to its new location on the ground floor of the new facility. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, Northern Area Health Board and management of James Connolly Memorial Hospital are also finalising arrangements to transfer existing accident and emergency services to the new facility upon its anticipated completion in November.</P>

      <P>James Connolly Memorial Hospital has gained significantly from the recent long-stay initiative with 24 patients expected to benefit from the programme and be placed in a more appropriate community setting.

    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD" hpid="Ms F. O'Malley Ms F. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leas-Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue once again in the House. Given the UNFPA state of the world population 2003 report launched in Dublin yesterday and the alarming rise in sexually transmitted diseases, as reported by the National Disease Surveillance Centre, all elements of the health sector must redouble their efforts to communicate an effective safe sex message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brendan O'Brien of the UNFPA described the report as a serious wake up call. He said that it is a wake up call to society to listen to young people and acknowledge their needs so they can lead healthy, productive and dignified lives. The report stresses that education, information and sexual health services are urgently needed in all regions of the world. It also highlights the fact that studies repeatedly show that empowering young people with quality information about <Col N="346" /> relationships and sexual health is a key component in strategies to delay the onset of the first sexual experience. The more educated and more aware young people are, the less likely they are to have unprotected sex at an early age. Education brings with it the confidence to make more mature decisions.</P>
    <P>In developing programmes for young people on issues of sexual health, we must engage with them so they are accessible and appropriate to their particular needs. While in global terms, Ireland's teen pregnancy rates are low, they are the second highest in the EU. Our rate of teen pregnancy is twice that of Sweden and three times that of the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>The &lsquo;sex is wrong' approach, which has dominated our thinking for so many years, is out of touch with the needs and behaviour of young people and has consequently met with little success. Recent surveys on attitude and behaviour of young people and the rising sexually transmitted disease, STD, rates bear testament to this failure. What needs to be done to improve things? We need to ensure that responses to outbreaks are timely and that the statistics on STDs are up to date &ndash; the figures released this week relate to last year.</P>
    <P>Treatment for STDs is inexpensive and usually comprises a course of antibiotics. Early primary care intervention is far less expensive than if problems are left untreated resulting in higher infection rates and more complex health problems for those who are infected. If left untreated chlamydia can lead to infertility.</P>
    <P>Prevention is paramount in any strategy to deal with STDs. Awareness about the risks associated with casual unprotected sex and the use of condoms in sexual relations is essential. The price of condoms and their lack of availability in some parts of the country is a disincentive to their use. In raising the importance of condom use in STD prevention, there has been a small but persistent lobby which asserts that condoms promote disease. This destructive message should be faced down. If people are having sex &ndash; they clearly are &ndash; a condom, if used properly, provides the best available protection against STDs.</P>
    <P>While the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been established to help reduce the instance of crisis pregnancy and there are individual sexual health strategies within health boards, there is still a need for more comprehensive direction at national level. There is enormous disparity between the services available in different health board areas. No testing facilities for STDs is available in the North-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The UNFPA report cites some excellent examples of the success which followed when sex education and services were made accessible to young people. We need to be open to the experiences of the Netherlands where the issue of teenage pregnancy has been successfully dealt with and there is an effective sexual health policy. Key elements in their strategy include convenient access to contraceptive services for sexually <Col N="347" /> active young people and treating sex education as an integrated part of the school curriculum, which includes biological and emotional aspects of sexual development, facilitating informed decisions and providing people with the confidence to say no if this is what they want. This only comes from an atmosphere where openness flourishes. Let us look forward to a new openness in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Malley for raising this important issue. I support some of the sentiments she expressed with regard to prevention, primary care and education. National and international research has shown that there has been an increase in the rate of sexual activity in industrialised countries, coupled with a decrease in age of the first sexual encounter. Data on sexual activity from the national health and lifestyles survey, commissioned by the health promotion unit of my Department, revealed that in the 18 to 34 year age group, 29% of those surveyed sometimes used contraception. For sexually active adults, condom use accounts for 40% of contraceptive use.</P>
      <P>These worrying statistics are borne out by recent figures on sexually transmitted diseases in Ireland released by the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC. These show a 9.4% increase in the number of cases of sexually transmitted infections, STIs, notified in 2001 &ndash; 9,703 cases compared to 8,869 cases in 2000. The majority of these cases were notified from the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. The 20 to 29 year age group represented the largest number of reported cases of STIs. The most recent available statistics published by the NDSC for HIV-AIDS refer to the period July to December 2002. These indicate that a total of 207 new cases of HIV were diagnosed in Ireland in the last six months of 2002. This brings the total number of cases in 2002 to 364 and represents a 22% increase in the number of cases diagnosed in 2001. These increases are a cause of concern and are undoubtedly reflected in additional demands on the treatment services at both primary and secondary level. While some of the increase in STIs may be due to an increased public and professional awareness, improved acceptability of STI clinics and the availability of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques, the increases in HIV partly reflect migration patterns. These figures undoubtedly also suggest an increase in unsafe sexual practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has set out the promotion of sexual health as a strategic objective of the health strategy. It is a strategic aim of the Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005 to promote safer sexual health and safer sexual practices among the population. The importance of a partnership approach to promoting sexual health is also reflected in the health strategy. Issues such as crisis pregnancy and STI awareness can only be tackled by promoting an inter-sectoral approach to sexual health. To that end the health pro<Col N="348" /> motion unit of my Department is increasingly bringing an inter-sectoral and multidisciplinary focus to initiatives and programmes.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit supports a wide range of local health board initiatives and interventions targeting specific at risk groups, such as the gay community and prostitutes, aimed at lowering the incidence of HIV and STIs in these groups. Much good work is being done in outreach programmes by personnel working at this level. I congratulate them on their endeavours. Health boards also undertake information and awareness activities at regional level. Where appropriate, the health boards work in conjunction with voluntary and other relevant organisations. To date, over &euro;4 million in additional funding has been provided for health boards since 1997 to address the problems of HIV and AIDS and other STIs. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the facilities in place for dealing with STIs. At present there are six consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV and AIDS and STIs.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit has long since been involved in and continues to support a range of initiatives and interventions aimed at preventing and raising awareness of STIs. The unit is proactive in implementing effective approaches to sexual health promotion and has undertaken a nationwide campaign to promote sexual health, aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 year age group. This convenience advertising programme is a collaboration between the health promotion unit, local public health advisers, service providers, community groups and venue owners and managers, and focuses on disseminating messages in third level colleges, health centres and leisure and entertainment facilities. By targeting venues, such as male and female toilets, which have a particular customer profile, a message can be directed to a tightly defined audience, which makes this form of advertising valuable in reaching groups that may otherwise be hard to access.</P>
    <P>Education is also an important aspect in raising awareness of the dangers of engaging in risky sexual behaviour that could result in a sexually transmitted infection.</P>

The data will also provide a benchmark for planning future sexual health promotion services and strategies.

      <P>Swords is the capital of Fingal and it has public transport difficulties. It has a population of between 45,000 and 50,000 and it is growing very fast. The need for a metro is very strongly felt in the area. The Swords electoral ward includes the area of Donabate and Portrane which is currently evaluating an increase in population under a variation 34 plan which would increase the numbers to between 25,000 and 30,000. There is a proposal to sell St. Ita's Hospital and build approximately 2,800 houses on that site. Donabate on its own will have a population equivalent to Dundalk, and it is difficult to imagine Dundalk without a rail link.</P>
      <P>The area of Kinsealy-Melrose was rezoned in the past to create a residential area which does not have good connections to its natural hinterland of Swords. It would also benefit from a rail link to Swords. Lusk has increased in size and there are proposals for a theme park on the style of Disneyworld to be situated there. There exists a large metropolis of population which is crying out for assurance from the Government that the metro plans which the RPA are recommending in its business case proposal will serve Swords. The Minister has asked the RPA to evaluate a line between the airport and Dublin city centre. It is very important that before mistakes are made which will have a long-term impact, the need for a metro link to Swords should be evaluated. It would be important for its own viability as well as for the population it is serving that Swords is included on that line connecting the city to Swords via the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State attends meetings on the north side and is aware that many housing estates in the Swords area are colloquially referred to as &ldquo;hangars&rdquo; because so many of the residents are airport workers. The viability of the metro will be greatly enhanced by ensuring that Swords is on <Col N="350" /> that line. It will be vital to provide a park and ride facility to serve the many people working at the airport who come from north of Swords, Meath and Louth. I raised this issue with the Taoiseach in the House last week and he told me, understandably, that he is endeavouring to obtain the most cost-effective proposal. I appeal to the Minister to include Swords in that cost-effective proposal. The metro will not be cost-effective unless it runs to Swords, as the RPA business plan recommendation clearly bears out. I have doubts about whether the RPA was even privy to the information on the projected population growth in the Swords-Donabate-Lusk area. The RPA's conservative evaluation of present needs would provide justification for the extension of the metro to Swords. I was informed by the Taoiseach that the decision on the metro will come before Government in the next few weeks, in October. It is high time that we are given clear information and a clear understanding of the Government's position.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin, particularly Fingal, need to know if the Taoiseach will support the recommendation that Swords be included on that line. If Swords continues to be a difficult place to access because it does not have a metro service, I am sure the Minister for Finance as well as every other member of the Cabinet will realise that the cost to business will be very significant, and that should be part of the evaluation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for raising this issue. I am very sympathetic and supportive of the case he makes. We are very fortunate in having a strong leader of the country who is from the north side of the city. The Taoiseach is very supportive of this issue.</P>
      <P>In January 2001 the Government decided that, given the costs involved, the metro network should be phased and the newly established RPA should prepare a business case and issue a call for expressions of interest. RPA completed this process and 22 companies are pre-qualified. In November 2002, RPA submitted an outline business case for a number of routing options with different costings. However, even the cheapest option was considered too costly, given the changed economic environment. RPA was asked to provide a more affordable option. It is fair to give credit where it is due, to the Minister, Deputy Brennan. He wanted to ensure value for taxpayers' money. He intervened and the RPA is now taking the Madrid experience into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RPA submitted a revised proposal based on the above in June this year, which the Minister is evaluating. He intends bringing further proposals to Government in the coming weeks. The Deputy will be pleased to hear that the current proposal centres on a more direct and less <Col N="351" /> expensive route to the airport as the first line of a metro network.</P>

      <P>The metro can reduce travel times and congestion, improve reliability, availability and quality of public transport and make it more attractive to car users. It has the potential to improve the quality of life for the people of Dublin and for those visiting on business or for tourism. Improved public transport is also important to the continued development of Dublin Airport as both an employment centre and a gateway to the greater Dublin area. Without additional public transport provision, the growth of Dublin Airport will be constrained.</P>
      <P>Development of modern mass-transit projects also brings benefits in terms of the stimulation of new development of housing and employment in the catchment area. The wider metro network would service some key regeneration and development areas of Dublin.

      <P>The route runs for 11.4 kilometres from St. Stephen's Green to the airport. Interchanges are proposed with Luas line B at St. Stephen's Green and Luas line A at O'Connell Street, linking the metro with Busáras, Connolly and Heuston stations and more directly with DART and suburban rail through an underground link between D'Olier Street metro station and Tara Street railway station. Interchanges with bus services are also proposed at D'Olier Street, O'Connell Street and Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sargent referred to capacity. I am pleased to inform the House that estimated <Col N="352" /> patronage for metro line 1 is 24 million passengers by 2016. The RPA has tailored its proposal to allow for this initial patronage level with the possibility of the metro being expanded in the future to cater for a capacity of up to 70 million passengers per annum. On metro line 1, airport patronage is likely to account for 32% of total passengers, reducing to 15% as the metro is extended in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sargent in supporting Swords and the other northside development areas. Swords is a large suburban town with no rail link to the city centre. Adding this rail link to the metro could increase forecast patronage by 15% and improve the economics of the broader metro project. There are also significant development opportunities which could contribute to the cost of the extension. The extension could be either elevated or at ground level, depending on the route chosen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent highlighted the importance of Swords to Dublin Airport and its employees. Many of the people working at the airport live in Swords and its environs. Metro would provide these people with a fast and frequent transport service to the airport. According to the Public Transport Partnership Forum report on improved access to Dublin Airport published last year, a metro link from Swords could also open up opportunities for park and ride facilities in the area for airport users and city centre commuters travelling to and from north Dublin and the north east of Ireland. While not part of the base case proposed by the RPA, it is the Minister's intention that this option will be kept open so that it can be assessed further as the competition proceeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 55, 59 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined to the House the various initiatives which are under way and are planned to address pressures in the acute hospital system nationally which are heightened in emergency medicine departments. Particular pressures have been experienced in emergency departments on the northside of Dublin in recent weeks. In order to deal with the specific problems being encountered in the Dublin area I would like to advise the Deputies of some specific developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have provided additional funding of &euro;3.8 million in 2003 to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting thus freeing up acute beds. The Eastern Regional Health Authority expects that more than 200 patients will be discharged from acute hospitals as a direct result of this funding. According to information that I have received from the ERHA, a total of 30 patients in Beaumont Hospital, 30 patients in the Mater Hospital, 12 patients in St. Vincent's Hospital, eight patients in St. James's <Col N="354" /> Hospital, seven patients at James Connolly Hospital and five patients in Tallaght Hospital had been discharged up to 3 October 2003. Further patients have been approved for discharge from all these hospitals and the process of transferring these patients is continuing.</P>
    <P>A total of 15 beds in St. Joseph's Hospital Raheny for use as acute rehabilitation beds are due to come on stream in November once refurbishment is complete. These additional sub-acute beds will assist in the discharge of patients from Beaumont Hospital to a more appropriate setting.</P>
    <P>The ERHA is in discussion with the major Dublin hospitals on the possibility of re-opening a small number of their closed acute beds and use them as transitional care beds. The transitional care units will facilitate the transfer of acute patients to the community.</P>
    <P>While there are out of hours co-operatives in all health boards at present there is only limited out of hours cover in the Northern Area Health Board. Several doctors from Balbriggan, County Dublin, have joined the North-Eastern Health Board out-of-hours co-operative NorthEastDoc. The extension of out of hours co-operatives to the remaining areas of the ERHA remains a priority for the authority.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the ERHA intends to initiate a media campaign, involving radio, television, and print, highlighting the pressures that exist in emergency medicine departments and encouraging people to attend only if absolutely necessary. This initiative is an attempt to focus on the need for only those in need of emergency care to attend and for others to use the primary care services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I launched the report of the expert working group on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. I have arranged for copies of the report to be made available to Deputies. The report provides a detailed plan for the further development of radiation oncology services in this country. The Government has accepted the recommendations of this report. I would like to outline brief details of the report and the expansion programme in radiotherapy that I have announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has <Col N="355" /> agreed that the first step of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. I agree with the report's conclusion that this is the best model to provide a radiation oncology service to the highest standards. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the backbone of the future service expansion. This is the best model to rapidly provide a radiation oncology service. The development of radiation oncology services along the lines recommended in this report is the single most important priority of my Department in cancer services in the acute setting.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have issued approval for the purchase of two additional linear accelerators &ndash; principal treatment machine &ndash; for the Cork centre and the necessary capital investment amounting to &euro;4 million to commission this service as rapidly as possible. I have now approved the appointment of a project team to prepare a brief for the rapid expansion of current capacity from four to eight linear accelerators. I also intend to prioritise the necessary resources to ensure that the radiation oncology centre in Galway, which is currently being commissioned, is in a position to treat patients, commencing in spring 2005. I have also requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate the expansion from three to six linear accelerators in the medium term. I will also give early approval to the establishment of a project team to plan this expansion.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that there should be two treatment centres located in the eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas. I have asked the chief medical officer of my Department to advise on the optimum location of radiation treatment facilities in Dublin. The chief medical officer will apply the guidelines established by the group. Based on the advice from the chief medical officer, who will be supported by my Department's hospital planning office, I will decide on the location of the services. I propose discussing the implications of the report with the board of St. Luke's Hospital in the near future.</P>
    <P>I will require radiation oncology centres to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. I will also require radiation oncology centres to provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions. This is currently the case and as more radiation oncologists are appointed it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has also decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite <Col N="356" /> centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a co-ordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report. I have now established a national radiation oncology co-ordinating group. The group will, <i>inter alia</i>, facilitate improved access to existing and planned services. The group will comprise clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 24 June 2003, the most recent report of the National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland 1994 to 1998: Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival finds that incidence rates of prostate cancer in men in all age groups and 65 and over showed statistically significant increases. However, mortality rates showed no evidence of an upward or downward time trend. The report states that the evidence of a divergence between incidence and mortality rates may be due to better case-finding, more incidental diagnoses or a genuine increase in survival. The report further states that the increase in incidence rates in men under 65 years of age appears to be a recent phenomenon and that it is notable how little mortality rates have changed over this same period of time. The report concludes that it is unclear from the figures if mortality trends will change much in the future but considers that it is unlikely that incidence rates will continue their steady climb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. The National Cancer Strategy 2003 is currently being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. As part of this work, a sub-group of the national cancer forum has been established on generic screening. This multidisciplinary group has reviewed all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. In relation to screening for prostate cancer in particular, the group recommended that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population-based prostate screening programme <Col N="357" /> in this country. The group recommended that this issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised trials currently being conducted. The group's recommendations will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy of draft proposals from the European Commission for a Council of Europe recommendation on cancer screening. The proposal which is expected to be accepted by the Health Council before the end of the year provides a framework for consideration by member states of cancer screening programmes. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.</P>
    <P>The new national cancer strategy will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the first national cancer strategy and set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years. It will also make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.</P>

      <P>Persons aged 70 years and over have automatic eligibility to a medical card, solely on age grounds, since 1 July 2001. It is not possible to definitively state the number of persons who have benefited solely as a result of this measure, since data on the number of persons who would have qualified, on means grounds, if the budget initiative had not been introduced, is not collected. However, the higher capitation rate payable for newly eligible persons aged 70 years and over 70 years from 1 July 2001 is presently being paid to general practitioners in respect of 89,895 persons.</P>
      <P>The provision of the services of a home help and equipment are not routinely available to medical card holders. Decisions on entitlement to such services are made following individual assessments of need carried out by health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 37 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>Over the last two or three decades there have been numerous important advances in surgical technology and in anaesthesia. These advances have improved greatly the range, the safety and the effectiveness of the surgical procedures that can be offered by modern health systems. However, as a consequence, there has been dramatic increases in the demand for surgical procedures, especially elective procedures.</P>
      <P>Due to the nature of any health care system not all treatments can be made available to patients immediately. Hospital facilities must be used to best effect and it is sometimes necessary to place patients for non-urgent treatments on a waiting list. Therefore, the significant issue from the patients perspective is the length of time spent waiting for treatment and as such my Department's objective is to reduce waiting times significantly in the short-term with particular focus on those waiting longest for treatment.</P>
      <P>This Government has maintained a particular focus on those waiting longest for hospital treatment. Despite pressures on the acute hospital system considerable progress has been made by health agencies in reducing waiting times for public patients.</P>
      <P>My Department publishes comprehensive information in respect of both in-patient and day case waiting lists and waiting times by hospital and speciality.</P>
      <P>The waiting list data for the period ended 31 March 2003 showed that there were significant reductions in the number of adults and children waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target specialties has fallen by approximately 35% from 7,402 to 4,782 in the period June 2002 to March 2003. The total number of children waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment in the same specialties and for the same period has decreased by approximately 56% from 1,576 to 697.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very significant progress has been made in many health board areas to achieve the target of <Col N="359" /> no adult waiting longer than 12 months and no child waiting longer than six months. This has been achieved through active management of long waiting lists at a local level and the involvement of the national treatment purchase fund. To date more than 7,200 patients have already received treatments through the NTPF predominantly in private hospitals in Ireland. The fund has the capacity and funding each month to arrange treatment for over 800 patients in hospitals throughout Ireland and in four private hospitals in England. To date, the capacity in England has not been fully utilised. The additional capacity identified by the fund covers the majority of surgical specialties. If patients feel that they qualify for treatment and they have not been referred to the NTPF by their doctor then I would urge them to contact the NTPF directly.</P>
    <P>While the rate of progress in achieving the targets set out in the health strategy has been slower than anticipated, the targets still remain a goal to be achieved. Funding through the waiting list initiative and the national treatment purchase fund will continue to keep the focus on reducing waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>On 25 July, 2003 I published the report of Mr. Kevin Bonner in relation to Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated at that time my acceptance of the main recommendation of the report that Monaghan General Hospital should continue to play a vital role in the delivery of acute hospital services to the local community within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. I have also accepted that additional services can be developed at the hospital to the benefit of the local community. In particular, I welcomed the proposals in the report aimed at strengthening the management capacity <Col N="360" /> of the hospital within the Cavan-Monaghan group. The central involvement of consultant staff within this new structure is a very significant development which should enhance the ability of the group to deliver high quality services.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bonner has recognised in his report that the pattern of acute hospital service delivery is changing world-wide and that Monaghan Hospital's best guarantee for the future is to participate in and accept those changes which will ensure its future viability. In this context, the report's recommendations in relation to the range and configuration of acute services, including maternity services, to be delivered within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group are appropriate for consideration by the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming national task force on medical staffing, Hanly, report will further inform decisions in this regard. The task force was asked to make recommendations about how to best organise hospital medical staffing within the hospital system, having regard to the requirement of the European working time directive to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the recommendations of the forum on medical manpower. The report of the task force on medical staffing will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendations in the Bonner report, I am making additional capital funding available to the North-Eastern Health Board under the national development plan. In this context the board has been asked to identify urgent capital needs at Monaghan General Hospital in areas such as equipment replacement, refurbishment, fire precaution and other health and safety measures.</P>
    <P>With regard to the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, it purchases procedures for public patients from private hospitals in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. The fund may also make use of any capacity within public hospitals to arrange treatment for patients. Where it is not possible to treat patients within a reasonable period in Ireland, either in public or private hospitals, arrangements can be made by the NTPF to refer public patents for treatment abroad, having regard to quality, availability and cost. This is always subject to the patient's prior agreement and is done in co-operation with the patient's consultant and/or general practitioner.</P>
    <P>In relation to costings, the fund has not released individual procedure prices on the grounds of commercial sensitivity and on the basis that it would disadvantage the taxpayer. I am advised by the fund that the prices it pays compare favourably with the prices recouped by private insurers.</P>

      <P>Rheumatology is predominantly an out-patient delivered service with a small number of beds being required for acute rheumatic diseases and for patients requiring intensive periods of rehabilitation. Most first time referrals to rheumatology out-patients services have conditions such as osteoarthritis, back pain or fibromyalgia. These conditions can usually be assessed, treated and discharged back to primary care following a single out-patient visit.</P>
      <P>The Irish Society of Rheumatology, ISR, has prepared a report entitled Rheumatology Manpower Report 2002 examining the current state of rheumatology services and identifying the resource needs for the service. The report gives a clear picture of current rheumatology services. There is a strong case made for improvements to the existing level of service based on existing demand and future population changes. My Department is aware of the demand and the necessity to plan for future demographic changes.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal, which is the statutory body with responsibility for regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the health Acts, carried out a review of rheumatology and rehabilitation services in 1995 and is currently examining the ISR report in that context.</P>
      <P>The expansion of existing rheumatology services is initially a matter for the individual health boards or the Eastern Regional Health Authority based on the relative priority accorded to the service by the agencies and in the light of available funding.</P>
      <P>I have met with the ISR in relation to its report. Separate meetings also took place with officials from my Department. I understand the service requirements as described in the ISR report but there are limitations on the capacity of the health care system to respond to demands for increased or additional services in the current economic climate. However, future planning requirements will be considered by myself and my Department in the context of the Comhairle na nOspidéal examination and the report of the national task force on medical staffing.</P>

      <P>Quality and Fairness recognised that models of maternity care are changing, with increasing demands for choice with regard to type of care <Col N="362" /> and location of birth. In view of the changing needs and pressures on existing services, action 58 provides for the establishment of a working party to prepare a plan for the future development of the maternity services. The objective of this development is to ensure that maternity care is woman-centred, equitable across the country, accessible, safe and accountable.</P>
      <P>It was anticipated that this working party would be established in 2002 and report this year. The report of the domiciliary births group established by the health board chief executive officers' group will be particularly relevant in this context.</P>
      <P>The domiciliary births group has commissioned an external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects in Dublin, Cork and Galway, and the service in the South-Eastern Health Board area. This evaluation is due for completion in mid-November 2003. The domiciliary births group will then engage in a public consultation process and report to the chief executive officers in February/March 2004. The group's report will inform the development of future national policies, procedures and protocols for domiciliary births.</P>
      <P>In relation to the North-Eastern Health Board area, the Deputy will be aware of the publication of the report of the maternity services review group to the North-Eastern Health Board, chaired by Kinder, in 2002, and of the recently published Comhairle na nOspidéal report of the committee reviewing maternity and related services in the North-Eastern Health Board area. The future configuration of maternity, obstetrical and gynaecological services in that board's area, is being informed, <i>inter alia</i>, by the recommendations of these reports.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 2002 and <Col N="364" /> acknowledge the important role that the inspector plays in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In his report for 2002, the inspector notes the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric in-patient facilities, from 4,256 at the end of 2001 to 3,966 at the end of 2002. He also highlighted the further increases in the provision of community facilities, such as day services and community residences. The inspectorate would like to see the programme of community residence provision accelerated and extended to eliminate the occupation of acute beds by patients whose illness and needs are no longer acute. I fully support that objective.</P>
      <P>Significant advances have been made in recent years in the provision of community psychiatry, nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres. In the period 1999-2002, an additional &euro;70.7 million was invested in the mental health services. In the current year, additional revenue funding of &euro;7.6 million will be provided for on-going improvements in mental health services, to develop and expand community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the later-life psychiatry services, to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>In his report, the inspector outlined some significant developments during 2002, including the setting up of the Mental Health Commission with the appointment of a chairperson and members. Functions of the commission include an independent review of patients detained involuntarily, the establishment of an Inspector of Mental Health Services and responsibility for establishing and maintaining a register of centres approved by it for the detention of patients suffering from mental disorder.</P>
      <P>The inspector welcomed the considerable reinforcement of various sub-specialties in recent years, with the appointment of additional consultant psychiatrists in later-life psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, rehabilitation psychiatry and liaison psychiatry in general hospitals. The inspector felt these posts demonstrate recognition at official level of the increasing complexity of psychiatric disorder and the growth of understanding of some of the circumstances and consequences of major mental disorder.</P>
      <P>However, the inspector did acknowledge shortcomings in the services also. In particular, the failure of psychiatric general hospital units at Portlaoise General Hospital and Castlebar Regional Hospital to open as planned was a source of disappointment to the inspector. He noted that the slow rate of progress in this area contributed to patient disadvantage. However, I am pleased to inform the House that both units are expected to open shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector highlighted areas of genuine concern in relation to mental health services. These <Col N="365" /> are concerns which the Government shares and which it intends to address. While steady progress has been made in the move towards an integrated, community-based mental health service, I accept that much remains to be done. I am committed to continuing to work with health boards and service providers in bringing about the necessary improvements and developments identified by the inspector, as quickly as possible.</P>

When account is taken of once-off, non-recurring funds of &euro;28 million provided in 2002, the increase in 2003 over 2002 is &euro;57 million or 5.5%. In addition, some of the hospitals entered 2003 with expenditure overruns of approximately &euro;14 million which had to be treated as a first charge before developing the service plan for 2003.

    <P>The Dublin academic teaching hospitals, DATHS, are providing similar levels of service in 2003 as they did in 2002. In-patient and day case activity across the five hospitals for the eight months ended August 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 shows an increase of 1.5% or an additional 2,217 cases, bringing the number of cases treated to 153,664. Therefore, I do not anticipate that the final overall level of services for these hospitals for 2003 will be less than 2002.</P>
    <P>Hospitals have been working closely with the authority since the start of the year in relation to expenditure control and service plan delivery. A programme of savings measures is being implemented by each hospital within the approved funding to allow for the delivery of the <Col N="366" /> service plan. These are under continuous review to allow for revision, where necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>I have had regular meetings with the Medical Defence Union, over recent years as part of the process of implementing the Government's decision to introduce enterprise liability as the basis for providing professional indemnity cover to health agencies and their employees. Many of these meetings have been taken up with resolving the issue of who should have responsibility for claims arising from events that had occurred before the inception of the new arrangements. The Government's position on this issue has been clear and consistent throughout. The commercial insurance companies and the mutual medical defence bodies which had taken premiums or membership subscriptions in respect of years prior to the scheme are responsible for these liabilities. This position has been accepted by all of the commercial insurers and by the Medical Protection Society. The only body contesting this view is the MDU.</P>
      <P>The Government would prefer that the transition from the old indemnity arrangements to the clinical indemnity scheme were a smooth one so as to remove uncertainty for patients and doctors. In that context discussions were held with the MDU on a possible transfer of liabilities if accompanied by a transfer of substantial of assets to be set against the liabilities. The MDU's offer was rejected on the grounds that it was wholly inadequate.</P>
      <P>In my most recent correspondence with the chief executive of the MDU I have indicated that the Government is prepared to take all possible measures, including court action, to ensure that the MDU meets all its obligations to its present and former members in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has put in place a refund scheme, operated through the GMS payments board, to process applications from persons who may be eligible for a refund due to the delay in putting the drugs payment scheme, DPS, on a statutory basis. The scheme was widely advertised in the national press on 26 June 2003 and again on 12 and 14 September 2003 to advertise the extension of the closing date.</P>
      <P>At this stage there has been a substantial demand for application forms, with some 24,000 claims received by the General Medical Services Payments Board, the body charged with operating the scheme on behalf of the Department. The claims received are presently being processed and payment of refunds has already commenced. All claims received by the deadline of 31 October 2003 will be processed and paid by the end of December. The final cost and the numbers qualifying for reimbursement will not be known until all applications have been received and processed.</P>
      <P>The question has been raised as to why members of the public have to apply for the refund, with supporting documentation &ndash; original receipts or printout from a pharmacy &ndash; while this data is already available to the GMS payments board.</P>
      <P>The answer is that while a significant amount of the data is already available to the GMS payments board a certain degree of verification is required for the following reasons.</P>
      <P>First, for claimants who spent under the old DPS threshold of £42 the position is as follows. Under this threshold the individual, or family, paid the pharmacist in full. As the pharmacist was not claiming any refund from the GMS payments board they did not submit these details. Therefore, no records of these transactions are recorded in the GMS payments board's database and these must be provided by either the claimant or pharmacist. Where the claimant may not have relevant receipts, pharmacists are providing copies of Med 1 forms with the necessary level of detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, for claimants who paid over the £42 <Col N="368" /> threshold, and the details of their transactions were supplied to the GMS payments board, it was felt that in order to ensure the accuracy of the data for any month the GMS payments board may have to seek further information from the claimants. This might arise if there is a discrepancy between pharmacy records and those of the board and they have therefore been asked to complete a claim form.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the address details supplied on the claim form will also allow the GMS payments board verify the current address of the claimant allowing for the fact that some persons may have moved in the four years since the inception of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to reassure members of the public that the GMS payments board are working with claimants and individual pharmacists to deal with any problems which may arise.</P>

      <P>The health reform programme was announced on 18 June 2003. The programme's priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management. The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Heath System, which were also published on the same day.</P>
      <P>The Government considered the recommendations made in both reports and has decided on a number of priority actions to move on system reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new structure set out in this reform programme will provide a clear national focus on ser<Col N="369" /> vice delivery and executive management. It will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed that to succeed it would be necessary to clearly set out the Government's vision of reform to all within the existing health system, including board members, staff and staff representatives. This engagement was undertaken as a vital first step in the implementation process. This is the process on which we have been engaged during the last number of months.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General and I briefed every senior manager of every agency in the system in the days after the Government's decision. There followed a visit to every health board area meeting large numbers of staff and board members.</P>
    <P>The Department commissioned the Office for Health Management to conduct an information and consultation exercise reaching as many people and agencies as possible in the system. Over 20,000 staff were directly engaged with over the summer months and into September. The draft report of the OHM is currently with the Department and will be made public shortly. Overall co-ordination of the change programme is supported by a project office, led at assistant secretary level, which reports to the Secretary General of the Department.</P>
    <P>Output to date from the project office includes: a draft project plan for the reform programme, identifying manageable phases of implementation; and establishment of 13 action projects to advance specific elements of the programme by end year.</P>
    <P>The next steps will involve the appointment of a national steering committee to oversee the implementation process and the establishment of a board for the interim health service executive. I am considering possible nominees for both bodies at the moment. I intend to report back to Government shortly with proposed appointees, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The reforms will require legislation to implement them. Work has commenced on the preparation of this legislation, which will provide the statutory basis for the establishment of the new health service executive and related structures. The new legislation will also incorporate other legal changes required and my aim will be to introduce the necessary legislation next year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the preparatory work on which we have been engaged has been undertaken with the appropriate degree of professionalism and urgency. This programme affects every aspect of the health system and everyone working in it &ndash; close to 100,000 people. If it is to have lasting impact, particularly for patients and clients, it must be professionally planned and executed.</P>
    <P>I am more than satisfied that the planning and initial consultation phase we have just completed will pay dividends in the longer run.</P>

      <P>A working group was established by the Minister for Health and Children in June 2000 to make recommendations on how child and adolescent psychiatric services should be developed in the short, medium and long-term to meet identified needs.</P>
      <P>The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry was published in March, 2001 and recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service including the recruitment of additional consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists. In furtherance of the group's recommendations, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.061 million was allocated in 2002 to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further &euro;1.64 million was allocated in 2003. It is envisaged that these developments will have an impact on the waiting times for initial psychiatric assessment in the relevant health board areas.</P>
      <P>The first report also recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units for children ranging from six-16 years should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established to develop child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and one in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area &ndash; at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview.</P>
      <P>The second report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry published in June 2003, contains proposals for the development of psychiatric services for 16-18 year olds. It recommends that, in the further development of the child and adolescent psychiatric service, priority should be given to the recruitment in each health board area of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence.</P>
      <P>Further implementation of the recommendations of the reports of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry will be considered in the context of the Estimates process for 2004 and subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, will be considered in the context of the work of the recently established expert group on mental health policy. It is <Col N="371" /> expected that the expert group will report within 18 months.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department met with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in March of this year to discuss a number of areas of mutual interest including the proposed ban on smoking in the workplace. Officials of my Department outlined the proposal to the Northern Ireland officials. There is also ongoing co-operation between the health promotion unit of my Department and the Northern Ireland Health Promotion Agency in regard to advertising and smoking cessation measures.</P>
      <P>My primary concern in introducing a ban on the smoking of tobacco in workplaces is to protect workers and the public from exposure to toxic environmental tobacco smoke which is an avoidable cause of disease and ill health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf <Col N="372" /> of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed regarding the existing infrastructure at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Many of the buildings comprising the hospital are approximately 50 years old, and have not been upgraded in any significant way over that period. As a result, they do not now generally meet contemporary standards for paediatric hospital facilities.</P>
    <P>On foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin Hospital, I approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. The team includes representatives from the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of an outline development control plan which will set the context for future capital developments on the site. A project manager has been appointed to oversee the preparation of a brief for the ODCP, and this document is due to be completed by year-end.</P>
    <P>It is intended that a phased approach to new development and the upgrade of facilities will be taken. A phased approach will ensure that services continue to be provided at the hospital during the redevelopment.</P>
    <P>A sub-group of the project team is planning the interim development of three particular priorities in accordance with the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA, as follows: provision of MRI facilities, upgrade and extension of the haematology/oncology department and infrastructural upgrade of the cardiology department.</P>
    <P>A number of additional major developments, funded by the Exchequer, are currently being put in place at the hospital. These include a &euro;30 million investment in the new operating department which will provide two additional theatres, increasing the capacity of the hospital to five major theatres and two minor theatres. This development is designed to increase the capacity of the hospital to meet the additional surgery demands at both in-patient and out-patient level.</P>
    <P>Last week I announced the allocation of &euro;250,000 capital funding in 2003 towards the purchase of equipment for a telemedicine link between Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and St. Jude's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee. Telemedicine will enable real time access between both hospitals. This will allow joint case conferences between clinicians in both hospitals to discuss test results, diagnosis and treatment protocols.</P>
    <P>St. Jude's Hospital is a world leader in the successful management of childhood cancers and provides access to cutting edge research, prestigious clinical expertise and innovative technologies. This investment supports improved ser<Col N="373" /> vices in paediatric oncology, a key priority in the development of cancer services.</P>
    <P>I recently had a very positive meeting with representatives of the new Crumlin hospital group, which is composed of parents of children who regularly attend Crumlin hospital for treatment. I reassured the group of my absolute commitment to the total redevelopment of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, as a priority.</P>

      <P>The advisory group examining the feasibility of introducing a no-fault compensation scheme for brain damaged infants has met regularly since its establishment in July 2001. The group has conducted an extensive investigation of the clinical and legal issues involved in the handling of those cases. I hope that the group will be in a position to present its final report in 2003.</P>
      <P>Recent settlements made on behalf of infants with cerebral palsy emphasise the need to complete the examination of the issue being undertaken by the advisory group. However, as the group has already indicated its intention of completing its work by the end of this year I feel that it would not be appropriate to ask them to expedite the process.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services at James Connolly Memorial Hospital rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is advised that construction of phase 1 of the new hospital development at James <Col N="374" /> Connolly Memorial Hospital is now complete with the exception of some snagging work which is being carried out by the contractors. This major development is being funded jointly by the Northern Area Health Board &ndash; through the sale of surplus lands &ndash; and my Department. The projected full project cost is &euro;101.4 million. This includes an amount of &euro;5 million approved earlier this year to facilitate refurbishment works at the hospital which are necessary as part of the transition process to the new hospital and to facilitate a land transfer in line with the project development arrangements.</P>
    <P>There has been progress recently in commissioning the new facilities. The coronary care unit, formerly located in unit 7, has recently moved to the new building together with 35 medical/cardiac beds. In addition the therapeutic treatment centre has moved to its new location on the ground floor of the new facility. The ERHA, the Northern Area Health Board, and the management of James Connolly Memorial Hospital are also finalising arrangements to transfer existing accident and emergency services to the new facility upon its anticipated completion in November. The additional revenue required to further commission the new facilities will be the subject of consideration as part of the Estimates process for 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011, with 450 additional public beds to be in place by the end of 2002. I introduced the first phase of this process in January 2002 which provided funding for an additional 709 acute beds. My Department has been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards that, to date, 568 of these beds have been commissioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods. Bed closures may arise for a variety of reasons and may fluctuate over time. My Department routinely collects information on beds not in use in acute hospitals from health agencies on a quarterly basis. In 2002 acute hospital bed closures resulted from ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff leave, seasonal closures and as <Col N="375" /> a consequence of the winter vomiting bug. The total bed days lost in 2002 as a result of these closures is equivalent to a daily average of 269 beds being closed which represents approximately 2% of the overall available capacity. The equivalent percentage for 2001 was also 2%.</P>
    <P>Some hospitals, particularly in the Dublin region, have temporarily closed some beds in 2003 as a result of resource limitations in order to remain within budget. These closures are in addition to the normal seasonal closures that take place in hospitals around the country during holiday periods. Data collected for the period January-March 2003 shows that 23,413 bed days were lost due to some beds not being available for use. This is equivalent to a daily average of 260 beds being temporarily out of use in the period.</P>

      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency undertakes quarterly surveys of nursing vacancies, the latest of which is for the year ending 30 June 2003. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The main points of the survey are: there were 1,224 extra nurses employed in the health service in the year ending 30 June 2003; 931 nurses were recruited from abroad in the year ending 30 June 2003 by the employers surveyed; 294 nurses work every day in the hospitals as agency nurses; and the vacancy rate now stands at 2.75% nationally.</P>
      <P>While all sectors reported that recruitment was well ahead of resignations/retirements, employers reported that 1,007 vacancies existed at 30 June 2003. However, the combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime adequately compensates for this shortfall.</P>
      <P>The current vacancy rate of 2.75% could be considered to be a normal frictional rate, given that there will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of opportunities to change employments and locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff has been a concern of this Government for some time, and a number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years. These include: an increase of 70% in the number of nursing training places from 968 in 1998 to 1,640 in 2002; payment of fees to <Col N="376" /> nurses/midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses/midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for back-to-practice courses and payment of salary to nurses/midwives undertaking such courses; financial support to State enrolled nurses, SENs, working in the Irish health service wishing to undertake nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom; and 40 sponsorships are made available each year for certain categories of health service employees wishing to train as nurses.</P>
    <P>I would like to illustrate the improvements that have taken place in nursing numbers generally over the past few years. In 1998, there were 26,611 whole-time equivalent nurses employed in the public health system. By the end of 2002 this figure had reached 33,395. This is an increase of almost 6,800 during the period or over 25%.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these figures that the recruitment and retention measures I introduced are proving to be very effective. In addition, An Bord Altranais continues to receive applications for registration from overseas nurses, including from the Philippines.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to Filipino nurses is that they have the same working conditions and rates of pay as all other nurses working in the health services. In addition, all genuine nursing experience is taken into account for incremental purposes.</P>
    <P>A recent survey of EU nursing pay rates by my Department indicates that the average annual salary for a nurse with ten years experience is &euro;30,247. In Ireland, the same nurse would be paid &euro;34,103 per annum which represents a premium of almost 13%. In the United Kingdom, a nurse with ten years experience earns &euro;25,940 per annum. In Ireland, premium pay, which includes overtime, unsocial hours and night duty rates, typically adds a further 23% to basic earnings.</P>
    <P>Regular contacts are maintained between the Philippines Embassy in London, the honorary consul in Dublin and my Department. At a recent meeting, the deputy head of mission at the Philippines Embassy in London stated that Filipino nurses have been treated well in Ireland, that Irish employment laws are worker-friendly and adequately protect the rights of Filipino workers, and that Irish people are friendly and receptive to immigrant workers. The deputy head of mission also stated that Ireland remains competitive for foreign skilled workers, particularly Filipinos.</P>
    <P>Excellent relations and levels of co-operation have been established between the Irish and Filipino authorities, and I would like to place on record my appreciation of the contribution Filipino nurses have made to our health service.</P>

      <P>Costs arising in 2003 in relation to the health service reform programme will be met from within existing allocations.</P>
      <P>In relation to funding for the implementation of the health strategy, the budget day package for 2002 provided &euro;209 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital. This funding provided for the development of new initiatives and further development of certain existing services which were set out in the strategy. The additional &euro;209 million revenue included &euro;10 million for primary care general practitioner co-operatives and &euro;5 million for primary care units. The &euro;40 million additional capital funding referred to above includes &euro;5 million for primary care.</P>
      <P>An additional &euro;216 million revenue and &euro;18 million capital over 2002 funding was made available in 2003. This represents a continuation of developments initiated in 2002 and enables further progress in implementing the national health strategy. The revenue figure includes &euro;8 million for primary care general practitioner co-operatives and &euro;2 million for primary care units.</P>
      <P>Funding for 2004 and subsequent years will be discussed by the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance in the context of the 2004 Estimates.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>I received a copy of the Medical Council's report of an inquiry into the professional conduct of the person in question on 29 July. The report is a dreadful indictment of the treatment of the women concerned who have been both physically and emotionally scarred.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council requested that the very serious issues raised in its report be explored and I met with the council on 2 September 2003 to discuss its implications.</P>
      <P>On 23 September 2003, I met with representatives from Patient Focus and listened carefully to the case histories of a number of the patients concerned. I reiterated my concern at the findings of the Medical Council's investigation.</P>
      <P>Arising from these meetings, I believe that further inquiries into practices at the hospital concerned are required. I am considering a number of options in relation to the scope and format of such an inquiry. I will be meeting again with Patient Focus later this month to review the position.</P>
      <P>My Department has undertaken a thorough review over the past two years of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978. This review has involved widespread consultation with key stakeholders in the public health service. The views of patients, doctors, the Medical Council, health service agencies, training bodies and medical representative organisations have been obtained. The information contained in these submissions has contributed to the draft proposals that will be contained in a new medical practitioners (amendment) Bill. Preparation of the draft heads is now at an advanced stage. I intend that these heads will be put before the Cabinet as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings of the recent fitness to practice inquiry by the Medical Council will be taken fully into account in the proposals that will be put to Cabinet. Relevant issues regarding this case that are being incorporated in the preparation of the new amendment Bill include greater public interest representation to improve transparency and accountability, various enhanced fitness to <Col N="380" /> practice measures, and the urgent introduction and development of competence assurance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's budget day decision of 4 December 2002 that total public service employment is to be reduced by 5,000 over the three-year period to end 2005. My Department subsequently initiated consultations with each health board with a view to identifying measures which could be taken in the health service to contribute to the overall reduction required.</P>
      <P>In formulating proposals for the health service for the implementation of the planned reduction in employment levels, a key objective was, of course, to ensure that full account was taken of priorities in service provision and in particular the need to minimise the impact of the reduction in employment on front-line service delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, in view of the high proportion of the total health service employees in front-line service delivery roles, the Government has <Col N="381" /> recently decided that the contribution of the health service to the planned overall reduction should be limited to 600 personnel in whole-time equivalent terms over the three-year period to end 2005. This will require that the national employment ceiling for the health service be reduced from 96,000 to 95,800 by end-year.</P>
    <P>The national 200 post reduction is being applied across the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority based on current employment ceilings.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the regional employment level over the next three months is to be achieved by maximising the benefit of natural wastage, through detailed scrutiny of replacement recruitment in the health service and non-filling of any non-essential posts with specific emphasis on posts that are not directly involved in the delivery of front-line services. It is intended that this approach will, as much as possible, minimise any adverse impact on existing levels of service to the public in key areas.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the arrangements are to be undertaken in a manner consistent with agreed protocols for consultation with staff representatives at local level, and in conformity with the provisions set out in Sustaining Progress for the maintenance of a stable industrial relations environment.</P>

      <P>Consideration of the future corporate status of VHI is ongoing in my Department.</P>
      <P>The setting of premium charges is the responsibility of the VHI board. The legislation requires the board to set premiums at a level sufficient to cover costs and make proper allowance for reserves. The board is, however, obliged to notify the Minister in advance of putting proposed increases into effect. The Minister may prevent the introduction of an increase, but must give reasons for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures provided by the VHI board in support of its premium increase included financial details, that incorporated projected profits. It should be noted that the premium increase, which took effect from 1 September in respect of renewals and new policies effected from that date, will not impact significantly on the out-turn for the finan<Col N="382" /> cial year ending February 2004, but is critical when looking at the following years.</P>
    <P>Information on future trends in claims, which VHI will have to meet on behalf of members, is pivotal when considering the need for premium increases. The percentage increase in premiums implemented was considered by the VHI board to be the minimum necessary, given a higher percentage increase in projected claims costs. The board, as an insurer, must maintain sufficient reserves to pay claims as they fall due. Due to historically low profits, the board's solvency ratio is below what would be generally acceptable in the industry, though it has improved in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening programme has been up and running in the Mid-Western Health Board since October 2000. Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered to approximately 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group, free of charge, at five-year intervals.</P>
      <P>Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to the full extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The process of planning and organising the national programme is a major undertaking that requires careful consideration involving as it does significant logistical and resource implications. The Health Boards' Executive has initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll out of the national programme. The work currently being undertaken as part of the roll out includes the planning and undertaking of an evaluation of phase one, policy development and the establishment of national governance arrangements. This work is informed by both the experiences gained from the phase one programme and the learning derived from other international programmes and current international best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evaluation of phase one, which comprises an integrated evaluation and planning approach, is currently under way. It is intended that the retrospective analysis will be linked closely to establishing best practice and emerging international thinking on cervical screening and that this will inform the development of a high quality cervical screening model for Ireland. The evaluation dimensions will include: the overall approach to be taken by the national programme in the context of best practice elsewhere; quality <Col N="383" /> assurance arrangements; standard operating procedures; governance arrangements; business model and organisational arrangements; programme screening policies; a population register; and risk analysis and payment arrangements. It is expected that this evaluation of phase one will be completed early in the new year. A separate study to review the functioning of the programme in terms of its women's charter is also planned.</P>
    <P>In regard to policy development, I am advised that the sub group established by HeBE is currently preparing a series of policy proposals to be adopted by the programme. These policy proposals will address a wide range of issues including: the priority target groups to be reached by the programme; the most appropriate screening intervals; laboratory accreditation; the use of liquid based cytology; information systems; HPV immunisation, and the development of population registers.</P>
    <P>In summary, the evaluation of phase one is a major part of the planning process for the national programme and once it is completed HeBE has advised that it will be in a position to prepare a draft roll out plan. Furthermore, governance structures for the full national programme are also currently being considered. A final decision on structures will be taken in the context of the evaluation report and roll out plan.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to produce a situation report about the position in Ireland and in the United States in respect of a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia.</P>
      <P>As part of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner liaised with solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society. He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in the HIV haemophiliac litigation in the United States. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm in relation to the matters relevant to his investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Gardiner furnished a report to me which consisted of a 60 page opinion and a number of appendices, one of which comprised over 50 pages of legal advice from the US lawyers. The report drew attention to the fact that there is no <Col N="384" /> guarantee that the US authorities would provide judicial assistance to an Irish tribunal, either in relation to enforcing the discovery of documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses. I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the content of the report and I provided the Irish Haemophilia Society with a copy of it.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties that have been identified, I believe it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would access publicly available material and seek the assistance of persons and bodies willing to co-operate with such investigation. The Committees of Investigation Bill may provide an appropriate mechanism for this inquiry.</P>
    <P>I intend to maintain contact with the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to the format and scope of the proposed investigation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of services at Bantry Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board. The board has been supporting the phased development of services at the hospital over the past number of years. A total of &euro;2.45 million has been invested in improving the physical structure of the hospital and in the upgrading and replacement of equipment. As the Deputy will be aware, a strategic development plan is in place for an extended hospital campus in Bantry.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming National Task Force on Medical Staffing (Hanly) report will further inform decisions in relation to the configuration of services in acute hospitals. The task force was asked to make recommendations about how to best organise hospital medical staffing within the hospital system, having regard to the requirement of the European Working Time Directive to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the recommendations of the forum on Medical Manpower. The report of the task force on medical staffing is currently before Government for consideration and will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>While I understand that the task force will make recommendations regarding the organisation and staffing of acute hospitals, it will not be recommending closure of any hospitals.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, action 15 of the health strategy states that a policy for men's health and health promotion will be developed. The National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005 also identified the development of a national plan for men's health as an important initiative. Work will commence on the development of this plan in association with the relevant stakeholders as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Interest in men's health to date has tended to be on &ldquo;male specific&rdquo; conditions and increased emphasis on men's health in the wider context is now needed. In this regard, the health promotion unit of my Department has supported the appointment of a men's health research officer, in the South-Eastern Health Board, to research the role of gender and masculinities on Irish men's concept of health, their knowledge, beliefs and attitudes to health and illness, health behaviours and risk behaviours, and the barriers that Irish men perceive in accessing the health services. The findings from this study will inform the development of the men's health action plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle established a committee to, <i>inter alia</i>, examine existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and to make recommendations on the future organisation and development of those services.</P>
      <P>The Comhairle report has recently been published and recommends significant enhancement of neurology and neurophysiology services, including increases in consultant manpower. The report also recognises that there are aspects of a number of other specialties and services such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry which are related to and overlap with neurology services. Comhairle has recommended that a national multi-disciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework in relation to the development of neurology services. Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is currently being prepared by my Department. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its own publications will, in my view, offer a more comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the Alliance and the Irish Consultant Neurologists' Association (in the form of a joint working group) in relation to the future development of services.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board (SHB) area and on a national basis.</P>
      <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The SHB was allocated an additional &euro;1.191 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. The post of consultant orthodontist for Tralee was advertised through the Local Appointments Commission (LAC) on two separate occasions but unfortunately there were no successful candidates. The efforts of the board are hindered by the limited availability of suitably qualified candidates for the post.</P>
      <P>However, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to a specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor will take up duty in December next. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treat<Col N="388" /> ment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The SHB was allocated an additional &euro;720,000 from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</P>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. There is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officer of the SHB has informed me that at the end of the June 2003 quarter, there were 3,400 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of approximately 1,100 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001.</P>

      <P>Work is at an advanced stage in my Department in relation to all aspects of establishing the office including the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children. As the Deputy will be aware, it has always been the intention that children would be involved in the selection process. This is the first time this approach has been used for selection within the public sector and considerable work is required to ensure that children play a meaningful role in the recruitment process. This work is being carried out by officials from my Department working closely with the National Children's Office and the Civil Service Commission. I expect the post of Ombudsman to be advertised shortly.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of this Act, the Medical Council was enabled to prescribe rules relating to the registration of medical practitioners, rules for the recognition of health care settings in which training may take place, rules relating to the recognition of primary qualifications obtained from EU medical schools for the purposes of internship registration and rules relating to short-term temporary registration, subject to my approval.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I am currently carrying out a comprehensive review of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978. It is my intention that the heads of the Bill for an amendment Act, which are at an advanced stage, will be put before Cabinet as soon as possible. As part of this review process, consultations have been carried out with a number of bodies, including patient groups, medical representative organisations, and the key stakeholders in health service provision, regulation and postgraduate medical education and training. Some of the main issues under consideration are greater public interest representation, accountability and transparency, the fitness to practise procedures and competence assurance measures.</P>

The task force has examined the implications of a consultant-provided service in order to improve the quality and delivery of patient care. I expect the task force to make recommendations regarding the appropriate number of consultants in all specialties, including ENT and orthopaedics. The task force report is currently being considered by Government and will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>A Comhairle na nOspidéal committee has also been established to examine the provision of consultant-level ENT services.

I listened carefully to the views expressed by the group who presented a number of case studies to me.</P>
      <P>I advised the group that arrangements have been made by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to make a range of services available to women who had undergone the procedure of symphysiotomy including the provision of counselling services and an information pack for patients to be compiled. A similar pack will also be made available to general practitioners. Also independent clinical advice will be offered where requested. The establishment of a helpline for patients is to be considered as a priority. Sympathetic consideration will also be given to the refund of medical expenses in respect of treatments required to address the effects of symphysiotomy, including the provision of medical assessment and treatment for patients.</P>
      <P>The ERHA/health boards are to forward the name of liaison persons and to supply the group with details regarding the numbers of symphysiotomies carried out in their area.</P>
      <P>I also advised the group that I would commission an external review of the procedure of symphysiotomy in Ireland in order to fully respond to the concerns of the group. Officials of my Department will be meeting again shortly with the group to review progress.</P>

      <P>A working group was established by the Minister for Health and Children in June 2000 to make recommendations on how child and adolescent psychiatric services should be developed in the short, medium and long-term to meet identified needs.</P>
      <P>To date, the Working Group on Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services has made recommendations in relation to the organisation of services for the treatment and management of attention deficit hyperactive disorder, (ADHD), the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient units and the provision of services for 16-18 year olds.</P>
      <P>In the course of its work on services for 16-18 year olds, the working group noted a lack of information on numbers of referrals and non-attendees at out-patient clinics. Among its recommendations was the establishment of a database in this area.</P>
      <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, will be considered in the context of the work of the recently established expert group on mental health policy.

      <P>The report on perinatal statistics for 1999, published in December 2002, which is the most recent national data, stated that 36.16% of women exclusively breast-fed their babies on discharge from hospital, an increase from the previous published data of 1993. While this increase is encouraging it is clear that there is a need to heighten the acceptability of breastfeeding as a normal and natural process and create a greater public awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding for babies, mothers and society in general.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to the promotion of breastfeeding, as an integral part of a long-term plan to ultimately improve the health of the nation. A strategic objective of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness is: to generate positive attitudes to breastfeeding by promoting the unique nutritional advantages and the long lasting health protective benefits of breastfeeding for infants and young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end, the health promotion unit of my Department has recently embarked on a national breast-feeding campaign, which I launched on 30 September, to coincide with national breast-feeding week. The theme of the campaign is &ldquo;There <Col N="392" /> are reasons why breast is best&rdquo;. The campaign consists of a series of press advertisements, a breast-feeding awareness TV advertisement and various events around the country which aim to inform people of the numerous health benefits of breastfeeding. The Health Promotion Unit also produced a selection of print materials which will continue to be utilised to highlight the benefits of breastfeeding.</P>
    <P>In March 2002, I established the National Committee on Breastfeeding, a group representative of relevant health professions, the health boards, health promotion professionals and voluntary organisations. Chaired by Professor Miriam Wiley, ESRI, the committee published its interim report in May of this year. The report was the culmination of the committee's review of the 1994 national breast-feeding policy. The work of the national committee has now refocussed to develop a way forward for the promotion, protection and support of breastfeeding in this country. Its next report is due in late 2004.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of important initiatives currently under way to meet the human resource needs of the health services. The implementation of these developments will make an important contribution to strengthening the capacity of the health services to recruit and retain the high calibre professionals required in all disciplines to fill challenging and demanding roles central to the delivery of quality health and social care services to the public. Before setting out these initiatives in detail, it is important to emphasise that staffing requirements overall must be viewed in the context of the very substantial increases in employment levels achieved in the health services over the past several years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of each individual health board has responsibility for the management of the workforce, including the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff employed within that board, in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the authorised ceiling. The Deputy may wish to note that there were a total of 95,679 persons in wholetime equivalent (WTE) terms recorded in the annual health service personnel census at end-2002. This is an increase of nearly 28,000 staff or almost 41% since 1997, <Col N="394" /> bringing the current authorised employment ceiling to 96,000 in 2002 (excluding home helps).</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that comparing employment levels at end-2002 to those five years previously, there are 22% (+6,049) more nurses, 36% more medical/dental personnel (+1,799) and over double the amount of health and social care professionals (+6,608) employed in the health services.</P>
    <P>This is a considerable achievement which reflects the success of the steps taken to increase the attractiveness of employment in the health services and also the ongoing measures being taken in areas experiencing shortages of fully trained and qualified staff.</P>
    <P>Developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all played a part in increasing staffing levels. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body will make a further contribution to recruitment and improved retention. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has, over recent years, also contributed significantly to meeting the workforce needs of the health services, particularly in professions where qualified staff are scarce.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Employers Agency (HSEA) undertakes quarterly surveys of nursing vacancies, the latest of which is for the year ending 30 June 2003.</P>
    <P>The main points of the survey are: there were 1,224 extra nurses employed in the health service in the year ending 30 June 2003; 931 nurses were recruited from abroad in the year ending 30 June 2003; 294 nurses work every day in the hospitals as agency nurses; the vacancy rate now stands at 2.75% nationally.</P>
    <P>Last year, 1,640 nursing training places are available, 58% higher than the number available in 1998. In addition, there are now in excess of 800 places available on specialist postgraduate courses including accident and emergency, coronary care and oncology. A comprehensive package of incentives, including payment of fees and other financial supports, are available to nurses undertaking these courses. It is clear from these figures that the recruitment and retention measures I introduced are proving to be very effective.</P>
    <P>The latest survey of numbers from the Health Services Employers Agency (HSEA) show that, out of a total complement of 3,974 filled non-consultant hospital doctor posts as at 30 September 2003, there are 21 vacancies, giving a vacancy rate of just 0.53%. These statistics clearly show that we have the lowest vacancy rate ever among the NCHD cohort this year. Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body set up under the Health Act 1970 to regulate the number and type of appointments of hospital consultants in the Irish public health service. According to Comhairle na nOspidéal, in September 2003 the number of approved permanent hospital consultant posts in the public sector was 1,792, an increase of 61 posts since 1 January 2003.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant reduction in the number of adults waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of children waiting <Col N="395" /> for more than six months for in-patient treatment in the nine target specialties has fallen by 56% in the period June 2002 to March 2003. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target specialties has fallen by 35% in the same period.</P>
    <P>The national treatment purchase fund is used for the purpose of treating public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment. To date, more than 7,200 patients have received treatment under the NTPF. The fund has identified capacity to treat up to 800 patients per month predominantly in Ireland and in four hospitals in the UK. The NTPF will continue to identify capacity to treat those public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment. Some &euro;31 million has been made available to the NTPF in 2003.</P>
    <P>In-patient and day-case discharges from acute hospitals amounted to 958,000 (provisional) in 2002. This figure represents approximately 2,600 patients per day being discharged for each day of the year and is an overall increase of more than 4% on the number of discharges in 2001. There was an increase of over 12% in the number of day cases between 2001 and 2002. It is expected that about 1 million in-patients and day cases will be treated this year in acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have announced a &euro;40 million investment package aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period 2000/2001. The investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including the recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants and consultant anaesthetists. To date, an additional 20 accident and emergency consultants and 18 consultant anaesthetists have been appointed under this initiative. Additional appointments are being progressed by the health boards and the ERHA.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Employers Agency engaged consultants to conduct a staffing review of accident and emergency hospital units, focussing on nursing resources. My officials and nursing unions received copies of the draft final report on 7 October 2003 and are currently studying its contents. The consultants will make a presentation on their findings in the near future to key people involved in the provision of accident and emergency services. It is expected that the staffing review will be discussed at the next meeting of the accident and emergency forum in December.</P>
    <P>On 18 June this year, the Government announced the most extensive reform programme for the health system in over 30 years. The programme's focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management. The reform programme includes measures which will impact on every element of the health system and work has been ongoing in recent months to plan in detail, in conjunction with widespread consultation, the programme of change envisaged. The report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing (Hanly report), which has been completed and is due to be launched shortly, will also make an important <Col N="396" /> contribution to planning how the health services should provide a high-quality, consultant-provided service. The task force has set out a series of principles for the organisation and delivery of hospital services nationally while making detailed recommendations regarding the organisation of acute hospital services in two regions. This will harness the strengths of all hospitals so that they can best meet the needs of patients. The task force proposes that while emergency care must be concentrated in major hospitals, reorganisation of hospital medical staffing and acute hospital services offers the potential for a wider range of safe, effective and high-quality care to be offered in smaller or local hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that these will provide an increasing volume of elective procedures and the kind of multi-specialist day and out-patient care that is currently performed in larger hospitals. These services would give people local access to a wider range of hospital services and, where needed, allow them to recuperate much nearer home. The core of their services would include minor injury and illness units, high quality diagnostic services, outpatient clinics, day procedures, pre and post-natal maternity services, intermediate care and rehabilitation and convalescence beds.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious that, in view of the large numbers of staff employed and the unique nature of the services being delivered, it is imperative that a coherent, strategic approach to workforce and human resource planning be developed further and aligned closely with strategic objectives and the service planning process. Planning for the development of new and existing services in the future must be soundly based on a robust and realistic assessment of the skill and human resource needs to deliver these services. The issue of skill mix is also of paramount importance in meeting human resource needs. Enhanced skills mix by matching skills to service needs benefits patients and empowers health personnel to reach their full potential and optimise their contribution to quality care.</P>
    <P>I am, however, well aware that, in addition to effective planning to ensure the continued availability of a qualified, competent workforce, it is also necessary for the health service to become an employer of choice to further improve potential for recruitment and retention. While the record number of staff recruited into the health service in the past number of years shows the progress that has been made in this regard, even more can be achieved. Having recruited and developed such a large number of staff over recent years, it is a priority to retain them by offering a challenging and rewarding career path. In the human capital and skills intensive health sector, retention has been identified as a key issue in better people management. The implementation of the action plan for people management has a crucial role to play in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled staff, while providing the opportunity for each member of the workforce in the health sector, to maximise their contribution to the creation of a quality and pati<Col N="397" /> ent-centred health service in line with the objectives of the health strategy.</P>

      <P>The 1996 report of the working party on Tuberculosis made recommendations on which my <Col N="398" /> Department's TB strategy for the prevention and treatment of the disease is based. The recommendations covered a range of issues including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management and laboratory diagnosis. Arising from the report, the National Tuberculosis Committee was established to advise on a detailed national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis. The committee meets when necessary to review all issues concerning the control and management of tuberculosis.</P>

    <P>*Data for 2002 are provisional.</P>
    <P>The TB incidence rate for 2002 was 10.2 per 100,000, as compared to an incidence rate of 17.1 per 100,000 in 1992.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of health services at Peamount Hospital rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA).</P>
    <P>In July 2000, Comhairle na nOspidéal made a number of recommendations on the future organisation and delivery of respiratory and tuberculosis services. Comhairle recognised the valuable role which Peamount Hospital has played for many years. However, in line with major advances in medical treatment, it recommended that the optimal in-patient care of patients with respiratory diseases, including tuberculosis, is more appropriate to local acute general hospitals, staffed by consultant respiratory physicians and other consultants supported by an array of investigative facilities. Peamount Hospital was not regarded by Comhairle na nOspidéal as an appropriate location for the treatment of TB patients, especially those requiring ventilation and specialised treatment for other symptoms (heart disease, HIV, etc.) who may present with TB.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal subsequently appointed a committee to advance the implementation of the 2000 report. The report of this committee, which endorsed the recommendations in the earlier Comhairle report, was adopted by Comhairle in April 2003. Specifically the committee recommended that Peamount Hospital play an active role in the provision of a range of non-acute support services, including pulmonary rehabilitation, within the South-Western Area Health Board. For example, it recommends that patients who have been treated in the nearby St. James's Hospital and other major acute hospitals, and who require on-going rehabilitative care, could be transferred to Peamount Hospital for completion of their care.</P>
    <P>My Department is advised by the ERHA that, in addition to the Comhairle advice on this issue, the board of Peamount Hospital has developed a strategic plan for the development of the hospital over the next five years. The hospital employed external support to assist them in this process and advise of developments in the wider health care environment. My Department has received representations from and on behalf of staff at Peamount Hospital arising from this review of services. The strategy adopted by the board proposes considerable enhancement of existing services and development of new services in the areas of rehabilitation and continuing care of older people, persons with intellectual disabilities and adults with neurological or pulmonary illness. The implications for the acute respiratory services currently provided at the hospital are being assessed, following which it is understood there will be further consultation with a range of relevant parties. The authority will participate fully in this process to ensure that the interests of, and potential benefits to, patients of the region are fully realised.</P>

      <P>My Department has noted the finding of the UK court in relation to the case referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Ireland has consistently implemented the relevant provisions under Article 22 of EU Regulation 1408/71. This article deals with, inter alia, health care entitlements for EU citizens in member states other than the state of residence. My Department is currently, in conjunction with counterparts in other member states of the European Union, engaged in a review of EU regulation 1408/71. An important aspect of this is the introduction of a European health insurance card, the purpose of which is to further facilitate the greater mobility of EU nationals between member states.</P>
      <P>In 2002, I established the national treatment purchase fund for the purpose of treating those public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment. To date more than 7,200 patients have received treatment under the NTPF, which has identified capacity to treat up to 800 patients per month, predominantly in Ireland but also in four hospitals in the UK. Some &euro;31 million has been made available to the NTPF in 2003.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I announced the national extension of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme on 27 March 2003.</P>
      <P>The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary S.R. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will be at University College Hospital, Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage are counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary N.R.</P>
      <P>Under the extension, approximately 150,000 women in the target population 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 510 cancers per annum among this population.</P>
      <P>Under the business plan submitted by BreastCheck to the Department, the national expansion of the programme to the west and the south is costed at &euro;27 million, including &euro;13 million capital costs. It is anticipated that additional costs will be incurred by the host hospitals and these are being assessed at present.</P>
      <P>Approval has issued for the establishment of two capital project teams to develop a brief for the capital infrastructure needed for the static units in the south and west. This approval will allow for the immediate commencement of the detailed planning for the national roll-out. In relation to funding requirements, I do not anticipate additional revenue requirements for this programme this year. Revenue requirements for subsequent years will be considered in the context of the Estimates process. As regards capital costs, discussions are on-going involving officials of my Department, BreastCheck and relevant health agencies.</P>
      <P>Discussions have also commenced concerning operational plans for the national roll-out, including linkages with the symptomatic services.</P>

      <P>The health reform programme was announced on 18 June 2003. It represents the most ambitious programme of reform for any part of the public sector for over 30 years. The programme's priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management.</P>
      <P>The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Heath System, which were also published on the same day.</P>
      <P>The new structure set out in this reform programme will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management. It will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system.</P>
      <P>As an immediate priority, the Government has decided to put in place robust structures to manage implementation of the reform programme. A programme plan has been developed to map out the details of implementation for this large-scale and wide-ranging reform in a system which itself could not be more challenging in scope, scale and complexity.</P>
      <P>During phase one of this plan, due to be completed by year end, 13 action projects have been established to take forward specific aspects of the programme. They are formed by staff with the required competencies from the Department of Health and Children, the health boards, the Department of Finance, the Health Services National Partnership Forum and, in selected cases, voluntary and specialist agencies.</P>
      <P>Other aspects of the programme will be advanced in other ways involving the core staff of my Department, through the interim structures to be established shortly or through existing committees and task forces already established. I expect to be in a position to revert to Government shortly in relation to the appointment of a chairperson and board of the interim Health Service Executive.</P>
      <P>Change of this scale must draw on the experience and expertise of all those working in the system. It requires detailed planning and the support of key system stakeholders who must be involved in that planning if this programme is to be a success.</P>

      <P>With regard to the implementation of action 77 of Quality and Fairness, there are out of hours co-operatives in all health board areas at present, the majority of which provide full out of hours cover while, others in the ERHA area provide limited hours of operation. The level of patient satisfaction with the service being offered by the co-ops is very high from both the patient and provider perspectives. Independent evaluations undertaken in two health board areas show that the initiatives provide significant enhancement in service. Surveys of patient satisfaction with the out of hours services being provided continue to be taken by the co-operatives. Co-operatives show in a very real way what can be achieved when people come together in a constructive partnership of ideas and objectives. Government support for the development of general practitioner out of hours co-operatives nationally for the period 1997 to 2003 amounted to &euro;46.5 million.</P>
      <P>This type of co-operative serves as a basis for providing not only general practitioner services at nights and weekends. In time, they can also be developed to provide a much wider range of community based health services that ensure that communities, irrespective of size and distance from major urban centres, enjoy appropriate access to primary care services. Indeed, the use of the many technological advances available to us today can be fully exploited to bring considerable benefits to remote areas.</P>
      <P>My Department continues to provide funding for projects under the research and education fund. This fund taken from the indicative drugs target scheme allows projects to be undertaken which will be of benefit to general practice as a whole. The normal recipients are Departments of general practice at universities or doctors or other health professionals currently in general practice.</P>
      <P>With regard to national initiatives to complement the primary care model, my Department requested the health board chief executive officers to establish a national group to co-ordinate the preparation of needs assessments in accordance with action two of the strategy, Primary Care &ndash; A New Direction. The group has developed a set of agreed definitions and templates for the completion of the needs assessments on a regional basis. Work has been undertaken by the individual health boards and this will be followed by the development of models for use at local level for primary care team and network populations.</P>
      <P>I have also provided funding of &euro;360,000 for the establishment of three research fellowships in primary care, in the university departments of general practice. The fellowships, which will be funded through the Health Research Board and available to the professions who will work in the new primary care teams, will enable the researchers to work on topics relevant to the implementation of the primary care strategy.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, my Department has also agreed to make funding of &euro;750,000 available over a three-year period to the university departments of general practice to support specific activity in support of the implementation of the primary care strategy. Funding is also being provided to the Irish College of General Practitioners for a three year period to enable the appointment of a research development officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October, 2002 I gave approval to the establishment of ten primary care implementation projects &ndash; one in each health board area. These projects are building on the services and resources already in place in the locations involved so as to develop a primary care team in line with the multidisciplinary model described in the strategy. To date, I have committed a total of &euro;8.4 million to these projects over 2002 and 2003. Revenue funding of &euro;877,000 was provided in 2002, and this allocation was increased to &euro;4.5 million in 2003.  Once-off capital funding of &euro;2 million and a further &euro;1million in respect of information and communications technology support for the teams was also provided in 2002.</P>
      <P>The spread of locations, ranging from the centre-city urban to the rural communities of the west of Ireland, has been chosen to reflect the variety of circumstances around the country in which primary care services must be delivered and to explore, in a practical way, how primary care teams will operate. Each location has its own intrinsic challenges and each primary care team will have to adapt to the needs of the area and community it serves. The objective is that, when the teams are in place, more than 80,000 clients altogether will benefit from having direct access to the improved range of services provided by their primary care team.</P>
      <P>My Department has set an objective for each project to have its team operational by the end of this year. Projects are currently at different stages of development, with a number already providing new or enhanced primary care services to their target populations. Even at this early stage, some of the benefits which were anticipated for both service users and providers are, I understand, becoming evident in these cases.</P>
      <P>My Department is in ongoing contact with each health board to monitor progress with each implementation project. One of the priority objectives over the coming months will be for the Department and the health boards to work together to develop an appropriate standard system of monitoring and evaluation for these and other primary care projects.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present developing a policy document which is intended to expand upon the key principles in the strategy to assist in informing the process of forming primary care teams and networks on a system-wide basis. I see this as an important step in helping the different parties, in terms of service planners and providers, together with potential private entrepreneurial interests, to engage in the development of capital facilities to support the model of service outlined in the primary care strategy.</P>
      <P>The primary care strategy also identified that a significant component of the development of primary care teams, in the short to medium term, would involve the reorientation of existing staff and resources. To this end, my Department will shortly be formally asking the health boards to examine how the existing primary/community care resources can best be reorganised, so as to give effect to the application of the teamworking concept, as described in the strategy, on a wider basis and to map out the geographical areas to be served by primary care teams in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>The preparation of the programme of work for my Department in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2004 is well advanced. However, it will not be finalised until December following the completion of the work of the current Italian Presidency in the policy areas relevant to my Department. The draft programme is also the subject of ongoing consultations with relevant parties in the EU institutions and among our partners at EU level with whom Ireland is required to develop annual and multi-annual operating programmes before the end of this year. I am aware that there is considerable interest on the part of many people and groups in the issues that will be dealt with by Ireland during our Presidency, a period that will also see the historic enlargement of the EU with ten new countries set to become members on 1 May 2004.</P>
      <P>The Lisbon Agenda of economic, social and environmental renewal of the EU will be a key overarching priority for the Irish Presidency. Progress on the achievement of the agenda and measures to give renewed impetus to advancing economic reform, enhancing competitiveness and stimulating employment in Europe will be the focus of the spring European Council on 25-26 March 2004. The priorities of the Irish Presidency in this area are being developed in tandem with the preparation of the overall programme of work for the Presidency.</P>
      <P>During the Presidency, I will chair two formal meetings of the Competitiveness Council of Ministers, which are scheduled to take place in Brussels on 11 March and 17-18 May 2004. Particular stress will be laid by Ireland on the need for the Competitiveness Council to focus on its horizontal remit in line with the Seville European Council in June 2002 and the Presidency Conclusions of the 2003 spring summit. It is important that there is attention at the highest political level on issues affecting the competitiveness of enterprise and I see the role of the Competitiveness Council as central to achieving this. The Council will also discuss a range of issues coming under its direct remit in areas such as enterprise, research and innovation policies and the completion and effective operation of the internal market. Specific dossiers on issues relating to intellectual property, competition, company law and consumer policy are likely to feature on the agenda but it is too soon to say with certainty what the precise status of the issues will be when Ireland assumes the Presidency next January.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will chair the sessions of the Employment Social Policy Health and Consumer Affairs (ESPHCA) Council dealing with items on which my Department takes the lead such as the European employment strategy and individual dossiers in the areas of employment rights, industrial relations and occupational health and safety measures. The ESPHCA Council is scheduled to meet in formal session on 4-5 March and 1-2 June 2004. The Irish Presidency will seek to promote closer co-operation with the two sides of industry in facilitating change and helping in the effective transformation of the European economy. To this end it will convene a tripartite social summit with the EU level social partners in advance of the 2004 spring European Council.</P>
      <P>Both the Competitiveness and ESPHCA Councils will make significant contributions towards the preparation of the spring European Council meeting next March.</P>
      <P>In the trade policy area, and following the outcome of the WTO ministerial in Cancun, the way forward is as yet somewhat uncertain. However, the focus of the Irish Presidency will be on efforts to achieve progress on all of the issues included in the negotiations. The Irish Presidency will be committed to further developing cooperation between the EU and the US on a range of economic and trade relations issues. Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern will be closely involved in pursuing the EU agenda in the foregoing areas during the Presidency.</P>
      <P>In addition to the formal Presidency agenda, my Department will be involved in the organisation of a number of additional Presidency-related meetings in Ireland. The current calendar of such events, across all policy areas, has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and will be updated on an ongoing basis in the period up to and during the Presidency.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to keep the Oireachtas informed as the Presidency preparations and priorities evolve. In addition, details will also be available in due course on the Irish Presidency website which is currently being developed, as well as on my own Department's website.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums, especially in relation to young drivers.</P>
      <P>The insurance reform programme that I announced on the 25 October last comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe. To date, 23 of the recommendations have been implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations.</P>
      <P>Establishment of the personal injuries assessment board: the Government has approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the PIAB on a statutory footing. It is hoped to enact the legislation by year-end.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</P>
      <P>I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the coordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Government Departments and other bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress is being made on a range of other measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law in relation to personal injury claims.</P>
      <P>While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses. In this regard it is heartening to report that a number of insurers have announced reductions in motor insurance premia. As implementation of the reform programme continues, I expect further reductions to occur.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 to 90, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Donegal County Development Board (DCDB) is responsible for the implementation of the recommendations in the Donegal task force report. The DCDB is implementing the recommendations through a county strategy which provides for the strategic development of the county over a ten-year period.</P>
      <P>The DCDB has already indicated that what is required is a co-ordination of local and national resources and a recognition of the particular types of obstacles faced by a county with a peripheral location and highly dependent on access and infrastructure for its future development.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for this co-ordination rests with the DCDB which is overseeing the development needs of the county.</P>
      <P>I will be meeting a delegation from the DCDB on 16 October. The meeting will focus on key priority economic infrastructure projects within the context of promoting job creation, protecting jobs and attracting investment to County Donegal.</P>
      <P>The latest Quarterly National Household Survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 28 August 2003, shows a decrease in unemployment for the border region. The unemployment rate for the region has fallen from 6.8% for the second quarter in 2002 to 6.4% for the corresponding quarter in 2003.</P>
      <P>A number of major new projects have commenced operations in the north west region in recent years. These include Abbott Ireland, PacifiCare, Prumercia and MBNA. Some 24 community enterprise centres have been funded in the north-west to-date (including ten in County Donegal). I recently announced that Convoy Community Enterprise Centre had been approved &euro;100,000 for additional enterprise space.</P>
      <P>The Inishowen Development Forum meets regularly to promote the development of the area. The Keith Prowse project commenced operations in Buncrana last year. Planning permission has also been sought by IDA Ireland for a 20,000 sq.ft. factory in Buncrana.</P>
      <P>Overall, I am satisfied with the work done to date by the State development agencies and the Donegal County Development Board. I would reiterate the Government's continuing commitment to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 to 93, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The decision to support projects under the Community Enterprise Programme 2002 Initiative is a day-to-day operational issue for Enterprise Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>However, I have been informed by Enterprise Ireland that there was an enormous response to the second call for proposals under the Community Enterprise Programme 2002 Initiative (CEC 2002) which is administered by the agency. The level of funding sought stood at &euro;17.24 million, six times greater than that which was available for approval (&euro;2.84 million). This resulted in an intensely competitive situation that resulted in more communities being disappointed than those who were supported.</P>
      <P>A two-tier evaluation system was established. The first tier involved a specially formed evaluation committee that included representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Shannon Development, the county enterprise boards, third level education, and Enterprise Ireland. This committee met over a two-day period and, in addition to reviewing each proposal, considered inputs from both Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development regional representatives. The evaluation committee rated each application under a number of criteria including the level of need in the area, the ability of the team concerned to implement the project and the financial strength of the project. The committee rated and scored each project and in this way was able to approve 15 capital applications before the amount of funding available became exhausted. The committee also recommended that feasibility support totalling &euro;19,472 be awarded to two community groups, and management support to the sum of &euro;109,000 be awarded to three further groups.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the evaluation committee were then presented to the investment committee of Enterprise Ireland, which further considered the material before reaching a final decision. That decision endorsed the recommendation of the evaluation committee by agreeing that the 15 capital projects put forward for consideration were, in a highly competitive context, the 15 best such projects, along with the five projects being approved for non-capital support. </P>
      <P>A number of projects were highly regarded by both committees but, unfortunately in the context outlined above, did not score highly enough to be approved.</P>

      <P>The live register is not designed to measure unemployment. It includes part-time workers &ndash; those who work up to three days a week &ndash; and seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The number of persons under 25 years of age on the live register at the end of September 2003 was 34,099, a decrease of 3,250 on the previous month. This compares to an annual increase of 2,673 on September 2002 figures.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey. The number of young persons unemployed in the second quarter of 2003 (the latest QNHS) has dropped slightly (100) in the 15-19 age group and has remained static in the 20-24 age group when compared to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Despite small increases in unemployment the numbers at work have increased. Employment grew by 28,000 or 1.6% in the year to the second quarter of 2003. The employment rate for 15-64 age group was 65.0%, which is the same as the previous year.</P>
      <P>The number of young persons employed in this period has dropped by 1,500 in the 15-19 age group and has increased by 3,300 in the 20-24 age group when compared to the same period in 2002. This gives an overall increase of 1,800 in young persons in employment on a year-to-year basis.</P>
      <P>Given the difficult economic climate I believe that these figures show a strong and resilient labour market, which is well placed to take advantage of any improvement in the international economic situation.</P>
      <P>FÁS continues to provide a range of services for young unemployed people with particular emphasis on early school leavers.</P>

      <P>The decision to grant-aid client companies is a day-to-day operational issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>However, I am informed by Enterprise Ireland that, while the armaments sector is not a sector that the agency would normally support in any direct sense, the complex interactions between companies and industry sectors in today's global marketplace make it impossible for the agency to know definitively, and in advance, the final use to which the products of a firm supported by Enterprise Ireland will ultimately be put. Products or components can in many cases serve more than one purpose.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland considers all applications for funding on a case-by-case basis within its legislative remit and within the overall guidelines established with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Where a significant financial investment is being considered a full commercial evaluation of the proposed business is undertaken to ascertain its commercial viability. This would typically include discussions with key clients, as a result of which Enterprise Ireland executives will have access to information regarding major contracts undertaken. However, it is not Enterprise Ireland policy to require clients to advise the agency of their client list. This is regarded as an operational matter for the company and its directors and not one with which Enterprise Ireland, in its role as a development agency, considers that it should appropriately concern itself. A detailed list of recipients of Enterprise Ireland funds is provided as part of the agency's annual report.</P>
      <P>All exports by Enterprise Ireland's clients are subject to export licences granted by my Department. In Ireland, as in most developed countries, controls are applied to the export of military and dual-use goods (dual-use goods are goods which have both a civilian and military end-use). These licensing systems generally reflect the need to comply with international obligations in relation to arms control, non-proliferation of weapons, and sanctions imposed on specific states.</P>
      <P>Given the increasing focus that is being given to the necessity to strengthen strategic export control rules, it is important to ensure that Ireland's export controls are up to the best international standards. In this context, my Department has asked Forfás to undertake a review of our strategic controls systems with a view to recommending how best we can modernise and strengthen them and ensure full compliance with Ireland's international obligations. Economic consultants have been commissioned by Forfás to carry out the review, which is being done in two phases.</P>
      <P>Phase 1 involved a short review of the current licensing system and identified perceived gaps in operational procedures. Phase 2 constitutes a more detailed review of the licensing system. More precisely, the terms of reference set out three main tasks for phase 2 of the review. These are: a public consultation process; discussions with Departments, agencies, international organisations, specialised agencies, users of the system and interested parties; and establishing international best practice.</P>
      <P>The review is expected to be completed in December of this year.</P>

      <P>European security and defence policy is the EU policy area of concern to my Department. In this regard, great progress has been achieved by successive EU Presidencies towards developing the EU's capability to carry out Petersberg Task operations such as peacekeeping, humanitarian and peace support operations.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the operational capability of the European Union was demonstrated through the launching of three ESDP operations, the EU Police Mission (EUPM) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Operation CONCORDIA in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Operation ARTEMIS in Bunia, the Democratic Republic of Congo. These operations have made significant contributions to peace and stability in their respective areas of operations.</P>
      <P>Ireland will receive a mandate to progress ESDP from the European Council at the end of the Italian Presidency which will cover the full spectrum of ESDP issues e.g., conflict prevention, the civilian aspects of crisis management and the military aspects of crisis management. While I do not wish to pre-empt this mandate, key priorities for my Department are likely to relate to the ongoing development of military capabilities in the context of ESDP, issues relating to possible future EU Petersberg Task operations, the management of an EU crisis management exercise and the continued development of EU-UN and EU-NATO relations.</P>
      <P>During Ireland's Presidency of the EU, my Department will also be responsible for co-ordinating the ministerial air transport service and any Defence Forces aid to the civil power, where appropriate, in order to provide logistical support.</P>
      <P>With regard to the hosting of the Presidency, the Government intends that the same business-like professional approach which characterised our previous EU Presidencies will again be the hallmark of the forthcoming Presidency.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, remains as set out in my reply to Question No. 174 on 17 June 2003 which stated that Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel as outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland and no change in this regard is contemplated.</P>
      <P>Periodic interest by the private sector has been expressed during the past decade or so in relation to the use of Casement Aerodrome for civil aviation purposes. The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport. Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, however, aerodromes under my authority are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within my remit. Before any consideration could be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel it would be necessary to bring Casement Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993.</P>

      <P>Any strengthening or enhancement of the rules or provisions on ethics in local government is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Local Government Act 2001 has the following provisions. Part 15 of the Act provides a comprehensive new ethics framework for councillors and local government employees. This framework came into operation earlier this year and is based on a system of annual declaration of interests, disclosure of interest when a matter comes before the local authority and a public register of these interests. The interests which have to be declared are set out in Part 15 of the Act and associated regulations and include such matters as shareholdings, directorships, holdings of land or other property, gifts, supplies of property or services, travel facilities, contracts with a local authority and certain other matters.</P>
      <P>This framework will be backed up by statutory codes of conduct &ndash; one for staff and one for councillors. I understand that these codes are currently being prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and drafts should be available later this year.</P>
      <P>Any extension of further provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 to local government is a matter for my colleague.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy's earlier question, the addresses of those landlords to whom the ground rents are paid directly were supplied. The addresses of those landlords where the ground rents are not paid directly to them but to their agent were not available and, accordingly could not be provided at that time. The names and addresses of the said agents are included in the following tables.</P>

      <P>In section 24 of Finance Act 2003 I extended the existing scheme of capital allowances for buildings used as private hospitals to hospitals providing acute services on a day-case basis. To qualify, a day-case hospital must provide a minimum of 40 day-case beds, as well as meeting all the other requirements set out in the existing legislation.</P>
      <P>This is a new initiative and as far as I am aware, there is only one such day hospital planned at present in relation to these provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have on several occasions, both before this House and elsewhere, expressed the Government's concern that the detainees in Guantanamo Bay be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law. The Government's views on this issue are known to the US authorities and have been most recently conveyed to the US Embassy in Dublin last month.</P>
      <P>The general right of a person qualifying for prisoner of war status to be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities is provided for in Article 118 of the (Third) Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. An exception to this right is provided under Chapter 3 of the convention, in a case where the POW has been tried and sentenced by the detaining power for the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity and of crimes not permitted under its law or international law.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously, I am aware that a number of our EU partners, whose citizens have been detained in Guantanamo Bay, are seeking to resolve matters relating to their treatment with the US authorities. For its part, the Government remains of the view that it is important for the US authorities to maintain the highest international standards at all times in respect of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the report of the US arms inspector in Iraq and head of the Iraq survey group to the US Congress which indicates that no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq despite the deployment of a team of 1,200 personnel and a spend of $300 million to date on this search by the US team alone.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report of Dr. David Kay, head of the Iraq survey group, ISG, to which the Deputy refers. Dr. Kay has said that his group have not yet found stocks of weapons, but they are not yet at the point where they can say definitively that such weapon stocks do not exist. He has also said that the ISG has found significant evidence of continuing Iraqi weapons research and development.</P>
      <P>At the time when Security Council Resolution 1441 was adopted, the Security Council was acting in the belief that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction. This belief was very widely shared in the international community. The General Affairs Council of the EU at its meeting of 18 to 19 November 2002 could not have been more clear in stating its belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. This was despite the fact that there was disagreement among many member states about how to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>In his report of 6 March to the Security Council, Dr. Blix, head of UNMOVIC, the arms inspection team mandated to investigate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said that many questions relating to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction remained unanswered. We still do not have answers to these questions.</P>

      <P>Preparations for the EU Presidency are well under way in my Department and will be finalised in December next following the last European Council of the Italian Presidency.</P>
      <P>I have chosen an overall Presidency theme for the education and youth sectors entitled, Building an Inclusive and Competitive Europe. The following priority areas of activity have been identified at this stage.</P>
      <P>There will be two formal Education Councils held in Brussels during Ireland's Presidency in February and May 2004. The main agenda item for the February Council will be the review of the education and training elements of the Lisbon Agenda which seeks to make the EU the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. It is intended that the May Council, which will also deal with youth issues, will focus on the initiation of discussions on the new generation of EU education and youth programmes due to commence in 2007. These will be the successors to the existing Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Youth programmes.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two formal Councils in Brussels, my Department will be holding a wide range of conferences and seminars in Ireland covering issues such as ICTs and digital learning; special needs education; vocational training; and higher education.</P>
      <P>As part of the Presidency programme in Ireland I will host an informal EU ministerial conference on guidance and counselling and a meeting of OECD Ministers for Education. The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, will host an informal EU ministerial conference on youth issues.</P>
      <P>In January next I will also be launching 2004 as the European Year of Education through Sport in conjunction with my colleague Deputy O'Donoghue, Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, and a number of related events are being planned as part of the Presidency programme.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide a physical education hall to a school that does not already have such a facility, commensurate with available resources and competing priorities. When planning new schools or major extensions to existing schools that do not have an existing physical education hall, provision is made in the schedule of overall accommodation for a physical education hall. A school with an enrolment in excess of 450 pupils qualifies for a physical education hall of circa 800 sq. m. inclusive of ancillary accommodation. Schools with an enrolment below 449 and greater than 200 pupils qualify for a physical education hall of circa 600 sq. m. inclusive of ancillary accommodation. The needs of schools with an enrolment below 200 pupils are assessed on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Within the school building section of my Department standard physical education hall templates are being designed. These templates, which will initially be piloted at four locations, will expedite the delivery of physical education halls at schools where existing accommodation at a school is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration at approved colleges. Eligible students are those who are first-time undergraduates, are EU nationals and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved course.</P>
      <P>The third level student support schemes administered by the local authorities and the vocational education committees under the aegis of my Department, offer financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third level courses. Students entering approved courses for the first time are, generally speaking, eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, and nationality. An approved course for the purpose of the schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years' duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one year's duration pursued in an approved institution.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that the diploma in addiction studies is a one year course at undergraduate level and, accordingly, does not qualify for grant aid under the above schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A total of five hours resource teaching support and a full-time special needs assistant was sanctioned for the pupil in question and has been in place since the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>Resource teaching is an additional teaching support for pupils who have been fully integrated into mainstream schools and who satisfy the requirements of departmental circular 08/02 as needing such support. The maximum level of resource teaching allocated under this circular is five hours per week.</P>
      <P>In the light of the views expressed by schools and teachers and their representatives, and taking account of its own reviews, my Department wishes to facilitate the most effective deployment of resources allocated for special educational needs. I am aware, however, that some schools feel restricted as to how they might deploy special needs resources. A departmental circular 24/03 issued recently to clarify the flexibility that schools might employ in this regard.</P>
      <P>The circular points out that, although pupils with SEN may learn at a different pace and in a different way from other pupils, they need to belong to a peer group and to mix with pupils of different abilities in a variety of situations. Research on mixed-ability teaching illustrates that pupils of lower ability benefit greatly and pupils of average or above ability are not academically disadvantaged. However, the practice has developed in recent years of using resource hours for individual tuition only. An exclusive reliance on this approach is contrary to the principle of integration in teaching and learning.</P>
      <P>Wherever possible, schools should provide additional help for pupils in the mainstream classroom or, if necessary, in small groups. Accordingly, my Department would have no objection to schools making flexible use of their approved resource teaching hours for maximum benefit of those pupils clinically assessed as having special educational needs.</P>

      <P>There are some 39 recommendations in the report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences, with costed proposals totalling &euro;244 million extra, of which &euro;66.3 million is a recurring annual cost. Funds are not available at present to progress the strategy on the scale recommended in the report. Of the 39 recommendations, four are not for the education sector. Of the remainder, partial progress has been made on 19 of the recommendations, work has been initiated on a further six, and no progress has been made on the remaining ten at this stage.</P>
      <P>In particular, important progress has been made in regard to: curricular reform and inservice support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology and physics and chemistry, revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003-04 and work under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus (all of these developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers); resourcing, with substantial grants issued to schools at primary level in 1999, 2001 and 2002 at a cost of &euro;10.376 million, an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate, a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment, allied with the recent announcement of a once-off grant scheme, likely to cost of the order of &euro;12 million to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus; ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative, and a new Scope initiative in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education; provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path; reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science, and initial reports on teacher training undertaken; awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges linking with schools; foundation, bridging and progression measures to promote access to third level education; quality assurance initiatives in third level, including the sciences; and the development of a national framework of qualifications by the National Qualifications Authority as an important step in developments to improve access, promote flexible assessment and accreditation processes, and enhance mobility across the further and higher education and training sectors.</P>
      <P>Other than the amounts quoted above, it is not possible to isolate the costs of investment pertaining to the task force report from the overall funds issued for curriculum, inservice training, equipment and non-pay grants to schools. Nevertheless, the investment is substantial. For example, three days inservice was provided for all primary teachers to support the implementation of the primary science programme, supported by a national team of 24 trainers. Some 1700 second level biology teachers, 900 chemistry teachers and 1000 physics teachers received inservice for the leaving certificate revised syllabi, and a national programme is now being implemented for the revised junior certificate science syllabus.</P>
      <P>This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forfás and industry. My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to provide an indicative realistic timeframe for modernising school accommodation across the entire country. This is because the rate of progress of individual building projects depends on a broad range of factors including the speed or otherwise of procuring a suitable site; the complexity and size of each individual project; the time required to undertake and complete architectural planning; the period of time required to comply with the requirements of the various regulatory authorities and the availability of funding. Additionally, available resources are required to address demands for new schools in rapidly developing areas; to provide accommodation for pupils with special needs; to provide for diversity within the educational system as well as tackling the historic under-investment in educational infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate the inherent difficulties in attempting to provide even a rudimentary timeframe in this matter.</P>

      <P>As I have advised the House I will be responsible for a wide range of EU Presidency business across the sectoral policy areas of telecommunications, energy, broadcasting, fisheries, maritime transport and maritime safety. I will have commensurate chairing responsibilities for the Agriculture and Fisheries, Transport, Energy and Telecommunications and Education Youth and Culture Council formations.</P>
      <P>Within the Government's overall strategic approach to the EU and the forthcoming Presidency I am working to deliver on policy priorities at EU level up to and during the Presidency. I welcome, and will continue to encourage, widespread interest across the business community, the sectors and the public at large in Ireland's forthcoming Presidency at a critical time for the EU itself.</P>
      <P>Presidency agendas and priorities across all these sectoral policy areas are being firmed up and will be finalised as part of the overall Irish Presidency programme.</P>
      <P>During the Presidency, my Department and I will host a number of conferences and informal meetings here in Ireland which will discuss and progress key issues in the telecommunications, fisheries, marine research and broadcasting fields.</P>
      <P>I am completing a series of visits to the accession countries and I plan a round of pre-Presidency bilateral meetings with EU partners before year end.</P>

      <Quest> the role he sees forestry playing into the future for the provision of job diversification for farmers and employment potential in rural areas, as a means to soak up carbon thus dealing with the Kyoto Protocol agreement, as a source of new options for product development, and apart from economic and environmental aspects, the future social aspects of the potential of forestry; and if he will make a statement on both the medium and long-term strategies in place to facilitate such developments.</Quest>

      <P>The future role of forestry in the areas of job diversification for farmers, employment in rural areas, product development as well as the social potential of forestry are set out in the strategy for the sector, entitled, Growing for the Future, which was approved by Government and published in 1996. The strategy which covers the period 1996 to 2030 recognises the contribution which forestry, being a rural based activity with little, if any, imported inputs, makes in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The role of forestry as a carbon sink is recognised by Government in Ireland's national climate change strategy, published in 2000. The strategy outlines the significant contributions in terms both of carbon sequestration and biomass that forestry will make in meeting Ireland's requirement under the Kyoto Protocol. COFORD, the forest research agency, has estimated that forestry can account for 16.4% of the required reduction in greenhouse gases under the national climate change strategy.</P>
      <P>The current social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, contains, <i>inter alia,</i> a commitment to review the 1996 forest strategy.</P>
      <P>The House should be aware of the high historic and future cost of forestry, if existing policies are to be maintained. For example, &euro;613 million, or an average of about &euro;88 million per annum, has been spent on forestry since 1997 and, if existing policies were to continue, annual average costs, assuming respectively 10,000 and 20,000 hectares per annum, would be &euro;100 million per annum and &euro;130 million per annum over the next three years. Indeed, by 2020 the annual costs of meeting the sustaining progress targets of 20,000 hectares per annum could be over &euro;210 million per annum.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board that, following further investigation of the fish kill on the River Lee by the board and the Marine Institute, the board is of the opinion that the kill was the result of a combination of increased water temperature, lowered oxygen levels, decreased flow and algal bloom which existed in the weeks prior to the incident. The board informs me that such conditions can cause stress in salmonids resulting in fish diseases and subsequent mortalities.</P>
      <P>I understand that fish samples were sent to the Marine Institute for analysis and identification of any disease agents present. Results of this analysis have identified the most likely cause of death as acute irritation of the gills. There were no signs of any other significant disease processes and the most likely irritant in this case was algae present in the water.</P>
      <P>The South-Western Regional Fisheries Board is satisfied that the reason offered at the time of the fish kill i.e. a combination of high temperature, low water and algal bloom, would appear to remain the significant factors in this incident.</P>

For my own part, I will be chairing the Education, Youth and Culture Council for those items in the cultural and audio-visual spheres which fall under my remit. The specific priorities for this council's work programme are currently being finalised with the Commission.</P>
      <P>My Department will also manage the cultural programme associated with Ireland's Presidency of the EU. Enlargement will be a key focal point for this programme and the celebrations associated with the accession of the ten new member states will be hosted in Ireland around 1 May 2004. While many of the details are still to be worked out at this stage, it appears that relevant events will include: a major event in Dublin, with broadcast links throughout the EU; a broader programme of events to involve the wider population of Dublin; a programme of events, specifically focused on the various accession countries, which will involve arts practitioners and local communities in key locations around the country; Irish artists touring to the accession countries; inviting important artists and exhibitions from the accession countries to Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>I have received quite an amount of correspondence about the impact of the funding decisions the Arts Council, which is autonomous in these matters, found it necessary to take as a consequence of the reduction in Arts Council funding this year both on specific sectors of the arts and on the arts in general.</P>
      <P>The reduction in overall funding available to the Arts Council in 2003 was regrettable, but unavoidable given the national economic context applying, and must be seen against the backdrop of increases in funding of over 80% between 1997 and 2002.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the available funds between sectors, organisations, or individuals is a matter for the Arts Council itself, which although funded by Government, is independent with regard to individual funding decisions.</P>
      <P>As for every year, funding for 2004 will be determined through the annual Estimates process, and in that context I will be putting forward the best possible case for the funding of the arts, including the Arts Council. However, the current Estimates system, based as it is on an annual cycle, cannot give funding commitments more than a year in advance. I accept that this makes it difficult for State supported bodies like the Arts Council to operate on a multi-annual basis, but there is no easy way around this at present.</P>

      <P>The priorities identified for the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers in the area of public health are those matters which will be addressed in the context of the work programme of the Employment, Social Protect, Health and Consumer Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Closely linked to the EU public health programme, 2003 to 2008, cardiovascular heart disease which causes over 1.5 million deaths per annum in the EU will be addressed by the Council in 2004. In particular, attention will be given to the issues of risk factors and optimum behaviours for cardiovascular health.</P>
      <P>The Council will actively seek to progress proposals on tobacco control measures and priority will be given to the ratification of the WHO framework convention on tobacco control and preparation of the protocols to be drawn up under the convention. Protocols are likely on illicit trade, advertising and passive smoking.</P>
      <P>The Council may also address EU participation in the proposed revision of the international health regulations of the WHO.</P>
      <P>The Council looks forward to the establishment of a European centre for disease prevention and control and hopes to advance the proposals for the establishment of the centre in 2005. This would build on the good work already being done by the Community Network on Communicable Diseases which has been co-ordinating the actions of member states up to the present. The Council should also finalise dossiers in the areas of tissues and cells and the pharmaceutical review package. The Council will continue its consideration of the proposed action plan on environment and health.</P>
      <P>Patient mobility issues and other EU health care considerations are under examination in the high level process of reflection. A Commission communication arising from this process is expected in March 2004.</P>
      <P>The EU public health programme has, as priorities, the creation of a public health portal, validation of health websites and improvement in collection and analysis of EU health data/information. The Council will facilitate promotion of e-health in these areas. Agreement on a proposal for amendments to the regulations to facilitate the introduction of the European health insurance card will also be sought.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the European public's interest in seeing action across the maximum range of areas possible so as to improve the levels of public health generally in Europe. I am, personally, fully committed to ensuring the maximum progress possible is made during the Irish Presidency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>The homeless preventative strategy, published in February 2002, stems from Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, which makes a commitment that the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform each will develop and publish strategies to prevent homelessness amongst those leaving institutional care.</P>
      <P>The objective of the strategy from my Department's viewpoint is to provide guidance to health boards to ensure that policies and procedures are in place to reduce the risk of people becoming homeless on leaving institutional care. The strategy focuses on the following three principal groups: people leaving mental health residential facilities; people leaving acute hospitals; young people leaving care (both foster and residential).</P>
      <P>The information set out below is the most recent update received from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in relation to the implementation of the health aspects of the preventative strategy.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA)</i>A protocol for people being discharged from acute and psychiatric hospitals has been developed and is being rolled out throughout the region. In relation to young people leaving care, research has been undertaken with a view to establish a more detailed analysis of aftercare requirements. The Youth Homeless Forum convened by the ERHA, with wide representation from the statutory, voluntary and community sector is overseeing the development of a regional leaving care policy.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mid-Western Health Board</i>New protocols have been developed and agreed in relation to the acute sector, the mental health area and for young people leaving care. All three protocols are expected to be implemented by the end of October 2003.</P>
      <P>
        <i>South-Eastern Health Board</i>Preventative protocols have been agreed and are being implemented in respect of acute hospitals and mental health residential facilities. I have been informed that existing child care policy in this board includes provisions for the prevention of homelessness for those leaving care.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Western Health Board</i>Each of the acute and mental health facilities has its own discharge policy and links have been established with the local authorities. Work is continuing on the development of a regional policy document. The recommendations contained in the strategy are being implemented for young people leaving care.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Southern Health Board</i>Protocols are in place to support the prevention of homelessness amongst those leaving acute care. Protocols in relation to those leaving mental health facilities and young people leaving care are currently being finalised.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Midland Health Board</i>People leaving acute services &ndash; while the board's hospitals have relatively few attendances of homeless people, when they do present to the hospital, a procedure to ensure that key individuals, (such as social workers, community welfare officers and liaison public health nurse), are informed is followed.</P>
      <P>People leaving mental health facilities &ndash; a regional discharge planning framework and policy which provides for all patients, including homeless people is in place. In addition a pre discharge planning checklist is being piloted and will be extended in due course. Post discharge care is planned and appropriate accommodation is sought for individuals prior to discharge.</P>
      <P>Young people leaving care &ndash; aftercare support plans have been developed and are being implemented for all young people leaving care. A written aftercare policy is currently being drafted.</P>
      <P>
        <i>North-Eastern Health Board</i>People leaving acute services &ndash; a comprehensive admission and discharge protocol is in place.</P>
      <P>People leaving mental health facilities &ndash; a formal written discharge policy is in place.</P>
      <P>Young people leaving care &ndash; An aftercare service was established in 2001 with the appointment of three aftercare workers. A written aftercare policy is in place.</P>
      <P>
        <i>North-Western Health Board</i>This information is not readily available in my Department. Therefore I have asked the North-Western Health Board to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.</P>
      <P>In line with the strategy, my Department receives regular updates from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in relation to the implementation of the homeless preventative strategy. My Department reports on progress through the cross-Department team on homelessness, that operates under the aegis of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.</P>
      <P>In relation to the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams throughout the country, two multidisciplinary primary care teams operate in Dublin city. These teams comprise social workers, nurses, community welfare officers, drug outreach workers, a community psychiatric nurse, an occupational therapist and general outreach workers. Their main role is to identify homeless people who are not accessing necessary health services, assess their need and link them into mainstream services.</P>
      <P>An outreach psychiatric team for homeless people is operating in the East Coast Area Health Board since April 2003. Staff have been recruited for a further team to operate in the South-Western Area Health Board and it is expected that this team will be operational from November. These teams will operate on an outreach basis, working across catchment areas and will deal with people with dual diagnosis and behavioural problems.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, a dedicated multidisciplinary team for homeless people operates in the Southern Health Board. This team comprises a sessional psychiatrist, a sessional GP, two mental health nurses, a public health nurse, a general registered nurse, an addiction counsellor, a health promotion officer and four community welfare officers. This team operates in Cork city and south Cork.</P>
      <P>A multidisciplinary team (comprising two community welfare officers, a public health nurse, a community psychiatric nurse, and a psychiatric social worker) operates from the homeless person's centre in Limerick.</P>

      <P>The waiting lists issue has been comprehensively addressed in the health strategy Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. The strategy placed waiting times in focus and outlined the need for immediate action. One of the actions for dealing with the waiting list issue was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund. The NTPF was set up in April 2002 and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June 2002.</P>
      <P>The work of the NTPF is patient-centred with the aim of taking public patients who have waited the longest off waiting lists by providing them with the highest standard and quality of care. The NTPF purchases procedures for public patients predominantly from private hospitals in Ireland. Where it is not possible to treat patients within a reasonable period in Ireland, either in public or private hospitals, health boards are making arrangements under the NTPF to refer public patients for treatment abroad, having regard to quality, availability and cost. However, only a small number of patients have travelled to Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom to have their treatment.</P>
      <P>To date more than 7,200 patients have received treatment under the NTPF. The fund has identified capacity to treat up to 800 patients per month predominantly in Ireland and in four hospitals in the UK. The NTPF will continue to identify capacity to treat those public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment in order to reduce the waiting time for patients. In relation to costings, the fund has not released individual procedure prices on the grounds of commercial sensitivity. However, I understand from the fund that the price paid per procedure compares favourably with the rates charged by private insurers.</P>

      <P>In 2001 I launched the national health strategy Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. The strategy brought together a wide programme of service evaluations and research and set out for the first time ever, detailed objectives for every element of the health system. It quite deliberately set out to get away from short-term thinking and piecemeal policy making to create a long-term over-arching framework with clear goals, objectives and action points that would guide day to day and year to year decision making over the period of implementation.</P>
      <P>The health strategy also recognised the need for significant change in the way in which services are planned, managed and delivered. To further this objective the Government announced the most far reaching health service reform programme in over 30 years on 18 June last. The programme's focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management. The reform programme is about unblocking pathways to successful implementation of the strategy; removing obstacles to the development of primary care; streamlining the policy and service delivery functions; removing gaps and overlaps in the system and ensuring that the system is delivering everything it should given the level of investment being made.</P>
      <P>My Department monitors implementation of the strategy on an ongoing basis and I am happy to report that to date work has commenced on over 75% of the strategy actions. The reform programme is further evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to the implementation of the national health strategy in the long-term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</P>
      <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding thirteen dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus there is an aggregate of 19 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic Initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</P>
      <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently severely restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. The number of children who do not come within health board guidelines is not available. However, the broad range of measures that I have outlined, is already impacting and will continue to impact positively on the availability of trained clinical staff in this area.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me that at the end of the June quarter 2003, there were 20,650 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are over twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated and over 3,000 extra children are getting treatment from health boards since the end of 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the Roads Regulation 1994 (SI 119 of 1994) any mechanically propelled vehicle or combination of vehicles (other than an invalid carriage) which &ndash; (a) is driven by a person holding a driving licence referred to in section 22(1) of the Act of 1961 authorising that person to drive the vehicle, and (b) is so constructed that its entire weight is transmitted to the road surface by wheels which are equipped with pneumatic tyres and (c) exceeds 50 cu.cm. in cylinder capacity, where it is propelled by an internal combustion engine, and (d) whether propelled by an internal combustion engine or by any other means of propulsion is so constructed and in such a condition and so loaded as to be capable of maintaining a speed of 50 km. per hour on the level, solely under its own power, may use a motorway.</P>
      <P>It would seen that the scooter referred to by the Deputy would not come within the foregoing and so would not be entitled to use a motorway.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to licensing is that under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 a driving licence is required to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place. Such a vehicle is defined in the Road Traffic Act 1961 as &ldquo;a vehicle intended or adapted for propulsion by mechanical means, including &ndash; (a) a bicycle or tricycle with an attachment for propelling it by mechanical power, whether or not the attachment is being used, a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical or partly electrical and partly mechanical, but not including a tramcar or other vehicle running on permanent rails&rdquo;.</P>

The issues which are discussed in the report include the question of extending the current range of speed limits to provide for the application of a speed limit of 30 km per hour in association with appropriate traffic calming measures in residential areas and a new speed limit structure that would take particular cognisance of national and non-national road classification.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that in accordance with the Explosives Act 1875, my Department has responsibility for the importation, transportation and storage of explosives including fireworks. Consequently in order to import fireworks an importation licence granted by my Department is required. It is a long standing policy that these importation licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by professional and experienced operators. Prior to the granting of an importation licence, my Department consults with the relevant local authority and the Garda Síochána to establish if there are any objections to the granting of a licence. Indeed, the relevant local authority and the Garda Síochána are empowered by statute to prevent any organised display from proceeding if, in the opinion of either authority, it is not safe to do so. Importation licences are not granted to import fireworks for sale.</P>

      <P>There was a general discussion at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 2 and 3 October 2003 on the introduction of biometric data on immigration documentation, in particular visas and residence permits. This is an important development in the fight against illegal immigration and the abuse of immigration systems by persons seeking to enter the European Union for criminal or terrorist purposes. On 24 September 2003, the European Commission adopted two proposals for Council regulations amending existing Council regulations laying down a uniform format for visas (Regulation (EC)1683/95) and a uniform format for residence permits for third &ndash; country nationals (Regulation (EC) 1030/2002). I am currently examining these proposed regulations and I will be bringing proposals to Government in the near future with regard to them.</P>
      <P>These proposals are made under articles 62(2)(<i>b</i>)(iii) and 63(3)(<i>a</i>) of the treaty establishing the European Community which are part of Title IV of the treaty. If it is proposed that Ireland should exercise its option under the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam to participate in these proposals, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be required.</P>

I am assured by the Garda authorities that these security provisions are adequate for the specific purpose of the card.</P>
      <P>The identity requirements of commercial bodies, such as airlines, are contractual issues between these bodies and their customers.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The costs of imprisonment to which the Deputy refers are based on different cost factors across the prison system. However, the main cost element involved is the cost of staffing a prison. In a prison such as Portlaoise, where an exceptionally high cost per prisoner exists, staff costs reflect the intensive security requirements involved.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I regard the level of costs arising as unsustainable and I am actively pursuing the application of more efficient staffing arrangements, particularly those which involve reducing overtime. In this regard, I refer the Deputy to my recent reply to Parliamentary Question No. 49 of 19 June last concerning my proposals for the ending of overtime by prison officers and the position regarding negotiations with The Prison Officers' Association. A proposal for change currently with the staff side for ballot involves organisational change and revised working and attendance arrangements for staff. It is aimed at replacing overtime costs by adopting a more efficient annual hours attendance system.</P>
      <P>The current overtime costs in the Prison Service are running at an estimated &euro;63 to &euro;64 million per annum, which constitutes a major element of the costs of imprisonment. The Prison Service proposal to eliminate overtime holds out the prospect of substantial savings annually and consequently the costs of imprisonment would be likewise substantially reduced.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to addressing the problem of Prison Service costs and I am keen to secure staff agreement for the measures necessary to reduce those costs. In the event that agreement is not forthcoming, I will have no option but to introduce a range of short and long-term measures to reduce Prison Service expenditure. While I am hopeful that agreement can still be reached, my officials have recently informed staff representatives that plans will be refined and action will follow if, by the end of this month, an agreed way forward is not in prospect.</P>

Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, which repealed the 1963 Act, planning authorities are required to prepare a development plan every six years, and to send notice and a copy of the draft development plan to my Department.</P>
      <P>Since Part 2 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 came into operation on 1 January 2001, copies of 43 draft development plans have been submitted to my Department. Observations in relation to 27 of those plans have issued to the relevant planning authorities. Among the issues covered in the observations were the following: consistency with the national spatial strategy, housing strategies, retail strategies, archaeological heritage, architectural heritage, nature conservation, rural settlement, landscape appraisal, amenities, environmental impact, zoning, and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have details of the dates on which all of these plans were subsequently adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Electoral law and the practical arrangements for the holding of elections are under ongoing review in my Department. As part of that review an examination of the feasibility of introducing electronic voting and counting began in November 1998. It concluded that the introduction of such a system was feasible. A statutory basis for electronic voting was provided by the Oireachtas in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
      <P>Following an international tender competition, a Dutch/UK company, Nedap/Powervote, were appointed to deliver an electronic solution to the manual voting and counting system. The system was successfully used in three constituencies at the last general election and in seven constituencies at the Nice II referendum.</P>
      <P>In addition to Nedap/Powervote, a number of companies have been engaged to test the system hardware and software including PTB, the National Institute for Science and Technology in Germany; TNO Electronic Products and Services BV and KEMA Quality BV, the Netherlands; Electoral Reform Services, UK and Zerflow Information Security, PMI Software Limited and Nathean Technologies in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Carr Communications were appointed, following a tender competition, to assist in the educational and publicity campaign for the introduction of the system in 2002 and the MRBI carried out an exit poll to ascertain the electorate's views on it. The poll found that 87% of those polled preferred the use of the voting machine to the paper ballot. An Irish company Loredo has been awarded a contract to supply large trolleys for the transport and storage of the voting machines. Tender competitions are in progress for the supply of small hand trolleys, tables for the voting machines which will assist wheelchair electors in the use of the voting machine and for a company to undertake an extensive educational and publicity campaign before the use of the system on a nationwide basis at the European and local elections in June 2004.</P>
      <P>The rationale behind the introduction of electronic voting and counting is to advance the modernisation and efficient operation of the electoral system. Experience to date has confirmed the advantages of the new system. The evidence so far is that the electorate finds electronic voting easier than manual voting. The system simplifies the work of returning officers and their staff; it eliminates spoilt votes and it produces more accurate poll results. The problem of hanging chads which was seen in the last US presidential election is associated with punch card voting machines and not the system of direct vote recording and counting adopted for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The verification of votes cast is also maintained under the new voting system. When using the voting machine the voter will see their preferences beside the candidates' photographs. In addition, the details of each preference will be separately shown on a voting machine display screen. Before pressing the cast vote button a voter can amend, in secret, the preferences recorded on their ballot. Finally, the system software will enable the printing of a ballot paper for each vote cast, without attribution to the voter, where a court order to this effect is obtained at an election petition. Electronic voting takes place in a number of countries such as in the Netherlands, in some large cities in Germany, in parts of the USA, India and Brazil.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the new electronic voting system will enhance the integrity, security and efficiency of the Irish electoral process. Preparations for its use countrywide at the 2004 European and local elections are at an advanced stage. The estimated cost is &euro;36 million plus VAT. Precise costings will not be available until near polling day when the uptake and demand by returning officers for ancillary equipment such as the trolleys and special tables is known.</P>

      <P>The priorities which my Department has proposed in respect of Ireland's Presidency of the EU are as follows: islands &ndash; conference in Galway on 19-21 May 2004; rural development &ndash; conference in Mayo on 30 and 31 May and 1 June 2004; and drugs strategy &ndash; meeting of national drugs strategy co-ordinators in Dublin on 15 and 16 June 2004.</P>
      <P>All three events would be high level meetings at official level. They have been included in the calendar of such meetings for the forthcoming Irish Presidency which was deposited recently in the Oireachtas Library by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I plan to open the two conferences and the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Noel Ahern, may open the national co-ordinators meeting.</P>
      <P>The timing of the events for May and June 2004 means that they will take place after the formal enlargement of the EU on 1 May 2004. In addition to their overall objective of making a contribution to furthering strategic consideration by the EU in three important policy areas, they should provide occasions on which to celebrate and welcome ten new members to the European family.</P>
      <P>The proposed priorities reflect my Department's remit. It does not cover lead responsibility for areas where decisions are taken at EU level. For example, drawing up priorities for a council agenda or an informal ministerial meeting would not arise.</P>

      <P>With effect from 1 January the conditions for entitlement to the allowance were revised. From that date the it does not apply to certain full-time postgraduate courses. It was considered that the scheme needed to be refocused towards people who most need additional training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. People with a primary degree are already in possession of a third level qualification and their academic qualifications should impact positively on their employment prospects. Those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or a graduate diploma in primary school teaching were not affected by these changes.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was a participant in the scheme from September 1999 to May 2003 while pursuing a four year primary degree. In September 2003 he applied for further participation in the scheme in order to pursue a postgraduate qualification. The course he now intends to pursue is outside its scope. Therefore, this application was disallowed on the grounds that the person has already achieved a high level of academic attainment while participating in the scheme, which has already greatly enhanced his prospects of securing employment.</P>
      <P>In a time of financial constraint I must ensure that supports are directed at those with the most pressing needs. Limited resources must continue to be aimed at those in most need and who are most distant from the labour market.</P>

      <P>My overall focus for the Irish Presidency will be to advance the EU social policy agenda generally and, in particular, make progress in delivering on the Lisbon agenda.</P>
      <P>One of the goals of the Lisbon agenda is to achieve greater social cohesion. At present the second round reports on national action plans for social inclusion are being evaluated. This process will lead to the second joint inclusion report for approval by the Council of Ministers and for presentation to the European Council at its spring meeting during the Irish Presidency. Ireland will also be hosting a conference of people experiencing poverty. Its aim will be to further develop ways of promoting participation by and consultation with people experiencing poverty in the context of developing policies in this area.</P>
      <P>Making work pay or addressing the financial incentives to encourage people to seek, take up, and remain in work is one of the key policy areas that will be addressed as part of our contribution to modernising social protection systems. This issue has been chosen as the main theme for discussion at the informal Council of Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs meeting in January.</P>
      <P>The issue of migration will be another priority for my Department during the Irish Presidency. In April we will host a conference using the theme, &ldquo;Reconciling mobility and social inclusion&rdquo;. Its main focus will be on the role of social and economic policies in achieving social inclusion for migrants.</P>
      <P>A major priority will be to campaign for the adoption, by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, of the proposals to simplify and modernise the EU regulations on social security of migrant workers. They will provide migrant workers moving within the EU with a more streamlined set of rules aimed at protecting their social security and healthcare rights. Following the accession of the ten new member states in May, we intend to host a special conference, in co-operation with the Hungarian Government, on the practical application of the new regulations for all member states.</P>
      <P>Family policy is another priority for the Irish Presidency. To mark the 10th anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family, we will host a major international conference entitled Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the interest being raised in regard to the Irish Presidency in general, particularly social policy issues. I look forward to progressing this agenda actively during our Presidency.</P>

      <P>The BTEA is a second chance education scheme designed to assist unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups who are being held back in their search for employment by a lack of qualifications.</P>
      <P>Last year a review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out. In the light of this and of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme was revised.</P>
      <P>In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme I was conscious of the need to ensure that payments were focused on those who most need training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. In line with this payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued for BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment. This was done because many students traditionally find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months.</P>
      <P>Of course participants in the scheme who failed to find employment during the summer were entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>All other participants on the scheme, lone parents and people with disabilities, remain unaffected by this decision and retained payment during the summer period.</P>
      <P>The BTEA scheme was also revised in respect of people who wish to pursue certain full-time postgraduate courses. These now no longer qualify for BTEA. All of the people concerned are already in possession of a third level qualification. I am satisfied that they already have achieved a good level of academic attainment. This should impact positively on their employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint I want to ensure that supports are directed at those with the most  pressing needs. Those wishing to take up a higherdiploma in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching were not affected by these changes.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the new arrangements will ensure that the BTEA scheme continues to provide support to those people who are the most distant from the labour market. I have no plans to alter these arrangements.</P>
