      <P>As the Taoiseach is going to London this morning to meet the British Prime Minister and will not be here for the Order of Business today or in the House tomorrow, perhaps I could be given the liberty to express the hope that his discussions with the Prime Minister and the parties are successful and will bear fruit. On a personal basis I wish him all the best for the festive season and hope he is prepared for the enormous challenge of the Presidency on 1 January.</P>
      <P>Taking into account that recent events have taught us that the victims of terrorism and their families must come first on issues such as the atrocity of the Omagh bomb, which left 31 innocent people dead, and that those elected to this House are in a privileged position to use authority legitimately to help people, the Taoiseach will appreciate that on a number of occasions during the past six weeks, he gave an indication to the House, endorsed by the Tánaiste last Thursday, that the Nally report would be published in some form or other. Having been given a copy of the report by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for which I am grateful, and having read it, there are elements of it that should not be let into the public domain. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said an edited version would be meaningless. In that case, and as it is the season of goodwill, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that he and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will sit down with the families of the victims of the Omagh bomb and explain to them the elements of the Nally report they can explain to them and, at least, give them that comfort and a sense of interest in understanding the depth of grief these families still experience? In the event that the commitment given is not being honoured in terms of publication of the report in edited form, will the Taoiseach give that undertaking now in the season of goodwill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for his <Col N="770" />remarks and wish him and his colleagues season's greetings.</P>
      <P>I did say previously that we would try to publish the report in some form. As the House is aware there was a considerable legal examination of the report to see precisely how we could deal with the matter. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a statement last night in so far as he could go. He stated that due to legal constraints and on national security grounds he could only go so far in his statement. Deputy Kenny has asked that we give as much information as we can to the relatives committee, which the Minister met previously. I will discuss that with the Minister to see how best we can do it.</P>
      <P>As regards all of these reports, personally I would rather give everything but that is not possible, and it is totally impossible in this case. I will discuss the matter with the Minister. One way or another we will have contact again with the relatives but we need to work out legally what we can give them. Certainly we will do that. However, there are large parts of the report we cannot give and that has been very clear to me. That was the reason for the delay in implementing the report, not that they would see any details that would assist them in any way, but just on grounds of national security. I will look seriously at the Deputy's suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that. I hope it will be possible for him to give the relatives information that does not breach national security, for their own comfort so they may get at the truth. My understanding is that the Northern Ireland ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, was given an undertaking that the group would go back to her before the report was finished, as it was on the basis of her information, intelligence and evidence given to the Government that the Nally report was commissioned in the first instance. Will the Taoiseach confirm whether or not that undertaking was given and, if so, why it was not honoured?</P>
      <P>There are two central issues in the Nally report that do not leave it as a fully finished document. The person central to the entire report, known as the informant, was not questioned and when questions were submitted to him, through his legal adviser, they were not answered. There is also a divergence of opinion on the intelligence level and information available to the PSNI and the Garda Síochána in respect of certain aspects of the Omagh bombing. In order to move this forward, does the Taoiseach consider the group should re-examine these two issues or, as they are not professional investigators, could consideration be given to bringing in a professional investigator of international repute to examine those two issues? This could possibly be done in advance of the matter being discussed further here in the new session, when there will be more complete statements and an opportunity for questions and answers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer the first matter. The second matter should be left to the debate in the House. The Deputy has correctly given the answer to the second part of his question. The individual concerned has, on legal advice, not co-operated with the group. We will leave that until the Minister deals with it in the new year.</P>
      <P>The members of the group have confirmed that no undertaking was given to Mrs. Nuala O'Loan, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, that she would be contacted again about the report. In fact, the group made it clear to the ombudsman that its function was to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and nothing else. No undertaking was given in any form to return to the ombudsman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I offered the Taoiseach my good wishes for the success of the Irish Presidency and I repeat that now.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the explosion in the cost of consultants employed by Government, as revealed in the figures recently secured by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore? These show the almost casual incidence of resort to consultants by Government, rising to a cost of more than &euro;100 million in the years 2000-02. That is without including the three big Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children and Transport. This &euro;100 million is taxpayers' money. It works out at more than &euro;100,000 per day for the employment of consultants and shows an exponential rise over the years. The cost was &euro;22 million in 2000 and almost twice that, &euro;42 million, in 2002. This exponential pattern of increase is evident in most Departments. For example, the cost in the Department of Social and Family Affairs was &euro;22 million, in a Department which seeks to pare &euro;58 million off services to the weakest sections in our society.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied there is not an overly cavalier resort to the use of consultants and that this is not seen as a honey pot where application for contracts is not impeded by close affiliation to Fianna Fáil, as we have seen in a number of instances? Four years ago the Comptroller and Auditor General did a value for money audit of the resort to consultancies by Government, and expressed a number of concerns about the guidelines which ought to apply, not just to the tendering process and recruitment, but to the matters on which consultants are brought into various Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asks if I agree that the figure for the last number of years is quite high. The figure is high and it has grown, like most areas of public expenditure. The Deputy asked if this was necessary in all cases. Without examining every case, there has been increasing recourse in the public service in the past ten or 15 years to seek outside advice on policy decisions and to have some expert examination undertaken by international consultants and <Col N="772" />domestic firms. The record of who has received this money is available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the Department of Social and Family Affairs. This was spent on the service delivery model for the information technology programme to improve the ability of the Department to pay individuals. In many other Departments consultants have been concerned with information technology. In other cases consultancies have been used as part of the modernisation agenda and are partly concerned with human resources. Ecological and environmental reports are made in cases of infrastructure. An aviation report on Dublin Airport was done by international aviation consultants. Many of these are costly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not. Many of these reports are necessary. They are made by considered professional experts who give their assessments before the Government makes decisions which involve expenditure of several billions. That is a recurring figure. The analyses in many reports lead on to expenditure of billions of euro in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore has given me a letter which the Minister for Transport kindly sent to him because his is one of the Departments not included in the figures. It shows that the number of different consultancies in his Department increased from 48 in 2000 to 136 in 2002. The Taoiseach appears to be saying that this is concerned with expenditure of hundreds of millions of euro. That is true, but have we built more roads more quickly and more cheaply? Has Luas come in earlier and on cost as a result of these consultants? One would need to reflect on the use <Col N="773" />of 136 consultants in the Department of Transport.</P>
      <P>I would have thought the Government is particularly well armed with public relations consultants. They crowd around every Minister, yet we see PR consultancies brought in. There is no difficulty in doing that yet we make cuts in social welfare. Is the Taoiseach saying the expertise is no longer retained in the Civil Service to do some of the work that would have been regarded as normal routine work in the past? People would be shocked to learn that, apart from the three big Departments, &euro;100 million has been spent on consultants, or more than &euro;100,000 per day.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator O'Rourke was Minister she commissioned a large number of consultants' reports on rail safety. In this House I always pointed out that I was happy to put money into rail safety and we used professional outside consultants. We do not have experts on rail safety in the public service, nor do we have them on ecological or archaeological services.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have expertise on international aviation, rail safety and other matters. Some people think people are overpaid in the public service. We do not have international experts who receive millions of euro who are capable of doing this work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked if we are wasting money and if consultancy is growing too much. We should not use outside consultants if they are not necessary. We rarely use public relations consultants. A small number of the contracts are in that area. Most reports are technical and are made by technical experts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Christmas is approaching and irrespective of religious belief, most Irish people see it as a time for flaithiúlacht, generosity of spirit, and inaction. A group of people urgently need a generous response from the State. They are immigrant parents of children born here who had lawfully applied for residency in Ireland before February 2003, when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform changed the rules and stopped processing all applications not already determined, leaving thousands of people in a twilight zone. Some of these people were applicants for asylum but when they had children here they were advised, including by those in official positions, to withdraw their applications on the basis that they would get residency as parents of Irish citizens. Those who took the advice are in a precarious and exposed position.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, most cannot afford adequate legal representation to advance their case since, unfortunately, they are forbidden to work. It means that children of two, three and four years of age who are Irish citizens, attending school and speaking with Irish accents have parents who are in fear and dread of receiving letters ordering them to leave the country. In some cases they face being forcibly wrenched from communities where many have well integrated and being sent out of the country. It is taking a heavy mental and emotional toll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is aware of this because he has visited immigrant support centres and been photographed with the children. As we approach the Christmas season, with one million of our own people settled in Britain, hundreds of thousands in other countries and tens of millions overseas whose parents came from this country, will the Government give a generous response and grant those few thousand people the right of residency here? This would give them the right to <Col N="775" />make a contribution to society, which they want to make, and to find the same security and future here that millions of our people found around the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Given our historical position, we in this country have been very generous in dealing with the influx of immigrants and asylum seekers over recent years, and we continue to be so. I do not need to give the Deputy a litany of all the areas, resources and staff involved. The largest influx of staff into any area of the public service was the 150 additional staff recruited mainly this year to deal with the follow-up to the case to which the Deputy referred, the Supreme Court judgment on the residency and status of Irish born children. The relevant section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was established to deal with the cases to which the Deputy referred, which have arisen because of the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
      <P>Legislation has been enacted to address this issue and the Deputy knows that every effort is being made to deal with the outstanding cases. No new legal changes are necessary to deal with them. In so far as this is the Christmas period, the services provided by the State to those who have come here in recent years have been outstandingly more friendly and accommodating than those in almost any other country in Europe. We will continue to operate on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, if I may use the Christmas analogy, the child born in the Irish stable is a citizen but the oxen have more security of tenure than the parents. That is the reality. I met 15 people last week, mainly women in their 20s and some young men, parents of young children who are in this twilight zone. Dealing with the human questions that arise in this area does not call for more staff but a simple change of policy in respect of this cohort of people. It is in the Taoiseach's hands to ensure that happens.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Against the Deportation of Irish Children has been established to deal with this problem and it is supported by groups such as Amnesty International, Residents against Racism, the National Women's Council, the Children's Rights Alliance and others. Will the Government change its policy on families of Irish citizen children who had made applications prior to February? Will it also provide the adequate legal assistance to help them make their applications, especially those who are facing deportation orders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows it is not such a simple matter. He picked one aspect of it with which I have some sympathy, where the children are in this country. He also knows that there are many cases where the child has been born in Ireland and the parents have left immediately afterwards. It is a regular occurrence that people come here from various parts of the world to have their children and then return to their own countries. They come here merely to use the maternity services and to get citizenship. I accept the Deputy is aware of the distinctions that can be made in this area, but it is not a simple matter to decide on a loose policy that would enable anybody to use such services. I accept the Deputy's definition of the cohort and in any policy changes all of these issues will be considered but the system cannot be changed in a loose, unregulated way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the November meeting of the cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships, the Central Statistics Office gave an informative presentation on the principal demographic, spatial and infrastructure-related findings from the Census of Population 2002. Covering such themes as household formation, housing characteristics, transport modes and journey times, the presentation brought into sharp focus the pace and scale of change that has occurred in Ireland, especially since 1996. I have <Col N="777" />asked the Central Statistics Office to give a similar presentation on the societal findings from the census to the senior officials group on social inclusion. The necessary arrangements are being put in place at present.</P>
    <P>The other agenda item of the November meeting of the cross-departmental team was energy. A key aim in this complex area is to ensure that all relevant issues in the competitiveness, environmental and security of supply areas will be factored into the development of long-range policy. An important step in that regard will be the upcoming publication by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources of a public consultation document on energy policy. I understand the consultation document will be published in early 2004.</P>
    <P>The eleventh and most recent meeting this year of the cross-departmental team took place last Wednesday. The main items on the agenda were the national spatial strategy and Gaeltacht and islands infrastructure. As Deputies are aware, it is just over a year since the national spatial strategy was launched and good progress has been made in advancing its aims. In particular, the introduction of five-year multi-annual financial envelopes for capital programmes will be crucial to future investment supporting the strategy over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The presentation on Gaeltacht and islands infrastructure to the cross-departmental team provided a helpful summary of the progress made so far under the national development plan, as well as an overview of plans to the end of 2006. The next meeting will be held on 14 January 2004.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Does he agree there are major problems associated with the public private partnership concept as it currently operates? Is he aware of a study carried out among IBEC members which indicated that approximately 94% considered that progress through the PPP system was either poor or very poor? That highlights a range of problems. In that context, very little else was achieved apart from a few major road proposals, unlike in Britain where the PFI system generated £20 billion in private investment.</P>
      <P>Has the interdepartmental committee and his cross-departmental team on infrastructure discussed the question raised by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech whereby he proposes to end the system of employing consultants on major contracts, a matter referred to earlier by Deputy Rabbitte? How is that to be done? In respect of the announcement made by the Minister in the past two days, how much private money will go into the new Cork road development and how will that be repaid in tolls? Has the infrastructure committee dealt with that sort of issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Brennan, has already informed the Taoiseach of the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the short answer rather than the long one. In the next five years, approximately &euro;8 billion will be spent on roads, &euro;2 billion of which will be in the form of PPPs.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the general point concerning PPPs raised by the Deputy. When the PPP process was launched and when we launched a national development plan in 1999, there was a general perception in the financial sector that as soon as we gave them the projects, they would provide the resources. I never believed that, but that was what those in the private sector were saying. In so far as those in the private sector came into the process at all &ndash; their level of participation was not that high, unlike the position prevailing in some other countries &ndash; their proposals were to the effect that if taxpayers took all the risk, if they were guaranteed the contracts and if they received good extensions on a number of basic points for borrowing, they would be interested in considering a cherry picked list of projects. That was amazingly helpful and, needless to say, the Department of Finance was not too enthusiastic about that. If one looks back over that four-year period, one will note that not many companies here were genuinely interested in PPPs on the basis that they work elsewhere. That is a fact. Three or four major companies based on the Continent &ndash; whose representatives I am sure the Deputy would have met &ndash; which are in this business, employ Irish staff and engage Irish consultants, would say that people here are not prepared to carry the kind of risk level people have to carry elsewhere. It is regrettable that people here are not prepared to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other side of the question is that the Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency have a belief, and it is a correct one, that the State can fund a project more cheaply. The idea of mortgaging out a project over a period does not represent good value to the taxpayer and we are better off managing it by way of statutory borrowing. That is the reason the process has not moved forward here. There are times when Ministers would like to do more in this area, but the deals available elsewhere are <Col N="779" />not as available here. We went to check the Portuguese position and I spoke here at length about what happened in Spain and in other places. There are considerable resources in the five-year envelopes published with the budget for PPPs. The Department of Finance has laid down the rules. I do not know if it has published those new rules but they will be published in a multiannual review.</P>
    <P>On the Deputy's general question regarding the Minister, Deputy Brennan, he has tightened up the rules considerably in that contractors have to complete projects on time and in accordance with the terms of the contract. They have to submit fixed priced contracts, which hopefully should eliminate all the overruns and other issues that arose in the past. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, brought in that measure recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That aspect of the Taoiseach's reply is critical. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, is to be commended on bringing in a system of fixed priced contacts because many of them were grossly over-inflated once people got on the tender ladder.</P>
      <P>In respect of PPPs as they currently operate, is there still a difficulty with the business of EUROSTAT, which has been put forward as an obstacle to the Government getting further projects up and running under the PPP system? The Department of Finance seemed to indicate this was a problem in respect of, for example, the Cork School of Music. Is the infrastructural committee attempting to create a greater understanding between the public and private sectors of the potential that exists in PPPs to bring about further major infrastructural projects over the next ten, 15 or 20 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making progress on both those questions. This country challenged EUROSTAT's understanding of the rules. That effectively meant that if one was going to carry out a project now, the full cost of it would be put on one's balance sheet for this year, even though the work would be spread over a number of years. That made it a hopeless exercise to try to spread contracts over a period. A new examination of this process was done, in which the CSO fully participated. New guidelines on this will be issued in the new year. We have not seen them yet, but we are more hopeful that the view and case we put forward is a more realistic and simple one. Currently, there are too many interpretations, guidelines and indents on the existing rules that are used. What happens in almost any case is that the case goes to arbitration and those concerned seem to change things around. It might be unfair to say that but that is how the position is perceived. I understand the report on this matter will be clear and that it will be far easier to see what is in, what is out and how it will be managed from an accountancy perspective. That should be available in early 2004, perhaps in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" />On the Deputy's second question, a number of seminars on the PPP process have been held and I thank those who were involved. In respect of work that has commenced on some of the large PPP contracts such as the Dundalk western bypass, the Kilcock-Kinnegad bypass and the Waterford bypass, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, advises me that work on most of those projects is ahead of schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach a happy Christmas, as I am not sure he will be around after these questions. I wish him well in his talks with the British Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>There are many issues to discuss. It is interesting to note that the Comptroller and Auditor General found in a case study of the Cork School of Music that a PPP would involve a total cost of &euro;200 million, yet the original figure proposed for the project was &euro;12 million. There seems to be a need to compare straightforwardly the prices a PPP would involve compared to capital funding from public funds. Does the Taoiseach agree that the Construction Industry Federation has a point when it stated that PPPs are largely being used to boost funding to give the impression that there is considerable public funding when that may not be the case?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach talked about the risk being shared between the private and public sectors, can he give an example of where the private sector did not do well from a PPP? That would be useful to know. We regularly hear of risks, yet we see National Toll Roads doing quite well, along with Jarvis, Oxigen and Indaver. Companies are lining up for PPP contracts. They are obviously not doing so for the good of their health or for charitable reasons. Is the risk factor overplayed? In the final analysis there does not seem to be a great deal of risk.</P>
      <P>The metro may provide an example. Is the metro to go ahead by means of a public private partnership? The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, may be able to whisper in the Taoiseach's ear the answer to that question. I understand that the Department of Finance has reservations on the metro funding mechanisms planned by the Department of Transport. Is the metro an area where we may see some final progress by means of a PPP if progress is not to be made in any other way?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As with the point I made about Deputy Kenny's question, those details are more specifically a matter for the Minister responsible rather than for the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into detail about the metro, but an RPA report to the Minister for Transport is due shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the points made by Deputy Sargent on the PPPs are factual. There is a limit to the capacity of the private sector to take up PPPs. Currently, over 80% of infrastructure is paid for by the taxpayer. One has to derive an income <Col N="781" />from the private sector element of it, so one can not toll every road in the country, nor has the Government any intention of doing so. There must be an income stream from any PPP project. With projects such as the large Dublin Bay sewerage project, for example, suitable PPP contracts can be established. Some contracts have been quite ingeniously negotiated in order to move ahead on large infrastructural projects that otherwise would not be possible perhaps for a number of years. There is a price and a cost. No one will invest in a project where there is no return.</P>
    <P>Initially, a number of international English-based companies sought PPP involvement. As I said in response to Deputy Kenny, some of them have gone away because of the lack of private sector involvement. Some of them remain. We attempted some PPP projects in the educational system. They worked well and fast, but a cost was involved. To invoke the Cork School of Music in this regard is not comparing like with like and I will not discuss that. The project initially costed at &euro;10 million is not the project that was finally envisaged. There is no doubt that there was a huge escalation of costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There is no doubt that an infrastructural deficit existed and still exists in this country. Ireland is not Austria or Germany, countries which have had infrastructural programmes for 50 or 60 years. We have however brought spending in the area to about 5% of GDP, which is providing a much higher level of infrastructure for the economy than in any other country, almost twice the European average. There are currently some 46 major contracts in operation. We have had substantial railroad investment. The Luas project continues. We have airport extensions. Work continues in many other areas of infrastructure, including water and sewerage. One of the biggest sewerage programmes in Europe is taking place in this country.</P>
      <P>Maintaining this level of investment is part of the multi-annual programme, and if we can continue in this manner we will catch up in a relatively short time. There is much work to be done. Maintaining this investment level provides the best value for the taxpayer. Let us by all means use PPPs, but also keep the Exchequer funding element at 5%. That is part of the Government plan. We have worked hard over the last six or seven years to bring the figure to that level and we have sustained it even in the more difficult economic climate of the last three years. The figure this year is &euro;6 billion, a very high resource level. The cash figure is not as relevant as the GDP percentage level. If we can keep it at current levels we can deal with our infrastructural deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that in the case of the Cork School of Music, one is <Col N="782" />not comparing like with like. What began as a refurbishment programme budgeted at &euro;14 million is one thing, while to build a school of music is another. There is, however, a lesson to be learned from a simple project to provide a building for a school of music in Cork that according to the Comptroller and Auditor General will now, by means of a PPP, cost &euro;200 million over 25 years. Part of this involves the cost of raising money. PPPs come in at around 14% in commercial banks whereas the State can raise money at between 3% and 5% through the National Treasury Management Agency. The issue is efficiency, but is that not a huge premium? Managed and delivered under a PPP, a project is carried out more efficiently than the examples we have seen, without instancing any of them. The premium is very substantial. Are the appropriate State agencies any closer to devising a template that might be applied in this area? Are some 40 projects awaiting the go-ahead?</P>
      <P>In respect of a contemplated PPP project in the Department of Health, which would assist in the provision of step-down beds, how is it that nursing home owners in Dublin complain of over-supply arising from the tax breaks introduced, while at the same time the price of having one's relative accommodated in such private nursing homes is not falling? The Taoiseach sometimes visits such homes and talks to the people involved. If there is an over-supply of nursing homes, why are prices not falling? Why are we contemplating a PPP to supply more step-down beds? More step-down beds are needed, but why are private nursing home charges not falling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Cork School of Music or any other such projects, the basic argument of the Department of Finance and the NTMA is that the cheapest way of borrowing money is through the State. The State cannot be beaten in this regard. Where there are infrastructural deficits in this or any other country, using PPPs brings in outside finance. In this country, in Portugal, Britain and elsewhere, when one gets the private sector consortium to design, build and manage, everything is done more quickly, though it is a pity to have to say so. In the case of roads, incidentally, such management has been taking place for 30 years in Ireland. The management of PPP projects is also more effective, though to say that is not to criticise other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One will never borrow money cheaper than through the State, but in opting for PPPs there are advantages other than financial ones. The State's resources are limited each year, so PPPs have their attractions, and when an income stream such as a road toll can be generated, they can work well. There are income streams for Dublin Corporation from the Dublin Bay sewerage project and from others. PPPs however have a limited role. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has made that point in the House many times regarding infrastructural pro<Col N="783" />jects. One cannot provide for every project by means of PPPs.</P>
    <P>We have a fairly conservative view on this matter in Ireland, although companies would argue with the Government that our template is quite strictly controlled. The NTMA is involved through the National Development Agency and advises the Department of Finance. When projects are proposed, the Government approaches the NTMA and considers how best to finance them. By and large, though not always, the cheapest and best way, the method preferred by the NTMA, is State funding. I agree with that view. It is a tightly-controlled process at times, but generally advisable for the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also asked about nursing homes. I am not an expert but I am informed there is not an oversupply of nursing home places in the country overall. Deputy Rabbitte is correct on the matter of pricing because, like me, he is engaged in trying to help constituents and families.</P>
    <P>The step-down bed is a slightly different case. The problem is that in all the general hospitals there is a very high proportion of people with serious long-stay illnesses who in most cases are probably not suitable for the ordinary nursing home, such as those in the North Circular Road or Clonliffe Road in my area of the city. They require a certain level of medical and nursing care. To use that terrible phrase, they are &ldquo;clogging up&rdquo; the general hospitals but they are not capable of moving out. The costs of nursing home care are far too high. I have heard the argument of those who say we should stop the incentives. The law of supply and demand, as written by the economist, Mr. Hansen, has not been reached in the greater Dublin area, not to mind anywhere else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <P>Issues to do with waste management are constantly being discussed. Much of the progress made has been as a result of the discussions of the cross-departmental team. In reply to the Deputy's question on legislation, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will bring forward proposals to find a means of fast-tracking some of the major infrastructural problems. It is not a measure which will overrule democratic accountability in any way. Where large infrastructural projects are concerned, it is important to make progress and to find the mechanism whereby those projects can be examined and given priority so that they can be undertaken as speedily as possible. As far as conditionality or environmental or ecological reports are concerned, they will all still apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is an excellent and deserving project. The multi-annual programme has allowed considerable resources for PPPs in the education sector. The previous model will be updated to ensure better value in the long term. It is intended to continue using a certain percentage of the budget, not a very large one, for PPPs. I am pleased to inform the Deputy there has been a significant increase in the available resources for primary, secondary and special schools. The excellent school mentioned by the Deputy comes under the category of special education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on the issue of the cost of PPPs. I agree with the Taoiseach that the cost of State funding is under 5% compared with the PPP cost of 14.5%. It seems to be an appalling comment both on Ministers and on public servants that their lack of capacity to deliver projects on time should lead to a significant differential cost between a PPP and the traditional public contract of design, build and manage. In terms of the strategic management initiative, has the Taoiseach an ambition for the public service and Ministers to improve their efficiency in the delivery of public projects?</P>
      <P>In his reply to Deputy Rabbitte's question, the Taoiseach stated that the element of the PPP was the transfer of risk to the private sector. Experience in the UK has reiterated that if a public good such as a school, a hospital or a stretch of road is built and if the private company involved in the PPP collapses, the public school, hospital or road cannot be closed and therefore the notion of risk transfer is highly theoretical.</P>
      <P>On his journey to England today, the Taoiseach may have time to read Graham Greene's <i>Our Man in Havana.</i> In that novel, a diagram of what was thought to be a secret weapon, a WMD, turned out to be a diagram of a vacuum cleaner. I do not know if the Taoiseach has seen the diagram that has been produced by the PPP unit in the Department of Finance showing the operation of a PPP. I used to be an accountant and so was the Taoiseach. I believe the diagram would tax both of us collectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have attended several conferences on PPPs. I have the impression that the structure being developed is so top-loaded with <Col N="786" />legal and accounting consultancy and process steps that it is no wonder the Cork School of Music or any other project will cost an unbelievable amount of money. Under the current procedures, could that diagram ever go to Cabinet? The Taoiseach and a few others might be able to whittle the 24 steps that I found down to eight or nine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question. The Department of Finance and the NTMA are not overly positive or constructive about the PPP process, unless they can rigorously examine it to determine if it will give value for money, where there is a transfer risk, or where the design, build and maintenance costs add up over a prolonged period. That is where they stand on the matter.</P>
      <P>Some of my former colleagues left the country in the 1970s to work in the British local authority system, many of whose services have been privatised. They would argue strongly that the British system works extremely well. From what I have already said, the Deputy knows my views on this matter. In Britain, people would argue that pension fund resources are often used to finance PPP schemes, so they will not collapse. For example, if a company such as Unilever, which has &euro;5 billion a year in pension fund resources, puts its money into PPP schemes, as it has done in Britain, there is no chance of it collapsing, unless the entire British economy was to fail. Therefore, they see it as a very solid basis. They do not have an answer to the point made here because the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England would be able to borrow far more cheaply. They believe that the idea of being able to take a stretch of motorway and remove maintenance and other costs, including staffing costs, from their balance sheet has a long-term benefit. They look at that aspect far more than we do. We tend not to do so.</P>
      <P>The Portuguese socialist Government of Mr. Antonio Guterres, proceeded to instigate PPPs over half of the country. Driving through Portugal on holiday, one can see the results, which are impressive. It has been very costly, however, and the Portuguese Government has been in trouble with the Commission over it ever since. The job gets done but I take a conservative view because the cost is long-term and is not just the cost on this year's balance sheet. That is why I take a more limited view of it. People should be allowed to put together projects as part of an imaginative planning process and I do not disagree with the Deputy's point that the process should be simpler than it is. However, I would not allow Departments to race off looking for PPPs around every corner, which is part of the concept that existed four or five years ago.</P>

      <P>Under the existing arrangements, there is now a big move within local authorities to go for major water and sewerage schemes under the PPP system. Traditionally, such <Col N="787" />schemes were designed by local authorities themselves with the approval of the Department. Where breakdowns occurred, people knew who to call to remedy defects. Under the new PPP system, however, the designer might be in Alaska when he or she should be available here. More importantly, under the PPP system, is there any constraint on the charges to be imposed on consumers and customers subsequent to a design going through? For instance, if a sewerage system is done under the PPP system in a major town at a cost of &euro;60 million, once it is in operation are there any restrictions on the cost that can be charged to the local authority manager and, through him, to consumers and customers, or, having acquired the scheme, are they likely to be subject to exorbitant levies or other charges? Is there a concern in that regard or is there a lever which will prevent that happening as it is in everybody's interest that it should not happen?</P>

      <P>I do not claim to be an expert in these matters but I have seen the PPP sewerage project that was done in Dublin Bay, which is a model that is used extensively elsewhere and over which tight financial control is exercised. The Department was involved in it together with the local authorities and there were strict and extensive controls. Taking this example, one can see the benefits. Under the old system, one could have hundreds or thousands of applications for water and sewerage schemes. Using the PPP model, however, one can put in a central control mechanism using modern technology, which can group a region together. In the control room at Ringsend, which covers an enormous area of Dublin Bay and the adjacent lands, one person using modern technology can identify where a fault is. In that way, one service team can repair the fault effectively and efficiently. That PPP scheme is a 25-year one. One can imagine that if we attempted to achieve such a project under the old piecemeal system, we would be a long time getting it finished. Therefore, there are advantages to the PPP system in particular areas but it is tightly controlled. When the PPP model is used, the scheme is effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the next phase of the benchmarking award to my Department, payable in January 2004, is estimated at &euro;491,000. This increase has been calculated in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines. As per the Department of Finance guidelines, all staff under the grade of assistant secretary level are entitled to receive the benchmarking increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" />In my Department, the number of staff to receive this award is 205.4, that is, staff on salaries below the minimum of the assistant secretary scale, which is &euro;92,949. However, also included in the &euro;491,000 projected figure are benchmarking costs for other staff, not counted in our Department numbers, but who fall to be paid from our pay subhead. Examples of such individuals are: secretaries to former Taoisigh, three in total; staff in the office of the Leader of the Seanad, two in total; and some other grades.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service performance verification group, or PVG, issued its reports on 15 December 2003 in respect of the individual Civil Service Departments or offices that report to it, and the Civil Service as a whole. The PVG recommended that the pay increases are warranted for my Department.</P>
    <P>In particular, it found there was no industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement, and that there had been co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change.</P>
    <P>As regards progress on our modernisation agenda, the group highlighted progress on the Department's programme of internal audit and expenditure reviews, the development of the e-Cabinet system, the development of the customer charter, and the preparations for the implementation of further modules of the management information framework and human resource management systems, including the devolution of some HR responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The group also acknowledged the innovative measures relating to training and development which had been developed by the Department. The group indicated that it looked forward to this progress being maintained and developed in these areas during the next phase of the verification process.</P>

This is a cross-departmental appointment and in that regard it warrants debate rather than being simply noted on the Order of Business. The motion sanctioning the appointment of the Ombudsman was accompanied by statements in the House and in view of this and having regard to parity of esteem, the appointment of the Ombdusman for Children warrants a similar treatment. Furthermore, the Ombudsman for Children will be dealing with children from Gaeltacht, Galltacht, Gaelscoileanna and others, but it is not yet clear whether a full range of services through Irish as well as English will be provided by his office. It is necessary to hold a debate on this matter.</P>

This is based on the conviction of her own superintendent welfare officers. The Labour Party has managed to force a U-turn on one aspect of rent supports, but&mdash;</P>

      <P>The likelihood is that Report Stage of this Bill will take two and a half hours, taking into account the sos and questions this afternoon. It was originally intended that two sessions would be allocated for Report Stage. However, the ordering of yesterday's business meant that one of these sessions was lost. There is an onus on the Government to provide the additional time, considering this is one of the more important Bills the Dáil passes every year. Far more amendments are proposed than can be accommodated in the time allowed. I would ask the Government to provide the additional time originally promised for this measure.</P>

      <P>Again, a guillotine is being proposed. This measure originated in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1997 and was intended as a minor reform. Since then it has been translated, as a result of coat-trailing by the Tánaiste, into the most major reform in the history of Irish insurance that is guaranteed to reduce premia and so forth. It is, of course, a minor reform but it required more detailed discussion of submissions made on behalf of the Bar Council, the Law Library and other vested interests. We oppose the guillotine on the debate.</P>

      <P>I concur with Deputy Boyle. It is a ridiculously short time to deal with such a controversial Bill. There was also only a short time to discuss it on Second Stage. The problem is not just the content of the Bill but also the fact that the Minister introduced more than 30 amendments on Committee Stage and proposes to introduce further amendments on Report Stage tonight. That is not the way to deal with legislation. Haste results in bad legislation and makes bad legislation worse, which is happening in this case. The Bill will have major implications for people's human rights so there should be more time for a proper debate on all Stages.</P>

Having regard to the debate last night about the Nally report and the fact that the study had to be carried out by three eminent former public servants, there is an acute necessity in this jurisdiction for somebody equivalent to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland to be appointed without delay. The legislation was promised in November 2001 and several times since then, including in July by the current Minister. When is this legislation likely to be introduced?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test for carer's allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Most of the amendments deal with the carer's allowance, particularly improvements to various benefits for carers. Considerable time was expended on this matter on Committee Stage and in previous debates in the House.</P>
      <P>As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs I was delighted to introduce, along with my colleagues, a significant report on the rights and needs of full-time carers. This comprehensive report was launched on 27 November. Among the recommendations were the abolition of the means test for carer's allowance; a comprehensive system of needs assessment for carers; a significant shift of resources to home care subvention; the payment of a respite care grant to all carers; where a person has given up his or her job to provide care, a waiver of the 15 month restriction on the payment of carer's benefit; and, where a person providing care is receiving widow's or widower's social welfare payments, payment of 50% of the carer's allowance. This was to try to get rid of a significant difficulty. There is a deep resistance within the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and probably within the Department of Finance, to paying people a second social welfare payment. We recognise this in the report.</P>
      <P>We received 80 submissions on this matter and spent 12 committee meetings discussing it. We were impressed by the quality of the submissions received and moved by several. I was confirmed in my view and that of the committee in undertaking the work that some of the best people in the country are involved in full-time care of people with long-term disabilities. We frequently hear the opinion that we are becoming a nation of selfish, self-centred materialists who care about nothing except our own increasing wealth and comfort, but that claim is easily counteracted &ndash; indeed, destroyed &ndash; by reference to the number of people who give up their own comforts, ambitions and, in many instances, careers to devote themselves to looking after a relation or friend who is in need of full-time care.</P>
      <P>The report recognised that it was not possible to do all things at once. However, there were a number of serious and urgent initiatives that could be taken in the short term. The Minister indicated that the abolition of the means test would cost about &euro;180 million &ndash; the amount has gone up &euro;30 million since last year. She said this is a reflection of increased payments, disregards and so on. I accept that some positive work has been done but according to the Carers Association, it is widely accepted that the requirement to submit to a means test for receipt of carer's allowance is &ldquo;unfair, inequitable and . . . demeaning to the dignity of carers&rdquo;. It went on to say: &ldquo;We have been promised repeatedly that it would be abolished, but despite the repeated promises, we have again been let down badly on the big day.&rdquo; It also stated that the Minister for Finance had missed an opportunity to make his budget the magnificent seventh and instead it would be seen by carers as the miserable seventh. That is the context in which we are pursuing this issue.</P>
      <P>There are many people who are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, without respite care. For example, a women who contacted me and some of my colleagues has been looking after her 36 year old child who has Down's syndrome. She is in her sixties. She does not receive respite care because she is in receipt of a widow's pension. It is no use saying the respite care grant has increased if it is not available. One of the recommendations of the report, which was pertinent and comprehensive and could have been achieved, was that the respite care grant should be payable to people such as this woman. We gave other examples, such as that of a woman who looks after her elderly mother and whose husband was in a low income job. She was receiving some carer's allowance but unfortunately her husband died young and she now receives a widow's pension. Not alone has she lost the comfort and help provided by her husband, but she has also lost his income, small as it was, and her carer's allowance. The system is riddled with anomalies.</P>
      <P>It is true that &euro;180 million is big money. Contrary to what Senator Ross wrote about me in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week, if I must pay extra capital gains tax to ensure that &euro;180 million is collected, I am prepared to do so, as a socialist. It is true that I invested in Bula shares and lost. So what? It is no use looking in one's own pocket to see what is there for oneself. That is symptomatic of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; philosophy that permeates society &ndash; the individualistic approach. I am more interested in solidarity and the community view we must all share. Some day I may be a recipient of social welfare so I must contribute now towards people who need help. That is the difference between the right-wing ideological view and the left-wing socialist view. There is a clear demarcation there. I believe we should find the &euro;180 million and I am prepared to help the Minister for Finance find it so we can give it to those carers who are saving the State many millions of euro every year.</P>
      <P>Carers do tremendous work for a pittance but they would love to receive carer's allowance as a recognition of their efforts. The essential concern for carers is that they receive recognition for the work they do. Meanwhile, they are saving the State millions of euro. That is why it is so important. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs knows about this and I know she is considering various options, such as a move to home based subvention. I appreciate what she is doing. She said she was setting up a review group and it is to be hoped the joint committee will have some input into this aspect. I accept the Minister's bona fides in this regard. I am trying to persuade the Government to recognise that the Minister should be given that &euro;200 million next year. Deputy Ring, in his own inimitable way, said something about this issue. It is hard to paraphrase him because he has a unique style which I would never try to assume, but he said the Minister was capable of making a mark and he would even allow her to spend a couple of bob on consultants if he thought she would make a mark in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>On the matter of money for consultants, the committee produced its report at no cost by working hard, although the media did not give it much attention. I salute the work of the committee and the Minister acknowledged it also. The report is a blueprint for the future and has a number of aspects which should be implemented.</P>
      <P>I will finish with a quote which sums up a philosophy:</P>
      <P>It's the same the whole world over,</P>
      <P>It's the poor what gets the blame,</P>
      <P>It's the rich what gets the pleasure,</P>
      <P>Ain't it all a bleeding shame?</P>
      <P>The Carers Association states there are 170,000 carers, but I know the Minister says there are fewer because of the definition of full-time carers and so on. Some day it is to be hoped we will have a carer's database or register that will finish that argument. In the meantime, the &euro;180 million the Minister said is required will be the best &euro;180 million ever spent. I and my Labour Party colleagues are prepared to contribute to it, as are many Members of this House. I urge the Minister to consider the report of the committee as soon as possible and implement what recommendations she can. It might not be possible to abolish the means test tomorrow &ndash; we are realistic. However, there are a number of recommendations that could be implemented, such as those dealing with respite care grants and carer's benefit and the suggestion that carers should be able to use subsidised private taxi services in rural areas with their free travel passes. Employers will need an input in this regard but these are areas in which the Minister could make a significant difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given much time and consideration to carers, carer's allowance and the various issues that need to be dealt with. The first four amendments, which have been grouped, give the Minister an opportunity to take on board the views contained therein and the collective wisdom of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. Fewer than one in six carers receives a carer's allowance, the current rate &ndash;&euro;129.60 &ndash; for which, is to be increased to &euro;139.60. Throughout the country, hundreds of thousands of carers save the State at least &euro;450 per week on alternative care. If that care were not provided in the home, it would have to be provided in a nursing home or hospital. Carers save the State at least &euro;2 million per year. It is in the context of that commitment in respect of carers that we want the Government to deal with the issue. We stated clearly, prior to the general election, that we would give priority to carers and their needs. I acknowledge small improvements have been made. There is no point in Ministers, backbenchers, or members of the Opposition saying they want this and that; there is a need to acknowledge the role of carers and put that in place.</P>
      <P>On respite care services, the criteria for respite care needs to be more transparent and applied systematically to care for ongoing caring situations as well as crisis interventions. More extensive and flexible respite care services would make the shared care approach possible which, in turn, would allow some carers to work outside the home. The issue of respite care needs is covered in amendment No. 4. In teasing out this matter on Committee Stage and in the context of her commitments to us, the Minister outlined that an interdepartmental review group was being set up within her Department to look seriously at the issue of carers. I ask the Minister to give a commitment to link with the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and endeavour to meet the requirements of our amendments. We are seeking that the Minister would prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test for carer's allowance, the implications of payment of 50% of carer's allowance to persons in receipt of social welfare payments, the implications of providing that where a person gives up a job to engage in caring, the 15 month restriction on payment of carer's benefit be waived for as long as the care is required, and the implications of extending respite care payment.</P>
      <P>If the Minister gives a commitment to link with us in the context of developments in the interdepartmental review, the spirit of these four amendments can be taken on board. This would enable preparations to be made well in well in advance of the Estimates and next year's budget. In this way, a concise report would emanate from the Department with an input from the committee so that all the issues relating to the carers, and carer's needs, would be up for scrutiny and decision making. The Minister for Finance would then be in a position to say, &ldquo;These people have their work done, the Department has its work done and we will move ahead on a planned basis.&rdquo;  Carers' needs must be put on the agenda and pursued vigorously. If the Minister can give a positive response to these four amendments, we can move ahead.</P>

      <P>I am dissatisfied with what happened in the committee last week and I will write to the Ceann Comhairle. The information I received there differed from the information I received here today. I am disappointed but I will write to the Ceann Comhairle's office to have the matter clarified.</P>
      <P>I support the previous speakers. I compliment the chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and the committee members on their work on the issue of carers. We put much time, research and effort into it and, as I said at the select committee last week, we did not employ consultants but did the job ourselves and saved the State a good deal of money. We invited all those concerned throughout the State to come before the committee. I thank all those who took the time and effort to come before the committee and make their recommendations. They are the people on the ground who are looking after people at home. They are the people who came in and advised us. Following their representations, the committee issued a very good report. It will not be easy for the Minister to take all these recommendations on board overnight. We are saying today that we expect the current Minister or the next Minister, whoever that may be, to take on board many of the recommendations we have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Something must be done. As Deputy Penrose said, it would cost &euro;180 million to remove carers from the means test. Some 21,000 are in receipt of carer's allowance &ndash; 14,000 plus are in receipt of full carer's allowance while the remainder receive part of the allowance. Some 150,000 people get no recognition for looking after their loved ones because of the means test. The Minister went part of the way this year and I compliment her on the disregard. However, it was not enough. Irrespective of the disregards, there are those who, because their spouses are working, will not qualify for carer's allowance. We must recognise the work they do and the role they play in society. I hope in the next budget the Minister will deal with that.</P>
      <P>An issue that causes many problems is the rule whereby one can be in receipt of only one social welfare payment. For example, a widow in receipt of widow's allowance cannot qualify for carer's allowance. We have suggested in our report that they should get at least a 50% payment. I ask the Minister to look at this issue.</P>
      <P>The greatest scandal of all is the carer's benefit which is taken up by only a small number of people. Another recommendation in the report is that if people give up work and receive that allowance, they should not have to be assessed again after 15 months but should automatically be put on to carer's allowance if they want to continue looking after their loved ones. That would not cost much money. I hope the Minister can accept this recommendation and deal with it quickly.</P>
      <P>In compiling the report the committee also discovered that, in spite of the Department's PR, consultants and advertising, a large number of people do not know their rights as carers. Last January, my post consisted almost entirely of letters from the Minister's Department, containing her photograph and telling us about the social welfare increases in the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there was one for everybody in the audience and that is why I received them.</P>
      <P>The committee received a recommendation from a school in Dublin that social welfare recipients should receive information about their entitlements in their payment books. This was a good suggestion. It would not cost the Department a fortune and would require no consultants. The technology which has been installed in the Department could be used to give this information on the payment book to carers, widows and other social welfare recipients. A contact number could also be given, although I hope people who ring the number would be able to get through. Sometimes that is difficult.</P>
      <P>The issue of carers is an emotive one and people feel strongly about it. The nursing home subvention is available when old people are placed in private nursing homes. Most old and sick people want to stay at home and, if they are very ill, to die at home. They want their families to look after them, if possible. People wish to go into full-time care only when they have no one to look after them. Every report has shown that people feel safer and more secure when they are being looked after in their own homes. Carers save the State a fortune.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, the Ombudsman stated that a person aged 65 or over who has a medical card and is in need of a full-time nursing home bed must be provided with that bed. However, the Government has not changed the legislation to this effect. Carers save the State a fortune. It costs between &euro;900 and &euro;1,000 per week to keep a person in a public nursing home. It would mean a great deal to carers if they were given &euro;70 or &euro;80 in recognition of the work they do.</P>
      <P>Health board assessments must be streamlined. There are too many agencies and one does not know what the other is doing. It is important that they be pulled together, that one assessment would suffice and that a person could then be told his or her care needs and entitlements.</P>
      <P>The committee also recommended that, when a person changes from one health board to another, the report from the old health board should satisfy the new one. A person should not have to deal with new paperwork every time he or she moves. The Minister could make this happen immediately by regulation.</P>
      <P>The Minister went part of the way. She could be remembered as the woman who looked after the women of Ireland. She could be as famous as Granuaile. Does the Minister remember Granuaile?</P>

      <P>In the middle of November, 120 people were on trolleys in the accident and emergency units of five Dublin hospitals. This problem was compounded because 450 people were waiting to be discharged from those hospitals. Many of these people did not have suitable homes to go to. They had been left in hospital and the system was clogged up.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a woman whose husband has Alzheimer's disease and is blind, aggressive, incontinent and in need of full-time care. He is only 62, which is young to be suffering from this disease. This woman used to tie her husband to her in bed to prevent him wandering during the night. He fell out of bed and injured himself and had to be hospitalised. The hospital is anxious to discharge him and free the hospital bed. It costs approximately &euro;2,000 per week to keep someone in hospital. A place in a specialist Alzheimer's unit would cost approximately &euro;1,000 per week. This woman could not afford to pay this, even if she received a subvention. This is merely one example of a family which is being let down by the system.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance should be seen as an interdepartmental matter. The savings made in one Department could be used by another and hospital beds could be freed up. This is how a caring Government or a Government that works would view this question. It is crazy to keep people in hospital because we do not have facilities on the outside while carers cannot afford to have their loved ones at home. No one wants to see his or her loved one in a hospital or home. If the financial support is in place, people will avail of the opportunity to care for their elderly or incapacitated relatives.</P>
      <P>These amendments ask that we examine the question of carers and review the means test. Some 21,000 people are in receipt of carer's allowance, of whom 14,000 receive full-time support of &euro;139.60 per week. For a carer who is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, this amounts to 83 cent per hour.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the means test would cost &euro;180 million. The Minister may claim the Government does not have this money while we could argue about how we could get it. Banks made obscene profits last year but were not touched by the budget. People do not want to pay extra taxes, but in a time of shortage no attempt was made to gain extra funding from institutions which have made millions of euro in profit.</P>
      <P>Depending on the level of care required, alternative care by the State might cost in excess of &euro;1,300 a week. The Carers' Association referred to the saving of &euro;2 billion a year by keeping loved ones at home. Will the Minister clarify in her response whether she accepts these figures and has made the case at Cabinet that, while it might cost &euro;100 million to abolish the means test, the State would make savings in the number of people for whom families could care? She could put emotional and economic arguments to the Cabinet. I ask her to support the amendments but I know she will not.</P>

If she could do it, we would all remember her as another Granuaile, taking from the rich to give to the poor. The Minister will not be able to do it but a logical case can be made for this. It is not a large budget, either in the context of the Minister's budget or of the amount of money the State takes in. People do not want to see their loved ones in hospitals or homes and, if the financial and other supports were in place, many would take advantage of them. It comes down to financial support.</P>

      <P>Members of the Opposition face the usual difficulties in seeking to amend the Social Welfare Bill 2003, it being a money Bill and we being precluded from tabling amendments that would result in a cost to the State. Given that much of the Bill concerns payments, we cannot propose that they be increased. There might be savings if we suggested that some of the payments be decreased. That might be allowed, but no Member on this side of the House will do that. Instead we propose amendments of this nature that challenge the policy position and seek information on whether policy is consistently followed through and whether it can be adapted in the course of the coming year and future years. There is a great demand for the policy on carers to be widely assessed and to be changed significantly in several areas.</P>
      <P>The work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, chaired by Deputy Penrose, has been acknowledged and I would like to further acknowledge the report submitted and the work that it entailed. The ongoing campaign of the Carers Association points out many inconsistencies among carers.</P>
      <P>The Minister on several occasions has said that the carer's allowance is not intended as an income maintenance measure. This highlights the first inconsistency in the policy. If it is not income maintenance, why does a means test exist? The means test is a way to justify the payment in proportion to a person's other income. If the Minister does not overcome that dichotomy, the problem of recognising the contribution of carers to our society and economy will not be acknowledged. It is only a partial contribution, as the Minister has said many times in the House. If she is not prepared to go all the way with some of these amendments, for instance, the 50% additional payment to those who already receive a social welfare payment, perhaps she can indicate how far she can go.</P>
      <P>Is there a possibility of a 10%, 20% or 30% top-up for people who find themselves in the position of being social welfare recipients and carers? The information supplied by the Carer's Association indicates that it is a problem of large proportions because more than half of all carers are aged 50 years or over. This problem will worsen as that cohort moves into the pension age group. There is also the problem of the one in every five carers who cares for one or more people. There is a need for direction in these policy areas and for future resources to be identified and ring-fenced if we are to deal with the problem of caring in the future.</P>
      <P>Parallel with the carer's allowance we need to take on board the idea of care benefit as it exists in other jurisdictions. It is part of the social protection code of many other countries where a direct payment is made to the care recipients that they can use in meeting their own care needs. There is an assumption in this argument that some provide care while others are cared for. It is an equation which we do not properly measure. Many of those in need of care want to be able to develop their own capacity and these are free-thinking creative people, especially those suffering from various forms of physical disability.</P>
      <P>The many representations from the Centre for Independent Living for this type of payment to be developed and paid directly to care recipients outlines the direction in which we should move in this area. The centre has interesting ideas on the respite care grant which offers respite to carers. The option for care recipients is often to be taken out of a situation rather than to be properly consulted about and involved in the alternative care arrangements. It is a wider area than we have had the opportunity to debate properly. If these amendments, whether accepted or not, have value, it is in the extent to which we look at the broader picture of care needs for our society in the coming year and for future generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had long and protracted discussions about carers in recent years while I have been Minister. It is an issue that has been on the agenda for many more years. I reiterate my thanks to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and sympathise with its Chairman on the lack of publicity he received for the work done. It will be valuable, however, for the committee, Members of the House and my Department.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputy Seán Ryan that we are studying the financing of long-term care and I will consult the committee and listen to its views, especially on several issues raised in the debate. The consultative process will take place at the beginning of the year and I hope to establish a working group in the spring to evaluate how we progress.</P>
      <P>Several people have raised issues that fall outside the parameters of the carer's allowance and benefit. For example, they addressed the issues of respite care and step-down facilities in the health sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee's report links particularly well with the nursing home subvention scheme launched by the Department of Health and Children with my Department's report, Study on the Future and Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland, and will create great challenges for the nation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the best way forward with the carer's allowance and benefit will be linked to that and to see where it will fit into the long-term analysis. Should we examine another type of European model where people pay private insurance towards this contingency? Do we increase PRSI and ring-fence the increase for caring and carers? We must contend with the demographic changes of the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boyle alluded to the purchasing power of the care recipient in determining the type of care he or she wishes to receive. All these issues are in the melting pot and a decision must be made soon to study the long-term issues because, even in the short term, we are not managing many of them. Long-term provision is not necessarily just for the elderly but also for those who have a disability or are dependent on care. Linking this with the report of the committee on social and family affairs will form a good policy direction on this issue.</P>
      <P>When we advance the discussions, we will discuss targets and what the Government has set. We have exceeded the target set by this Government, which was to increase the income disregard. It was increased considerably this year. That disregard will enable an additional 1,750 carers to qualify and 2,100 existing carers will receive an increase in their carer's allowance. That is good progress.</P>
      <P>We can discuss the issue of numbers. The CSO has given an outline of the number of carers. Approximately 22,000 carers are determined as providing full-time care and are in receipt of the carer's allowance or carer's benefit. Some 41,000 people currently provide 43 or more hours care a week or six hours care per day. Those are the parameters we set. Some 50% of those carers are determined to be full-time carers in receipt of carer's allowance. The respite care grant has been very beneficial. I was anxious that it would be increased again this year because it creates some space for carers.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the joint committee does not need an introduction to what removing the means test for the carer's allowance would cost; it would cost &euro;180 million. There are considerations as to whether that would be the best policy framework towards which to work. It is my view that we should continue to increase the income disregard. Consideration of this issue will have to be brought into the overall policy direction in which not only my Department but the Department of Health and Children want to go in the next number of years.</P>
      <P>Of all the issues discussed in recent years, the most genuine, emotional and supportive discussions have taken place on the issue of carers. That reflects not a governmental priority but a priority among Members of the House towards caring. It is my fervent wish to proceed further with the expansion of the scheme. There have been issues concerning carer's benefits, some of which do not necessarily come under the remit of my Department but the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as in the case of consideration of additional weeks being provided in regard to carer's benefit.</P>
      <P>There has been a major increase in a short period in the money available for this scheme. Some &euro;46.46 million was provided for carers in 1997 compared to &euro;165.8 million being currently provided. This position will progress further. We will take into consideration the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee, some of which we can address quickly in terms of providing information and tightening up on issues such as that.</P>
      <P>I look forward to progressing the overall long-term issue of carers and those in receipt of care, and look forward to the co-operation of the committee and Members of the House in putting forward their views. I cannot accept amendments from the other side of the House on this issue, but the ethos of it has been accepted on the basis of the discussions that will take place on home subvention and on long-term care needs. It will be opportune at the beginning of next year to examine the framework, particularly the policy framework, towards supporting long-term care needs.</P>

      <P>The major concerns of the Deputies present are reflected in the various recommendations of the report of the joint committee. There is a broad consensus of support in the Oireachtas and in Government for the actions recommended by the committee, which are endorsed in the amendments proposed by Opposition Deputies. I acknowledge the unity and solidarity of purpose of the membership of the joint committee in finalising the report and bringing forward recommendations. If they were acted upon with some alacrity and speed, the position of carers and their families would be transformed. There would be an end to the circumstances outlined in the examples mentioned by Deputy Crowe and me. We need joined-up Government in the form of interdepartmental co-operation whereby significant savings on the one hand can be utilised on the other hand to defray the cost associated with this area.</P>
      <P>We will monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the report. That is not a threat but a promise. We will keep in contact with the many parties who made submissions to us and whom we got to know in the course of our work. Deputy Ring said the committee was engaged in hard work over some 25 to 28 hours. The Deputies present want to be a voice for carers and a force to promote an improvement in services in this area, which experience has shown is needed now. The timescale for the implementation of the improvements required is as important to us as the content of our recommendations. It is important that dust is not allowed to gather on yet another report. At least this one did not cost any money in so far as we can ascertain other than that involved members of the committee attending meetings. There is no substantive disagreement or controversy concerning this report. In it we have reflected the wider views of those involved in caring.</P>
      <P>I received a letter from the DergFinn Partnership, which will be well known to the Minister who comes from Donegal, thanking us for the report and the way we brought forward the issue. However, he urged us to give carers some hope that the issue will not rest there, that progress will be made on it and that carers will see light at the end of the tunnel. That is for what I appeal. In the context of what the Minister said, we will not press this amendment to a vote. We will accept her bona fides in this instance, as there are a number of other amendments on which I wish to speak. All my colleagues present have signalled a motion of intent to vigorously pursue this issue. We will observe the work of the interdepartmental committee that will be set up and we hope to have an input into its work.</P>
      <P>I exhort the Minister not to allow the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, or the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, who have right-wing ideological views on life, which differ substantially from the Minister's views, to dominate the next budget. We will be behind her, pushing her over the line.</P>

The Minister has the Mercer report and the O'Shea report, and she now has the joint committee's report. Having regard to the three of them and bringing together their recommendations in the work of the committee that she will set up, we should make substantial progress on this issue.

      <P>In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of extending the social welfare free schemes to widows and widowers who do not currently qualify in that regard.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister tried to make some improvements to the position of widows and widowers in the budget to bring them up to some level of equality. It is a critical time for people, particularly under the age of 66, who become a widow or widower and may have two or three children to look after. For example, if a wife suffers the loss of her husband, there is also the issue that he would have been due to qualify for benefits at a certain age and that will devolve down to&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point on Committee Stage that there may be legal difficulties involved and other ramifications. However, in so far as she can, having regard to the good legal expertise available to her Department, she should try to improve the lot of widows and widowers under the age of 66. They are a vulnerable group of people who were left on their own, maybe with two or three children, at a critical time. I request that some of the benefits in the household benefit package be made available to people in that category. I am aware they are made available in terms of an age category. While there may be legal difficulties involved in what I seek, we would all extol the Minister to make such a move.</P>
      <P>Most of us in rural areas know the importance of free travel, but a widow or widower, living perhaps where I live myself, ten miles from the nearest big town, may have no access to transport. There is a suggestion that people might be allowed use the free travel pass for transport other than public transport. The Minister might inform us how the cross-boundary extension of the free travel scheme is going regarding Northern Ireland. Many people who got the pre-1953 retirement pension, some of whom are in the UK, hoped that the scheme might be similarly extended to allow them come back and forth to Ireland. I will not raise Deputy Ring's hackles in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak specifically on the amendment. As a public representative, one of the great concerns in one's constituency is meeting widows or widowers who say they are the forgotten group in society. Their husbands or wives have died, they are raising perhaps two or three children and they feel they have been forgotten about by the welfare state. Many of them have no opportunities. They must look after their children and educate them. They have no opportunity to work.</P>
      <P>While progress has been made over the years for such people who are over 66 years old, we must now consider those under 66. It is debatable whether all widows and widowers should qualify, or whether those depending on children should be the first group considered for assistance. This is part of the debate that must take place. Widows and widowers under the age of 66 feel they have not been adequately looked after, and the purpose of the amendment is to put that on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the two previous speakers. Deputy Ryan is right in saying that widows and widowers are the forgotten people in this State. They have been so since its foundation. Many widows and widowers, particularly those with young children, have been left behind because their situation has not been recognised by the State. I support the amendment on the basis that the free travel scheme should be extended to such people. I trust that the Minister will let me know today what is happening between her and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, regarding the extension of the free travel scheme to Luas. I hope the news is positive and that all entitled will be able to travel free on Luas when it is completed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose touched on an issue I have regularly raised. The Acting Chairman is from a rural constituency and knows what I am talking about. The free travel pass is fine if one is in Dublin and can access the rail connections to various parts of the country, but in rural Ireland it is not much use when there is no public transport. The time has come for the Department of Social and Family Affairs to introduce taxi vouchers. People in rural Ireland have not got the appropriate public services. A system should be put in place so that vouchers can be used by people with free travel passes, people who, for example, are travelling to pick up their pension payments. Some people get great value from the free travel pass because they are near a rail line.</P>
      <P>I compliment the groups set up to deal with rural transport. Their work is advancing and I am impressed with it. That is a separate issue. I am concerned however that in some cases where services exist, voluntary groups are also moving in. That cannot be allowed to happen. We cannot have State subsidy for one sector with the private sector being penalised. That must be checked by the Department when these schemes are being set up. I had one very serious complaint in that area but I understand it has now been dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Minister understands that it is time that widows and widowers were looked after. Their payments must be aligned with other State payments. I would like to see major increases in their allowances over the next few years. It is a serious tragedy when a person dies and the husband or wife is left to look after the family. Every State assistance should be provided for such people. That has never been the case. We must now look at how we can support these people in their time of need. It is not just when people become pensioners that they need such help. It does not makes sense for one partner to be forced to raise a family on a modest State pension. Support is needed. The appropriate committee might look at suggestions and proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the free allowance scheme developed in this country is something in which we can take a great deal of pride. In many respects other countries are still catching up with the measures taken in this country. The Minister might even make a fair argument that they could be taken as an &ldquo;in kind&rdquo; additionality to some of the other payments being made. If I suggested that, the Minister might bring them into the PRSI net, so I will not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The intent of this amendment is to identify a group which should be considered for the extension of the free schemes. The Minister should also examine the qualifying factors for many of the schemes apart from free travel, such as the income limits which prevent some people from getting full benefit, and the rules on the residence in a house of other family members, regardless of the status of the others there. There are people in the categories involved, particularly pensioners, who could get greater access to and benefit from free allowance schemes if the rules were changed and relaxed. I hope the Minister will examine the operation of the schemes. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the amendment. It calls for a report, which would be useful. All these proposed changes are aimed at bringing about a positive change in Irish society. It is clear that this report would help the Minister and those who want to see the positive change regarding carers, of which we talked earlier. It makes sense and I do not see how the Government could vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As many Members are aware, we have made considerable changes to the free schemes. I agree with Deputy Boyle that they give additionality. Someone asked me to explain additionality but we all agree that these schemes provide it. They are seen by a lot of people as a great support network and we have expanded them to carers. We changed the rules applying to widows and widowers in cases where someone was previously in receipt of the benefit, so it would revert to those aged 60.</P>
      <P>There was a significant emphasis on widows and widowers over 66 and the anomalies that were there. This year we have been able to address those anomalies and they have been sorted out. I agree that widows and widowers are a particularly vulnerable group. Quite often a tragedy is involved and people have to pick up the pieces and look after children. That is very difficult. My mother was a widow for a considerable number of years and I appreciate why people are concerned about the issue of the household benefits scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 to 26, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 3 December last, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, decided as an interim measure that the electricity network operators, ESB and ESB Networks, are not required to offer new binding connection offers for wind farms before the end of the year. There is no block on new connections where offers are in place. In this matter the CER was exercising its exclusive competence under section 34 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. The Minister has no statutory authority to intervene. The CER was acting in response to concerns raised on the part of the grid operator about system stability and reliability.</P>
      <P>However, in the medium to long-term the decision could potentially impact on the Government's demanding targets to increase the contribution from renewable energy technologies in electricity production and is, therefore, being monitored by the Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland. The CER has published the relevant papers relating to the decision on its website.</P>
      <P>The factual position set out in those documents is that the decision is only valid to the end of the year and there are new wind powered projects amounting to 619 MW with binding offers which are not affected by the decision. To put this capacity in context, if all the projects with binding offers proceed, the amount of wind powered capacity on the network will more than quadruple from the documented 166 MW currently connected. It is misleading to imply, as some questions seem to do, that the CER's decision will stop further connections to the electricity network.</P>
      <P>Wind energy technology has an important role to play in meeting our national targets for renewable energy technologies. However, because wind is intermittent and there is no economically viable means of storing the energy as a fuel source or storing the electricity produced, it cannot be solely relied upon to deliver electricity in response to customer demand. Under the national support programme operated to date, wind powered plants have been allowed, in effect, to self dispatch. In other words, if the wind is blowing, the networks are required to accept, as a priority, the electricity generated irrespective of overall customer demand at the time. This was justified and possible because of the relatively low levels of wind powered plant connected to the networks and it allowed wind generated electricity producers to maximise revenue earnings and ensure the financial viability of such projects.</P>
      <P>An independent study commissioned by the CER and Ofreg, its counterpart in Northern Ireland, estimates that, if self dispatch is maintained, the amount of wind powered plant which could be accepted at selected transmission system grid supply points in Ireland by 2005 is 790 MW. The published data on existing wind powered plants and binding connection offers to new wind farms is at 775 MW.</P>
      <P>I have no basis to repudiate or challenge Garrad Hassan, the wind energy consultants of international repute who established the 790 MW threshold. As part of the decision, the CER requested ESB National Grid to conduct a public forum to give all interested parties an opportunity to submit their views on the situation before a final decision is issued by the CER. The public forum was held this morning.</P>
      <P>The current renewable energy target as published in the Green Paper on sustainable energy is to add an additional 500 MW of new renewable energy-based electricity generating capacity to the network by 2005, to be built independently in the fully liberalised green market or with support under the AER programme. The Minister has already announced that, subject to State aid clearance for the increases proposed, it is intended to award an additional 140 MW for onshore projects, 50 MW for offshore projects; 28 MW for a biomass-fed combined heat and power plant. The allocation of an additional 140 MW is designed to better ensure the 500 MW target will be delivered at a minimum, even if some selected projects fail to proceed. It is a matter for each project developer to secure a connection offer under the rules prevailing at the time.</P>
      <P>However, there are binding connection offers in place of 619 MW for wind farms alone at this time which is a positive indicator that the 500 MW minimum target from all technologies will be delivered or surpassed. Following the completion of the selection process in the current support programme, AER 6, it is proposed to publish before Christmas a consultation document on future targets and future support mechanisms for renewable energy technologies. It is therefore premature to speculate on future policy initiatives until all interested parties have had an opportunity to respond to the consultation document and those responses are considered.</P>
      <P>The technical feasibility of an Ireland-Wales electricity interconnector was confirmed by an initial limited feasibility study in 2002 undertaken by ESB National Grid and National Grid UK. The cost benefit analysis published by the CER in June 2003 confirmed the benefits of such interconnection in terms of adding reserve margin, supply security and possible assistance to the operating economics of wind powered generation.</P>
      <P>The case for progressing an east-west interconnector is strong and discussions are continuing with CER as to how its development can be advanced as a priority. However, I foresee an ongoing future programme to support renewable energy technologies at the national level continuing in parallel with that process, commencing with the consultation document to be published before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The EU renewables directive requires Ireland to increase consumption from renewable sources to 13.2% of total electricity consumption by 2010, to provide priority grid access for renewable energy technologies and to ensure grid costs to renewable energy operators are objective. The existing large hydro facility together with the current AER support programme and activity in the liberalised green market are well capable of delivering the majority of the 13.2% target. Additional steps which will be taken in the coming year following consultations with all interested parties will ensure the overall target is delivered if not exceeded.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 accelerated the liberalisation of the national green electricity market and preceded the renewables directive of 2001. It established administrative procedures to licence green electricity operators and established an appeals procedure which would also be required by the renewables directive. The Act also established the legal framework for the development of administrative procedures to provide objective costs and network access for green electricity generators. The provisions in the directive on grid systems issues state, &ldquo;Without prejudice to the maintenance of the reliability and safety of the grid. . . . .&rdquo; The decision of the CER is therefore well within the scope of a predictable concern recognised in the directive.</P>
      <P>In addition to these requirements, member states are also required to publish a national report and to submit a report on compliance with the requirements of the directive to the European Commission during 2003. The report to the Commission has been dispatched. It is proposed to publish the national report simultaneously with the consultation document on future programmes to support renewable energy technologies in the coming days. This arrangement will provide a better context for both documents.</P>
      <P>Without intruding into the operational function of the network operators or the regulatory independence of the CER, I am satisfied that, if all parties proceed diligently and in good faith, the moratorium on new connection offers in place will be seen in hindsight as a valuable step in developing the stable regulatory environment necessary for new proposed wind powered plants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a long answer and I hope we will be allowed some latitude in posing supplementaries, particularly as three priority questions are being taken together. Who decides on energy policy? As far as I can see, whenever we discuss energy policy the Minister of State seems to outline the policy as set by the CER. He appears to be little more than a spectator when it comes to renewable energy policy and issues concerning grid capacity.</P>
      <P>Why have we not seen the promised consultation process on the post-AER 6 strategy? The process was promised last May by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who said it would happen during the summer, yet we still have not seen it. There has been little or no consultation with the industry, and the consortia planning to build wind farms across the country have been left out in the cold since then.</P>
      <P>Since my question concerns more than wind energy, will the Minister of State outline what other renewable energy sources the Government plans to target for support in future? How does he intend to provide that support? Will he comment on whether he thinks it is a slap in the face for the wind energy sector to announce, without prior notice, that all grid connection contracts are being stopped until the end of this year? Will he confirm that the amount of wind-powered capacity on the grid is only 166 megawatts? Even though the existing arrangements for connection that have been agreed would, if developed, produce 700 megawatts, will the Minister of State acknowledge that process may take up to two years to achieve? If that is the case, why are we sending out all the wrong signals and slowing down the momentum that has built up behind the development of wind power generation? A negative signal has been sent to the industry that we are stopping any new connections to the grid.</P>
      <P>Are any successful AER 6 candidates currently being prevented from getting connection agreements with Eirgrid because of the moratorium in place? If so, what are the potential consequences for those projects? If they have been given a contract by the Department, yet are now being prevented from connecting to the grid and are therefore not fulfilling the contract, what will happen to those consortia or individuals?</P>
      <P>I recognise that there are technical difficulties and this has been confirmed by independent reports. Anyone who says we can produce endless amounts of wind power for the national grid is being naive. However, the report to which the Minister of State referred also stated that if we can overcome certain technical difficulties through investment, we could provide more than 750 megawatts quite comfortably. What is the Department doing to overcome those technical difficulties so that in future we will have well over 1,000 megawatts coming on to the national grid?</P>
      <P>At the moment, the CER, wind energy groups, Sustainable Energy Ireland, Eirgrid, the ESB and the Department are all in consultation with each other. The forum held this morning is also very welcome. Will the Minister of State drive this process forward by providing political direction where necessary, as was done to a certain extent for broadband? This would ensure that the provision of significant quantities of renewable energy will become a reality. Without that political drive it will not happen.</P>
      <P>What capacity will the so-called east-west interconnector between Wicklow and Wales have? When does the Minister of State envisage it will happen and who will pay for it? I contend that the State should pay for, run and own it. Will the Minister of State acknowledge that the only true way for Ireland to achieve its full potential for wind and other renewable energy is to link up with the British and European grids? Given our competitive advantage from natural wind resources, Ireland could supply many megawatts of power to Britain and, eventually, to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultation document will be available this week and will take into account the issues that have arisen over the past couple of weeks. As regards alternatives to wind energy, the biomass strategy group &ndash; which has been established in my Department, comprising the industry, Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Department itself, and various sectors of other Departments &ndash; had its first meeting last month and expects to produce a report next year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the decision taken by the regulator, it is of course up to the Department to drive policy. However, the regulator is the independent person appointed to deal with such issues and it would be remiss of the Department and the Minister not to take into account the decisions the regulator has taken in this regard. I accept what the Deputy said, that people who have received planning permission and had aspirations to connect to the grid will be disappointed in the short-term. The regulator has made it quite clear, however, that there will be a pause until the end of December, and then the issues will be re-examined.</P>
      <P>I can inform the House that the feedback from this morning's meeting of the consultation forum, which was run by Eirgrid, recognised that there are serious technical problems. The industry, the Department and the wind turbine suppliers need to work together to deal with these problems. Storage is one of the major issues that came up for discussion. Given the small scale of wind energy produced here, it is not currently viable to provide storage capacity. In America, they are investing approximately $27 billion on hydrogen fuel research to deal with this matter. One can therefore see the enormity of the storage problem and the financial implications of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney also asked about approved AER 6 candidates that may not get connection agreements, and he is factually correct. There may be some people who have been approved under AER 6 but do not yet have a contract with the CER. They will have a difficulty, but this morning the forum examined how this could be overcome. Both the Minister and I have asked our officials to see how the matter can be dealt with. The regulator has made a decision and he is determined, as is the Department, to deal with the technical problems before us. The Deputy can rest assured that the target of 500 MW set down by the Minister will be achieved with the existing contracts.</P>

      <P>The problem is that we cannot rest assured. We know there will be a shortfall of approximately 1,200 MW by 2007 in our general energy output. We have had a cumbersome and unfair system, through the AER process, to encourage wind generation but in terms of the outlook, winter after winter we import temporary generators to keep the lights on. I have great respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, but it is regrettable that the senior Minister is not here to answer questions or take important legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific issue I raised in this question concerns the technical measures. Did we all not know years ago, including the Commission for Energy Regulation and Mr. Reeves, that there were technical issues to be resolved in terms of wind power? I have before me the letter and the accompany report from ESB National Grid which highlights the key issue of the grid code. Perhaps the Minister of State can confirm that Derrybrien and King's Mountain got derogations from the potential grid code but the report lists issue after issue which must be addressed because of the nature of wind generation, for example, the fault ride through, the frequency control and regulation, the voltage control and regulation, the signalling, communications and dispatch and the applicable provisions for distribution connections. We were only thinking about this for mid-2004 and therefore we tried to call on-stream, in a very cumbersome way, 700 MW of wind power but we had no grid code under which this wind power would be fed into the national grid. That is gravely unfair to the promoters of wind power who have tried to move our country, under the Kyoto targets, to a greener form of energy to allow sustainable economic development.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister of State intend to do as a matter of urgency because this is a matter of policy? It is not just a matter for the regulator. It is for those of us in this House and particularly the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. What do they intend to do about addressing these technical matters and at least making people aware that the grid code exists and that all these issues must be addressed if we are to have stability of supply, given that we could be going into the next general election with the lights flickering or going out? That would be another disaster from this disastrous Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree it was deeply embarrassing for his senior ministerial colleague that on the day he was trumpeting the budget provisions for the development of renewable energy and that we were looking at a new dawn with the expansion of the Irish renewable energy industry, at the same time his press release was put through his fax machine, there was another one coming in the other direction from the regulator and from Eirgrid, both State appointed bodies, to the effect that no more connections would be made in the renewable energy sector because we could not handle what was already on the table? Was that not an incredible example of the Minister responsible for this area not having the faintest idea what was going on in the area under his control?</P>
      <P>I will give four brief examples of where the Minister might start intervening and casting his eye on the whole energy area. First, in the broadband area we heard him talk the other day about a failure of the market and that he had to intervene to effectively create an alternative market. Fair play to him, but we have a clear disaster in the energy area because of our inability to develop renewable energy. A country with the best wind energy resources in Europe is the least developed in terms of exploitation of those resources.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to take up the independent Garrad Hassan report he referred to earlier and will he point out to the regulator and to Eirgrid that, according to page 85 of the report, the international expert believes we can take up to 2,000 MW of wind power before curtailment starts to be of any significance? The international expert in this field believes we can take at least up to 2,000 MW before we run into any difficulties in terms of curtailment of wind power. Will the Minister be instructing the regulator on that basis? That is the target we should be seeking in the medium term. Beyond that we can start discussing the storage issues which the Minister rightly said become an issue once we get up beyond that level of wind power.</P>
      <P>Second, will the Minister start to take an interest in Eirgrid's development of the grid itself &ndash; some &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion has been invested &ndash; and make sure that investment is made on a basis that assists the development of renewable energy because a key criteria as to whether we can take further wind is how that money is invested? To date, the Minister has said nothing on the matter and he has given no direction on how that investment should be made.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister of State say in his response that our transposition of the renewables directive is unnecessary because we have the 1999 Act which sets out the appeal and marketing mechanisms? Is he saying we do not have to do anything else in terms of amending our own legislation, regulations and administrative systems to take into account the requirements of that directive? Was I correct in taking that import from the Minister of State's earlier response?</P>
      <P>Third, is the Minister of State happy that a State company, Eirgrid, which, as Deputy Broughan pointed out, had approximately five years to establish the grid code we would need to have in place to develop wind energy and determine how it would get further wind resources onto the grid, at this late stage in that five-year process states out of the blue, with no consultation with the Minister or the industry, that we cannot do it and that this is the end of any further connections? Is the Minister of State happy with that type of planning in the Irish energy sector?</P>
      <P>Fourth, does the Minister of State agree that come what may in my lifetime, which I hope will be long, the electricity generation sector will make a complete transition from fossil based to renewable energy because the fuels on which we are dependent today will not be available or will cost so much we will be forced to move towards renewables? What is the Department's long-term vision in this area? Mine is to have 20% renewable energy by 2010, 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050, by which time I will still be hale and hearty. Does the Minister of State disagree? What exactly is the Government's vision? Is it content to say nothing as it has done for the past two years?</P>

      <P>Although the provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, it has been clear for some time that the market has not responded to the demand for broadband, either in the provision of services, the pricing of those services or their regional spread. In this regard, I welcome the announcement by Eircom in recent days of its intention to extend its DSL coverage to more than 150 locations by March 2005.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced the Department's broadband action plan to make high-speed connectivity available to towns with an aggregate population of more than 350,000. The key elements of the plan are: the provision of open access, high-speed broadband infrastructure in towns with a population of more than 1,500; a Government supported group broadband scheme, similar to group water schemes, in which smaller communities can pool their demands and secure high speed connectivity from a range of providers in the market; funding of &euro;140 million, committed under a multiannual budget approval by Government, representing &euro;35 million annually between now and 2007; tougher fines against those infringing communications laws; new policy directions to the telecoms regulator focusing on delivering competitive pricing; and a website on which consumers demanding broadband can register and view competing prices from broadband providers. These initiatives complement other broadband initiatives taken in recent months and covered extensively in the House on previous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the progress made by the private sector in recent days on broadband roll-out and pricing, particularly wholesale pricing. On Monday, Eircom announced plans to roll out broadband to an additional 80 towns in the next 18 months. Today, it has been reported that Esat BT and the ESB have announced plans to reduce wholesale telecommunications tariffs in the regions outside Dublin to the level available in the capital. This is a welcome initiative which will reduce the cost of accessing broadband for many people.</P>
      <P>I will focus, however, on the Minister's announcement last Thursday, which, as usual, was made through press releases and announcements as opposed to in the House. Will the Minister of State confirm that the promised funding is &euro;140 million over the next years, which amounts to &euro;35 million per year? Is it not misleading to announce that the funding is &euro;140 million when only &euro;35 million will be spent each year until 2007? Does the Minister of State expect the implementation of the strategy to roll out broadband to 83 new towns with a population in excess of 1,500 to take four years to complete? Is this the grand plan? Is he satisfied that &euro;35 million per annum will be sufficient for this purpose in an area of such importance?</P>
      <P>The group broadband scheme is supposedly available for rural villages and towns with a population of less than 1,500. While I welcome the Minister's effort to address this issue, he is going about it the wrong way. People in rural areas will have to pay 50% of the cost of rolling out broadband to their areas. Will asking people to pay half the cost, in contrast to the Government's undertaking to meet the cost of rolling out broadband to the 83 towns announced by the Minister, solve the digital divide between rural and urban areas? Instead of solving a problem for many people in rural areas, we are causing another one by asking them to pick up half the tab.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced funding to roll out broadband in rural areas through group broadband schemes to which communities will be able to apply for grant aid. What he forgot to mention was that it was matching funding and the communities in question would have to pay 50% of the cost. Does the Minister of State accept that this may discourage some communities from securing broadband because they will see no hope of getting together a group of 30 people, the minimum required to apply for a grant and will also have to meet 50% of rolling it out?</P>
      <P>As regards the Minister's grand broadband strategy, what will happen to people in rural areas, for example those living on farms or commuting to work in urban centres, who are unable to bring together a group of 30 people? Is there any hope for them under the strategy because I fail to see it? How does the State propose to ensure&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will be brief. The coverage in Ireland is 30%. In most other EU countries it is 70%. The Minister is determined that Ireland will achieve the 70% level within a reasonable period of time. Like Deputy Coveney I welcome the announcements by Eircom and Esat BT this week. Deputy Coveney is right, the Minister announced last week &euro;140 million in funding from the Government between now and 2007.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If further funding comes on stream works will be carried out before 2007. The Minister has set a target which will deliver broadband infrastructure to over 350,000 people who have no immediate prospect of access. The small rural communities outside of the urban areas can also get access to broadband based on initiatives similar to the group water schemes. People who live in rural Ireland are aware of how successful group water schemes have been in the past. Local communities have to make a contribution, in addition to the amount of money they will receive from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister is saying matched funding is needed and recommending that groups of 30 people should apply. I will refer Deputy Coveney's concerns about individuals who cannot muster a group of 30 to the Minister. I am sure such cases will also be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is to achieve the 70% coverage that other EU countries have at present, through a combined initiative of Government and private enterprise. How this is achieved does not matter. The important thing is that we do it, working together with all the relevant sections of industry and the community. The sum of &euro;140 million is not an insignificant amount.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> if, as part of the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the EU, he will initiate a complete reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, including a comprehensive review of the terms governing the administration and control of Irish fisheries.</Quest>
      <QRef>[31625/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the institutional framework governing the European Union, the sole responsibility for initiating proposals or reviews of the type indicated in the Deputy's question rests with the European Commission. It is not a matter on which the Presidency of the Council can seek to progress unilaterally.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy was advised in response to a broadly similar question on the Common Fisheries Policy on 7 October this year, the CFP has only recently been reviewed. A new basic regulation was finally agreed at last December's Council, following protracted and difficult negotiations.</P>
      <P>The process leading to that reform was lengthy and comprehensive, covering such key areas as access to resources, conservation, control and enforcement, structures and fleet policy. CFP reform spanned a number of years and involved detailed consultation with stakeholders across the European Union. The new basic regulation will govern EU fisheries policy over the next decade and, accordingly, the question of embarking on a new review of the CFP so soon after it has been comprehensively reviewed is not a realistic prospect.</P>
      <P>Ireland, with the benefit of detailed input from Irish fishermen, participated in the reform process in a progressive manner and the reform package finally agreed contains many of the recommendations of the national strategy review group. In that respect, it is appropriate that I draw particular attention to an action plan to address the problem of the discarding of juvenile fish catches, stronger control and enforcement, continued recognition of Ireland-s entitlements to additional quotas under the so-called Hague Preferences and new regional advisory councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level. The regional advisory councils are considered a particular priority and we hope to make very significant progress on this issue during Ireland's EU Presidency next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State concur with the belief among most people involved in the fishing industry that the Common Fisheries Policy has been a disaster for this country, where billions upon billions have been lost both to the industry and the fish processing sector? Many commentators put the loss at &euro;120 billion since 1972. Will the Minister of State and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, impress on the other EU Ministers that as a small compensation for such radical losses, the Common Fisheries Policy should be radically transformed to guarantee the future survival of the Irish fishing industry? Will the Minister of State agree that the Common Fisheries Policy is in need of the type of radical reforms that were implemented with regard to the Common Agricultural Policy and that this is not being met by the current reform programme which appears to be designed to drive most people involved in fishing out of the business?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that we are stumbling from one crisis to another? I stress this point in regard to the Irish Box, the limit on fishing days, new licence regulations, etc., right up to today when the Council is proposing further restrictions on Irish fisheries. Will the Minister agree that while the Council claims to be open to proposals from fishermen on conservation and other matters, where such submissions have been made &ndash; recently for example, by a group representing those who operate on the Irish Sea &ndash; they have been rejected out of hand? Will he agree that from a scientific survey point of view, people within the fishing industry with the relevant experience and track record have an invaluable contribution to make in determining the quantity of the stocks that exist in our waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would inform the Deputy that the reason the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is not here is that he is attending the December Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels where all the decisions are being made. If he can get as good a deal as last year, when he worked in conjunction with the fishermen, they will be reasonably happy. During the EU Presidency it is important that Ireland uses its influence as much as possible to ensure that the livelihoods of fishermen are protected. The new CFP provides that the interests of each member state are taken into account when it comes to allocations. This is significant and will help protect our interests as a maritime nation for the future.</P>
      <P>There is also flexibility within the CFP as regards revisions to allocations. This will allow for possible change in the future. In the context of declining fish stocks such a task is extremely difficult. During the Presidency the Minister has a number of priorities. The establishment of the regional advisory council is important since fishermen will themselves have a direct input. Agreement and implementation of stock recovery programmes is also important as is the development of technical conservation measures as a fisheries management tool, particularly to combat the discarding of juvenile fish and implementation of the new western waters fishery effort regime. The Deputy can be assured that the Minister will be working closely with all of the fishing organisations during the Irish Presidency of the EU to ensure their livelihoods and interests are protected and to achieve as much positive progress as possible for the industry. From 1 January, when the Minister assumes his role, he will try to implement his priority list in this regard during the six months of the Presidency.</P>

      <P>The Irish Coast Guard of the Department has the responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services in this country, and it has no plans to purchase sea rescue helicopters at this time.</P>
      <P>The current sea rescue helicopter service is provided by means of contractual arrangements with a specialist company in this field. Contracts are in place to cover the period until end 2007. The decision to contract out the helicopter service rather than purchase aircraft directly was taken to ensure that arrangements associated with the operation of the helicopters remain the responsibility of the contracted company. Under the contract the operator is responsible for such matters as the provision of a helicopter base, the statutory aircraft inspection and certification obligations, the maintenance and manning arrangements of the aircraft and the provision of other equipment necessary for the safe operation of the service.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is familiar with the south east and is aware of the length of the Wexford coastline. The county is lucky to have a modern helicopter which can operate by day and by night. This is the result of the hard work of the previous Minister of State, former Deputy Hugh Byrne. I compliment him on that. In recent years the maintenance of the rescue helicopter in Waterford was under severe threat and he is one of the Ministers who kept it there. Can the Minister give a guarantee that the service will be kept in place? In recent days I was speaking to people involved in the fishing industry and they told me that the rescue helicopter has been called to south Wexford a number of times in the past two weeks due to the herring fishing. When the rescue helicopter is being serviced and is out of use, what helicopter is available to cover for it?</P>

      <P>There has been a 24 hour service in place from 1 July 2003, to run for a period of two years, on the east coast. That is based at Dublin Airport. There is a 24 hour service in place on the west coast, valid from 1 January 2002 until 31 December 2007, and that is based at Shannon Airport. From 1 July 2002 the service on the south coast was extended from a 12 hour to a 24 hour service and the contracts run until 30 June 2007, with operations based at Waterford Airport. This Department and the Department of Transport had to provide a significant amount of money to retain the helicopter service there because the airport was closing down and the services there had left. However, Aer Arann has returned and is providing a valuable service. Our Department had a financial input into that as well as providing the 24 hour service.</P>
      <P>The service will remain in Waterford on a 24 hour basis. The helicopter does not always stay in Waterford because it occasionally helps out in other areas. There have been difficulties with the service in Sligo recently and the other three helicopters have had to assist in that area to ensure a full service is provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 an indicative &euro;200 million of Government and European regional development fund or European Regional Development Fund funding has been allocated to broadband infrastructure initiatives aimed at addressing the country's broadband deficit. Funding has been made available for a number of major infrastructure projects, including the creation of 19 metropolitan area networks, MANs, in towns and cities throughout the country, the extension of broadband services by both Eircom and Esat BT, the creation of a national fibre trunk network by the ESB and a number of smaller local initiatives involving upgrades to existing cable networks and switches.</P>
      <P>The MANs, which are being constructed by local and regional authorities supported by Government and EU funding of &euro;64 million, are designed to interconnect to the maximum possible extent with existing infrastructure. It is expected that the MANs will be completed on time and within budget by mid-2004. When completed they will be managed for the State by a management services entity, MSE, which is currently being procured. The MSE will have full responsibility for the management, marketing and maintenance of the MANs and will be awarded a services concession contract for a period of ten years in consideration of a financial return to the State.</P>
      <P>In recent years, under the national development plans, my Department and the European Regional Development Fund have co-invested in a number of regional high speed projects, including the ESB Telecoms, ESBT, fibre wrap project, the western digital corridor and some of Esat's and Eircom's regional networks. The objective of these investments is to address regional backbone deficits and to drive price and choice in those areas. As indicated in the Minister, Deputy Ahern's, announcement last Thursday, of the Government's broadband action plan, additional Government funding of &euro;140 million has been secured under a multi-annual budget that will make broadband available to over 350,000 people who have no access to broadband and no immediate prospect of it.</P>
      <P>It is intended to extend broadband connectivity to all areas, including smaller rural communities, using the group schemes model which has proved so effective in the provision of rural water supplies.</P>

The contract for the management services entity was due to be awarded in September. Why has it been delayed until now? When will we be given the name of the MSE? Will the MSE be given responsibility to manage the &euro;140 million over the next four years for the roll out of broadband to 80 towns? Is it planned that the same entity will manage both the fibre rings and the roll out? That would make sense. Is the Minister satisfied that we are rolling out broadband to homes and businesses with sufficient capacity to keep Ireland competitive? We are rolling out DSL with 500 kilobytes whereas competitors such as Hong Kong and other cities are rolling out broadband with up to five megabytes. Will the Minister comment on that?</P>

If there is an intention to keep business in rural areas, there must be a commitment to towns such as Kingscourt. What criteria were used that led to the exclusion of a town like Kingscourt?</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Minister's replies to identical Questions Nos. 159 of 7 October 2003 and 181 of 11 November 2003.</P>
      <P>The Dooish exploration well, which was drilled last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland off the Donegal coast and which discovered a hydrocarbon accumulation, was re-entered and deepened this summer. Drilling commenced on 11 May 2003 and the well was plugged having confirmed the existence of a substantial gas condensate column. The rig will move off-site on 30 July 2003. Both my Department and Shell-EEI are continuing to analyse the well results and integrate them with other data from the area. Further technical work on the projects will be required before the size of the gas condensate accumulation and the possibility for any commercial development can be accurately assessed. However, it is extremely encouraging that this well, only the second to be drilled in the Rockall Basin, proved to be such a significant discovery. My Department has emphasised the positive implications of this discovery for the prospectivity of the basin as a whole.</P>
      <P>No further oil or gas exploration occurred during the summer months of this year. Statoil Exploration Ireland has plugged and abandoned its exploration well off north-west Ireland. Data from the well will now be integrated with the data acquired in the vicinity to ascertain the implications for further exploration work in the licence area.</P>
      <P>There have been three seismic surveys carried out offshore this year, all off the west coast. However, one of these surveys was abandoned following damage to equipment. The results of the surveys are not yet available due to the highly technical processing required for this type of data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the general pattern of exploration offshore during the lifetime of the Government? One gets the impression there is less activity each year. The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, made a statement a few months ago on changes to the terms and conditions in order to stimulate this activity.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the three seismic surveys, one of which broke down. What independent knowledge has the State of the resources off the north-west shelf in particular? The Minister of State said in the past that up to 60% of our gas supplies for two decades may come from the Corrib field area. There is also the Cong exploration. This is a significant discovery which may impact on our discussion on alternative energy and the energy security of the country. What attention is being paid to this aspect? The Minister of State will note that there has been significant adverse comment in the media recently, and by representatives of workers, on the extraordinary terms and conditions that apply whereby no royalties are payable by companies, there are no production levies, the only tax return to the State is the 25% corporation tax and the number of Irish workers directly involved in these explorations.</P>
      <P>Given that there are positive vibes coming from recent activity, is it time to consider a new regime and to carry out an independent examination of the resources of our country and the coastal shelf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of exploration licences and, correspondingly, the level of exploration activities, including drilling, has declined in recent years. The current low level of exploration activity reflects this decline. This is not just happening in this country but throughout Europe and the world. However, 2003 has seen six wells drilled on the Seven Heads for appraisal, development and production purposes. Deputy Coveney will be aware that Ramco began production during the week. This is a worthwhile project for the Cork area from the point of view of employment and continuity of supply.</P>
      <P>A recent study of the Porcupine region concluded that the region had an active hydrocarbon system in the Connemara discovery which proved to be uncommercial. The region is largely underexplored, with low drilling density and a large basin. The 3D seismic coverage of the region is sparse and 2D seismic data quality varies. A large number of leads and plays were identified of which less than 10% have been drilled. The basin has untapped reserve potential and regions of prospectivity have been identified.</P>
      <P>The lack of royalties and tax concessions introduced a few months ago have not encouraged a worthwhile response from companies who want to carry out explorations in Ireland. The Deputy suggested that we should look at the system, and I have no problem with that. There is not a mad rush of companies coming to Ireland to spend their money.</P>
      <P>There were planning problems for the Corrib field, which is one of the major fields. The company appealed to An Bord Pleanála and was rejected. I understand the company may be about to resubmit a new planning application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, met the British ambassador on 12 November last concerning the transportation of 13 old US naval ships to Britain for dismantling. The Minister had previously written to the UK authorities expressing the Government's concerns about the operation. The Minister informed the ambassador that the Irish Government is opposed to any further so-called &ldquo;ghost ships&rdquo; being transported across the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>The Minister reiterated the Government's view that such operations exposed coastal states like Ireland to unnecessary risks. He informed him that he had already asked the EU Transportation Commissioner, Mrs. de Palacio, to consider what actions the EU could take to prevent a recurrence of this type of activity. The ambassador confirmed to the Minister that the UK would return the four vessels, two of which were already in Britain and two others that were on route at the time, to the US. He indicated that for safety reasons the vessels would be returned during the summer months.</P>
      <P>The ambassador also acknowledged the concerns raised by the UK Environment Agency about the operation. He informed the Minister that the remaining nine vessels still in the USA would not be towed to the UK. However, he was unable to say what will eventually happen to them. The Minister made it clear that the Government would oppose any attempts to reactivate the project.</P>
      <P>From the outset steps have been taken to minimise the risks posed to this country. Prior to the vessels leaving the US, the Irish Coast Guard received detailed information on the status of the vessels, including threats from hazardous materials, the seaworthiness of the ships and the planned routes. The Coast Guard monitored the progress of the tows on a daily basis. At no stage did the vessels enter Irish waters. The Government also ordered that aerial surveillance take place of the vessels during their transit off the south coast and a tug boat company was placed on standby in the event of any incidents.</P>
      <P>This month the position adopted by the Minister has been vindicated by two UK High Court rulings. On 8 December the court ruled that the dismantling company, Able UK, did not have a valid waste management licence from the Environment Agency for the intended dismantling. On 15 December, in a related case, the High Court ruled that Able UK's planning permission from Hartlepool Council was not valid. Environmental risk was a key factor in both these cases. The Minister will avail of the opportunity of the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the EU to pursue any additional Community measures to prevent European waters being used in the future as a highway for vessels which pose such threats to member state coastlines and communities.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister on his actions, albeit belated. Will the Minister of State agree that the problem arose when the former US President, Mr. Bill Clinton, banned the export of old hulks from the Second World War and earlier to developing countries because of the incredible quantities of mercury, lead, asbestos and so on that were used to build them? Given that this was the case and that we knew these ships would be leaving Virginia, why did we not say at the time that this was an outrage and refuse to allow such vessels anywhere near our coast, whether they entered our waters or not? The Minister has been calling in ambassadors and appearing on television news programmes, but why did he not do this a long time ago, before these vessels left the USA?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has piloted a number of Bills dealing with sea pollution through the House and has spoken a number of times about the highly sensitive zone we hope to declare in our massive maritime territory. When will he introduce concrete proposals that can be examined in the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

      <P>The Minister has been concerned about this issue from day one. He raised it with the UK ambassador and also, on 7 November, took up the case with the US ambassador, Mr. James C. Kenny. I attended a meeting with the Commissioner for Transport and Energy, Ms Loyola de Palacio, at which we made it clear that this is not just an Irish problem but one for the whole EU and that she should consider introducing legislation, or a system within the EU, to stop this happening in the future. The Minister requested that EU member states bind together to deal with this issue and that the USA consider other options for the disposal of ships on the grounds that there is a risk in their taking long journeys through EU waters. We also expressed to the Commissioner our view that the dismantling of such ships and making safe their hazardous waste, while it is necessary, should be carried out in their countries of origin.</P>
      <P>During our forthcoming EU Presidency this will be a priority issue for the Minister, who will be seeking common ground within the EU to deal with it. The Taoiseach will also take this up at the highest level in the US and with the British Prime Minister to ensure that countries such as Ireland, which have no involvement in these matters, are not threatened by ships such as these. The Minister will take it from here and see what he can do during our Presidency to ensure something like this cannot happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on promises made by Government in the Agreed Programme for Government and the national anti-poverty strategy and the increase in payments which would be required to meet the NAPS promises by 2007.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move the amendment in the context of the targets outlined by the Minister in the national anti-poverty strategy. What effort has she made in the budget to achieve these? She has fallen notably short and we are disappointed about this. The Minister should consider the figures. The Combat Poverty Agency prioritised the ending of family and child poverty and set out targets for increases in child benefit, personal social welfare rates and employment supports. Every Minister makes the point, with which it is hard to argue, that the best way out of poverty is through employment, but some of the actions taken by the Government, including in the Minister's Department, have shown glaring inconsistencies. The IDA recently responded to some budge measures under which the back to education and back to work allowance, which should have been priorities, have been cut. This is foolhardy economics. There are many inconsistencies in the Government's position on poverty and the NAPS targets, including it position on payments that target children in the poorest families.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boyle has been a consistent and trenchant proponent of some changes in that area. That is not a view he has arrived at recently; he has always argued it in a fairly consistent fashion. Effectively it is frozen since 1994 and in real terms would have been devalued by approximately 25% to 30% in that period. They called for an increase in child benefit of &euro;12 per month and an increase in child dependant allowance from &euro;16.80 to &euro;19.30 for children under the age of 12 and up to &euro;21.60 for those over the age of 12, recognising a point Deputy McGrath used to make that as children get older there is a need for increased expenditure. As a mother, the Minister knows that better than any of us here.</P>
      <P>Some 300,000 children live in relative poverty, according to a Combat Poverty report, augmented by figures from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which has witnessed a significant increase during October and November. Some 70,000 of those experience consistent poverty. As the Minister will appreciate, childhood poverty can have devastating consequences. We can get a definition of &ldquo;relative poverty&rdquo; where one's income is less than 60% of the average industrial wage. Not having basic items such as a warm coat or a hot meal on daily basis are issues I would be focused on.</P>
      <P>That many of the targets set have been missed is an abject failure. Those targets were set within the various programmes for Government and independent reports. Those reports are not made in a political fashion. It is our duty as an Opposition to ensure that targets which are set in an independent fashion are achieved. In the context of a relatively affluent and rich economy it is important that the fruits are distributed where they are most needed. That is critical.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say she got &euro;11.26 billion. She is a good teacher and we have all got it into our skulls. At the end of the day it is how it is distributed. One may say more is needed but we live in a society where more elderly people have to be looked after. It behoves us all, irrespective of which side of the fence we are on, to provide for them. My colleague, Deputy Ryan, will have more to say but certainly there has been a significant failure on the part of the Government. That is not political point-scoring or bashing, but it stands up to independent scrutiny.</P>
      <P>In the context of the amendments tabled by my colleagues and me, we want to know how the Government will achieve those targets by 2007, given the significant shortfall. We never knew whether the &euro;150 in 2002 was set in CPI or average earnings terms. It was left suitably vague to allow for whatever target is ultimately achieved to be claimed as a success, without losing face. Even in that context, it will take a significant increase of funding, and the Minister for Finance will have to come to the table with a full deck the next time, otherwise there will be a massive shortfall in achieving those targets which are reasonable in 2002. Given what has happened during the past two years in the lower levels of social welfare it will be difficult to achieve them. We do not know whether indexation of the target to wages or prices is the preferred option.</P>
      <P>Children have been badly let down in that they received only &euro;6 this year. Most independent commentators indicated they would get at least &euro;12. Others said it would take &euro;15 this year to achieve what the Minister for Finance set out in the 2001 and 2002 budgets. They are solemn commitments given on the floor of the House by the Minister for Finance and he has left the Minister without anything in this regard. That is the reason we bring it to the attention of the House on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to address the NAPS reports to see how far the Government has fallen back on its commitments. It is worth looking at the key targets, which the Minister and the Government signed up to, to reduce the numbers who are consistently poor below 2% and, if possible, eliminate consistent poverty, under the current definition of that term. Even if we were to accept the consistent poverty line, without going into relative poverty where there could be 844,000, those figures show that 210,000 live in constant poverty in this rich Christian country.</P>
      <P>We set a target to achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rate of social welfare to be met by 2007. We have heard much about the increase and the success that has been made of it. To meet that target by 2007, I estimate that an extra &euro;50 would be required over the next three budgets, approximately &euro;15 or &euro;16 per week. The Labour Party and the other Opposition parties will vigorously pursue the Minister and the Government to ensure this commitment is met.</P>
      <P>We are speaking about poverty. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced the budget, the Minister announced the Estimates and the Social Welfare Bill and the backbenchers said it was fantastic that there had been a &euro;100 million increase this year over last year. That was in the context of the budget and the increase was 18%. There is no reference good, bad or indifferent to last year's budget which was reduced by 50% on the previous year when over &euro;100 million was handed out. Last year that amount was reduced. We have got extra money but compared with what was available two years ago it goes nowhere towards meeting the commitments entered into in NAPS.</P>
      <P>With a view to expediting this issue many are looking to the Government. We will not even touch upon the 16 vicious cuts. Solely in the context of NAPS, the Government is falling behind in its commitment. We will put pressure on the Government to ensure that commitment is carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister has the opportunity &ndash; the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, had the opportunity but did not do so &ndash; I call on her to apologise for misleading the Dáil in 2001 and 2002, when the Government promised women that the commitment regarding child benefit would be honoured in this year's budget. It was not honoured. The women and children of Ireland were owed &euro;17 and &euro;20 respectively from last year but they got only &euro;8 and &euro;6 respectively. The Minister and the Government should apologise for misleading the House and the people with regard to child benefit.</P>
      <P>Organisations such as CORI and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the national children's strategy, the national anti-poverty strategy and other voluntary and State agencies are monitoring what is happening and how we deal with people who are falling behind in society. CORI has said that the gap between rich and poor has widened by &euro;294 per week. The UN international day of the family will be celebrated on 15 May next. The only way to deal with child poverty is through child benefit. Every report has shown that child benefit is spent on children.</P>
      <P>Recently the Society of St. Vincent de Paul highlighted two problems. First, there are approximately 300,000 children in poverty in Ireland. Second, more and more people are falling into the poverty trap. People who are coming to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul will soon be pushed towards money-lenders to borrow money to pay for Christmas because these poor creatures cannot live on social welfare.</P>
      <P>The Government has set out a strategy and has established State agencies to protect the less well-off in society but it is already falling behind in meeting its commitments and promises. For the ninth year in succession there has been no increase in the child dependant allowance, the most important income for women who are rearing families. Approximately 99% of the payment is drawn by women and it is important that this continues to be the case. Women spend this money on their children. The Minister gave a commitment to the women of the country in 2001 but in 2002, when we had the first downturn in the economy, that promise was broken. The Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement in 2002, said he would deal with the matter the following year, but as of today he has not even dealt with last year's problem. The Government's commitment has not been met.</P>
      <P>More than 9,000 people in Ireland now earn more than &euro;200,000 per year. When the Government came into office those same people earned less than &euro;100,000 per year. The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and the middle classes are being squeezed by stealth taxes and other costs. They are feeling the pressure. The economy will feel this pressure by the end of the year. The Minister for Finance was able to find a record amount of money at the end of the year but if he paid the money he owes to local authorities and others and if the Government had not held back on other payments, he would not have that money.</P>

      <P>There is concern among the public that child benefit will be means-tested. Is a review under way in the Department? This is the one payment that women receive. Many men who have very good jobs and incomes do not give any of it to their wives. Many such women depend on child benefit. That benefit must not be touched by the Minister, the Minister for Finance or this or any future Government. I would not be a part of any Government that would do such a thing, regardless of how it was made up.</P>
      <P>We have a problem regarding poverty and children. The best way to tackle child poverty is with child benefit and the child dependant allowance. If the money is given to the women it will be spent on children. The Minister did not get what she wanted in this year's budget, but next year I hope she and the Government will honour the commitment given to the women of Ireland in 2002 and clear the record of this House.</P>

Child benefit has been mentioned already.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that the Government is fully committed to the national anti-poverty strategy. If we look at the commitments made in NAPS as part of Sustaining Progress we see how the various social partners are treated in different ways. Once employers get their productivity and the unions get their wage increases where is the collective goodwill towards seeing that the commitments to those who are income dependent in the social welfare system are met? They are largely met in the partnership process through the community and voluntary pillar but members of that pillar say that successive national agreements, even prior to Sustaining Progress, have included commitments by successive Governments which were not met. Such commitments have always been bottom of the pile and have always been those least honoured. We need a linkage to the Social Welfare Bill which will show how these commitments are being met, when they are met and are they likely to be met. This is why these amendments should be seriously considered.</P>
      <P>If the Government annually falls behind in its commitments and we cannot predict what annual funding for future budgets will be, what confidence can the Opposition have that these commitments will ever be met? If the Government fails to make even an annual tranche of these social welfare payments &ndash; and next year's will be larger and the following year's larger again &ndash; the people's confidence that these commitments will be met will be undermined. Other Members have pointed out where the linkages should be made by referring to the children strategy and the health strategy as well as Sustaining Progress.</P>
      <P>My amendment refers to the need to poverty-proof all measures. I am ashamed to say that I have to urge the Department of Social and Family Affairs to poverty-proof its own policies. This is not being done, although a commitment to do so was made in the partnership process. As a lead Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs should be giving greater guidance to other Departments to make sure their counter-productive policies do not undermine what it is trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that we read the same ESRI report on monitoring poverty trends because the Minister hid behind her constant reference to consistent poverty while I argue that relative poverty is the better guide because it shows the growing inequalities in our society. Even if she does not accept the figure in the ESRI document on the growth in persistent poverty, we should heed that warning. Persistent poverty refers to people in relative poverty for longer than three years. The Minister can hide behind her assertions about consistent poverty but, if she is not prepared to acknowledge the existence and growth of persistent poverty, her Department and those in Government who pursue the Boston rather than the Berlin model of economic development and social welfare will always ignore indicators such as this.</P>

      <P>Deputies Penrose and Seán Ryan have submitted an amendment similar to mine. Like many Opposition Members I am not a fan of An Agreed Programme for Government, but it is worth re-reading now and again to remind ourselves of what was promised in the days before the Minister for Finance came up with his adjustments&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>They were called adjustments at the time. It is another word introduced by the Government. There was a pledge to publish an annual report of progress towards the achievement of an anti-poverty target. These amendments are to give effect to a commitment already outlined in the Government programme, but will people be paid and the increases given?</P>
      <P>Other speakers referred to the gap that must be narrowed, which is the issue of greatest concern. Deputy Ring referred to child benefit, an area where the Government reneged on its commitment without warning and told people that they had to manage. The Minister indicated that she will peg the increases to prices, not to wages. In the discussion on Committee Stage, Deputy Seán Ryan asked why they were not linked to wages. Perhaps the Minister will allude to that in her reply. The gap is significant and a long way from the targets set in the national anti-poverty strategy, but the Minister for Finance does not seem to be planning increased spending soon. While the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, may seem genuine in her commitment to meet these targets, it is hard to see how we can bridge that gap. The amendment is asking for a report on simple measures such as whether we are on target, which clearly we are not, and how we can bridge that gap.</P>

      <P>We are dealing specifically with means-tested schemes under the ending child poverty initiative. Three years remain in which to reach the realisable targets in NAPS. Considerable amounts of money must be provided. We went some way towards that this year.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the targets, income supports of &euro;150 in 2002 terms are not attached to an indicator. Others have interpretations of the indicator to which it is attached, but there are no commitments on its attachment to an indicator. It is the real value of the payment. Deputy Crowe recalled the discussion on Committee Stage and said that it should be attached to average industrial wages. If it were, it would be less than it is now because all payments in recent years have been increased by considerably more than that indicator. It is best if we attain a target set by NAPS of &euro;150 in 2002 terms, which is approximately &euro;173 now depending on the consumer price index.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The targets are set within the economic parameters of the Government and the Minister for Finance has eloquently adverted to these on several occasions. All programmes and targets, such as NAPS and the programme for Government, refer to economic ability and stability in the country and, despite the recent difficulties, the Government has been in a position to give almost &euro;900 million extra to my Department. That signals its commitment to reaching the NAPS target and ending child poverty.</P>
      <P>I am not naive enough to say that we will eradicate poverty in the next number of years, but it is my aim, as it is of every other Member, to do my utmost in this respect. Poverty indicators are academic. My Department and I, as Minister, deal with those in poverty. There are academic arguments about those who are at risk of poverty. One can be at risk of poverty and not be in poverty. It is my job initially to support those who are in poverty and to bring them above the poverty line. That is the reason there has been such a great reduction in recent years in those who have been living in consistent poverty.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boyle and I were in the same year in UCD and he knows that once there is a change in the economy, relativity will always click in. He is talking about relativity. I could be relatively poorer than he is.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way in which this issue is examined. There is a paradox in that there can be an increase in relative poverty at a time of economic boom. It would be wrong for such a position to continue, but when we are talking about examining poverty indicators, our view is that addressing those in consistent poverty is the best way of addressing this issue. Poverty is not necessarily an income support issue. It encompasses everything. That is the reason we have an anti-poverty strategy and we take account of issues over and above income support.</P>
      <P>While not accepting any of the amendments in this grouping, I am sure the Opposition Members will ensure that I do my job. That is their job.</P>

      <P>I will pursue the NAPS target set and agreed by Government and the social partners. It is my intention to proceed as quickly as possible to its achievement. While not being facetious, I hope to have three years to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy set a target of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rate in social welfare benefit to be met by 2007. If that figure was indexed, we would need to achieve a rate of &euro;182.70 per week. The lowest rate in social welfare benefit in the budget is &euro;134.80 per week. Therefore, there is a significant way to go.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring is correct in that there was an increase in child benefit of only &euro;6 per month, despite the Government's commitment in this regard. It would need to raise the payment by approximately &euro;24 per month to meet that commitment. There was no increase in child dependant allowance and the Minister said firmly she is dismissing that out of hand. There is no mention of the fact that the Government would have to bring in only 200,000 people on low income into the safety net and enable them to qualify for a medical card.</P>
      <P>Since coming to office the Government has managed to widen the gap between the rich and the poor &ndash; this would be in line with the philosophy of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy &ndash; by &euro;294 per week, according to figures calculated by CORI in its budget analysis. There was no mention about that in terms of child care, despite the crèche supplement being removed as part of the savage 16 cuts, which is to pay for the cost of emergency child care. In that context, starting with this budget the Minister is faced with the challenge of delivering a real increase of about 25% over four years. That is the extent of what she has to meet.</P>
      <P>We are not misleading anybody. We are acting on figures that were laid down. I agree with Deputy Crowe that some of the figures set down in the various partnership agreements were at the lower end of the scale. If we cannot achieve those, what hope have we of trying to achieve a higher level to eradicate the numbers in poverty, a situation that is not of our making? These figures were given independently.</P>

      <P>They are the real winners. They have got &euro;100 million out of the system and none of them will be in receipt of social welfare benefit for the next 25 years because they have been well looked after.</P>
      <P>I want to support the Minister in trying to eliminate child poverty. The promise given regarding child benefit was broken. As to whether the Minister's figures or my figures are correct, my figures indicate that the Government has met only 50% of the target set.</P>
      <P>Another scandal is that the Government promised that 200,000 more people would be eligible for a medical card, but that is another promise it broke. Fewer people have a medical card now because the guidelines have not been adjusted by the Department. People with children on a low income who should have a medical card and need one do not have one.</P>
      <P>An increase in child benefit is the way forward. I reiterate my request to Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister for Finance to keep their hands off the child benefit. The Government made a commitment in that regard which it should honour.</P>
      <P>The Minister said she had a few years more in office, but I wonder. She is getting nervous, as are the backbenchers. The decentralisation proposals settled them a little, but prior to that announcement they were running out to the plinth every hour on the hour, every day of every week, because they did not agree with Government policy.</P>
      <P>Those in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are dealing with child poverty on a daily basis. They know what is happening on the ground. Some Members of this House who sit in the front seats opposite are off in their clinics meeting people at the grassroots. Power has gone to their heads. When they are here, they smile, grin and laugh at everybody because they think they know better than everybody else. The PD philosophy has contaminated Fianna Fáil, because the PD philosophy is to leave those who are weak and have been left behind in society where they are and forget about them while people trample on top of them, but that is not my philosophy.</P>
      <P>The way forward in addressing this issue is by way of increases in child benefit. The Minister should make sure that she honours the commitment given by the Government in that respect.</P>

With regard to the Minister's adamant assertion regarding child dependant allowance, she surely must be aware that several reports have indicated that lone parent families, particularly women who are dependent on child benefit and child dependant allowance, have slipped further behind because of their income dependence on child dependant allowance. The Minister is making a clear statement that lone parent families will be proportionately less well supported because of her policy.</P>

On average, this works out at an annual increase of &euro;15.97 a year, which is more than two and half times the increase awarded this year. This Minister is saying this will happen. The kindest thing one could say is that the NAPS strategy is on hold in many areas. Years ago we were told that labour must wait and now we are told that the poor must wait.

      <P>One of the difficulties of which we are all aware is that posed by the disincentives which arise when people move into employment. CDAs are one of those. Working on the interaction of CDAs and family income supplement, which I greatly support, and about which we have had numerous discussions over the past weeks, is the best way of addressing child poverty and the transition problem I mentioned. Despite what people might say, we are very good in this country at facilitating the transition from an income support into employment, for example, and ensuring that people have a secondary benefit. I am not in any way making the poor poorer and the rich richer through the implementation of the policies of the Government. It is very easy to say that.</P>

      <P>2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of further extending school meals programmes.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the next part of the programme. It could be discussed in conjunction with the various other parts relating to child poverty as discussed by the Minister. She has accepted the importance of intervening at an early stage of child poverty and the importance of hot meals in terms of giving people opportunities while they are in education. That advantage flows on into further education. The Minister has made some changes. I think it was in 1911 that this scheme was initiated. Therefore, the Minister is the first in some 90 years to change the scheme. Some credit is due to her.</P>
      <P>We accept and approve of the improvements but we want to know the cost of extending the scheme to rural areas. I am a rural politician and I suppose the Minister looks after her own back garden somehow or other. The scheme is very important in urban areas. What would the cost be of extending it to all primary and secondary schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. We must make greater progress in this area. There are thousands of children in urban and rural areas of Ireland going to school daily without a meal. That is the reality for many people in disadvantaged areas, where family life is dysfunctional. It is unrealistic to expect children who attend school without having had a meal to be as attentive and active as other children. In terms of poverty and the effort to create equality of opportunity, this area must be dealt with. I acknowledge the progress made, but we must go further in helping the disadvantaged in urban and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme under discussion is very city orientated. I have asked the Minister at a committee, and ask her now, to write to all schools and explain to them what the scheme means, in order that schools which may need to avail of the scheme may do so. Many rural schools will not know that this scheme is available. It is important that a child who leaves home without a hot meal can be given one in school. A child can more easily be educated when warm and fed and looked after. Some children come from homes where they have no breakfast or dinner, and sometimes no fire, and that causes problems in their education.</P>
      <P>The scheme is very good. The Minister has promoted it citywide and I ask her to promote it in rural areas. Some schools may not wish to avail of it, but many others would wish to do so. The Minister should get her four public relations officers moving and give them a bit of work for the new year, instead of having them send out statements telling us we are dummies. Instead of sending out such negative material, they would have positive work to do.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. Having once worked in the Youth Encounter Project school in Cork, I can attest to the benefit of a school having access to a school meals programme, especially in the most disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The intent of this amendment not only indicates it should be extended more into rural areas from outside the larger urban areas but consideration should be given to extension of the programme within schools. It needs to be targeted in many ways. Breakfast is the problem in the case of many young people. Attentiveness in school is affected by the lack of taking a first meal of the day never mind food during the course of a school day. I encourage the Minister to continue on the path she has chosen and I ask her to broaden the scope of this programme. There are only four specialised schools using Encounter projects. Schools in other disadvantaged areas would be given the advantage of a food programme that would go beyond one hot meal and would pay particular attention to the first meal of the day which is ignored in many of these circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Research undertaken in Britain and other parts of the world suggests that one method of tackling poverty is by giving children one nutritious meal a day. It increases their attention in class.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that last year up to 220,000 pupils in both primary and secondary schools would eventually be included in the scope of a revised school meals programme. She stated that the Estimate would be an extra &euro;15 million which is a substantial sum. It would provide a free meal for students in most disadvantaged schools. The working group supported this proposal. Unfortunately one person who represented the Department of Finance on the working group opted out of the proposal. It is a worthwhile programme and the research proves that it works. If we are serious about tackling poverty, this is one of the ways of doing so. A response can be seen in the attitude of children in school and their attention span. The programme has everything going for it. I accept there is a problem with finding the funding. Like everything else, the record seems to be stuck in the same groove and we seem to be repeating the same refrain of requesting more money. I urge the Minister to look favourably on the programme.</P>

      <P>In the heat of the moment I called Deputy Boyle by the wrong name and offer my humblest apologies. He is too young to have been in college with me anyway. I lost the run of myself. I will probably be reading about it in the newspapers. When Deputies provoke me, I call them the wrong names.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that it has taken a considerable number of years to have this review completed. The expansion of the school meals programme will be a significant undertaking. I sought assistance in its implementation from the Department of Education and Science. We initially examined in the targeted approach those secondary schools that have the greatest number of early school leavers and their feeder schools. The programme is open to people in rural areas as well as those in urban areas. A number of schools in rural areas have been targeted. It is my view to expand it further with an additional 31 projects this year. It is an excellent scheme and it has been evaluated. We have examined direction with regard to the nutritional aspects of the meals. As I come from a rural area, I was not familiar with the breakfast clubs that are organised in city communities. They are excellent and are of benefit to young people. This school meals project supports the breakfast clubs and children with special needs and other targeted groups.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to expand it further with the additional funding that has been provided. I changed the regulations whereby it is now available within the rural areas. The old Gaeltacht scheme has been disbanded for a number of years which means there was a ganntanas and therefore the scheme was expanded from the urban areas into the county council areas. It is my fervent wish that the scheme be expanded further. Without doubt it has given a great boost to young people.</P>
      <P>All the research indicates that children need a good healthy breakfast and lifestyle in order to learn. It is my hope to progress this project further over the next number of years and that children who need this support will get it. It is targeted to the schools, not to the children. The sorry lesson was learned from the experience in the United Kingdom where children were ashamed at being targeted to receive a school meal.</P>
      <P>It is a worthwhile initiative and programme and I hope to expand it further. Its implementation will take some time. A total of 386 schools with a total of 51,000 pupils will benefit under the urban scheme. A total of 210 schools and voluntary organisations will facilitate approximately 23,500 children. It has expanded and its role will be expanded further. I will be in further consultation with the Department of Education and Science to examine how its initial implementation can be targeted. I reassure Deputies that it is available in rural areas.</P>

      <P>I raised the issue of the consumer price index on Committee Stage. I made a point about the basket of foodstuffs used by the Department. There is no point putting luxury holidays or cars into the basket because people on social welfare do not have luxury holidays three or four times a year and they do not own big Mercedes cars. I ask the Minister to use a basket of ordinary foodstuffs when compiling the CPI.</P>

A great amount of information is required to provide the indexation. I appreciate his point about the plethora of things in the basket being quite astronomical. From a statistical point of view my Department is not in a position to provide an additional indicator of the necessities from one house to another. My officials would have a heart attack if I even contemplated doing such a thing. In my view, the CPI measurement is the best way to deal with indexation. I cannot accept the amendment. We have ongoing discussions with the Combat Poverty Agency, the ESRI, the NESF and numerous other organisations to evaluate many of the existing indices. I am not in a position to accept the mantle of the consumer price index. The excellent work done provides a wide-ranging view of consumer goods and services. While it would be difficult to narrow them down, it would be equally difficult to determine what is essential, <i>per se.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed the basis of the family income supplement under the taxation system on Committee Stage. It is difficult to make valid comparisons between the family income supplement take-up and the Revenue earnings data. This is because the Revenue data is not broken down by reference to the number of children in a family or the number of hours worked. In addition, most people who require the family income supplement need it on an immediate basis, whereas one must wait a year under the taxation system. That would be detrimental to those who would like to receive the family income supplement.</P>
      <P>A working group was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the role of refundable tax credits within the tax and welfare systems. It examined in particular that to which the Deputy referred, namely,. the potential for paying the family income supplement through the tax system. A range of issues were considered, including refundable tax credits for FIS claimants whose income was below the tax exemption limits, the collection of data on family size, hours worked and spouse's income, as well as the nature of payments and how this impacts on incentives to take up and remain in employment. Following that evaluation, the group concluded that the family income supplement should be paid through my Department. It is a complicated matter but ultimately it was considered that for reasons of immediacy, the best way to make FIS payments was through my Department, given the complexities of the taxation system and the fact that it does not immediately address a particular need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxation can be done through the PRSI system. The Revenue Commissioners are well able to extract tax from people and they know how many children they have. I do not see why it cannot be done like that. The FIS take-up rate is only 30%, which means that some 70% of people who could qualify for the supplement do not do so because they do not want to receive a social welfare payment when they are working. They would much prefer to receive it in back tax at the end of the year. If the will was there, the Department could do that for people on low incomes, but it will not because it is saving the Department a great deal of money.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 10 to 13.</P>
      <P>This is one of the first of the 16 insidious and mean-spirited cuts we have seen. A number of umbrella organisations, including Hope, have made this point. This cut concerns qualification and linkage. As was said on Committee Stage, it means that, if someone claims unemployment or disability benefit in February 2004 and previously had a claim in August 2003, both are linked. This has an advantage in that one does not have to wait for the three waiting days, as we called them in the old days. However, the disadvantage is that the amount of time one has on benefit is reduced. If one used 26 weeks of unemployment benefit in 2003, because the claim in January 2004 is now linked under the current proposals, one would only have 29 weeks left, whereas if one starts a new claim in January 2004, which is not linked, one would be entitled to 65 weeks UB or 52 weeks if one had fewer than five years' stamps or 260 contributions paid. It will affect people who will be in and out of employment continually.</P>
      <P>The linkage could be of advantage to some who are affected by the increase in the basic contribution level from 30 to 52. A total of 275 people are affected by it and it represents a saving of &euro;2 million. That is the extent of it. Nevertheless, it is a decrease which will impact on those 275 people and we will hear about it when those people appear at our clinics. We never recovered, nor did the then Minister, from the previous cuts and it was the cause of that Government losing an election. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was the author of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;, which we fought tooth and nail, and we will have to fight these 16 cuts in whatever forum and at every opportunity. We are not afraid to nail our colours to the mast and fight them in every way and we intend to run this campaign throughout the country because many people will not be aware of these cuts. It is only when one gets the nip that one realises one has been bitten. That is the problem.</P>
      <P>We will be sitting in our clinics snowed under with work and people will ask us why we did not prevent these cuts. I will not divert them to Donegal because it is too far away but I will head them up the road to Kildare.</P>

      <P>My colleagues are trying to disrupt my train of thought, a Cheann Comhairle. In any event, this is an indication of the bureaucratic nature of a technical adjustment in this case. I hate to mention my own crew but one would almost have to be a barrister or a legal person to interpret the nature of this measure. It is one of those technical measures which drives everybody dealing with social welfare mad, particularly those who will now be caught in the grips of what is a mean-spirited cut.</P>

It is not until people begin to be affected by these cuts in the new year that problems will arise. Fianna Fáil backbenchers will be on the plinth again and signing motions to the effect that they did not realise what they had done in the Dáil. They will have an opportunity to correct that in a few minutes because we will oppose it. This is a mean-spirited cut and I call on the Minister at this late stage to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I am supportive of this amendment. It is indicative of the series of cuts introduced in the Book of Estimates. This cut fails to take into account the growing casualisation of the economy from the point of view of the labour market and the fact that people will be drifting in and out in terms of seeking unemployment benefit by the nature of contract work in which they are engaged. It is not that the Minister will make a small saving of &euro;2 million but that proportionately more people will be affected year after year because of the nature of this cut. On those grounds, I support this deletion.</P>

      <P>From Granuaile to Scrooge, a Cheann Comhairle. I have been doing well in the past hour and a half.</P>
      <P>As we all know, the key component of the administration of the benefit system is the concept of continuity in a claim. The notion of linked claims is a key component in how this operates in practice. It is true that linking claims can serve to reduce entitlement to payment over a longer time period as the maximum duration of claims are combined resulting in entitlement to benefit exhausting earlier, for example.</P>
      <P>The principal implications of claim linking for the recipient, however, is that he or she retains some or all of the entitlements established during the course of the first claim. For example, retention of previous entitlements may result in payment of unemployment benefit at a higher or lower rate than would have been applied to a new claim. Currently, where a person makes a claim for unemployment or disability benefit within 13 weeks of the end of the previous claim, both claims are linked fully in the case of unemployment benefit and partially in the case of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>In a changing labour market and the consequent change in work patterns to short-term, temporary employment, it is considered appropriate that the short-term social welfare schemes should adapt accordingly. The extension of the linking period from 13 to 26 weeks will close the gap within the 52 weeks linking which applies to schemes such as unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>As we said previously &ndash; I do not want to rehash the debate &ndash;&euro;70 million was given to the horse racing industry. We are talking about a sense of priorities but somebody is ensuring that those who are in a better off position do not suffer any impact from these cuts. I realise prize money and so on has to increase; I am involved to some extent myself and I know a little about this area. However, we have to prioritise because to those who are at the bottom, every additional two or three euro can make a significant difference.</P>
      <P>Coming from my background I am aware of the significance of these cuts, the impact on rent supplement and so on. I read a good article on rent supplement. If reform is needed, so be it. Let it be done on an interdepartmental basis with the local authorities, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. That is joined-up Government, as Deputy Crowe referred to it. Let us get everybody involved on an interdepartmental basis. Some of the groups told us &ndash; it may have been Threshold but I am not sure &ndash; that we must reform, not retreat on the question of rent supplement.</P>
      <P>No matter what is said, the eligibility requirement puts vulnerable people at risk of hardship and homelessness. We are not saying that. Threshold and other groups are saying it, and I understand the Minister met them in the interim since we last spoke to her on Committee Stage. I would like to hear what she has to say now, having heard from those organisations on the ground.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for the increase from 39 to 52 in the number of paid social welfare contributions required for entitlement to unemployment benefit, disability benefit and health and safety benefit, nor is there any justification for removing child benefit payments from people whose partners earn more than &euro;300 per week. The removal of three months of unemployment benefit from people who have been paying PRSI for less than five years is especially difficult. Those benefits are paid for by employees and employers. The Government does not contribute one cent to the social insurance fund. It raided the fund in 2002 to pay for its pre-election splurge and promises. In spite of that raid, there is a surplus in the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has no moral right to change the rules and restrict the owners of this fund. The employers and employees own the fund and the Government has no moral right to start tampering with it. They should leave it alone. The people who paid into it are the owners of that fund and they are entitled to get their entitlements. Effectively, this amounts to another smash and grab raid on the fund. I repeat that it does not belong to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs or the Government. It belongs to the people who paid into it.</P>
      <P>The Minister might say she has a pain in her head listening to me, and that is fair enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be some justification for that if the PRSI rates were reduced for low income workers, but there will be no change. The traps which exist for those on an income level of &euro;287 per week, which is low, will remain and will be felt more extensively when the minimum wage increases in February to &euro;7 per hour. To take the case of two parents who are working and paying their PRSI, if one parent becomes unemployed, he or she cannot now get a payment for the children because they are only dependent on the other parent. People in this position can legitimately ask why they are paying PRSI on both incomes. Why do we have an individual contribution system and a couple based benefit system?</P>
      <P>Has the Department made any progress in deciding how the system should develop in the future? Why do we lurch from year to year making cuts here and there, while making virtually no structural improvements and with no concept of where the system should be in the future. I invite the Minister to present to the House blueprints for the social welfare system for the next ten to 15 years showing how she intends to deal with its anomalies, make it inclusive and ensure Deputies will not be pointing out further poverty traps and exclusions in ten years and having to give our constituents history lessons to explain the reason they do not qualify for a payment.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of spouses from the social welfare allowance will have a significant effect on families in the small number of cases in which it is applied. Let us take the example of a family with three children where the husband is in low paid employment earning &euro;300 per week and which is renting a house. If the wife applies for social welfare allowance, the family could receive rent supplement because the household limit is &euro;317. When this is withdrawn, the husband will have no option but to give up work and go on to welfare permanently. The measure will propel people into a poverty trap.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boyle made an interesting remark on poverty proofing policies, an issue I frequently address. As I do not want to take the freedom of information route, I will fight the Minster on the floor of the House to find out the reason the data in this regard are never produced. Where is the poverty proofing? Will the Department produce evidence to show how and by what means policies are poverty proofed against unemployment and poverty traps, such as those which will be created as a result of the Minister's mean-spirited, niggardly cuts? These cuts have captured a group of people who need to be helped, given a leg up and pushed the extra couple of yards into sustainable employment, from which they can progress.</P>
      <P>These are the reasons we vehemently oppose sections 9 to 12, inclusive. We must fight to reverse the measures on diet supplements and the MIAB and the exclusion of spouses from social welfare allowance. We must find the &euro;56 million and put it back into the pot. While it may, as the Minister stated, amount to a small sum the context of a budget of &euro;11.2 billion, it is vital to the people who receive it. This is the reason we ask the Minister to accept these amendments, which have been made in the spirit of inclusiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address the nub of the Bill and its savage cuts. The Minister may smile but they are savage. The amendments attempt to reverse the attack on the contributions paid by workers. The reduction in the maximum duration of unemployment benefit from 390 days to 312 days is a cut. The number of paid contributions will increase from 39 to 52 and the period in which claims for unemployment benefit and disability benefit are linked to a previous claim will increase from 13 to 26 weeks. These three measures will diminish the rights of working people who have paid contributions.</P>
      <P>The worst of the Minister's cutbacks is the measure restricting rent assistance, which is deplorable. As I stated on Committee Stage, the Minister has been led up the garden path by her officials. Her proposals were not considered or examined. When the Minister for Finance informed her he wanted savings of &euro;58 million and these proposals were placed before her, she ran with them without teasing them out.</P>
      <P>It is a scandal that following their meeting with the Minister, the community welfare officers, who are the Minister's officials, wrote that the proposals will cause administrative chaos in the local authorities and make people homeless, yet the Minister has not changed them. This is despicable given that the numbers on housing lists have doubled from 27,000 to more than 50,000 since the Government took office. The Minister expects people to wait for six months before applying for rent supplement from the community welfare officer. She has told them they can go to the housing officer of the local authority, as if they will somehow be able to give them a house.</P>
      <P>We have huge waiting lists throughout the country. The Labour Party demands that anybody on the housing list will be considered for rent supplement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>

We also want the concerns expressed by the community welfare officers to be taken on board. The 16 cuts are an attack on vulnerable people, namely, the disabled and social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>Having spoken to community welfare officers, I will not hesitate to say the system is abused. I do not know whether abuse takes place in 1% or 50% of cases. None of the Minister's measures have anything to do with establishing a process for dealing with alleged abuse. Instead of addressing the issue, she has introduced measures which will hit ordinary people with no home over their heads and no hope of getting a house.</P>

      <P>The social insurance fund is in credit to the tune of &euro;1,500 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect &ndash; the true figure is &euro;1,628 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Minister introduced this measure for the sake of saving &euro;2.5 million? The social insurance fund is an insurance scheme, which operates in a similar manner to car insurance, where companies are expected to honour policies and pay claims, whether it be for windscreen breakages or whatever. What has the Minister done? Why is she taking so much pressure and getting so much flak throughout the country for &euro;2.5 million? In 2002 the Minister for Finance, the man from Kildare who wears the white shirt, took &euro;650 million to balance the books before the election. This is now going to be the election fund because with &euro;1,500 million the social insurance fund will be raided again close to the time of the election. The public will be told: &ldquo;This is your money. We are spending it now instead of in the future.&rdquo;  This is wrong.</P>
      <P>I would not have minded if the Minister was taking the &euro;57 million that caused her so much criticism &ndash; as Deputy Ryan has said, the rent supplement, the crèche supplement and all of the 16 cutbacks. If it would have saved the Minister's face, I would have supported it on the basis&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have supported that and it would not have caused a row in this House if they took &euro;57 million out of the social insurance fund. However, it is wrong. As the Ceann Comhairle has said, this Bill deals with disability benefit, invalid pension, maternity benefit, etc. This is money paid for by people into their own fund and it is wrong. I know the Minister will say this is only going to affect new people. However, it is going to affect people already in the scheme who might get sick and who will not qualify at a later stage. I am not going to talk about the 16 cuts. I am only disappointed we did not get to the next amendment, as regards what has happened, although we may still get to it.</P>
      <P>Do Members know how much interest the Government got on that fund last year? The Minister did not give us that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the number of people it is going to affect. I cannot understand what is going on, but I know this is going to be the slush fund for the PD-Fianna Fáil election alliance. I do not know who is leading this Government now. It looks like the Progressive Democrats because they have the right-wing policies. They have no social conscience. Will the Minister say why it is necessary to get herself into so much trouble for &euro;2.5 million? What is the plan? The way she is going about it is wrong. It is going to affect many people. I do not like the fact that people who are paying into the scheme are being affected. People are paying their social insurance and it is wrong that they are being affected in this way to save &euro;2.5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the other speakers. These amendments are an attempt to try to stop these cuts. They are cuts that in some cases, as Deputy Ryan said, affect working people who have worked for their rightful entitlements. These are being undermined. Other speakers referred to rent assistance and the effect that is going to have. No matter what the Minister says, Members will get people in their clinics who will have left home, whatever their unfortunate circumstances, and find themselves in crisis situations. Community welfare officers will be contacted who will respond that they are working within guidelines. Members will have to try to use persuasion so that people may be allowed into accommodation. Some of them will have left abusive homes or whatever. Deputies will have dealt with such cases down through the years.</P>
      <P>These cuts are wrong in an equitable society where the objective is to narrow the gap between rich and poor. However, the Minister and people on the Government benches will insist these are positive initiatives. They are not positive. They attack the new poor in society, the people on the margins, on low incomes, the working poor, etc. These groups will suffer from these cuts. Behind the cuts is the mindset that the system is being abused. We have heard this for years. One can make a comparison between these cuts and what is happening to the rich in society. Are similar cuts being imposed on the people who make millions in profits from investing in offshore accounts and so on? There is no equivalent savage attack on those elements of society. It is always the most vulnerable, the ones that the media find most popular to attack in terms of abuses in the system. The amount of social welfare abuse is infinitesimal by comparison to white collar crime. These amendments are being put forward in an attempt to give a different vision of how society should progress. Unfortunately, we are not going to win this vote, but we are putting on record that these initiatives are the wrong direction for society to take. It is widening the gap between rich and poor and it is making things more difficult for working people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">

      <P>Historically the social insurance fund has not been in surplus. It has had many of its payments made by taxation and there might even be an argument that the current surplus should go into the general taxation account to make those payments. There is &euro;1.5 billion in the fund and the fact the Government is adding to it in this budget by raising the ceiling and by having PRSI reckonable in terms of benefits-in-kind means there is a slush fund available for future use. In that context &euro;56 million in cuts are being made, only in a book-keeping sense. If there was an argument that resources were being targeted it might be acceptable. There is no evidence that resources are being targeted. If there was an argument that the system was being reformed, it might be acceptable. There is no evidence of reform of the system. There seems to have been a <i>quid pro quo</i> that if a Department was to get any increase in any category it had to come with the &euro;56 million in cuts first. That is not an acceptable way to put an Estimate together or to present a Social Welfare Bill to this House. On all these grounds the Opposition is united in opposing what is proposed within the Bill.</P>

The Minister is changing the criteria under which people can qualify for unemployment or disability benefit. She is changing the criteria by which a person uses his or her stamps to get a payment when it is needed most, at times of sickness, unemployment or whatever. Up to now one could get that payment on the basis of having paid 39 weeks in the relevant tax year.</P>

Anyone who was out sick for a couple of weeks in 2002 and who may have to be out for a prolonged period, will not get this payment if he or she does not have the 52 stamps for 2002.

If that is the case it is going to have enormous consequences for a vast array of people. When it is considered that it is only going to save &euro;2.5 million, in effect it means only about 2,000 people will be affected by it.

    <Title>Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003 [  Seanad ]  : Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)&nbsp;Upon the enactment of this Bill the Minister shall have the power to make an order obliging an insurance company to reduce premiums in line with savings achieved as a result of the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I can get agreement from the Tánaiste on the amendment. Will she agree that the Bill is essentially and principally about reducing the cost of insurance premiums? During the Seanad debate she said that the objective of the Bill was to tackle the delivery cost by way of speedier compensation for genuine claimants while reducing the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses alike. While I agree with this, unless the Bill does exactly that, it will be useless and all the drafting, amending and debating will count for nothing. The crisis will continue for business people, employers, motorists, especially young motorists, and people in the voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>This amendment strengthens the Bill. It gives it considerable backbone and ensures that it does exactly what it says. In other words, it will reduce the cost of insurance premiums. It will also give statutory control over the cost of insurance, which is long overdue. We all agree on the excessive cost of insurance, which is obvious from the debate on all sides of the House. If the Tánaiste is serious about the issue, which I believe she is, I have no doubt she will accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The amendment is mild-mannered, so to speak, because it does not say the Tánaiste must make an order to oblige insurance companies but that she may make an order, or she certainly has the power to make an order, obliging insurance companies to reduce premiums. It also states that insurance companies should reduce premiums in line with savings achieved as a result of the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. As it is a reasonable amendment, it should be acceptable to the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies have shown no inclination to date to reduce insurance costs despite calls not just from leaders of industry and unions but also from the Tánaiste and a host of other political and business representatives. In the face of a lack of co-operation from the insurance industry, this strengthening of the Bill is necessary. It is essential to control the price of insurance. I would be concerned that, without the amendment, the situation will continue exactly as it is at present and there will be no improvement for the people to whom we referred during our contributions. Will the Tánaiste to accept the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Tánaiste on being close to the finishing post in establishing the PIAB. It is fair to say that the issue has been on the table for the past six and a half years during which time our constituents have been crying out for action in terms of motor and small business insurance in particular. I had experience of this as a community director. I welcome the fact that we have at last reached this stage, even though we should have been at this stage four or five years ago.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Morgan and support the thrust of his amendment. According to reports today, the Blue Book on the insurance industry which shows the profits of insurance companies from premiums over the period 2001 to 2002 has been published and it seems there has been a significant upturn in profitability. The kind of lament we have been hearing through the years at Question Time when we discussed this matter does not seem to apply any more. The public will hope to see improvements arising from this. The market is changing.</P>
      <P>I am deputising for our spokesperson, Deputy Howlin, whose mother, sadly, died earlier this week. I was not present during other debates on the Bill but the Minister's colleague mentioned on Second Stage the new court rules and other improvements that would be coming into effect and combine with the operation of the PIAB. I congratulate the Minister on the appointment of the interim board and her attempts to drive the process, although I wish the issue of motor insurance would come onto the agenda more quickly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morgan is right to suggest that the Department should have some direct ability to stop the gouging of citizens through insurance. What is wrong with the market? Under my own portfolio, there is talk of market failure in the area of broadband but there seems to have been incredible market failure in the area of insurance, which is damaging us. We need to do something about this. While the new board will be a help, perhaps there should be a benchmark under which the Minister could say she wanted to see savings translated into lower premiums for small business people and in motor and house insurance. During her period of office matters have become intolerable and the problem has contributed significantly to Ireland's loss of competitiveness. We must try to change this. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is possible to enshrine compellability as Deputy Morgan requests but if it is possible, I fully support it. The point of the Bill was to reduce insurance costs. There is no point in this new board being in place if the insurance companies will still hoodwink us into believing there is no basis for reducing costs. It gives me no pleasure to say this but we cannot trust them. I say this taking into consideration all the evidence heard by the committee inquiring into the high cost of insurance and the information contained in the MIAB report, in which it is pointed out that the insurance companies were one of the only interested parties which refused to co-operate with the investigation. We cannot allow ourselves to go further with this unless we have some mechanism to compel the insurance industry to pass on whatever savings are achieved by this new board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept this amendment for a number of reasons. I am not a believer in price controls. Competition in the market drives down prices for all consumers, drives up quality and leads to more innovation and better value for money. Even if I were so disposed, however, I am prohibited by an EU directive, Council Directive 92/49/EEC, from controlling prices in the insurance market. What the Government can do, and is doing in this case, is to seek to bring about change that will affect the operation of the insurance market.</P>
      <P>I share the views expressed by Deputies here and elsewhere that we do not have a properly functioning insurance market. However, there are some hopeful signs. Prices are on the way down &ndash; we can see from the recent CSO publication on inflation that the reduction in insurance costs played a significant role in the overall reduction in inflation in the economy over the past month. I hope this will continue. There is much anecdotal evidence to suggest that consumers are beginning at last to see a reduction in prices.</P>
      <P>The publication last week by the IFSRA of the outcome of its survey shows that despite large variations in the prices being quoted, competition is in operation. It is to be hoped that following the enactment of this Bill and the realisation of the proposals of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Ireland will be more attractive to operators, especially niche players. I am not certain we will attract any major new insurer into the market because it is after all a small market of only 4 million people but I am optimistic. A number of niche players are seriously considering providing a service in this market and I hope to meet some of them next month, both in Dublin and overseas. That is the greatest guarantee we can give that prices will come down. Increased competition will drive down the price of insurance, as it has done in many other markets, with the radical reform measures being put in place.</P>
      <P>I must take this opportunity to express my sympathy to Deputy Howlin and his family on the sudden and sad death of his mother earlier this week. The Deputy has taken a great interest in this area for many years and I know he would have wished to be here. I extend my sympathy to him on my own behalf and that of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share in the expression of sympathy for Deputy Howlin on the death of his mother.</P>
      <P>I would be delighted if the Tánaiste's comments about the insurance market were true but doubt that is the case. No longer than a few hours ago in the House we heard the leader of the Labour Party advise the Taoiseach that there was an over-supply of step-down beds, or nursing home places, in this city, yet there has been no reduction in the cost of such services to the public or the health boards. To depend entirely on the market as a price control mechanism is not the best course of action.</P>
      <P>I carried out some research to find out whether any EU directives or regulations would prohibit the provisions of the amendment. Clearly, however, it was not as exhaustive as the Department's research. I notice there is no bar on putting in place a price ceiling on alcohol and several other commodities and goods. Therefore, I am surprised to hear there is a directive prohibiting this in the case of insurance. We should campaign on this issue in Europe in order that we may better deal with the cost of insurance. I would still like to see a measure giving the Minister more control over prices rather than just calling on the insurance companies to reduce them. So far we have clearly seen that they have no inclination to reduce their prices and I do not think the Bill will change this.</P>
      <P>If the estimate of 40% for legal costs in litigation is delivered upon, who is to say the insurance companies will pass this back to the motorist, the business person or those in the voluntary sector? Who is to say all those sectors will not continue to be ripped off? There is no guarantee whatsoever. I am disappointed to hear the Minister has found a directive such as this. Is the directive definitive in terms of what she cannot do? I thought I detected an element of doubt in her voice when she mentioned it. Could she make matters a little clearer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>I should not be provocative in the run-up to Christmas. The directive referred to is Council Directive 92/49/EEC of 18 June 1992. Article 29 prohibits price control in the insurance market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any other country got a PIAB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance market in many European countries is often paid for from the social welfare system. It is a different system from that which operates here. There are other models in the world where a PIAB type forum exists for settling claims. For over 20 years we have discussed an alternative to the courts-based system. When I first came to Leinster House I recall discussions taking place with the former Minister, Mr. Desmond O'Malley, about the possibility of reform in this area. One of the suggestions was to end jury trials and to end the need for two senior counsel in personal injury cases. When that happened the one senior counsel doubled his or her fee. Since the junior counsel receives two thirds of a senior counsel's fees, the fees increased. None of that has made much of a difference. This proposal which has come about after much consultation and discussion will play a significant role in helping to drive down the cost of insurance because it will drive down the delivery cost of compensation substantially. When fully functioning, it is estimated the PIAB will cost approximately &euro;7 million to &euro;10 million per year. Effectively, &euro;8 million will be paid by the insurance industry. That is substantially less than the &euro;340 million paid last year in legal and other costs in personal injury cases. Clearly, that will have an impact on the cases taken together with the measures being introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the area of fraud, exaggerated claims and so on. Hopefully, all of that will help open up the market to new operators, particularly to niche players in the motor, public and employee liability, and property sectors.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept Deputy Morgan's amendment because of an EU prohibition on my doing so but also I do not believe it is the right way to proceed. We do not have price control on alcohol. In advance of the 1997 election, an attempt was made to control the price of alcohol. These things do not work. If we lift the control order, invariably after a couple of months the price shoots up. The market has to be able to regulate the price. We have a below cost selling ban, through the groceries order, but that is the only order of that type that exists in Ireland on price control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Tánaiste is not in a position to accept the amendment and would not be inclined to do so. My understanding is that the regulation controlling the cost of the ceiling price on alcohol is still available, it is just the political instincts of those in power choose not to use it. This Bill will prove useless to all the categories outlined, unless it delivers on lower premiums. I am concerned that as the Bill stands it may not do this.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment. Its purpose is to delete the definition of &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;. This is because there is no reference in subsequent sections to things being prescribed.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)&nbsp;For the purposes of this Act, a claimant and a respondent may nominate a third party to act on his or her behalf in relation to any matter that comes before the Board under the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I made the case that there is a great expectation that the claimant will be in a position to fill in the necessary form without being able to rely on the third party intervention of a legal adviser, a brother or sister, or any category of person in respect of helping him or her in making the claim. If it is a paper-based exercise that has to be gone through, fundamental decisions will have to be made arising from the completion of that form which may have a subsequent impact on the level of award the claimant may receive. Parking liability at this stage will ensure it is even more important that people complete the application properly without unwittingly making any particular mistake. If an incapacitated, illiterate or blind person needs direct third party intervention from family members or professionals, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that is the case and, also when the claimant subsequently goes to court, if that is the outcome of the assessment and liability becomes an issue, that he or she will not have disadvantaged himself or herself arising from the initial application to the PIAB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The general content of amendment No. 6 adheres closely to the presentation by my Fine Gael colleague. There is a fundamental problem here. Clearly, the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, indicated it was important to remove the legal profession from the process so that there would not be a legal aspect to the plaintiff, assessment, respondent and decision procedure. There are fundamental basic rights involved. I have sought to address them in my amendment No. 6 which proposes that the board should communicate through a solicitor if the plaintiff has asked such a person to act for him or her in dealings with the board. Deputy Hogan's point is accurate. Given that sometimes we have to give information on medical card forms, housing applications, passport applications and so on we may well be asked in our representational capacity to fill out those forms.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the Irish Human Rights Commission is concerned at the Bill's attempt to remove the right to personal representation. We had this discussion many years ago in regard to trade union representation. I believe workers are entitled in all circumstances to professional personal representation, if not collective representation. It is interesting to note that people were thinking about this when the former Deputy, Mr. Desmond O'Malley, was Minister for Industry and Commerce. We wanted to get out of the need for barristers in straightforward cases but it appears there is a fundamental right, if a person so wishes to have a solicitor to act for him or her. That is related to the fact that later in the Bill, the Labour Party and Fine Gael tried to provide that representatives of the legal profession would be on the board because there are aspects which may need a legal interpretation. If someone was to want personal professional representation, it would seem preferable that such would be the case. We saw the complexity of some of the issues which arose in the settlement of cases of institutional abuse. The cases before this board will be simpler but in most cases people feel that having professional representation would help at that stage.</P>
      <P>As public representatives, we make representations for people who, some might say, could perfectly well do so themselves, but we often represent people who lack the necessary skills to make the best case for themselves. We act as their advocates although we might not have professional expertise in the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>The right to legal representation is a fundamental aspect of this legislation. The Tánaiste is determined to ensure that this facility is not made available. I cannot see how it would damage the general thrust of the procedure at the heart of the Bill if someone wanted to have a professional legal representative to help them initiate a claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed in great detail on Committee Stage but we must come back to it at every opportunity and try to get the Tánaiste to see sense.</P>
      <P>I have no hidden agenda. I will say what I think and will not be hoodwinked by any organisation or interest group. My interest is in the protection of the claimant. I cannot see how the claimant's interest will be protected if we follow the route the Tánaiste has set out. It is a basic human right to deal with one's own business or to nominate a third party to deal with it on one's behalf. No arm of the State should refuse to deal with an individual or his or her representative.</P>
      <P>Earlier in her political life when the Tánaiste was a mere Deputy and dealt with representations, I am sure people consulted her on almost every issue. I am sure she can remember how busy she was at that time. We Deputies are busy, not because we deal with legislation but because we deal with members of the public and try to represent them in situations where they cannot represent themselves. Many lack the necessary knowledge or confidence to deal with boards and bodies. If we do not bear this in mind, it will come back to haunt us. I do not wish to be accused of not highlighting this aspect at this time.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste's proposal is intended to save money. A claimant, even one who is expert in everything, should not have to go to the expense of putting a claim together without being compensated for that. The Bill makes no provision for compensation for a claimant's effort in putting a claim together. That is not fair. The claimant must deal with a situation which is not of his or her own making and should, therefore, be compensated. If one follows that line there is no logic in pursuing the argument that legal professionals would create extra expense. The expenses of the claimant should be met in any event.</P>
      <P>During the debate on Committee Stage the Tánaiste said she could not understand the reason people travel such long distances to see solicitors about almost everything.</P>

      <P>When a case has been assessed by the assessment board, where does the Tánaiste think a claimant will go to have it checked out, if not to his or her solicitor? Can the Tánaiste not accept this fact of life and incorporate it into the legislation, with protections against runaway claims for legal fees?</P>

      <P>These amendments go to the heart of what we are talking about. There is no point in Opposition Deputies talking up the need to reform insurance and to establish an effective personal injuries board and then seek, through various amendments, to fillet its effectiveness before it is established. If we do as the Deputies opposite suggest and provide for legal representation, as night follows day the kind of legal bills we have seen in recent years will be repeated. There is nothing stopping anyone from engaging a lawyer or anyone else, but they will not be paid for this. This assessment board will not deal with lawyers or others. It will deal directly with the claimant. It will be a claimant friendly body.</P>
      <P>Other boards, for example the Employment Appeals Tribunal, hold actual hearings and people are often represented by lawyers, although that was not the case in the early days. However, even there we do not provide for legal fees. We will not provide for legal representation in the way suggested. If we do, there will be no point in establishing this body. The Bill provides for assistance to be given to vulnerable citizens and minors, for example. It is right that we should do that. If a claimant wishes, a copy of the correspondence will be forwarded to a solicitor at the same time as it is sent to the claimant. However, the whole purpose of the Bill is to establish an organisation on a statutory basis which will help to settle claims in a cost-effective and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I have said many times during the debate on this Bill. It takes six times longer in Ireland for a genuine claimant to get what they are entitled to than it does in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, and barristers are involved in 70% of personal injuries cases in Ireland as opposed to 4% in the United Kingdom. One of the reasons insurance costs are so high in Ireland is that we are all paying for that system through high premiums. This is neither sustainable nor necessary and it will not be provided for. No matter how often people try to argue this point with me &ndash; many of my close friends have tried to do so &ndash; I cannot concede it. I feel strongly on this matter and so does the Government. To do this would fillet the legislation before it is enacted and make the PIAB completely ineffective. It would not be cost effective and would do nothing to reduce the huge cost of delivering a claimant's entitlement quickly.</P>
      <P>If someone has an accident at work, his or her first call will not be to the PIAB but to his or her employer. The first claim will be to the employer or to the employer's insurance company. It is only if the matter is not resolved at that level that it will go forward to the PIAB. Many cases are settled at that level every day of the week and we hear no more about them because they do not need to go down the legal route. People here have a great deal of experience of this. At the outset when I was appointing the interim board, I considered having representatives of the legal profession. If one is representing a body, one must wear one's representational hat but there are people there with legal expertise. One of the appointees to the interim board is a barrister who is also a medical doctor, Denis Cusack, and the other is a solicitor from the Revenue Commissioners, Francis Cooke. Therefore, there are at least two people with legal expertise who are not and should not be there in a representational capacity. This places a great onus on people who might seek to represent the Law Society or the Bar Council, or one person who might represent both, and would not lead to the proper and effective functioning of the PIAB.</P>
      <P>I have also considered a suggestion from Deputy Conor Lenihan that an Oireachtas Member be appointed in a representative role. Senator O'Toole is there as a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. We should not politicise this board and to put somebody in, from whatever side of the House, would politicise it. I decided against this, although I would be better disposed to putting a public representative on it than anyone wearing a particular professional hat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to expose the Tánaiste's hypocrisy or lack of definition on this issue. On the one hand, she is trying to keep lawyers out of the system, with which we all agree as that was the original objective but on the other hand, she has succeeded in bringing legal representation back into the equation in another section of the Bill. She is against legal representation in this section of the Bill in order to give fairness to the citizen and we want to ensure that people are treated fairly, cheaply and efficiently. There is a very important issue whereby people who have an accident through no fault of their own get help to make a proper application when liability is parked. This is a crucial point because people are going into a system where liability is not an issue at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is even more important that the citizen or the claimant would be able to put his or her case well in the paper-based approach through the PIAB. Insurance companies represented on the board which will decide that liability is an issue for them and that they are going to fight it all the way will be armed with all the necessary engineering, medical and legal expertise and the claimant will be obliged at his or her own cost to fight the Big Brother insurance company. The insurance company will be able to pass on its costs in the form of higher premiums or discharge its obligation corporately rather than individually.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste mentioned on Committee Stage that there would be a helpline for the PIAB. We did not hear the detail of what help would be required from the board. It is very important that this is beefed up considerably to ensure that the citizen is not unfairly treated in this application. The right of representation as mentioned by Deputy Broughan in reference to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights could come back to haunt the Tánaiste in the context of this section, if someone takes a test case. We are highlighting these issues to tease them out and ensure that we get the balance right. I accept that the Tánaiste has a view; I have a different one but I share her view on ensuring that we have a cost-effective, efficient system in which litigation is as cheap and efficient as possible but is nevertheless fair to everybody. I will not press the amendment because we have made our point very carefully but the Tánaiste has set herself on a particular course and has unfortunately contradicted herself in another section on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Tánaiste is afraid she will open a Pandora's box that would devastate the Bill and bring us back to square one but in our amendment we were focusing on the narrow remit whereby somebody seeking professional representation in his or her dealings would be accorded responses from the board. That does not seem to be available. The broad point still holds that liability comes in and a claimant may be strung along for quite a while and would finally have to go for professional help if the case went to the courts when he or she took on the full might of the insurance company. The point is well made and I can understand to some extent where the Tánaiste stands, given the lengthy debates we have had on this, the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and so on over the years. She wants to cut the knot of the very expensive litigation which accounts for approximately 40% of awards, but at the basic level this is a fundamental right. Deputy Hogan is correct in saying that it could come back to haunt us.</P>

      <P>In page 11, line 29, after &ldquo;claim&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after liability is admitted by the respondent in open correspondence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is concerned with whether liability should be an issue in the context of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. In the interest of the citizen and the claimant, liability should be decided when it becomes an issue before the board. It would be a cause of difficulty if the issue was to be parked at the time of an applications for assessment because if a case subsequently goes to court and the question of liability becomes a major issue, it puts the claimant at a major disadvantage later, given that he or she does not know where he or she stands in regard to liability, especially as a long period of time might have elapsed while a case was under consideration by the board. Liability should be admitted by a respondent in open correspondence at the earliest possible stage after it reaches the Personal Injuries Assessment Board stage.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste introduced an amendment to section 12 on Committee Stage, which allows the claimant to seek an order for inspection and preservation of the site of an accident. This would allow her to accept this amendment. If she does so it will effectively bring the issue of liability into play at an earlier stage. The Tánaiste expressed reservations about doing this on Committee Stage, but she might have reflected further on the matter in the meantime.</P>
      <P>If liability could be resolved at the earliest possible stage, it would give more certainty in respect of the outcome of cases and achieve earlier settlements. It would result in a cheaper, more efficient and speedier resolution of cases rather than having to go to court. Insurance companies have considerable resources at their disposal, which a claimant would not have, except by way of incurring large expense. In fairness to a claimant and to achieving a speedy resolution of a case at the earliest possible stage, liability should not be parked at the stage of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this issue on Committee Stage. Having reflected on it in the meantime, I still believe the issue of liability in this context is a mess. The way in which it will be dealt with is unfair to the claimant. It is very unfair for a claimant to be under the false impression that his or her application will be assessed by the PIAB and a conclusion reached only to find that the respondent can withdraw admittance of liability. This issue can give rise to two scenarios. One is where a respondent is liable, takes a chance and then weighs up the odds in respect of the outcome, and if it is not to his or her satisfaction, everything is thrown into an ensuing court case. An interpretation of such a scenario is that the facility to park the liability issue means a respondent can be treated in a softly, softly manner at the expense of the claimant. In a sense, the respondent is being facilitated to abuse the mechanisms of the State.</P>
      <P>The other scenario is that a respondent is not liable but he or she will take a chance because it might be worth it, given that an award decided by the PIAB might be less costly than it would be to pursue the claim in court. Many bodies have put forward the case that this is one of the reasons for the high cost of insurance. It is only one of the reasons that claims are not being fought and pursued by insurance companies in instances where they fully believe that the claim is false.</P>
      <P>What is the Tánaiste doing to address this practice? It is being pointed out to her that in this legislation she is facilitating fraudulent and false claims. She referred on Committee Stage to the fact that insurance companies might find it cheaper to go this route, but that is wrong. We should be going the route of rooting out everything that is wrong. If something is fraudulent, it should be pursued until it is proved to be wrong. That would eliminate fraudulent claims, as would awareness among members of the public that this is what is happening. If a claim is false, it should not be allowed to proceed. Legislation should not give protection to a false claim. That is what is happening here.</P>

      <P>A related amendment No. 20 in my name states: &ldquo;In page 12, line 12, after &ldquo;states&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in open correspondence to the claimant that the respondent accepts liability for the claim and states&rdquo;. Amendment No. 21, also in my name, is also closely related.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues that the Bill, as currently framed, could result in a grave injustice to a claimant. An investigation on the liability issue could end up being expensive and it would certainly need to be done rapidly. A claimant should be required only to show his or her hand in this regard if a respondent is admitting liability, but there is no mechanism to recover the cost involved if a claimant proceeds, investigates liability and subsequently accepts an assessment. There is a fundamental problem in the way the procedure in this regard would operate under the board. The degree of freedom given to a respondent would seem to allow a situation to develop where a serious injustice could happen. The claimant should know very early in the process if liability is being accepted as this will achieve the purpose for which the board is being established, which is to bring claims to a conclusion. What is proposed is of fundamental importance and I urge the Tánaiste to reconsider her position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat all I said on this matter on Committee Stage. If liability has to be admitted before one can go through the PIAB process, that process would not work because nobody would use it. If somebody is seriously suggesting that an insurance company would use the PIAB process, incur the costs associated with it and then decide that it has no faith in it and that it wanted to open up the liability issue, I do not accept that. I do not believe anybody who would pay for the PIAB process would agree to an assessment being done by the PIAB and then subsequently decide to make liability an issue in the context of court proceedings.</P>
      <P>As for fraudulent claims, I have gone on record on many occasions urging insurance companies to take a more medium-term view of these matters rather than the short-term view they often take. They regularly took the view that in some cases it is quicker and less expensive to settle, rather than go down the costly route of court proceedings. Indeed many of them did not get encouraging results from the courts process. That has changed in recent times. We have had some excellent decisions from the Judiciary in recent weeks on fraudulent claims.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, succeeds in having his legislation on fraudulent and exaggerated claims passed, there will be a significant change among insurers. We will pursue at every level those who make fraudulent and exaggerated claims. The new legislation will ensure that claims fall, except in exceptional circumstances, where someone either exaggerates a claim or makes a fraudulent claim. That legislation will go a long way towards rooting out the high level of insurance fraud which we all believe exists in Ireland. The good news is that the number of claims is down substantially in recent times and will continue to decrease.</P>
      <P>If liability were to be admitted at the outset, this legislation would not get off the ground. The most appropriate thing to do is to park the liability issue. The PIAB will not deal with any legal issues, nor should it do so. It is not equipped to do so. It is there simply to decide on the entitlement of someone who has suffered an injury as a result of an accident. The PIAB exists to do nothing more or less than that. It is not there to deal with liability or other legal issues that rightly belong in the realm of the courts.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to make more exact the obligations of the PIAB to a claimant, ensuring that in advance of the application being made to the PIAB, the board would set out clearly to the claimant what is actually involved in the process, and what the claimant is becoming involved in by making an application. If the Tánaiste does not wish to accept that a third party intervention is required in order to assist someone making an application for assessment, then the obligation should be on the PIAB to ensure the claimant is fully aware of the process in which he or she will become engaged.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment. It would give clarity to the responsibilities of the PIAB to the claimant. It would not affect liability, any reference to which the Tánaiste objects to in amendments. Liability would remain parked. The amendment would mean that the claimant could get some advice before making an assessment claim. It would allow the claimant full knowledge of what was involved and what type of assistance would be required by the claimant if an application was made. It would give clarity to that position and put a certain onus back on the PIAB to ensure that that was the case.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept this amendment, one reason being that by means of paragraph 6(<i>b</i>), it invites claimants to seek legal advice. Deputies have been circulated with a draft copy of the layperson's guide which the PIAB has produced in consultation with other parties. It makes quite clear that to which a claimant is entitled. Furthermore, the helpline referred to by Deputy Hogan in an earlier amendment, or at any rate in his response, will provide the advice called for in the amendment. There will be a duty of care on the PIAB towards vulnerable claimants, minors and others. Those provisions, along with the helpline, the assistance to be provided and the training the PIAB staff will get in dealing with citizens generally and vulnerable claimants in particular, will be more than adequate.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to write an amendment of this kind into the Bill. That it would encourage claimants to seek legal advice on matters giving rise to the relevant claim at the earliest possible opportunity is another reason I am not inclined to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste refers to vulnerable categories whom she wants to ensure are in no way disadvantaged when assessments are made. She referred to the helpline as one of the ways in which they might be assisted. I cannot see a vulnerable person using a PIAB helpline in any way. That is the reality we deal with. There are categories in our society who are vulnerable under the widest possible definition of vulnerability and who unfortunately will not do anything without getting someone else to act on their behalf. That is the reason in an earlier amendment I tried to address the issue without wanting to get into the expensive machinery of professional groups being involved at an early stage but in order to give the claimant in the vulnerable category access to justice and access to the assessment board in a well-informed and appropriate manner. Once an application is made, the PIAB should write a letter to lay out the criteria to the claimant rather than having the claimant, particularly a vulnerable person, relying on finding out as he or she goes along.</P>

In addition to their insurance policy, in the event of a claim, they will need to pay for all the medical, engineering or legal professional advice. The person with the largest cheque book will get the best representation. If that is what the Tánaiste wants, that is what she is getting.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;disturbed by the dangers and exploitation faced by children today as highlighted in the recent RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme;</P>
    <P Just="Center">calls on the Government to expand the role and function of the central vetting unit, and commit the necessary financial and human resources to the unit, to ensure that:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;all health board employees, or employees at any facility or service in receipt of health board funding, are vetted before taking up employment that gives them substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;all teachers and all other school staff, either full or part-time, are vetted before taking up employment;</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognises the success of the central vetting unit both in eliminating all backlogs in processing vetting requests and in reducing the average time to process a request to approximately one week;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes the continued implementation of the formal agreement between the health boards and the Garda Síochána to ensure the vetting of prospective employees in the health service and in certain facilities funded by the health boards who would have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes that Garda vetting is and has been available to children's residential centres and special care units for many years;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;endorses the decision to establish a working group on Garda vetting to examine the complex issues associated with enhancing the nature and extent of the services of the central vetting unit and looks forward to the outcome of its deliberations soon;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;approves the Government's commitment to supporting the Garda Síochána in every way possible in tackling crime, and particularly the abuse, sexual or otherwise, of children, and also by facilitating and promoting a programme of legislative change and reform within the criminal justice system, in order to meet the challenges of present day crime;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;commends the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, which provides for a package of measures aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation by, <i>inter alia,</i> making it is an offence for any person to knowingly possess child pornography for the purpose of distributing, publishing, exporting, selling or showing it, punishable on conviction on indictment by up to 14 years imprisonment;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;welcomes the obligation under the Sex Offenders Act 2001 that requires a convicted sex offender to inform his prospective employer of the fact of the conviction and that failure to do so is an offence attracting a maximum penalty of up to five years imprisonment;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;commends the introduction, as provided for in the Sex Offenders Act 2001, of a notification procedure or tracking system for all convicted sex offenders, which extends to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes that the criminal records of all persons convicted in relation to crimes perpetrated against children and vulnerable adults, whether of a sexual nature or not, are available to the central vetting unit during the process of vetting; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognises that vetting is not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for posts and that there will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage and in ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</P>

      <P>I consider that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, dealt in an informed and open manner yesterday evening with the legitimate issues raised in relation to vetting and child protection generally. However, I would like to reiterate some fundamental issues. The Opposition motion essentially calls for two things: first, the extension of Garda vetting to organisations not currently encompassed by existing arrangements; and, second, the incorporation, within the Garda central vetting unit, of an entirely new vetting register akin to the one in Northern Ireland. Once the central vetting unit had become fully operational and all its backlogs had been cleared, it was always envisaged that the remit to the unit would be extended on a phased basis to other groups. This was because it was recognised that there were good grounds for extending the vetting arrangements to additional organisations.</P>
      <P>Although expanding the provision of vetting services clearly has resource implications, it would be wrong to suggest that it is simply a question of providing additional resources; there are also critical issues of policy and legislation. To illustrate this point, we can examine the possible legal difficulties surrounding the Opposition's proposal for a vetting register, which, it is proposed, would comprise information on individuals deemed unsuitable to work with children and vulnerable adults not on the grounds of criminality but on the grounds of employment history. Under current arrangements, Garda vetting is, in the main, carried out on an administrative basis. In particular, there is no statutory underpinning for the Garda Síochána to hold information from the Courts Service relating to convictions recorded against a person.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána operates this system on the basis of legal advice from the Attorney General, in which a clear distinction is drawn between so-called hard facts and soft facts. Hard facts are conviction information and information relating to pending prosecutions where the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering a file. Soft facts are allegations, rumours, complaints, unsavoury associates or generalised anti-social activity. The Attorney General has advised that, as a general rule, although hard facts are disclosable, soft facts are not. In giving this advice, I understand issues of natural justice apply. Although Deputy Enright certainly goes to great pains to introduce, for example, appeal mechanisms and so on in her proposal for a register, it is unlikely that these would be sufficient to overcome the aforementioned legal concerns of the Attorney General. Accordingly, the best thing to do would be to await the outcome of the deliberations of the working group which has been examining this and many other complex issues relating to vetting.</P>
      <P>I would now like to turn my attention to a number of very specific matters raised in the debate yesterday which I believe warrant a clear and unequivocal response. Questions were asked in relation to whom and under what circumstances the Garda Síochána would realise information about convicted sex offenders from the so-called sex offenders register. I can inform that House that, generally, the Garda Síochána does not release this kind of information as a matter of course but may do so on a case-by-case basis where exceptional circumstances warrant. The register is, above all, a mechanism by which the criminal justice agencies can manage risk and monitor convicted sex offenders with a view to preventing recidivism. It is not a means of advising the public at large of details of individuals included in the register.</P>
      <P>Although only tangentially related to the issues of the motion, it is only right to respond to some very inaccurate comments made yesterday about the incidence of and response to rape and sexual assault cases. Provisional Garda statistics showed an increase of 42% in the number of sexual assaults during the third quarter of 2003. However, it is worth noting that in the same period rape offences showed significant decreases, with rape of a female offences down by 20% and section 4 rape offences down by 64%. The overall figure for sexual assaults in the first nine months of this year shows an overall decrease of 5%, or 76 fewer instances over the same period last year. The Garda Commissioner has also stated there has been a 13% decrease in the number of sexual assaults for the 12 months ending 31 October 2003. In addition, overall, the category of sexual offences shows a decrease of 20% in the same period.</P>
      <P>Recent newspaper reports, reiterated yesterday, have claimed quite inaccurately that a woman is raped every 90 minutes. It has already been clarified in the House in response to questions that this figure is not taken from the Sexual Assault and Violence in Ireland report. The SAVI report published in March 2002 found that 7.8%, or almost 1 in 12, of female victims of adult sexual assault reported their experiences to the Garda Síochána. However, this figure refers to all forms of sexual assault, including, for example, indecent exposure. It is not restricted to the crime of rape. It is worth noting that one of the most common reasons for adults not to disclose some forms of sexual abuse was that they thought them to be too trivial. The reporting rate of 7.8% contained in the SAVI report refers to the lifetime experience of the women interviewed, rather than their experience taken on an annual basis. The claim that a woman is raped every 90 minutes, therefore, which is a newspaper extrapolation, cannot be relied upon.</P>
      <P>The eight recommendations made in the SAVI report have implications for a range of State agencies, not only those in the criminal justice sector. I am pleased to say considerable progress has been made in addressing these recommendations, in so far as they relate to the criminal justice area. The first two recommendations are that a comprehensive public awareness campaign on sexual violence be developed and that a range of information materials be developed and made available in appropriate settings and formats.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, in 1997 the Government established a national steering committee on violence against women. Part of the remit of the committee is to raise awareness of the various forms of violence against women, including rape and sexual assault. Since its establishment, the committee has conducted a number of campaigns concerning rape and sexual assault which are intended to increase public awareness of the issue as well as being measures to prevent such crimes. The campaign in 2002 highlighted the dangers of drug-assisted rape and the steps that could be taken by friends and other persons if such a situation occurred. The committee also launched an information leaflet for victims of rape and sexual assault in July 2003. As recently as yesterday, on behalf of the committee, I launched a poster campaign aimed at raising awareness of the general issues of violence against women in the run-up to Christmas.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that barriers to the disclosure of sexual violence should be addressed. Rape and sexual assault are serious offences which can have a traumatic effect on the victim. It is critically important that victims of such crimes continue to be encouraged to come forward and report these crimes to the Garda Síochána. I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána and, in particular, its domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit encourages, in liaison with the Rape Crisis Centre, early reporting by victims. In accordance with the victims' charter, all victims of sexual crime are to be treated with special sensitivity by the Garda Síochána. In this regard, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre is involved in the provision of training for gardaí on how best to deal with victims. In addition, the Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides for separate legal representation for victims of rape and other serious sexual offences in particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>The eight and final recommendation of the report is that a consultative committee on sexual violence be established. The National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women is composed of most, if not all, of the statutory and non-statutory organisations dealing with the issue of sexual violence and best placed to pursue the other recommendations contained in the SAVI report. I trust the record has now been set straight on some of these important matters.</P>

      <P>In my brief intervention to support the Minister of State's amendment I would like to expand on some of the issues raised in the debate so far. Much concern, rightly, is directed towards the Internet and its associated use in terms of child pornography. Child sexual abuse, child pornography and paedophile activities are not crimes that began with the Internet. There is no doubt, however, that the Internet, with its ease of communication and the relative anonymity of users, is both a tool that facilitates the rapid dissemination of child abuse images and a mutual support structure that allows paedophiles and others to pool information to avoid discovery, providing, in effect, new ways to commit old crimes. In Ireland there are robust measures at the disposal of the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system to deal with those involved in such activities. However, combating these crimes on-line, in particular, is a more complex issue, involving many jurisdictions and differing legal systems with little or no controls in place.</P>
      <P>Chat rooms such as those featured in the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme are only one of a number of ways of communicating on the Internet with others of a similar legal or illegal interest. I understand so-called Internet relay chat is not under the control of any single organisation and although some chat facilities are offered by Internet service providers and major web portals, the majority of web-based chat services are lower level hosted services set up and run by a wide range of organisations not part of the Internet service provider industry.</P>
      <P>Few chat rooms are hosted on Irish servers. Only one of the Internet service providers, an Internet Service Provider Association of Ireland, ISPAI, member, facilitates chat rooms, and only one in controlled conditions. For example, Eircom.net, the biggest single Internet service provider with more than 70% of the Irish market, took a corporate decision years ago not to host any chat rooms. There are no chat rooms on its servers.</P>
      <P>It is known that there is a defined hierarchy in trading in child abuse images on the Internet. Producers produce the images; traders may aid and abet the production of the images but are more involved in their distribution. Then there are collectors. There will also be an overlap between them. There are various techniques for evasion at every level.</P>
      <P>I understand images of victims are held only on national databases or by individual police forces, making their use in international investigations very difficult leading to duplication of work, waste of resources and inefficiencies in tracking down the perpetrators of the crimes and their victims. I further understand the G8 countries and the European Union are developing an international child pornography image database, to be operated by Europol and Interpol, which will be used by police authorities in member countries in the investigation of international child pornography cases. I am aware, too, that the Garda Síochána also holds a database of abuse images for investigative purposes. In general, it is strongly felt that a proliferation of such databases in private hands, even for research purposes, should be avoided.</P>
      <P>In recent times there has been a shift in emphasis in the investigation of these images away from concentration on gathering evidence for prosecution of the perpetrator to the identification, rescue and rehabilitation of child victims. The identification of children in the images is vitally important because it can lead to identification of the abuser and other children being or are at risk of being abused. In Ireland, the Copine Project, referred to last night, under Professor Max Taylor at the Department of Applied Psychology, University College Cork has done extensive work on the identification of child victims from Internet images. The project monitors the Internet for new images on a daily basis, and is an acknowledged centre of expertise worldwide. Professor Taylor has assisted governments and police forces worldwide in this area. I understand he also assisted the Canadian Government in its preparations for G8 discussions on the issue. He featured on the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and is a member of Ireland's Internet Advisory Board referred to last night by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>With regard to statutory controls in Ireland, we have broad-ranging and innovative provisions thanks, in the main, to the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 which amended the law relating to the protection of children against sexual abuse in two main areas: it created a new offence of trafficking children into, through or out of Ireland for the purpose of sexual exploitation, with penalties on conviction of up to life imprisonment; and it created several child pornography offences, with penalties on conviction ranging from five to 14 years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The Act defines child pornography for the first time in Irish law. The definition is wide-ranging, including representation of children, or persons depicted as children, engaged in explicit sexual activity, or children or such persons depicted as children witnessing any such activity by any person. It also includes images of children whose dominant characteristic is the depiction for a sexual purpose of their genital or anal regions. The definition includes images on the Internet as well as information on the Internet which indicates or implies that the child is available to be used for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</P>
      <P>The Act is generally held up as model legislation for dealing with child pornography and in practice is working well. It is justified on the basis that even possession of child pornography is not a victimless crime. If persons did not view, exchange or collect child pornography, there would be few victims. Much child pornography can involve the most horrendous abuse. It can also be justified on the basis of the effect it has on some persons who possess child pornography. Although not all persons who possess child pornography will necessarily go on to abuse children, many will, and it is almost certain that all child sex abusers possess child pornography which can be used as part of the process of grooming of children for abuse.</P>
      <P>At the international level, an EU framework decision on child pornography is in preparation. It will define constituent elements of criminal law common to all member states, including effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. It follows the decision on child pornography on the Internet, a measure under the EU Third Pillar, namely, co-operation in justice and home affairs, which invites member states to take a number of steps to increase the effectiveness of law enforcement against child pornography on the Internet and encourage collaboration between law enforcement authorities of the member states.</P>
      <P>Ireland's non-statutory controls comprise three measures to combat the illegal and harmful use of the Internet with particular emphasis on child protection, namely, the Internet Advisory Board, the hotline for reporting child pornography and the self-regulation system for the Internet service provider industry in the form of a code of practice and ethics. The Internet Advisory Board supervises a system of self-regulation by the Irish Internet service provider industry. In answer to questions raised in the House yesterday about the merits of self-regulation, I understand the board is conducting a review of the effectiveness of self-regulation after a number of years in operation.</P>
      <P>The hotline provides a central point of contact for members of the public who become aware of child pornography on the Internet in Ireland. The hotline attempts to identify the source and, if the material is hosted in Ireland, will request the relevant Internet service provider to remove it. The hotline liaises with the Garda Síochána, as appropriate. If the material originates in another jurisdiction, the hotline will notify the relevant authority there which can take appropriate measures. A report to the hotline on chat rooms would be investigated in the same manner as that relating to other Internet services, for example, websites, e-mail messages or attachments, pornographic spam and so on.</P>
      <P>A number of references were made during last night's debate to the thorough manner in which information was gathered both in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and how effective these measures had proven to be in contrast to what was referred to as the worrying limitations of our vetting procedures. In the amendment proposed by the Minister of State to the Fine Gael motion, attention should be drawn to the paragraph which states vetting is not the sole answer. Today's conviction in the United Kingdom of Ian Huntley for the murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells should alert us all to the need to recognise that good practice in ensuring suitability of applicants for posts of responsibility where access to children is involved is also required and that vetting alone does not guarantee protection for the most vulnerable in society. Vigilance and an overall strategy under the legislation in place and the constant revision, facilitation and promotion of reform in the criminal justice system to meet the challenges of present day crime are what are required.</P>
      <P>On a personal level, I believe the motion is well presented and the research excellent. No one in this House will be found wanting when it comes to the protection of a child. It is merely a difference of opinion on the way this should be implemented.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sexton's contribution is a reminder that this is a sombre occasion. Private Members' Business is often about political point scoring, which is fair in a democracy, but the subject of tonight's debate is one all Members will agree should have our considered attention. I hope any additional measures the Government considers necessary in this regard will have the support of the entire House. Like Deputy Sexton, I compliment my colleague, Deputy Enright, on the fine work she has done on this issue. My praise has nothing to do with the season of goodwill.</P>
      <P>While I do not normally get involved in finished business, I wish to correct some of the comments made last night because they created the impression that the resources allocated to the paedophile investigation unit of the Garda Síochána were inadequate. When I checked today, I learned that the unit was established by the Garda Commissioner in late 2002 and is located in the domestic violence and sexual assault unit, based at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in Harcourt Square. I am informed the domestic violence and sexual assault unit has a staffing complement of one detective inspector, three detective sergeants and 11 detective gardaí, while the paedophile investigation unit comprises one detective sergeant and three detective gardaí. In addition to these resource commitments, personnel from the mainstream units of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation augment the units as the volume of work requires.</P>
      <P>Suspected criminal cases involving the use of the Internet are complex. All such cases which come to notice become the subject of investigation. Cases in hand are at various stages of the investigative process and will, I understand, result in files being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is satisfied that the Commissioner keeps all aspects of Garda operations and resource requirements under constant review and responds to developments in criminal activity in deploying his resources.</P>
      <P>Having been struck by images from the Soham trial at the Old Bailey today, this is a good day to have this debate. Everyone who has been engaged in community work, including many Deputies over the years, understands the importance of vetting. My first involvement in community activities was as a youth worker on Francis Street in the inner city. I later became involved in the Community Games and the International Youth Federation. Everyone involved in this area is aware of the issue of child abuse.</P>
      <P>Speaking a year ago on the occasion of becoming the first chairman of the South-Western Area Health Board, I noted that our legacy must be to guarantee the safety of children to ensure that in 30 or 40 years we will not be discussing difficulties similar to those we experienced in the previous century. Following the revelations of institutional abuse during the past ten years and with the media reporting daily on the crimes being committed against young people, it is important that we, as legislators, also remember that, thankfully, a large percentage of our children will never have to experience exposure to these crimes. The social services provided by the health boards must continue at all times to follow best practice and vetting. In addition, a vital component of both recruitment and placement should be supported by training and management supervision.</P>
      <P>A country finds itself in an uncomfortable position when all its care workers, teachers, voluntary community workers and health workers need to be vetted, which was the message emanating from the Opposition benches last night. The good being done by the majority of those involved in community associations, the child welfare sector and our schools must not be overshadowed by the deeds of a minority. We must ensure protection, but at the same time we must not stifle the good work which occurs day after day in our constituencies.</P>
      <P>It is possible for all organisations involved with our young people's development to have, as most already do, a set of guidelines and procedures on best practice and for complaints and responses to be investigated and reported on. Given the career path of many Deputies, it is a pity some colleagues are advocating the application of draconian measures to all in response to the crimes of the few.</P>
      <P>Times have changed in the residential child care sector. Guidelines have been introduced and the work of the Irish Social Services Inspectorate needs to be publicly supported, acknowledged and the organisation congratulated. This support should include health boards taking voluntary, public and speedy responses to correct without delay any fault or potential difficulties identified by the inspectorate.</P>
      <P>When researching for this contribution, I took the opportunity to read the Irish Social Services Inspectorate's 2002 annual report, some of the contents of which I would like to mention. The report states that while there are standards on safeguarding child protection, the safety of children and young people is best served when health boards ensure staff are vetted, trained, supervised and supported. This sentiment, that vetting should form part of wider supports, is worthy of the support of the House.</P>
      <P>The safety of children and young people is further enhanced when their rights are respected. The report indicates that good safeguarding practice was evident in 19 of the 22 centres inspected. This is a most encouraging finding, although I do not ignore the fact that three of the centres did not reach the required standard. The report also states that good practice includes awareness among care staff of the need to monitor each other's practice and discuss and-or report any concerns which may arise. It noted evidence of some defensive practice, namely, care workers working in a manner aimed more at avoiding allegations of abuse than ensuring the safety of the children and young people, an issue on which I have no doubt the inspectorate will be able to offer guidelines.</P>
      <P>Although 12 of the 23 centres were found to have child protection policies, only four had policies on safeguarding. Some of these were inadequate, with one described as &ldquo;seriously flawed&rdquo; and another as being &ldquo;in need of major revision&rdquo;. Nevertheless, the absence or inadequacy of policy did not necessarily translate into unsafe practice. In two centres, staff expressed concern for the welfare and safety of children and young people arising from the behaviour of a resident of the centre, while young people reported bullying in four others. Of these, two had introduced strategies to deal with the bullying problem, while the response in the others was <i>ad hoc.</i>Like the inspectors, I am concerned that such incidents, even when serious, were rarely seen as child protection issues as required under &ldquo;Children First&rdquo;, the national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. This is an area in which members of the Committee on Health and Children could seek to have the health boards report on their achievements and insist on timescales for implementation if no such arrangements are in place in the relevant health board area.</P>
      <P>One of the key parts of the report was a section which considered some of the responses of children in care. When asked directly, the vast majority of children said they were safe and had confidence in their carers.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the various organisations which do so much good work in this area. The groups with which I have had a great deal of contact recently include the National Office for Victims of Abuse, NOVA, and the Aisling Centre on Ormonde Quay in Dublin, which deals with the healing of institutional abuse. Given that many other Deputies have also had extensive contact with organisations involved in this area, it is important on an occasion such as this to pay tribute to their work and wish them well.</P>

      <P>A number of important points have been raised during Private Members' Business tonight and last night. How the central vetting unit deals with requests from health boards, schools and voluntary organisations is just one of the important issues. A far greater cohort of children in the community are now being cared for in crèches and playschools. Children are cared for by au pairs and childminders, both in their own homes and in those of the people who mind them. When children are cared for in other people's homes, often there is access to the house by a number of other adults. To be truly effective there would need to be an international vetting unit, given that so much child care is now being provided by foreign nationals, from within the European Union and outside but that would never really work.</P>
      <P>It is important for all parents to check on how their children are getting on with their childminders. As the Minister of State has pointed out, the Garda will not release details on everybody as regards whether they are on the sexual offenders register when people are checking out their childminders. A better solution must be found if children are to be protected. No vetting unit can be 100% effective and it is no substitute for vigilance by parents. Children do not go home and say they have been abused. It is the way they behave and react to the abuser that is often the first indication that something untoward is happening. Fellow workers are important also because they may notice certain behaviour by colleagues which may lead to the detection of abuse incidences. It is not satisfactory for employers just to be given clearance from a vetting unit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sexton alluded to the Soham trial concluded today in the United Kingdom. It was considered that an effective vetting system was in operation but unfortunately perpetrators of abuse against children are highly manipulative and can easily get around most legal safeguards such as those we have in Ireland. A truly effective vetting unit would intrude greatly on the civil rights of child care workers. Ian Huntley had no previous convictions but was arrested a number of times for sexual encounters with under age girls. At one stage he was arrested in his twenties when he had a girlfriend who was 15. These facts would never have appeared on his file on the grounds that within a democracy civil liberties were deemed to be paramount.</P>
      <P>The vetting system under debate would intrude greatly on people's civil rights. I do not believe it would be tolerated in most countries. Even known sexual offenders can travel freely to some degree across Europe. There is child prostitution tourism in some Far East countries. People are allowed to travel freely to the countries concerned, even though it is known what is going on. If the known sex offenders cannot be restricted, what hope is there as regards those who do not show up in the system as yet?</P>
      <P>The media can sensationalise issues. We have to be careful as legislators because we are expected to be somewhat more rational. There has been enormous coverage, for instance, of clerical sex abuse, yet clerical abuse cases only account for a small fraction of the total. Long after the spotlight had been placed on the issue of clerical sex abuse, however, the Catholic bishops still maintained a relatively benign attitude towards it.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Connor, I would like to say we should be careful about what we do, lest we intrude on the good names of thousands of child care workers who provide a fantastic service. We do not want to see people driven from voluntary organisations because of the fear they might be labelled as perverts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and will be supporting the motion which is about the protection of children from sexual exploitation and child pornographic material. I pay tribute to the vast majority of people who work with children such as teachers, classroom assistants, youth workers, child care workers and coaches of football teams who make a massive contribution to society. It is essential we recognise their valuable work and contribution to the community as a whole. Many have taken major risks in the interests of the child. In many instances it takes courage and integrity to deal with these difficult cases. I worked with many abuse cases in my previous job as a teacher. It is extremely distressing and upsetting. On top of the abuse one has threats, violence and intimidation. Hence I have great respect for those who take risks in the interests of the child.</P>
      <P>Many a night I could not sleep when I thought about some of the horrific situations into which children had to go each day after school. The sad thing was that the only positive part of the day for such children was school. That is the reason it is important to ensure all our schools are places of sanctuary for children at risk. We need to be there for them in a professional and caring way. That is the reason we should pay tribute to and thank all those who work with children.</P>
      <P>I pay special tribute to foster parents. These great and wonderful people are saving thousands of children each day. I know the excellent work they do from direct experience. With all due respect to institutional care, foster families were and are the best scenario for vulnerable children. We should never hold back as regards financial support for them. In legislative terms they should be given maximum help and assistance as that is the way forward.</P>
      <P>We should be cautious, lest the minority of offenders set the agenda for the rest of society. We may have gone over the top with some of the new practices to protect staff and children. For 20 years I trained an under-13 Gaelic team and had to drop the pupils home after matches. This was common practice for many years. All of a sudden the climate changed and we were all warned about the potential for allegations etc. I found this sad and unsafe at times, as people advised me to drop children back to school from where they had to walk home, be collected or get public transport, while some of us were passing by their homes. Needless to say, I did not take this over the top advice.</P>
      <P>We and society as a whole should not throw the baby out with the bath water. We need common sense at all times. I emphasise this as regards staff. At all times we have to be safe and vigilant. We cannot label people. I urge the House to support the motion.</P>

      <P>Táim an-bhuíoch don seans cúpla focail a rá ar an rud tábhachtach seo. Ba mhaith liom ar an gcéad dul síos comhghairdeas a ghabháil d'Fhine Gael don obair a dhein sé mar gheall ar an rud seo a chur suas. Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil do gach duine i bhFine Gael mar gheall ar seo.</P>
      <P>I am happy to speak on this important motion. I congratulate Fine Gael on the work it has done in putting it on the agenda. Deputies have mentioned Ian Huntley and the terrible situation that pertained in Soham. Every father and mother was chilled to the bone by the events that occurred there and the fate of those two innocent children. The verdict is known to be murder. It is now known that this man was someone who should have been detected but was not. The reason he was not detected is put down to human error.</P>
      <P>It is within our hands to prevent tragedies like this from occurring. Each and every parent worries every time his or her child goes out. As a GP dealing with many people who return to live in Ireland, I often hear the words: &ldquo;It is wonderful. Children can play outside in this country without fear of this happening.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, that is not the case. We are catching up with other jurisdictions, through the Internet and so on. By itself, the Internet is not the problem. It provides the opportunity for people so-minded to exploit children. That is what it is all about.</P>
      <P>An extremely important debate has been opened in the Chamber tonight over the balance between the right of the individual and the right of the person not to be harmed. I am referring to the right of people under the Constitution to live their lives without being harmed. How does one balance the wonderful work being done by so many in looking after young people, in sport, leisure etc. with the risk of abuse? It would be terrible if these awful events clouded or took away from the wonderful work people do or in some way tarred them with the brush of suspicion now associated with those who work with children. What priest will now go into the sacristy with the altar boys? It just does not happen any more. People's perspective has utterly changed.</P>
      <P>We have a responsibility to put in place proper systems that work effectively. The system in Northern Ireland is said to be better than ours, as is the system in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, this terrible event happened. Having a system is just one part of the equation. The other is ensuring the system works and is effective. Clearly, it did not work in this case. Too often, lack of resources is the reason for a job not being properly done. Temporary staff, for example, are not subject to the same rigorous assessment as those seeking full-time employment. That is a loophole which must be tackled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this important motion. Society has changed over the years. Many children are in crèches and playschools. Even at weekends children are sent to drama classes and so forth. The reason is that parents are extremely busy. Generally, they are working. The introduction of individualisation encouraged more mothers out of the home. That is the nature of our economic system. Many would say it is regrettable but that is the type of society in which we live. For that reason the motion is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I would be inclined to amend the motion. Rather than discuss the future and vetting people before they take up employment, many of those currently employed in institutions and schools should undergo vetting procedures. Statistics show that while the vast bulk do an outstanding job and can be trusted, there are people in the institutions and clubs mentioned in the motion who engage in child abuse. If we are to have a safe society, they should be subjected to a thorough vetting procedure.</P>
      <P>The vetting procedure is only as good as the database or technology. What type of information should go into the database? There have been references to the Soham trial. It was a horrifying case. There were many recriminations about Mr. Huntley and how he should have been caught. It is a difficult situation. We must consider what should be put in a central database. Should allegations be put into it or simply convictions? I believe the police should have had the allegations on its database. That would have led them to Mr. Huntley reasonably quickly, although it might not have prevented the killings. Certainly, convictions must be put on the database. It is a difficult issue.</P>
      <P>One can ruin a person's career, and his or her life, by making an allegation of this nature. We recently heard the harrowing story of a Christian Brother whose life had been shattered after a false allegation had been made against him. The allegation was a fabrication but the Christian Brother said he could never work again because, as far as most were concerned, there was no smoke without fire. What does one do in such a situation? Child abuse is a heinous crime but to allege that somebody is a child abuser is also heinous.</P>
      <P>We need to explore what technology offers. It is becoming more advanced. Lie detection is now a more exact science. It is even possible to carry out brain scans to find out if people are telling the truth. These possibilities should not be dismissed; we should examine them. It is now becoming a necessity. Everybody has experienced the problem of spam and viruses being received by their computers. Most of the spam is of a pornographic nature, yet it is on our computers. It is not child pornography but something many, including the secretaries in Leinster House, find offensive. I am told by experts that it is relatively easy to plant this on somebody's computer and make an accusation against them. These are difficult issues.</P>
      <P>A child abuser cannot be cured. I have heard people say they can go to therapy and be cured. In fact, that is their sexuality and how they are defined. It is simply a lost cause. For that reason, we must know when somebody convicted of child abuse is living in the community in order that we can protect our children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion. I am disappointed but not surprised by the Government's decision to oppose it. It is regrettable that it is not willing to compromise or accept good ideas and proposals when they are put forward. The Government appears to instinctively feel the need to oppose any Opposition motion no matter how positive or close to its own proposals it is.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have referred to the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on child pornography and the scale of the problem it apparently exposed. Earlier today police in Spain arrested 27 people in a crackdown on child pornographers. It yielded an enormous quantity of material, including thousands of images stored on computers. That many of these images appear to have come from countries in South and Central America, Asia and Sweden underlines the international scope of the problem. Child pornography and its practitioners do not recognise borders.</P>
      <P>The vetting system in the South is years behind that in place in the Six Counties. A co-ordinated, all-Ireland, common approach to the issue is not only practical but necessary. Of course, we must be careful that in protecting the children of the State we do all we can to avoid trampling on civil liberties. One need only look at the tabloid campaign in Britain of naming paedophiles. It led to the suffering of innocent people because their names were similar to those of the paedophiles.</P>
      <P>Last summer I met representatives of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children shortly after the launch of the campaign in August to highlight its concerns about child protection. Many Deputies will have seen the stall outside the ISPCC offices in Molesworth Street and I hope they took the opportunity to sign the petition. During the meeting I was disturbed to discover how inadequate the vetting procedure was for adults working with children and youths. People who stopped at the stall were also probably shocked to discover that people such as teachers were not automatically vetted to ensure they did not have convictions for sex offences. The Fine Gael motion identifies some of the key professions where vetting is vital.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to the working group set up to examine extending the vetting arrangements. He also outlined the amount of work done. He claimed the group's report will be published in January 2004. I am a little suspicious about that deadline. When I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in September when the report would be presented, I was told it would be ready in November. When I asked again at the start of November, he said it would be ready in a couple of weeks. Now the deadline is January 2004. I do not doubt that a great deal of work has been done and that the report will be comprehensive. However, the delays that have occurred are intolerable when the issue is of such importance.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Deasy pointed out that only 10% to 12% of the 300 sex offenders in prison participated in sexual rehabilitation programmes. He correctly described this as disturbing. He went on to suggest that there was a need to pressurise sex offenders into becoming involved in these programmes. I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that rehabilitation cannot be forced but the problem has more to do with the limited number of spaces available. If the 300 sex offenders wished to get onto the rehabilitation programme, unlikely as it is, there would be no space for them. A total of 16 offenders are recruited to the sex offenders programme on an annual basis. This is a pathetic figure and an absolute disgrace.</P>
      <P>Vetting of adults in the workplace, no matter how thorough, ignores the fact that the vast majority of child abuse cases are not workplace linked but take place in the home, the home of friends or with someone parents trust. Most incidents go unreported by victims.</P>

      <P>It is not often one gets a chance in life to right a definite wrong or put something right in place. For all Members of the House, it is one of those days when we can do so. The motion on keeping children safe, to coin a phrase, &ldquo;does exactly what it says on the tin&rdquo;. For years Members of the House and beyond have paid lip-service in fine words to doing exactly what is proposed in the motion but for reasons best known to themselves it has not happened. I am not here to give a history lesson, just to say, &ldquo;Shame, that it must stop now.&rdquo;  Overwhelming evidence compiled over the years has proved beyond doubt that this is exactly what needs to be done. The motion should be agreed to. The extra funding required which does not amount to millions of euro should be provided and the necessary changes in legislation implemented for the motion to work.</P>
      <P>Members of the House must decide what is important. They must not become engaged in the normal political nonsense of opposing suggestions because they come from the wrong side of the House. Will they take the proposals at face value, ensuring the House delivers an early Christmas present to all children in the community, not just those in care but all those who take part in the local athletic club, football club or attend the local swimming pool? We are not talking about children from the developing world &ndash; not that it should make a difference &ndash; or even visiting children but about all children &ndash; black, white, rich, poor, sick and healthy. They are our children &ndash; brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. They are the ones we meet each day, the children for whom many of us claim to live our lives.</P>
      <P>The protection of children is what the motion is all about. Will we play political football with the issue while allowing children to remain in an environment shaded with doubt as to whether our peers are fit for the job we entrusted them to do? I say to those in charge that the decision is theirs and theirs alone. However, for children's sake, if not for their own sake, they should think with their heart and head and add constructively to the debate to ensure the motion is passed and implemented quickly.</P>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Enright, for her commitment and the work she has put into the subject. Those of us who know her and have studied the motion can see the genuine thought and concern behind it. As past studies have shown, paedophiles and child abusers are clever and cunning, whose life's work consists of enabling them to get close to children, thus ruining their lives and that of their entire family. As stated by my colleague, no system of vetting is or can be 100% successful but this should not put people off trying to make it 100% successful. What is absolutely clear from the motion is that anyone who is innocent would have absolutely nothing to fear. In fact, the opposite is the case, which is welcome.</P>
      <P>One of the foundation stones of an adequate child protection system is a comprehensive vetting and screening procedure, an area in which there have been some improvements in this area in recent years but, sadly, many wishing to work with children on a professional and voluntary basis are still not vetted in an appropriate manner. Comprehensive vetting would have picked up someone like Mr. Huntley. Even though he had no criminal convictions, the information would have been available and perhaps may have prevented the tragic deaths of the two young girls concerned.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to accept &ndash; many may choose not to do so &ndash; that the person with whom we may go to football matches, teachers we have known for years, those who voluntarily run youth clubs or any such organisations may have a lifestyle hostile to what we call common decency and which puts the most vulnerable in society in great danger. While not wishing to overstate the case, thankfully these types of people are rare. However, that is not sufficient. One abuser in the wrong place is one too many.</P>
      <P>The care of children is the primary concern of the State but, unfortunately, to date we have relied on others to do the job. We, as legislators, must accept that the buck stops with us. We cannot continue to blame others. This is one issue where we cannot rely on statistics or rising or falling trends. There must be no trends. If the motion is passed and allowed to work at full strength, it will have the effect of not just catching abusers but ensuring they will not get through the system, or be able to apply to take up such positions, either on a voluntary or permanent basis.</P>
      <P>This argument is compelling and should ensure common sense will prevail. It only holds weight, however, if there is no watering down of the motion. I cannot see the reason a watered down version should be accepted in the House. I would have thought a progressive Government would have strengthened the motion or suggested that there should be a common European policy in this regard. Many youth groups involved in exchange programmes and so on have great difficulties because there are different rules and procedures in different countries, which is causing great concern. A progressive Government would have strengthened the motion.</P>
      <P>It is important to get this aspect right, which is what the motion proposes. Are we men and women or just mice? Will we do the right thing and ensure the speedy passage of the motion through the House? It is on issues such as this that we in this House are judged by the wider community. Therefore, let us show that we feel their pain, the pain of abused children. What should stop us from doing the right thing and insisting the motion should be implemented at the first available opportunity? Surely Members will not allow the opportunity to pass to correct this great wrong on some bogus grounds just to be seen to be politically correct. On Members' heads let it be.</P>
      <P>An important aspect of the motion is that it makes quite plain the heavy penalties which would be imposed on those who wished to discredit anyone by abusing the power given to them in the legislation. This reinforces the point that anyone who is innocent would have nothing to fear. It has often been said and referred to in law that it is better for three guilty people to be found innocent than for one innocent person to be found guilty. That is true but an exception must be made to ensure abusers cannot or will not be seen as innocent, allowing them to take up positions of influence over the future of our children.</P>
      <P>It is said one bad apple can destroy an entire barrel. That is true but what is also true is that one abuser can and will destroy many lives, undermining the administration of such professions as teachers, the carers of children and the law itself. This will undermine society, prohibit good people from getting involved in community service and result in children being locked behind doors because we as a community are afraid to act. I know many who are anxious to become involved in GAA clubs, soccer clubs and rugby clubs but they have stopped being involved because of a fear of being accused of abusing a child if the person beside them has been involved. More volunteers are needed but they will not become involved until proper systems and procedures are in place for vetting, monitoring and so on. The Minister said yesterday that it was up to clubs to put procedures in place. It is not. They can just implement the rules. They must be guided. The Government must direct and lead.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, many have children with either physical or mental disabilities. Due to cutbacks in respite care, they cannot get a weekend break because they cannot get anyone to look after their children. Many are willing to do this type of work on a voluntary basis. However, if they are not employed by the health boards, they will not be given a certificate. This means they cannot be tapped into. Families are missing out on this resource. This is not happening because the vetting system is out-of-date.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing a vetting service would not put a dent on general expenditure, yet it would add so much to the community. There is no valid reason, apart from the fear of being seen to be proactive on the issue, for not supporting the motion. Let us stop the nonsense. I call on each Member of the House to be proactive, support themselves, their children and communities by making it plain that paedophiles and abusers should seek help, not positions of authority in the community. We, as legislators, should ensure this happens whether the people concerned like it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Enright, for the work she has done in this area and tabling the motion, with which I believe Members across the House are in broad agreement. Protecting children is one of our most basic and important roles. The motion was crafted in the hope the Government might support it and at the end of this term we might go forward with a united message from this House that, for example, all health board employees, or employees of any facility or service in receipt of health board funding, will be vetted before taking up employment giving them substantial and unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. What is wrong with this? As the Government has not said there is anything wrong with it, why does it not agree with it? Does it think there is something wrong with saying all teachers and other school staff, either full-time or part-time, should be vetted before taking up employment? Surely there would be nothing wrong with this? Why is the Government disagreeing with this and voting it down? It makes a lot of sense to me, as a former teacher. As my colleague, Deputy English, said, many innocent people would feel much safer knowing there were proper vetting procedures in place. The charitable and voluntary organisations are crying out for a proper vetting service. They are all asking for it.</P>
      <P>We, as the national Parliament, are calling on the Executive to ensure that charities and voluntary sporting and youth organisations have access to vetting procedures for their staff and volunteers before appointing any person to a position involving substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults. What is wrong with that? We have not gone into the details &ndash; that is up to the Department and the Minister to work out. In general, however, the motion calls for the current vetting system to be extended so that voluntary, sporting and youth organisations can know that their staff who are working with children, whether employed or in a voluntary capacity, have been vetted.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, criticised our motion by drawing inferences and making presumptions. I do not know whether he is entitled to do this as he was not sticking to the facts. He said he did not accept the presumption that vetting of itself can detect problems that can arise. However, we never said that. One of the dangers of vetting is that people might rely on it too much. He was unfair to presume that was our opinion. I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is here tonight, to take into consideration that we never said that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also said: &ldquo;The Government could not accept the inference that is drawn from the report of the Irish Social Services Inspectorate for 2002 which found that vetting procedures in Ireland were unsatisfactory and needed urgent attention.&rdquo; He went on to say: &ldquo;A careful examination of the context of the report will show that the inadequacy had nothing to do with the operation of the central vetting unit of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;  We never said it had. He then said: &ldquo;It related to other matters of legitimate concern which were raised by the Opposition this evening.&rdquo;  This means he agreed with us. The two main points he made to rebut our argument were based on things we never said, yet he used them as reasons for opposing our motion. He used them to divide the House on this most sensitive and important matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is an eminent counsel. I ask him to reconsider the Government's attitude towards the motion. Perhaps he could point out to us what is wrong with our suggestions. I am not an eminent solicitor or barrister but I cannot see anything wrong with them. It would be great if the Dáil could show a united front on this urgent matter on a night when it was found that the vetting procedures across the water were flawed and inadequate. We are calling for a substantial improvement and expansion of our vetting procedures.</P>
      <P>The last point in our motion refers to information about people who are guilty of sexual misconduct. To me, a humble layman, this means they have been before a court and found guilty. They are guilty of downloading, distributing or creating child pornographic material &ndash; which is a crime &ndash; or of physical or emotional abuse, substance abuse, or theft from a child or vulnerable adult. The four points in the motion should be agreed to. There is nothing there that would bring down the Government or anything else. I appeal to the Minister to stand up and say the Government will accept the motion and there will be no vote. This is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>This Government and previous Governments have done much work in this area but much more needs to be done. We are dealing, as the Minister knows, with a group of people &ndash; paedophiles &ndash; who are very hard to identify and who can inveigle their way into sporting organisations, youth clubs and so on. Deputy Lynch made a powerful and valuable contribution last night and I invite the Minister, if he has not already done so, to listen to or read her contribution. These people prey on the most vulnerable children, those who are withdrawn, quiet and lonely, those who, often through the Internet, are looking for friends. We need to be vigilant, but it is not easy.</P>
      <P>As a former teacher I know that teachers and people who work with young people are worried about the lack of protection for themselves. For example, I know teachers who take other teachers in the car with them if they bring children home from school. One must never be alone with a child &ndash; that is the rule. Yesterday the Minister for Education and Science, on my invitation, called on all sporting and voluntary bodies to ensure they have proper guidelines in place for working with children and adults who are vulnerable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sexton mentioned chat rooms. Now that we are assuming the Presidency of the European Union we should try to use our position to make sure this technology is not used by people who are, in my view, very ill. It was suggested last night that when offenders are released from prison those in the area in which they intend to live should be informed of their presence. I do not know whether I agree with that, but I have a problem with letting them loose in the first place. Paedophilia is not only a heinous crime but it extends from a mental condition which is not stable. Anybody who preys on children must be insane. The idea of releasing them at all is something I would question. Experts have said that these people can never be cured. They are also very manipulative and can convince trained psychologists and psychiatrists that they are cured. I have seen studies to this effect. This is extremely serious, but it is also a new idea and must be investigated. I agree that forcing people into therapy does not work, as was said last night. It must be voluntary. There is some merit in strongly persuading people but there must be a voluntary aspect to it as well.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the motion is agreed but if he cannot do this, I ask him to consider the points made by Deputies from all sides of the House and expand as quickly as possible the procedures to ensure that children are kept safe. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, also said last night he was worried that despite the substantial investment by health boards in advertising the &ldquo;Children First&rdquo; guidelines, there is a lack of widespread public awareness about them. That is true and it is an issue which needs to be tackled. He also said there was no substitute for checking out references. I agree it is important for employers to do this, but we never said that vetting was the be-all and end-all, although it is important.</P>
      <P>These days there is so much mobility. All over the country apartment blocks are going up and people are moving in and out. In the past people were known. If a person in an area was suspect, people knew about it. That is not the case now as people move in and out of areas all the time. We need to get tougher and stronger in this area.</P>
      <P>The intention of the motion is to support that rather than to be divisive. I ask the Minister to support the motion and not to divide the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for standing in for me last night and providing a comprehensive and convincing presentation of the Government's policies on vetting which have to be seen in a broader context of child protection issues generally. I express my recognition of the great value of the Opposition's motion and commend Deputy Enright and her colleagues on their research efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of the issues under discussion and the arrangements in place outside this jurisdiction. In particular, it is recognised there are good grounds for examining the need to extend the existing vetting arrangements to additional organisations. However, extending the services of the Garda central vetting unit is not simply a matter of throwing resources at it because there are also important issues of policy involved. For example, speakers on this side have already spoken about the legal questions on the release of soft facts about individuals as opposed to hard facts about individuals and so on. Clearly, that issue has a significant bearing on any proposals for the establishment of a vetting register, as suggested by Members. Such a register is one whereby information is held and is disclosable on individuals deemed unsuitable to work with children and vulnerable adults, not on the grounds solely of criminality but also on the grounds of employment history or personal history.</P>
      <P>Because I acknowledge the need to extend the current vetting scheme to more organisations and because I recognise the more widespread release of information has consequences &ndash; we cannot deny these &ndash; from a data protection point of view and from other legal perspectives, I asked the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the working group established to look at the issues involved had representation from relevant Government Departments. In addition to members of the Garda Síochána and officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the working group includes representatives of the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The group is considering what is the best form of vetting that can be provided, taking into account all the aspects of vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons, be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placements. Issues under consideration within that working group include the range of organisations which are seeking Garda vetting and a future likely demand from such organisations; the resource implications of extending clearance arrangements to additional private, voluntary, community and education sectors; processing and liaison mechanisms with organisations to reduce duplication and to enhance standardisation and clearance requests; the viable means of processing clearance requests in respect of non-nationals taking up employment in the child care and health care sectors in Ireland; the making of services of the central vetting unit available on a commercial fee basis to ensure, among other things, that proportionality and common sense are applied by organisations and that the unit is not used indiscriminately; and the legal aspects of vetting.</P>
      <P>It is not only desirable but essential to await the deliberations of the working group before making any drive towards further enhancing vetting services in this jurisdiction. I have appealed to the House to recognise that. We do not have long to wait. As I understand it, the working group expects to submit a report on its deliberations to myself and the Garda Commissioner in January 2004.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the events today in Soham. Following the conviction of Ian Huntley for the murder of the two schoolgirls, Holly and Jessica, it has been revealed that Mr. Huntley was well known to the police services in England as a significant threat or danger to children, although it is not believed he had previous convictions. The question that arises in that context is how he managed to get a job as a caretaker in a primary school. There is no reason to believe that vetting arrangements in the United Kingdom are inferior in any way to our own. That has implications for this jurisdiction as well and there is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>The Home Secretary, David Blunkett, MP, announced that an inquiry will take place into how Huntley managed to secure employment as a caretaker. We are closely monitoring developments in this affairs and we will carefully examine any outcome of this inquiry, including the lessons learned. We cannot wait a long time, although I image the inquiry in the United Kingdom will be speedy.</P>
      <P>It was put to me that the best thing for the House to do is to unite around a single resolution. Whereas I heard what was said in favour of the Opposition's motion, the Government's motion is the more comprehensive. I ask the Fine Gael Party, whom I commend for raising this important matter, especially given that we are about to have a significant report on this issue within weeks, to join me in supporting the Government's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Enright for tabling the motion which deals with an important and serious issue. It is one that has been discussed at various time in recent years, including the period when we debated the child sex offenders register from 1997 until it was introduced prior to the last election. I am pleased the Minister has stated the report of his working group will be available in January. That is an important event. It is important also to pay serious attention to this issue because of the effects of abuse on children. We are aware that paedophiles target areas where they are close to children. It is well known that they identify positions where they can get close to children and subsequently abuse them.</P>
      <P>There are now 502 people on the sex offenders register. We are registering at the rate of 20% ahead of the United Kingdom. For many years prior to the introduction of that register, many thought it was unnecessary and would have only a marginal effect. That 502 people have been identified as a danger to children and have been convicted in the courts is evidence of the need for such a register. The proposal here is to extend it to additional organisations to ensure that those who are not only convicted but in danger of abusing children are vetted before being employed in areas where they get close to children and have the opportunity to violate them. The psychological and physical effect on a child not only during childhood but throughout his or her life is traumatic. They suffer from low self-esteem and deep depression for the rest of their lives. Many are suicidal and take their own lives. Apart from normal sexual relationships, they have difficulty in forming relationships with friends and individuals because they do not trust people. The effect is their lives are destroyed.</P>
      <P>The motion asks the Dáil to protect children from that terrible event that may destroy their lives. In reply to a parliamentary question which I tabled in July, the Minister informed the House he was in discussions with the Garda Síochána on ways of extending the service in the child care area to community workers, part-time employees and so on. I presume the report which is due in January will develop that issue and advise on it. That the Minister has announced that this evening is positive.</P>
      <P>All of us were shocked at the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme two weeks ago, which exposed the level of activity on the Internet in accessing child pornography. This, in itself, was a serious matter but the realisation that trading in child pornography is taking place puts a different emphasis on it. In order to trade one must have a product. The product of child pornography is an image of a child being sexually abused. If people in Ireland are trading in pornography they must be producing these images. That is a serious issue.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme made it clear that the Garda do not have the resources to investigate this matter. There is a three month delay between the time when information is supplied to the Garda and the matter is investigated. I appreciate that this problem is a new one to the Garda Síochána and to all of us. We were educated by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. However, the Minister and his Department have been aware of the problem and of the level of abuse being done to children. Some people think such activity is relatively innocent because the people involved are not directly abusing children. Nevertheless, they are indirectly abusing children because the images must be produced and children damaged to create the pornographic material and to allow access to it. Whether the abuse happens in Ireland or in the Far East, children are being abused.</P>
      <P>The paraphernalia of the State must be used to ensure that this activity is highlighted and people brought to justice. Traders in pornographic images must be identified. The Garda must be given the resources necessary to identify those who are trading in child pornography. A message must be sent that this is not acceptable and that the powers of the State will be used to investigate this crime and to bring people to justice. It was clear from the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme that people involved in this activity believe they will never be brought to justice. They clearly had contempt for the justice system because they felt they were quite safe, probably rightly so.</P>
      <P>In one three month period &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; journalists, working on a part-time basis, identified 105 accesses to abuse while the Garda Síochána identified 124 in a full year. This illustrates the level of Garda activity in this area. It is clear from Liz Walsh's article in last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i> that the necessary resources are not available to the Garda. Liz Walsh conducted an interesting investigation. She said of the Garda paedophile unit:</P>
      <P>The unit is hugely under-resourced and is swamped with material awaiting examination. On top of this, Garda management has, so far, shown little or no enthusiasm for the type of high tech policing necessary to trace and arrest child pornographers.</P>
      <P>She continued:</P>
      <P>Since 1999 the gardaí had tracking software capable of tracking suspect traders. Once they have established their computer identity they can obtain names and addresses from telephone services, enabling them to make arrests.</P>
      <P>However, arrests are not happening. I do not know why not. The technology exists. As people in the United Kingdom have said, it does not take many resources to identify the people involved, but it takes resources to follow up that identification, do the necessary investigation, question suspects, prepare a file for the Director or Public Prosecutions and secure a conviction. I appreciate that only a small number of such people will be brought to justice but the Minister must send a signal that people who are involved in this area will be brought to justice and ensure that we stop or control, as far as possible, the damage being done to children.</P>

      <P>The difference between the Government and Opposition on this matter emerged very clearly last night and tonight. The difference is between hard facts and soft facts, as Government speakers have described them. We have not heard a definitive response from the Government. The Government has said the principles of natural justice apply or this is a constitutional issue. In his previous incarnation as Attorney General, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seemed to run the show. I wonder if the current Attorney General is now running the show on this issue.</P>
      <P>In formulating Fine Gael policy, we did not rush to a conclusion that this type of information needs to be included. It is something to which we gave serious consideration. If we do not have a system which includes this kind of information our system will not be as good as that in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, and the Republic of Ireland will be a haven for pornographers. That is why this situation needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the Ian Huntley case and the Soham murders. In August 1995 both the police and social services in England investigated allegations that Ian Huntley had sex with a 15 year old girl. In November of that year there was an issue of burglary. In March 1996 a complaint was made by an under age girl, in April a complaint was made by a 15 year old girl and in May a complaint was made by a 13 year old girl. In May 1998 there was a rape charge, in July 1998 an 11 year old girl complained of sexual assault by Ian Huntley &ndash; at the time he was living with a 15 year old girl &ndash; and in July 1999 there were two more rape allegations. If that man were in Ireland he would be able to move from county to county and that information would not go with him. No system would ensure that someone like him could not get a job working with children or vulnerable adults. That is as clear as I can state the matter. That is why soft facts must be used. We can talk about the Constitution but we must find a way around it. If we do not, we will leave children and vulnerable adults in Ireland at risk from people like Ian Huntley. I know that the Home Secretary, Mr. David Blunkett, has ordered an inquiry.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he has no reason to believe the vetting system in the United Kingdom is any worse than our own. At present, it is better than the system here. There was a flaw in the monitoring of Ian Huntley. I heard on a news bulletin this evening that he was not apprehended due to human error. We will never have a perfect system and cases will always fall through the cracks. We must try to provide the best possible system to ensure that does not happen.</P>
      <P>We did not suggest that vetting would be the be all and end all. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, acknowledged this last night. We know that other practices must be in place. Nevertheless, vetting is necessary. Many speakers, particularly on the Government side, spoke of the work of the voluntary sector, teachers and child care workers. Some seemed to imply that we did not give consideration to those in the voluntary sector or that we do not value their work. That is not the case. The voluntary sector and voluntary organisations themselves want improved vetting procedures. Children at Risk in Ireland, the National Youth Federation and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children have all welcomed our proposals. The Government will present its proposals in January and I look forward to reading them.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael will not accept the Government amendment. I would have preferred if the Government had accepted the Fine Gael motion but I understand that is not how the Oireachtas works.</P>

Given their considerable legal experience, I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children will make a judgment on this issue and give due consideration to the information Fine Gael has presented to the House.</P>

      <P>I advise Members that the list of amendments circulated this morning contains a number of incorrect line references. The list of amendments has been reprinted with the correct line references and recirculated to Members. The correct list has a note on the top right-hand corner of the cover. There is one correction to be made to the reprinted list. The lead on amendment No. 92 should read &ldquo;In page 40 to delete lines 17 to 25 and to substitute the following:&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Ó Snodaigh is out of order as it amounts to a direct negative. Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Costello arises out of Committee proceedings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)&nbsp;This Act in so far as it relates to extradition and the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2001 may be cited together as the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2003.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was tabled by my colleague, Deputy Costello, in order to be helpful in the drafting of the legislation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, did not accept it on Committee Stage and no doubt I will get a negative response now. When the Minister is replying, will he consider re-stating or consolidating the extradition Acts, as there is a great variety of legislation in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation will have a significant effect on the 1965 Extradition Act. We saw the debacle created around that Act when Dominic McGlinchey was extradited from this State to Northern Ireland and a few months later extradited back again. There were several similar cases, including Robert Russell and Dessie Ellis and a host of other people who came before the courts on the extradition issue. At the time, the 1965 Extradition Act was shown to be full of holes. The case law established around the cases mentioned served to tighten up the legislation. At a time when we have probably reached some semblance of understanding between the Judiciary and people before the courts on this type of issue, we are being presented with legislation which has the potential for unravelling the situation again. That is not wise.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has knowledge of these matters because he acted for many republicans at the time. I commend him for his success in many of those cases, though I am somewhat saddened that his views have changed as much as they have done in recent times. This Bill is unnecessary and it is wrong to introduce it at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is correct in anticipating that I will not accept the amendment, but I considered the matter overnight, as I told Deputy Costello I would. It would not be helpful to cite this Act as part of the Extradition Act. The Bill before us is a fundamentally different concept. It is a European framework directive on arrest warrants. It does not relate to extradition as historically understood between member states. I accept that Part III of the Extradition Act of 1965 was also concerned with rendition on warrants rather than formal extradition, but it is the view of the draughtsman and of my Department, which I share, that it would not help simply to say that this is part of our extradition law.</P>
      <P>The point of the framework decision is to replace the concept of extradition with rendition on a court to court basis on foot of warrants, rather than on a country to country basis, as implied by extradition as a term.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raises an interesting question as to whether the extradition Acts be the subject of a consolidation or re-statement. They should be, because these Acts are a prime candidate for a re-statement in accordance with the statute law re-statement legislation now at hand. Extradition law is currently to be found in a number of different statutes. It would be a very useful exercise if the laws could be either consolidated or restated. That is a matter I will consider, and I will find out if the statute law revision unit in the Attorney General's office would recommend a single re-statement of the extradition law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morgan is correct in saying that as a member of the Irish Bar I represented many clients of many political hues. The fact that I represented them reflects only that I was adhering to&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was adhering to the ethical obligations of my profession, which are to represent clients whom I am competent to represent, regardless of whether I agree with them or not. It is true that on many occasions when practising at the criminal Bar, I have represented members of what would be termed the republican movement.</P>
      <P>Regarding this framework decision, the law on extradition between Ireland and the United Kingdom, which was set out in Part III of the Extradition Act of 1965, was on the basis similar to that of the legislation before us, of Irish courts honouring United Kingdom warrants. That was the law. From 1965 to 1976, and thereafter, it was generally assumed that there could be no rendition on these warrants in respect of what were termed political or revenue offences. In the context of the Sunningdale Agreement, efforts were made to secure rendition between the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of offences in which the political exception was frequently cited. A commission was then established between the two countries in which lawyers from both sides tried to work out whether it was constitutionally permissible, or permissible under international law, for rendition on warrants of this kind to occur.</P>
      <P>It was as a result of a disagreement between the expert panel of lawyers from both sides that the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 was enacted. It sought to avoid the extradition for political offences question by conferring on the Irish courts jurisdiction to deal with cases which were committed in Northern Ireland, provided they were scheduled offences under that Act. It was not until 1987 and 1989 that the question of political offences again arose in the Legislature. At that stage under the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, the political offence exception to extradition was narrowed down very considerably.</P>
      <P>It should be clearly understood by the House that the European Union has now developed to a point that the member states have agreed among themselves that the political offence exception has no future in European interstate relations regarding whether fugitive offenders should or should not be sent for trial in member states by other member states. That is the new position. It means that if one shoots or bombs somebody or engages in any other activity which is a criminal offence to which the European arrest warrant framework decision applies, one cannot resist being sent from one country to another to face trial for that offence by simply claiming it was politically motivated.</P>
      <P>For an offence to be the subject of a European arrest warrant, it either must fit within the list of positive offences which are cited in Article 2.2 of the framework decision or, alternatively, it must be an offence which is punishable under our law. That the offence was politically motivated will no longer be a ground for resisting rendition on foot of a warrant to anywhere in the European Union, including the United Kingdom. The same applies to taxation offences. The old rule in Buchanan and McVeigh that people could not be extradited for revenue offences has likewise been abrogated.</P>
      <P>From 1 January 2004, as part of the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice, people who engage in serious criminal offences, even for a political motive, will be liable to be sent to face trial or to complete their sentences regardless of whether their motivation was political. Does that mean that everybody in every circumstance would be liable to be extradited regardless of the political dimension? It might be that in certain cases, a case could be made that it would be contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights to send somebody for trial in a state if the political character of the circumstances of the offence was such that it would amount to a denial of his or her human rights to be made accountable for the particular offence in question. That is a highly exceptional and unusual possibility.</P>
      <P>Things which were in the past regarded as a political offence such as, for instance, shooting policemen, letting off bombs or being in possession of firearms or the like, will be the subject of state to state rendition. I do not agree with Deputy Morgan's implication that the case law which existed under the 1965 Act and the subsequent Acts are of value and should be retained. What Ireland has agreed to as part of the development of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, is that a political offence exception should no longer form part of our law when we are dealing with partner states in the European Union with whom we closely co-operate and whose systems of law we trust.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete line 17 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)&nbsp;This Act shall not come into operation until such time as all other European Union Member States have enacted similar legislation, and until such time as the Human Rights Commissions or equivalent bodies in each Member State have certified according to the procedures of their respective national parliaments that the safeguards provided therein are acceptable, and that the protections available are equivalent between Member States.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is to delay the coming into operation of this legislation when it is passed until all member states have enacted similar legislation. At this stage, only four out of 15 member states have passed similar legislation. The Minister spoke about another four yesterday on Committee Stage but that still leaves another seven about which there is no information. The legislation should be conditional upon the human rights commissions or equivalent bodies in the member states. The national parliaments should provide the acceptable safeguards and the protections should be equivalent between member states.</P>
      <P>The introduction of EU arrest warrants was proposed at the Tampere summit in 1999. It was discussed in the context of an EU legal system harmonisation over a period of a decade or so. Sinn Féin has opposed in principle the harmonisation of the EU legal system. There is a contradiction in the Minister's position as he has frequently defended the superiority of the Irish constitutional guarantees over other European systems and has argued the need to protect the integrity of the Irish system which has been developed since the foundation of the State. In this context I fail to understand how the Minister can possibly justify this harmonisation in the absence of an upwards harmonisation of safeguards.</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Commission has pointed out that the framework decision was based on a flawed presumption of effective and equivalent protections between member states. The Minister will know that this equivalence does not exist throughout the European Union and is not likely to exist in the short-term. Turkey will be accepted into the European Union without that country achieving a better standard of human rights protection which it will not achieve at present and is not likely to achieve in the near future. If such countries are accepted into Europe, the equivalence of safeguards in human rights will not exist. I ask how the Minister can justify measures which will reduce judicial scrutiny by Irish courts. He must understand that this is part of a broader drive towards the integration of an EU legal system and ultimately an EU superstate federation. That is the proposal being planned by some of the architects of the future Europe.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand the difference between this proposal and the slippery slope of harmonisation of taxation measures which has been denounced by the Minister's PD colleague, the Tánaiste. They are similar harmonisation proposals.</P>
      <P>Even the Minister's colleague, Mr. Paul Higgins, senior counsel, has expressed concerns about this measure. When one considers what the Minister has stated previously concerning the need to ensure the integrity of the judicial system, his position on this matter is fundamentally contradictory. There is no contradiction between our opposition to unnecessary judicial integration leading to an EU super state and our support for the harmonisation of rights and safeguards across the European Union. This position is perfectly in keeping with the harmonisation of rights and safeguards on this island through the introduction of an all-Ireland charter of rights, and with our commitment to greater human rights standards across the globe. However, this measure is taking a step away from this. Ultimately, we are not merely aiming at the reunification of this island but also the global harmonisation of rights and safeguards on the basis that everyone should enjoy equal rights.</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Commission has provided an opinion on the legislation for the Minister. Its analysis concludes that not only was the framework decision fundamentally flawed but also that the original scheme paid insufficient regard to the protection of human rights. I welcome the new safeguards provided for by the Minister, including a number of additional ones accepted yesterday on Committee Stage. Even with all these safeguards, however, the Bill is likely to diminish constitutional protections concerning extradition. If it is to proceed under those conditions, it will be unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Commission's conclusions must be taken seriously. That is one of the reasons I have moved this amendment which would allow for a delay in the Bill coming into operation. The Government maintains that it has had limited discretion in framing it but it does have the option of delaying its enactment. The Human Rights Commission's report states:</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Commission is aware of the limited legislative discretion afforded to the Oireachtas. However, the Human Rights Commission is also aware that the preamble to the framework decision makes reference to both the existing human rights protections in member states and those guaranteed by the treaty of the European Union, which in turns makes reference to the ECHR paragraph 12 of the preamble, which states: &ldquo;This framework decision does not prevent a member state from applying its constitutional rules relating to due process, freedom of association, freedom of the press and freedom of expression&rdquo;. Article 13 of the Framework Document goes on to state that &ldquo;This framework decision shall not have the effect of modifying the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in article 6 of the treaty of the European Union. Article 6 of the treaty of the European Union states that the union shall respect fundamental rights as guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights, and as they result from constitutional traditions common to the member states, as general principles of community law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's lack of a comprehensive response to the concerns raised by the Human Rights Commission, and the fact that he has not addressed all of the commission's concerns in the amendments, are appalling. The implication is that the opinion of the commission is of little value, that human rights concerns should not guide the framing of legislation, and that the Minister does not accept that legislation should be human rights proofed.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister has failed to do so, I am forced to move such amendments in the hope they will be accepted. Even though my party opposes the Bill in principle, in the short time we have had to table amendments, I have attempted to ensure that if the Bill is to become law, it will include the best possible guarantees of protection. Many of my amendments address issues raised by the Human Rights Commission but the rushed nature of the debate has not allowed us to have a proper discussion. We are now attempting to discuss 93 amendments in the space of 90 minutes. The Bill was rushed through Second and Committee Stages in order to facilitate its passing by an arbitrary deadline by which it does not have to be passed. However, because many other EU directives will not be passed by the time Ireland assumes the EU Presidency on 1 January we could have taken our time to debate the Bill properly, teasing it out to ensure all the questions raised by the commission are addressed properly and effectively. It is not sufficient to deal with the legislation in such a short period. Legislation framed in haste results in bad law, which is even worse.</P>
      <P>There are flaws in the Bill and the Minister has tabled amendments. The fact that he is still coming up with new amendments right up to the last minute is deplorable because, barring the two amendments left over from Committee Stage yesterday, they deal with new issues. That is not good enough. Yesterday we were landed with many amendments for which we did not have time to pay attention. The House should be able to scrutinise legislation properly and raise matters of concern in order that we can stand over it once enacted. We cannot do so if legislation is rushed through the House, particularly in the case of technical Bills such as this.</P>

      <P>While the Minister has used the 1 January deadline as an excuse, other Deputies, including myself, have succeeded in ensuring that at least there has been some discussion on relevant points. If the Bill is passed without amendment No. 3, it will accelerate the extradition process between member states and, in some cases, with third countries, making it nearly automatic in some instances. Most of the traditional grounds for refusing extradition are abolished, including the political offence exception. The Bill abolishes the dual criminality requirement for large categories of crime. It also disapplies the speciality rule and the re-extradition rule in a number of circumstances. The Human Rights Commission is not convinced that the safeguards are adequate. The Bill must not be viewed in isolation but as part of the repressive package of measures known as the so-called EU anti-terrorism road map.</P>
      <P>Even though it concerns sensitive issues of fundamental rights, the Bill has not been dealt with properly and is being fast-tracked. I oppose it as well as the framework decision on which it is based. My party will be voting against it later tonight. We tabled a motion to seek to delay it going beyond Second Stage to ensure a proper debate because we knew then that the Government would be rushing it through the House. Deputy Deasy is shaking his head. I will conclude to allow him speak.</P>

      <P>The whole Bill should be opposed. If not, the Minister should take the opportunity to adopt this measure. We can then ensure that the equivalent human rights protections are included from the day the Bill's provisions come into operation. We should delay the coming into operation of the provisions until all the European states are harmonised upwards in terms of human rights standards and procedures and we have the safeguards that are necessary to build a Europe which deserves our support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the points made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, I want to be orderly and not depart too much from the scope of his amendment but the amendment itself is inconsistent with the provisions of the framework decision, which require all member states to enact a law to give effect to it by 31 December of this year. I could not say I was complying with my obligation under EU law if I brought in an Act which would not operate until every other member state had complied with its obligation to enact similar legislation. That would not be appropriate or reconcilable with our European law obligations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Snodaigh also quoted from recital 12 of the framework decision. He said he would not quote <i>in extenso</i> from the report of the Human Rights Commission but it is worthwhile pointing out that recital 12 in the framework decision states:</P>
      <P>This Framework Decision respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Chapter VI thereof. Nothing in this Framework Decision [I stress this point] may be interpreted as prohibiting refusal to surrender a person for whom a European arrest warrant has been issued when there are reasons to believe, on the basis of objective elements, that the said arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on the grounds of his or her sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation, or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.</P>
      <P>I stress the term &ldquo;or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In terms of transposing this provision into Irish law, I draw Deputy Ó Snodaigh's attention to Part 3, section 37 of the Bill, which states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be surrendered under this Act if&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;his or her surrender would be incompatible with the State's obligations under&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)&nbsp;the Convention, or</P>
      <P>(ii)&nbsp;the Protocols to the Convention [which is the European Convention on Human Rights]</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;his or her surrender would constitute a contravention of any provision of the Constitution (other than for the reason that the offence specified in the European arrest warrant is an offence to which <i>section 38(1)(b)</i> applies),</P>
      <P>The next paragraph is of relevance because it deals exactly with the point raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. It states:</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;there are reasonable grounds for believing that&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)&nbsp;the European arrest warrant was issued in respect of the person for the purposes of facilitating his or her prosecution or punishment in the issuing state for reasons connected with his or her sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinion or sexual orientation, or</P>
      <P>(ii)&nbsp;in the prosecution or punishment of the person in the issuing state, he or she will be treated less favourably than a person who&ndash;</P>
      <P>(I)&nbsp;is not of his or her sex, race, religion, nationality or ethnic origin,</P>
      <P>(II)&nbsp;does not hold the same political opinions as him or her,</P>
      <P>(III)&nbsp;speaks a different language than he or she does, or</P>
      <P>(IV)&nbsp;does not have the same sexual orientation,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(iii)&nbsp;were the person to be surrendered to the issuing state&ndash;</P>
      <P>(I)&nbsp;he or she would be sentenced to death . . .  or</P>
      <P>(II)&nbsp;he or she would be tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment.</P>
      <P>We have taken the recital from this framework decision and will have embodied it into our substantive law when this legislation is enacted. There is a clear, unequivocal and absolute prohibition on the extradition of any Irish person or any other person in Ireland to any other member state or their rendition on foot of a warrant if any of those circumstances apply, and we have handed to our independent courts the protection of every individual on those grounds.</P>
      <P>People talk about the protections we have put in place on foot of the framework decision. We have used every mechanism available to us in the framework, including the language of its own recitals, to ensure that no person will be surrendered by the State to any other member state on foot of a European arrest warrant where any of those possibilities exist to a substantial extent in the mind of an independent Irish courts system. What more does anybody in this House want by way of protection? We entrust to our courts the protection of everyone, citizen and non-citizen, by reference to those grounds.</P>
      <P>One can conjure up any scenario but I cannot imagine more strongly worded and firm-minded protections for individuals than we have put into this legislation. It may be that we have created a lawyer's charter for the future, and some people may be critical of us because these issues are now litigable before the Irish courts, but we have taken the language of the framework decision at face value and taken some of its recitals and made them our substantive law so that people would be protected from extradition. Those rights apply regardless of the fact that a state may or may not be admitted or may or may not be a member of the European Union. Those rights, which are embodied in this statute, will apply to every person in respect of whom a European arrest warrant is issued by any other member state.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to refer to Part III because this is not just something which might arise in a case. It is a positive duty imposed on every case that comes before the Irish courts that there should be no surrender, to use a phrase, under this legislation unless and until these hurdles are got over. I do not know what greater protection of human rights could have been put into this legislation. The Parliamentary Counsel in my Department and in the Attorney General's office and I have made sure that every possible defence for human rights and civil liberties, and every possible defence based on discrimination or threat to human rights, would be included in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Snodaigh has also raised the question of the Human Rights Commission's critique of this legislation. I want the record to clearly indicate that when that critique came to hand it was taken very seriously. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as does every other Department but particularly my Department, takes seriously any critique the Human Rights Commission offers of any legislation. At my request, all of the individual arguments, criticisms and points were analysed in tabular form to determine if they were valid, invalid, covered by any portion of the Bill or whatever. It is not correct to say that in some sense we have been cavalier or ignored the views of the commission. We have taken them very much on board but in so far as the commission criticised the process leading to the adoption of the framework decision, we are bound by the adoption of the framework decision, and this House, in the lifetime of the last Dáil, voted for the framework to become binding on the Irish State. Subject to this, we have included everything possible in the legislation to protect the rights and liberties of individuals without making the whole system unworkable.</P>
      <P>Without wishing in any way to be prejudiced by its adoption, we have taken every letter, word and phrase in the text of the framework agreement which gives us the right to uphold the human rights of individuals &ndash; these are stated and acknowledged by the framework decision &ndash; to ensure they have a concrete and real defence. We have not, as we could perhaps have done, vested in the Minister of the day, for example, the right to interfere with a warrant on foot of these grounds but given this role to the courts. We have stated these issues &ldquo;must&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;, be taken into account by the courts which &ldquo;must&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;, refuse to extradite if they find that any of the dangers outlined are present in a particular case. We could not have gone further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Snodaigh may have a rooted objection to the principle of the legislation in the first place but he should at least acknowledge that Part 3, particularly section 37 to which I referred, goes as far as any member state of the European Union, and further than most, in protecting the freedoms and rights of people in respect of whom arrest warrants are issued.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested the legislation was the slippery slope to the creation of a European superstate and that this particular measure was part of an inexorable process of integration leading towards some form of European superstate with a uniform criminal law. I repeat my comment on Committee Stage last night that two broad strategies were open to member states at the Tampere Council meeting, one of which was to develop an area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of uniformity and approximation, whereas the other was to adopt a wholly different approach, namely, to create the area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of mutual recognition of systems, while at the same time preserving to the greatest possible extent the autonomy of member states to determine their own criminal law and criminal law procedure. The latter, the line taken by the Government, prevailed.</P>
      <P>The legislation is the exemplification of this approach because it operates on the basis that member states respect and recognise each other's decisions and orders and co-operate among themselves, while at the same time retaining the right to determine their own criminal law and criminal law procedure. It was also the position taken by the Government in respect of justice and home affairs matters at the recent Intergovernmental Council meeting.</P>
      <P>I reject, therefore, the suggestion that this is the slippery slope or carries with it the implication that Ireland is somehow submitting to anaesthesia in order that it can slip quietly into some form of European superstate with a single criminal law. Nothing could be further from the truth. Having regard to the provisions of section 37 when they come into effect, no state in the European Union will have a higher degree of real and substantial protection for those who seek the protection of its courts.</P>

      <P>While I may have rambled a little, I did acknowledge that the Minister had taken on board some, though not all, of the Human Rights Commission's concerns. I welcome the fact that he takes such a positive view of the commission's report and that each aspect was thoroughly examined.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated we must pass this legislation by 1 January. As I stated yesterday, there is no legal consequence for Ireland in this case if it refuses to incorporate this enabling legislation, as I understand third pillar measures do not currently come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Therefore, no proceedings could be taken against Ireland if the Government was to state our national Parliament had decided that the legislation was unacceptable on the basis that its safeguards were inadequate and that it would undermine constitutional rights.</P>
      <P>As I stated, most member states will not have passed the required legislation by 1 January. What will happen to them? The Minister mentioned the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; of Germany, France, Italy and, I believe, Spain, none of which will have passed the legislation on 1 January. Why will they not be punished? They have shown that directives can be ignored. The Stability and Growth Pact has also been ignored by several larger states, yet the institutions of the European Union have not collapsed around us. The Minister has stated this is the best we can come up with. Having set the standard, we should demand that it be met by all other member states and delay the legislation until such time as this demand is realised.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to the definition of &ldquo;judicial authority&rdquo;. We are concerned about the use of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; not being qualified in any way so we are seeking to qualify it by the insertion of the phrase &ldquo;exercising judicial functions&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would look at the amendment again. However, the more I look at it, the happier I am to leave the Bill in its present form. Judicial authority is given the extended meaning of: &ldquo;. . . the judge, magistrate or other person authorised by the law of the Member State concerned to perform functions the same as or similar to those performed under <i>section 33</i> by a court in the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be too technical but one must first apply the rule of construction or reading, which is called the <i>justum generis</i> rule. A <i>justum generis</i> rule means that where one uses a phrase such as &ldquo;the judge, magistrate or other person&rdquo;, the phrase &ldquo;or other person&rdquo; is construed as having the same broad category as the first two nouns in the phrase. If that were not the case, it would simply mean a person and there would be no point having the terms &ldquo;judge&rdquo; or &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; in front of it.</P>
      <P>In this context, the term is delimited to a person &ldquo;authorised under the law of the Member State concerned to perform functions the same as or similar to those performed under <i>section 33</i> by a court in the State&rdquo;. Section 33 relates to the function of issuing an arrest warrant. I wish to ensure the provision is as flexible as possible to accommodate differences in structures in different legal systems. In some countries a warrant is issued by a judge, in others it is issued by a magistrate and in others it is issued by a court. There could be some other similar person in another system, such as a procurator, and I do not wish to delimit the ambit of the section or to confine it unreasonably in any way, provided the legal system of a member state confers on the person the function similar to the Irish court's function in section 33. Having regard to the <i>justum generis</i> rule, I am satisfied it will not be simply anybody who can issue a warrant but somebody with a similar function to the judicial function in the Irish system.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to accept the amendment. I can offer the Deputy an example. The Director of Public Prosecutions has to act in a quasi-judicial manner but could not be said to be carrying out a judicial function in, for example, deciding to send a case to the Special Criminal Court or not. These are functions which are peculiar to the Irish system. Whereas in other countries those decisions might be made by courts, in Ireland they are not. I am anxious that this legislation be as flexible as possible to accommodate the diverse systems of criminal justice in the European Union without creating a trap or loophole by which the scope of the legislation is narrowed unnecessarily. I am satisfied with the provision as it stands.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 27, to delete &ldquo;or Gibraltar&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Gibraltar is not a member state and should not appear in the explanatory section of the Bill, any more than Jersey, the Isle of Man and other such states or principalities such as Sardinia, Andorra and San Marino. The European Union has 15 member states at present and on 1 May next year it will have an extra ten members, with more to follow. Perhaps Gibraltar will be one of them when it declares its independence. So far it has only declared its independence of Spain but not of Britain. It does not, therefore, fit into this provision and should be removed.</P>

      <P>Article 33 of the framework decision, which we are obliged to implement, provides that the framework decision shall apply to Gibraltar. If it is to extend to Gibraltar, although Gibraltar is not in the ordinary sense of the term a member state of the European Union, we must either insert the phrase, &ldquo;This shall also apply to Gibraltar&rdquo;, into every section or give a special extended meaning to the term &ldquo;member state&rdquo; to cover Gibraltar. That is what we have done. Deputy Ó Snodaigh may have an objection to Gibraltar featuring separately in the legislation but the framework decision makes that distinction. It is necessary to make provision for Gibraltar and the neatest way to do it is to extend the meaning of &ldquo;member state&rdquo; to cover Gibraltar.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 9, to delete &ldquo;and (3)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is related to amendment No. 10. The section as drafted provides for the retrospective application of European arrest warrants for offences carried out prior to the legislation coming into effect. The Minister said he took on board most of the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Commission. The commission still maintains that there is a strong argument that all persons subject to extradition requests should be afforded equal protection, a right that is protected under Article 40.2 of the Constitution. The commission cited the case of McMahon <i>v.</i> Leahy, where the Supreme Court held that the extradition of a person in respect of a specific offence is prohibited where an application for the offence of another person in relation to the same offence has already been refused. This is based on a principle of equal treatment under Article 40 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The rule in the McMahon <i>v.</i> Leahy case protects persons from being transferred to another state in regard to an offence committed if the transfer of other persons for the same offence has been refused previously. In keeping with this analysis, amendments Nos. 9 and 10 propose strengthening equality before the law regarding the differences in extradition standards and equality between persons charged with the same offence.</P>

I am not attracted to that argument in the context of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I not only seek to strengthen equality before the law, but to delete the section so that if extradition comes into effect it will deal from now on with cases that are not retrospective, in order to ensure equality between persons charged with the same offence, and equality before the law in respect of differences in extradition standards throughout the European Union. These are differences on which we have already focused. I ask the Minister to look at the case the Commission on Human Rights cited to see whether it has implications for the section. The Supreme Court case of McMahon <i>v.</i> Leahy held that the extradition of a person in respect of a specific offence is prohibited where an application for the extradition of other persons in respect of that offence has been refused.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes to delete section 4(4). Subsection (4) states that the Act shall not apply in respect of a European arrest warrant issued by a member state before the commencement of Parts 1, 2 and 3.

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;an offence will be considered a corresponding offence for the purposes of <i>paragraph (a)</i> only if it corresponds in all its component aspects with an offence under the law of the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that it is the general legal principle that an extradition may only be executed in respect of an alleged or committed offence where that offence in all its constituent aspects is also an offence in Irish law. This is contained in sections 10, 43 and 47 of the Extradition Act 1965. It was developed later in court findings in two extradition cases, namely, Furlong <i>v.</i> Kelly in the 1970s and Wyatt <i>v.</i> McLoughlin. The test for equivalence is whether all the agreements required when assessing if an Irish offence has been committed also exists in respect of the offence in the requesting state. The Commission on Human Rights concluded that the Bill as drafted was unclear as to whether the existing position in Irish law was protected and it requested to clarify the amendment. I propose the amendment in order to state more clearly that an offence for which a warrant is issued must correspond in all its component aspects with an offence under Irish law. There are many offences, and different sentences, throughout the European Union for which we do not have legislation. Offences in other countries, which are not criminal offences, would carry heavy penalties in these countries. The amendment seeks to include protection and clarify that the offence for which a warrant is issued must correspond in all its component aspects with an offence under Irish law.</P>

      <P>I did not mean to be dismissive. I was looking at a different amendment. On the points the Deputy raised, I believe the existing language of the section is sufficient. I do not know what extra distinction the Deputy is trying to arrive at by proposing that all the component parts should correspond with an offence under the law of the State. It appears this is designed to introduce extra artificial constraints in the operation of the European arrest warrant. If offences correspond, it should be sufficient. Substantial correspondence should be enough. I do not consider that including the words &ldquo;all component parts&rdquo; improves the text.</P>
      <P>It may be that in one country something is expressed to be an offence with four ingredients which corresponds to an offence comprising three different ingredients in the law of another country. I do not want to cause a totally artificial legal obstacle to the operation of the European arrest warrant by requiring that states arrive at correspondence by exactly the same route.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 16 to 18 are in the name of my colleague, Deputy Costello. Deputy Ó Snodaigh is seeking to delete section 10, while we are seeking to tidy it up and make it more precise and more in line with the extradition legislation. Amendment No. 16 provides that a warrant should only be addressed to Ireland in respect of people who are in Ireland. As the Bill refers only to criminal proceedings, we feel that the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; should be in the text of this section, hence amendment No. 17. No. 18 deals with the possibility that a sentence may not be enforceable &ndash; because it is under appeal, for example &ndash; and provides that only an immediately enforceable sentence is included under this section. All the amendments are designed to tidy up the section and render its intention more accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment seeks to remove the obligation of the State to surrender persons in respect of whom valid arrest warrants are issued. One can view it two ways. The Deputy rather optimistically says this would not affect the substance of the Bill. I presume he is implying that if this obligation was taken away there would somehow be an option left &ndash; that people might decide, if the humour took them, to surrender people in respect of warrants. The question of who is to be capable of exercising such a broad discretion is not clear.</P>
      <P>Section 10 provides that certain persons are liable, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the framework decision, to be arrested and surrendered. If they were not liable to be arrested and surrendered the Act would become largely unusable. In this context, I draw the attention of the House to section 11(3), which has not been mentioned much in our proceedings. It states:</P>
      <P>Where a European arrest warrant is issued in the issuing state in respect of a person who has not been convicted of the offence specified therein, the European arrest warrant shall, be accompanied by&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;an undertaking in writing of the issuing judicial authority that the surrender of that person is sought for the purpose, only, of his or her being charged with, and tried for, the offence concerned, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;a statement in writing of the issuing judicial authority that&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)&nbsp;the person has been charged and a decision to try him or her for the offence concerned has been made, or</P>
      <P>(ii)&nbsp;a decision to charge the person and try him or her for the offence concerned has been made.</P>
      <P>These two provisions are supposed to reflect the declaration made by Ireland at the time the framework decision was adopted that we would not extradite people for other purposes such as participating in a criminal inquiry, principally because we were concerned that under one construction of the framework decision it would be open to member states to seek the extradition of people to participate in an inquisitorial process other than their trial. That may go some way towards alleviating Deputy O'Sullivan's concerns.</P>
      <P>In the matter of amendment No. 16, it is not the intention of the Government to accept an amendment which would have the effect of providing that only a warrant that was Ireland-specific could be acted upon. If, for example, a child abductor went on the run from the United Kingdom and was believed to be either in Ireland, France or Belgium, the same arrest warrant should be capable of being executed in each of those countries at the request of the UK. This would be preferable to obliging the UK to issue separate country-specific warrants, which is not the intention of the framework decision.</P>
      <P>It is expected that if Ireland is to act on a Greek arrest warrant we will be provided with a translation, but provision has been made in an amendment I moved on Committee Stage for the requirement for translation to be restricted in certain circumstances, so that if at some future date the European countries decide the arrest warrant need only be in one or two languages of the EU, for example French and English, and that it does not need to be translated into the official languages of 25 member states, our law will be capable of dealing with that.</P>
      <P>To return to the country-specific arrest warrant which Deputy O'Sullivan is proposing, I do not think we should narrow down the scope of the arrest warrant. It is implicit in the framework decision that a single arrest warrant could be sent to a number of member states, albeit accompanied by a translation. I do not think it should be necessary for a country to be sure a person is in Ireland before it transmits an arrest warrant to Ireland. When fugitive offenders are being hunted one must operate under a number of different hypotheses &ndash; individual member states should operate on the contingency that the fugitive is in that country.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to the amendment in the name of Deputy Ó Snodaigh because it would render the Act unworkable. Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments are not required or would be too restrictive.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)&nbsp;The Central Authority shall ensure that a copy of a European arrest warrant and of any undertaking required to be given under this Act is made available to a person named in the European arrest warrant in a language he or she understands.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is to be expected that if the person arrested has not got the warrant in a language he or she can understand, the legal team would have access to a document detailing the exact nature of the offence and transmit it to the person and would have the ability to put forward a case on whether to proceed with the extradition, to accept the request with which he or she has been served or to accede to it without recourse to a court challenge. It is a natural provision.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 23 has the same wording as amendment No. 19 but seeks to be inserted in a different part of the Bill. Whether it appears here or where Deputy Costello wishes it to appear is irrelevant. It needs to be stated in the Bill that a person facing extradition or an arrest warrant should have a document served on him or her which he or she can understand. That would not be very difficult. If one goes through the process of drawing up such an arrest warrant the language of the person being sought would most likely be known to the authorities seeking the arrest and transportation to another state. Therefore, they could prepare the document in advance and have it served by the arresting authority in another state. In that way the rights of the person arrested would be protected. That would be the correct procedure in this case and it would set a standard which we should try to live up to.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment because it goes beyond what is required by the framework decision. The provisions in the Bill address adequately the matter about which the Deputy is concerned and I agree it is an issue about which we should be concerned. Where a person is arrested and also at his or her first appearance before the court he or she will be informed of his or her right to obtain or be provided with, where appropriate, the services of an interpreter. A person will be given an interpreter at the time of arrest and at the time he or she is first before the court. Our view is that it will be the function of the interpreter to explain and translate for the person in question any documents or exhibits relevant to the proper conduct of his or her case.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to accept amendment No. 23 on the same grounds. Where a person is arrested and also at his or her appearance before the court he or she will be informed of his or her right to obtain or be provided with, where appropriate, the services of an interpreter. In my judgment, it is implicit in the clear obligation under the statute to provide an interpreter, that all of these documents will be translated for a person who cannot understand them. The effect of what has been proposed by the amendments in the names of Deputies Costello and Ó Snodaigh is already provided for.</P>
      <P>There are a number of typographical amendments I wish to make to the Bill which do not in any way change the meaning of the legislation:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 11, to move the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; up to line 10,</P>

I measc na ndaoine ar theip orthu, bhí daoine a raibh leibhéal onóracha acu san ardteistiméireacht nó a raibh béim á cur acu ar an Ghaeilge, chomh maith le daoine ón Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>An rud atá i gceist anseo do na múinteoirí ná nach bhfuil cúrsaí nó ranganna curtha ar fáil ag an Roinn Oideachais do mhúinteoirí nach bhfuil aon eolas acu ar an Ghaeilge. Más mian leis an múinteoir freastal ar rang, caithfidh sé nó sí féin rang a fháil. Níl na ranganna nó cúrsaí sin dírithe ar an SCG. Níl aon siollabas speisialta leagtha amach nó tacaíocht speisialta ar fáil nuair a bhíonn na múinteoirí ag ullmhú don scrúdú. Más rud é go bhfuil an Roinn i ndáiríre faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge, ba cheart go mbeadh sé mar aidhm aici cabhrú leis na múinteoirí agus spreagadh a thabhairt dóibh pas a fháil sa scrúdú.</P>
      <P>Tugann na múinteoirí siúd a bhfuil traenáil faighte acu scileanna éagsúla don scoil agus don seomra ranga. Tá sé riachtanach anois go mbeadh athrú sa scéim más mian leis an Roinn na múinteoirí sin a bhfuil na cáilíochta acu a choinneáil i mbun múinteoireachta. Caithfidh an Roinn athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an scrúdú agus scrúdú a bhfuil baint aige le caighdeán oiriúnach a chur ar fáil. Tá gá le siollabas soiléir ionas go mbeidh múinteoirí ábalta é a leanúint nuair a bhíonn siad ag ullmhú don scrúdú. Is gá leis an Roinn cúrsaí a chur ar fáil dóibh siúd atá ag tosnú ar fhoghlaim na Gaeilge chomh maith le dóibh siúd a bhfuil Gaeilge níos fearr acu.</P>
      <P>Tá ganntanas múinteoirí faoi láthair. Tá baol ann, má leanann an Roinn ar aghaidh leis an scrúdú mar atá sé anois, go gcaithfidh cuid múinteoirí postanna eile a lorg. Tá neart múinteoirí sármhaithe ag obair i scoileanna ina bhfuil a lán míbhuntáistí agus fadhbanna sóisialta. Níl sé sin mar ghnáthscoil. Tá deacrachtaí ann faoi láthair múinteoirí a earcú agus a choimeád sna scoileanna sin. Más rud é go gcuirtear constaic eile ina dtreo, fágfaidh siad an mhúinteoireacht, agus is iad na daoine a chaillfidh an chuid is mó ná na páistí. Ní bheidh na scoileanna sin ábalta múinteoirí a earcú nó a choimeád. Mar sin, tá mé ag impí ar an Aire an scrúdú sin a athrú inniu agus geallúint a thabhairt go mbeidh scrúdú, siollabas, cúrsaí agus caighdeán oirúnach ar fáil do na múinteoirí a bhfuil postanna sealadacha acu anois agus atá ag tabhairt seirbhís iontach do na páistí agus na scoileanna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position regarding the examination in Irish, the Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge, taken by teachers who have obtained their teaching qualifications abroad. The SCG is an Irish examination which provides an opportunity for teachers trained outside the State to acquire the qualification in Irish that is necessary for recognition as a teacher in mainstream classes in national schools. Teachers in national schools are generalists rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged from four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy the Department of Education and Science that they are competent to teach the Irish language and the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
      <P>The standard required to obtain a pass in the exam is the standard of Irish that would enable teachers to teach the language to sixth class in a national school. Candidates must, therefore, demonstrate that they have attained the level of language competence described in the syllabus and reflected in the examination papers, and that they understand the methodology of teaching Irish as a second language. It should be borne in mind that many primary schools not only teach Irish but have Irish as the principal language of instruction and communication generally. The number of such schools has grown significantly in recent years. A primary teacher may have to teach pupils whose mother tongue is Irish, or who are competent users of the language. Even when teaching Irish to pupils whose mother tongue is English or another language, it is widely accepted by language teachers that, in order to be effective, the teacher needs to have a very good command of the language.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science established a working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge in 2001. Institúid teangeolaíochta Éireann, the colleges of education, primary school management organisations, INTO, the primary school section of the National Parents Council, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were represented on this working group. Organisations were invited to submit proposals as part of the review of the exam and all such proposals were given full consideration by the working group in preparing its report.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group has been finalised and presented to the Department. To date the review group has drafted a revised syllabus which was circulated to all schools in December 2002. The examinations held in October this year were the first series of the new examinations to be based on this new syllabus.</P>
      <P>The review group has also drafted a handbook for the examination. It contains detailed information on, and will provide answers to, a wide range of questions raised by candidates. The review committee is also recommending changes to the content and format of the examination modules to take effect possibly from next autumn. It is also planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose.</P>
      <P>Some of the statistics the Deputy mentioned were significant and while not being an expert on the matter I gather from what she said it seems to be a matter of major concern. I will report what she said as best I can to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.</P>

      <P>Loreto secondary school in Balbriggan has an existing population of 1,025 students. At this stage the parents of 50 children have been informed by the school authorities that their applications for the enrolment of their daughters in the school in September 2004 have been unsuccessful and that they have been put on a waiting list. Some 550 of the students can be accommodated in suitable permanent accommodation within the school complex. A further 350 are accommodated in prefabs and portable free standing classrooms, which were provided as far back as 1994 and 1997, respectively, in a temporary capacity to ease the overcrowding problem that existed even at that stage. The balance of the students are taught in Marian House, which is a remnant of the old Loreto Convent. This building is more than 100 years old and is grossly inadequate for the education of the students.</P>
      <P>On 13 June 2002, a high level meeting took place at which the principal, the board of management and senior officials from the Department attended. The purpose of the meeting was to agree a programme for the submission of stage documents for the extension of Loreto secondary school. At the meeting the Department officials gave instructions to the school authorities and the design team to prepare and submit stage one documentation for the planning process for a new school. It was also agreed that if the documentation was in order permission would be given to proceed to stage two. It was envisaged that stage two documentation would be submitted in November 2002 and permission for stage three would be granted in January 2003. It was also outlined that the construction period would be approximately 14 to 16 months and it was hoped that the new school would be available in September 2005. The school proceeded accordingly in good faith.</P>
      <P>The members of the board of management and the teachers are reasonable, perhaps too reasonable, as they took on face value the promises made by Fianna Fáil prior to the last general election in respect of its commitment to provide a new school. Since the cutback in the new school building programme announced by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, earlier in the year, the board of management accepted that the original timescale would not be met. Notwithstanding this, its members expected that the 2004 building programme would give them the go ahead to proceed to the advanced architectural planning stage, which would facilitate builders being on site in 2005.</P>
      <P>The parents, students, teachers and board of management will be astounded that once again their school has been passed over in the 2004 school building programme published today. The programme indicates that in respect of Loreto secondary school, the extension will be at early architectural planning stage post 2004, whatever that means. This statement is an outrageous attack on the people of Balbriggan and the wider catchment area of the school, including Malahide, Donabate, Portrane, Lusk, Skerries and Rush. These are the areas from which parents have applied for the enrolment of their children in the school. The admission in the programme is particularly repulsive given the shortage of places for second level education in Fingal, especially for a single sex education. Furthermore, it is a disturbing development in view of the fact that Balbriggan is currently experiencing a building boom as a result of which its population will grow threefold to 30,000 in the next eight years. Some parents have moved into the area and are seeking second level education for their daughters.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy representing the area, I cannot accept the Minister's continued neglect of Loreto secondary school. The least that must be done is for authorisation to be given to the school to enable the planning stages to progress in 2004. It seems it would not involve any excess cost to the Department to enable the school to proceed through the various stages towards the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>The current position is unacceptable and it must be reviewed and reassessed. The board of management, teachers and parents have worked tirelessly to ensure the best possible education is provided for the students. Fantastic education is currently provided in the school facilities. The board of management, teachers and parents proceeded on the basis of the understanding they received, but they were let down. I hope the Minister of State's reply will go some way towards meeting their objectives.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, I wish to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science on the proposed extension for Loreto secondary school in Balbriggan.</P>
      <P>The 2004 school building programme has just been published and is available on the Department's website. The programme is a further major step in progressing the Government's consistent commitment over the past six years to deal with school accommodation needs. It details in excess of 170 significant school building projects that are being authorised to proceed to tender and construction in 2004.</P>
      <P>The building project at Loreto secondary school in Balbriggan is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme. The project has been assigned a band 3 rating in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. Projects listed in section 9 of the school building programme are at early stages of architectural planning. The project is currently at stage two, which is the outline sketch scheme stage of architectural planning.</P>
      <P>The Deputy outlined what has happened since June 2002. Although progress has not been made, as the Deputy has indicated, the programme will be updated early next year with details of how the additional &euro;30 million funding announced in the budget will be spent. It is thought that most of that funding will be spent on construction projects at second level. However, all projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme are being reviewed with a view to including them as part of a multiannual building programme from 2005 onwards. The Minister expects to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter next year.</P>
      <P>From my limited knowledge of Balbriggan, I know it is a greatly expanding area and there will be a great need for schools there into the future. However, according to the current criteria, this project, which has a band 3 rating, does not seem to be as far advanced as the Deputy would like. I will relate what he said to the Minister and, hopefully, there might be a better announcement in the future.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the matter of Scoil Mhuire agus Phádraig in Swinford. This is a mixed school of 520 pupils. There is a shortage of space in the school and there is no canteen. This is creating serious problems for pupils and staff and their families.</P>
      <P>The pupils are obliged to leave the school area and go downtown in Swinford for their lunch. Swinford probably holds a record for having the greatest number of public houses for a town its size. Pupils used to go for their lunch to the multitude of public houses in the town. This has greatly upset the parents and the teachers. In the absence of a school canteen the pupils had no choice, and were being driven to eat in the public houses. That was their only option.</P>
      <P>The school authorities were very anxious to sort this matter out. The teachers too were very unhappy with this unsatisfactory situation. They shared the parents' unease and their concern that the pupils should remain on the school grounds. The position has got particularly bad recently due to the new licensing laws. The pupils can no longer go to the pubs to eat, so they have nowhere to go. There is therefore a great need for a canteen in the school. The matter is acute and desperate.</P>
      <P>There is also an acute shortage of classroom space in the school. Four years ago, the boarding school was vacated and given over to the school board on the express condition that it be used for the purpose of education of the school students. The building was in very bad condition and the school authorities repaired the roof out of their own funds. They had no choice. It cost them &euro;35,000 but the work was essential because of the structural condition of the roof. The consulting engineer advised the school that if something was not done to repair it the building would certainly collapse. That was not acceptable. Not alone was the roof structurally unsound but it was also leaking. The school exhausted all its funds in the repair process and did not get a penny from the Government for these essential major works.</P>
      <P>Approximately two years ago, the school applied to the Department of Education and Science for improvement works to be done on the school. The school submitted plans. It also applied to the Taoiseach's Department, because the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, had visited the school some years previously.</P>
      <P>The necessary works comprise a canteen and recreation area on the second floor and three classrooms and a library on the ground floor, with a storage area on the second floor. The building to be converted, the old boarding school, is adjacent and joined to the existing school. Tobin Architects have costed the project at between &euro;350,000 and &euro;400,000. There is no need for planning permission as there is no change of usage for the building, a former boarding school. The canteen plan was added to the already submitted plan and replaces the recreation and tuck shop area previously applied for. It is in addition to the classroom space and storage area. This canteen plan conforms to all the latest health and safety legislation, as it should. It is urgently needed, as is the extra classroom space.</P>
      <P>The Minister might outline the present situation, when funding can be expected, the amount of funding possible, and where the small jobs scheme can be applied in addition to the works noted. The school has put in &euro;35,000 of its own funds and has exhausted those funds with no Government contribution. It now needs help for these essential improvements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can outline to the House the current position regarding the accommodation situation at Scoil Mhuire agus Phádraig secondary school in Swinford.</P>
      <P>The school came into operation as a result of an amalgamation of the existing secondary school, Meánscoil Mhuire agus Phádraig, and the local vocational school in August 1992. The amalgamated school is located in the former secondary school premises.</P>
      <P>An application for grant-aid towards improvement works, involving the upgrading of the old boarding school donated to the school by the Mercy Order to be used for the education of students, was received from the management authorities of Scoil Mhuire agus Phádraig in July 2001. The application sought funding for the refurbishment of the building to provide additional classrooms and an assembly area. The application was not progressed at that time due to the volume of demands on the post-primary capital budget.</P>
      <P>Officials in the Department are now re-examining this application. The Deputy will appreciate that before committing capital funding to any projects, the Department must be satisfied, having regard to all relevant factors including enrolment and demographic trends, that the school in question has a verifiable need for the additional accommodation sought. The Department officials will shortly be in consultation with the school authorities with a view to assessing the school's long-term accommodation needs. When the application has been fully assessed, a decision will be made, and if approved, the project will be considered for capital funding.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the timing of when individual projects can progress to architectural planning depends on the budgetary provision in any given year, the rate of progress with existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that an extension project including two science laboratories, a general classroom, a woodwork construction room, a senior metalwork room and two mechanical drawing rooms was completed at Scoil Mhuire agus Phádraig in 1999. In addition, the school received grant aid of approximately &euro;480,000 towards a re-roofing project completed at the school over the summer of last year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked of a canteen but there is no mention of that in his question, so there is nothing about it in the reply. I will relay what he said back to the Department. It appears that while the school got those two projects completed over the last couple of years, the one the Deputy speaks of regarding the old boarding school does not appear to have progressed very far. Hopefully, something will come of the re-examination which is to take place. I will relay the Deputy's comments to the Department and try to find out something regarding the canteen, which I presume is to be in the old boarding school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; producers are watching tonight because one of their investigations is the only thing that could possibly help root out the numerous planning abuses that have taken place throughout this country. The abuse is due either to a lack of resourcing among local authorities or insufficient legislation on the matter by means of the planning Acts and other laws.</P>
      <P>I want to be specific. There are many areas around the country which might have been brought to my attention, but a case from my own constituency might be most appropriate. Time and again we see where developers or in some cases businesses construct what would be seen as developments in breach of planning regulations without planning permission. Sometimes they later seek and secure retention. That is fair enough. They pay the price for that. In many cases however, dwellings or businesses are built with no enforcement proceedings being initiated to stop them. There is a glut there.</P>
      <P>In south County Dublin, where I was first elected as a councillor, and which area has now co-opted councillor Fintan McCarthy, this abuse is endemic. It is not just a case of large-scale development as in the case of Weston Aerodrome, recently being granted a limited permission by An Bord Pleanála while enforcement proceedings were still going on regarding unauthorised developments elsewhere on the site. We heard that the developer of Weston Aerodrome was in breach of numerous planning regulations in Saggart at the time. I do not necessarily want to have a go at Mr. Mansfield. He is a high profile person and he wants to build a conference centre which would be hugely welcome in the county. That is one large-scale example of how planning permission is being applied for without the regulations being adhered to.</P>
      <P>The law needs to be changed so that a council is not drained, with its staff working full time trying to enforce regulations, and their eyes taken off the ball elsewhere. Councils need more resources in their enforcement departments, or else a law is needed. I will consider later what is required in such a law.</P>
      <P>I will tell a little story about an area near Rathcoole called Calleaguestown. It is a small laneway on the outskirts of Rathcoole. I would call it the planning breach centre of Ireland. It has quite a number of developments including office buildings, a furniture retailer and other commercial units erected without any action being taken by South Dublin County Council over some time. This is an area of significant historical and archaeological interest, but the council has taken no action to protect the historical landscape. All the developments contravene the county development plan.</P>
      <P>There have also been allegations of threats against residents of the area who have dared to suggest they have a right to see that proper planning procedures are adhered to in their area, yet nothing has been done. A business is allegedly owned by Noel and Celia Lee or a Jimmy Dunne. There is another furniture shop, Stafford Furniture, and the involvement of another relative, John Dunne. Some of these people seem to be related. I do not wish to cast aspersions on people but the records and the buildings exist. Photographs which I cannot show in the House show buildings that the council knows should not exist, yet it has taken no action.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain why the council has done nothing? Is it incompetence on its part or has it been given insufficient resources to act? If developers or businesses are in breach of the planning laws and if enforcement proceedings have been issued against them they should not be allowed obtain planning permission for one more development. That would be a fair and just practice. Otherwise there will be a web of unauthorised developments and councils throughout the country will not be able to keep up. It is known that already they cannot keep pace with developments.</P>
      <P>This issue requires further debate. I may request a section 31 ruling or I may at some future time seek the adjournment of the House under Standing Order 21. I await the Minister of State's views on how this crux can be solved. It will have to be done by providing extra resources or amending the planning legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major reasons for the revision of the planning code in 2000 was to ensure increased compliance with planning laws by developers. The introduction of a culture of enforcement is critical to ensure that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the community as a whole. If people are to respect the planning laws they must be assured that they will be generally enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past there were many complaints that people were able to avoid planning requirements with impunity. A range of new measures was included in the Planning and Development Act 2000 to tackle the problem and to streamline and improve the enforcement process.</P>
      <P>Planning authorities are now legally obliged to respond to complaints of unauthorised development or breaches of planning permission. That is the law and in view of this, the matter to which the Deputy referred must have happened in the past. The authorities must keep complainants updated as enforcement actions proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the law of the land. The Deputy is no longer on the council and his replacement may know the position. Local authorities normally try to comply with the law of the land. The period of time for taking enforcement action was also extended from five to seven years. If people attempt to hide behind a corporate identity this can now also be prevented.</P>
      <P>The abuse of the retention system, where people avoided court action by a late application for permission for retention, was stopped. An application for retention, or even a grant of retention permission, is no longer a valid defence against enforcement action.</P>
      <P>Fines were greatly increased, with a maximum penalty on conviction on indictment now being &euro;12.7 million and up to two years imprisonment. This is a serious deterrent to people wishing to flout the law. It now costs more to obtain retention permission, with the fees for making a retention application now three times the regular fee.</P>
      <P>In the past there were serious problems with developers who left developments unfinished, particularly housing estates with unfinished services. The local authority had to pick up the tab to complete them. The developer was free to apply again to build another development which the planning authority was unable to refuse, despite the past failures. The changes made in the 2000 Act, along with changes in the phasing and bonding system for large developments, and, in the case of housing estates, a requirement on local authorities to take them in charge after seven years, even if unfinished by the developer, should strengthen the hand of the planning authorities</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 gave a new power to planning authorities to refuse planning permission depending on the applicants past development history. Section 35 of the Act provides that the planning authority has to first form an opinion that permission should be refused because of substantial failures by the developer to comply with permissions or conditions of permissions in the past. The planning authority may then apply to the High Court for authorisation to refuse permission to the developer.</P>
      <P>The involvement of the High Court is a necessary part of this procedure. When this provision was being drafted in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, it was recognised that depriving an individual of a planning permission to which they were otherwise entitled, could be construed as preventing a person from earning a livelihood. As in the case when a person is struck off a professional register, it was considered necessary to ensure that the refusal was decided with the consent of the High Court. The threat by a local authority to seek the intervention of the High Court should be sufficient to bring most developers to their senses.</P>
      <P>It is important for planning authorities to direct resources towards better enforcement of the law and many authorities are now doing so. I accept that in the past enforcement was inclined to be the Cinderella of planning departments.</P>

Further legislative change is not under consideration. I suggest to the Deputy that his replacement on the council should quote the law because local authorities try to uphold it. I was a member of a local authority for many years. Some of the incidents quoted by the Deputy may have happened in the old regime before the 2000 Act came into force.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, comprises the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCPP. Legislation underpinning the establishment of NESDO is currently on Second Stage in the Dáil and when enacted will place the three bodies on a statutory basis as part of the office.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, NESDO has overseen the provision of new accommodation for its constituent bodies in Parnell Square. All the staff of these bodies are for the first time located in one building. Not only does this facilitate the sharing by the three bodies of administrative costs and overheads, but also the sharing of knowledge and ideas and the devising of complementary work programmes.</P>
      <P>That was particularly evident during the preparation of work on the recent NESC report, An Investment in Quality; Services, Inclusion and Enterprise, No. 110 of November 2002, when both the NESF and NCPP had a considerable input into the drafting of this report. Another example of this type of co-operation between the constituent bodies was evident over the past two months when the NCPP linked with the NESC and NESF in developing teams for each of the panels on the forum on the workplace of the future.</P>
      <P>NESDO has also produced its policies and procedures statement that defines the functions and responsibilities of NESDO in regard to its constituent bodies and outlines its financial and human resources policies and procedures as well as its customer service principles. The statement is currently being circulated to staff for their observations before formal adoption by the board of NESDO.</P>
      <P>Regarding the NCPP specifically, the centre was established to provide a strategic focus to the deepening of partnership and improvement of performance in the workplace in both the private and public sectors. It is doing this by developing models of good practice in the area of partnership and improved performance. Examples of the centre's work under this heading include the publication of case studies of good practice in the private sector, a recent conference on best practice in the area of information and consultation within organisations and ongoing work on the development of guidelines on innovative forms of employee financial involvement.</P>
      <P>A second strand of the centre's work is the development of practical supports for those involved in managing change through partnership. Examples of the centre's work in this area include the development and promotion of a competency framework identifying the behaviours, attitudes and skills necessary for the effective management of change through partnership and the establishment of an interactive facility on the centre's website designed to educate and inform those interested in improving performance through partnership.</P>
      <P>As a third strand of its work, the centre is in the business of promoting partnership and performance. Activities in this area include the recent publication of a major review of the international experience of partnership, highlighting its value as a positive force for change, and the centre's ongoing work with its strategic alliance network, consisting of Departments and agencies concerned with workplace issues and with the research advisory panel, a national network of leading Irish researchers in relevant disciplines.</P>
      <P>The fourth strand of the centre's work is to further develop our overall thinking on how workplaces, in both the private and public sectors, can best adapt to competitive pressures, improve the delivery of services and respond to the changing needs of employees. It is doing this through the recently established forum on the workplace of the future which the centre both services and oversees. The forum is the main focus of the centre's work at present. Its opening plenary session was held in Dublin Castle on 6 and 7 October. The four expert panels established to support it have held a number of meetings, most recently on 9 December. The forum is scheduled to report in autumn 2004.</P>
      <P>To assist in the work of the forum, a consultation paper was published in July and a major survey was commissioned on employer and employee attitudes and experiences. The paper and preliminary survey results are available on the centre's website, together with the centre's other publications. The costs which have accrued to my Department since the centre's establishment in 2001 to date are just over &euro;2.26 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 15 October 2003, the high level group on regulation has made considerable progress since its establishment in May 2001 following publication of the OECD review on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group has met 16 times to date and its last report is available on my Department's better regulation website.</P>
      <P>The group has focused on two areas in particular. It began the process of framing a White Paper on better regulation through the publication of the public consultation document, Towards Better Regulation. The consultation document was designed to highlight the key issues that are likely to feature in the Government White Paper and to promote public debate and awareness in regard to better regulation.</P>
      <P>The consultation document set out the key questions that we need to address in considering why we regulate, what we need to regulate and new approaches to governance in a global economy. It is important to emphasise that this process is not about resolving micro-level regulatory issues or specific market problems. Rather, it is about giving us a set of core principles to guide future regulation and policy-making.</P>
      <P>To inform the subsequent formulation of the White Paper, submissions made in the consultation phase have been studied and analysed. Earlier this year, my Department published a booklet containing two papers &ndash; the first summarising the submissions received and the second offering an independent analysis and commentary on the submissions by an economist. A drafting group composed of senior officials from key Departments has been working on the White Paper on regulation. It is expected that the Government White Paper will be published in January 2004.</P>
      <P>The second priority of the high level group &ndash; and a key element of the forthcoming White Paper &ndash; is the development of a system of regulatory impact analysis, RIA, as recommended by the OECD in its report. RIA is a policy tool designed to identify and quantify, where possible, the impact of new and existing regulations. A working group of officials has been developing an approach to RIA that would be suitable for the Irish legislative and policy making context. I understand the next steps will be to: pilot the model in a small number of volunteer Departments; prepare detailed guidance material and supports; and devise and deliver a programme of awareness raising and training to inform civil servants and other interested parties about RIA.</P>
      <P>The publication of a White Paper on regulation and the introduction of RIA across Departments are two of the commitments on regulatory reform contained in Sustaining Progress. Overall, significant progress has been made in the area of better regulation and I look forward to continued progress in the coming years.</P>

      <Quest> the number of vessels within the polyvalent segment of the fleet which will be affected by his regulation of 17 November 2003 to ring-fence the total capacity of boats with pelagic wet storage capacity tanks, as determined by the licensing authority, at current approved levels of 1,247 GT and 2,881 kW, whereby such vessels may have fully functioning RSW tanks.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the provisions in the ministerial policy directive issued to the licensing authority involves the ring-fencing of the total capacity of vessels with pelagic wet storage capacity tanks, within the polyvalent fleet segment. The total permitted such capacity has been set at 1,247 gross tonnes and 2,881 kW. This policy provision takes account of the capacities of four polyvalent vessels already licensed with approved wet storage capacity. A related policy provision also allows one further polyvalent vessel already licensed with unapproved wet storage capacity to continue to operate with such capacity until its current licence expires. The capacity of this vessel is not included in the total ring-fenced capacity as this is only a provisional arrangement. The ring-fencing of permitted pelagic wet storage capacity in the polyvalent segment essentially affects all vessels licensed, or proposed to be licensed, in that segment.</P>
      <P>The policy provides that any future proposals for the licensing of new, second hand or modified vessels with pelagic wet storage capacity within the polyvalent segment will only be considered by the licensing authority where this would lead to no increase in the overall capacity ring-fenced. This means that while replacement vessels with pelagic wet storage capacity could be licensed, the total capacity of this sub-segment may not be exceeded.</P>
      <P>The fundamental principle underpinning this policy provision is that vessels with wet storage capacity &ndash; tanks &ndash; for pelagic species were not traditionally intended to be licensed in the polyvalent segment which comprised up to the late 1990s only dry hold vessels. Following the introduction of five tank vessels into the polyvalent segment in recent years, a moratorium was put in place in February 2001 on the licensing of non-dry hold vessels with bulk storage tanks in the polyvalent segment.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of all the issues involved and intensive consultation with industry, the Minister introduced a new policy in this area, as I have set out. There is a dedicated fleet segment for pelagic tank boats within the Irish fleet. Any vessels with pelagic wet storage capacity may be licensed in this tank boat segment as long as relevant licensing policy requirements such as the provision of appropriate replacement capacity, are complied with.</P>

      <P>On 2 December last, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced that he had appointed independent consultants to undertake a high level review of the inland fisheries sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The consortium of consultants is led by Farrell Grant Sparks Consulting and comprises the centre for environment, fisheries and aquaculture science and the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis, NUI, Maynooth. This review is to be completed in two stages over six months and I expect that stage one will be completed by the end of February 2004.</P>
      <P>The consultants conducting the review have already commenced work and have recently placed advertisements in the national newspapers calling for submissions from all interested parties. I am advised that they have also set up a website portal dedicated to the review, which contains the terms of reference and provides instructions for making submissions or comments on the review for those wishing to use this medium of communication. I understand the closing date for receipt of submissions is 16 January 2004.</P>
      <P>Recognising the importance that I have attached to conducting a widespread consultation process, I am advised that the consultants will be organising a programme of face to face consultations, meetings and interviews with key stakeholder interests at national and local level. They also plan to undertake a wide sweeping range of focus groups and workshop sessions early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The review that is now under way presents stakeholders with a unique opportunity to participate in a fundamental examination of the inland fisheries sector. I, therefore, strongly encourage all concerned to engage fully in the process with a view to building a consensus on a new model for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, it is an operational matter for Bord Gáis Éireann, BGÉ, under the supervision of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, to arrange the safety of its natural gas network and this includes works to upgrade the network or to replace cast iron pipes.</P>
      <P>BGÉ has an ongoing programme to replace all cast iron mains with polyethylene pipe within the next ten years. The network at present consists of 8,000 km. of which over 85% or 6,800 km. is polyethylene. When BGÉ took over the networks of the former town gas companies, there were 3,000 km. of cast iron mains.</P>
      <P>Following the Raglan House explosion in the mid 1980s, BGÉ followed a strategy to replace all cast iron pipes greater than four inches diameter or serving buildings of four or more storeys. This programme was completed well within the scheduled ten years. All other cast iron mains have been subject to replacement in pace with road works building redevelopment and new construction.</P>
      <P>The report of the independent investigation of the Rathfarnham explosion on 2 November 2003 was published by CER on 25 November 2003 and the commissioner provided my Department with a copy on that day. Among the recommendations in the report, all of which were accepted by the commissioner, was that BGÉ should put in place a parallel programme of cast iron mains replacement in areas where the ground was known to be liable to subsidence. In the report, the investigator noted that BGÉ had already commissioned work to assess the vulnerability of its cast iron network to poor ground conditions.</P>
      <P>Another of the recommendations is that BGÉ report its progress in meeting the recommendations to CER within three months. I understand that BGÉ and CER are in close touch with each other on this and allied safety matters.</P>
      <P>As regards advice to gas users and their neighbours, I remind them that gas, although a clean and efficient fuel, must be treated with care and to follow the gas industry's safety advice to report all suspected leaks, not to risk sparks or open flames in a suspected area and to ensure that only suitably qualified personnel install and maintain gas appliances.</P>

      <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation continues to monitor the security of supply situation and has initiated a number of positive actions to redress postulated generation capacity shortfalls in the short-term and the medium to longer term, as forecast by ESB national grid in its generation adequacy report published on 27 November last.</P>
      <P>Short term measures put in place for the coming winter include the implementation by ESB national grid of a demand side management programme and increased imports of 167 MW of electricity from Northern Ireland, contracted on a priority basis to meet customer demand here. In addition, ESB has purchased 104 MW of additional peaking capacity, which is being commissioned at present.</P>
      <P>As to the capacity deficit in the medium to longer term, CER recently announced the two preferred bidders in the competition it is running to facilitate the introduction of new generating plant, with a combined generating capacity of over 500 MW.</P>
      <P>Also, as regards proposals for an east-west-Ireland-Wales electricity interconnector, it is accepted on the advice of CER that the case for progressing this development is strong. Discussions are continuing with CER as to how its development can be advanced as a priority.</P>
      <P>In addition, ESB is currently undertaking a significant networks investment programme of some &euro;4 billion up to 2007 to bring the transmission and distribution systems up to required international standards and to meet projected capacity demand requirements. The programme is being delivered within the planned timeframe and budget.</P>
      <P>As demonstrated by recent international blackout events, no electricity power system can be fully protected from all eventualities. However, the transmission system operator has in place specific plans to deal with any incident quickly and effectively whereby supply is matched to demand.</P>
      <P>The recent statements by CER referred to in the question appear to stem from its response to a discussion paper issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the subject of a strategy to reduce emissions. These statements are not a forecast of what will happen in practice and should not be cited out of context.</P>
      <P>Finally, in response to concerns at EU level of insufficient development by some member states of transmission and generation infrastructure and reserve capacity, the Energy Commissioner, Madame de Palacio presented a new EU energy infrastructure and supply security package to the Council of Energy Ministers this week. A proposed EU directive on security of supply is a development which I welcomed in principle at the Council and which will inform our future policy development on this important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent meetings I held with the UK and French Fisheries Ministers afforded an excellent opportunity to exchange views on proposed quota and days at sea restrictions in key shared fisheries in the west of Scotland and in the Irish Sea. I also discussed the Commission's quota proposals for the Celtic Sea.</P>
      <P>Given the shared participation of Irish fishermen with both UK and French fishermen in many fisheries in these areas, there was considerable common ground between myself and my colleagues at both meetings. The need to both conserve stocks and ensure a sustainable livelihood for fishermen were identified as priorities. It was agreed that I would work closely with both ministers at this week's Council on such common concerns. The discussions included the Commission's recent expanded proposals to limit fishing effort in the Irish Sea and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Ireland reiterated its view that fishing effort limitation generally is a blunt instrument that will not provide adequate protection to the cod stock in the Irish Sea which is outside safe biological limits.</P>
      <P>The specific issue of the impact which fishing effort limitation schemes have on the fishing patterns of fishing vessels was a particular feature of the debate that surrounded last year's agreement to introduce such a scheme in the North Sea and the west of Scotland. At that time, Ireland, together with a number of like-minded member states, emphasised the potential risk of fishermen putting to sea in dangerous weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, therefore, be pleased to note in this regard that the Commission's current proposals on fishing effort limitation are substantially different from last year in that provision is now made for the aggregation of days into a longer, three month management period. Accordingly, the rigidity in last year's system that gave rise to such safety concerns for fishing crews has effectively been removed in the current proposals.</P>

      <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, an independent statutory authority since 2002, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, operates a number of programmes aimed at stimulating greater energy efficiency in the residential sector, particularly at individual householder level. These programmes share a number of significant objectives: making consumers aware of the energy they use in their day to day lives; making consumers aware of the environmental impacts of the production, supply and use of fossil fuel based energy; informing consumers of the options they have with respects to their own energy behaviour. This includes changing poor energy habits in the home and when purchasing to consider energy efficiency and energy implications; and empowering consumers to make better choices with respect to energy use and energy using appliances.</P>
      <P>Information campaigns which were run during 2003 and which will continue in 2004 have highlighted the benefits of saving energy to householders and identified suggested ways of reducing overall energy consumption in houses. This plays an important role in our demand side energy management programme and emphasises the positive effects of reduced energy consumption both for individual consumers and for the environment.</P>
      <P>Among the initiatives co-ordinated by Sustainable Energy Ireland are: energy awareness week; publications about energy awareness issues; Internet information service; energy telephone hotline; appliance; labelling information; schools energy programmes; home energy rating; house of tomorrow and enhanced building regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children, like adults, are exposed to increasing amounts of advertising in all forms of media and the wider environment. Much of that advertising promotes products which are arguably not in the long-term interest of the individual child or of society in general. On the other hand, regulation of children's advertising must be considered in a broader context of children's programming generally and the standards that are reflected there. Taken together with the issue of revenue generated by such advertising, it is clear that addressing the issue of children's advertising in all its aspects is complex and presents major challenges.</P>
      <P>Section 19(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Broadcasting Act 2001 provides that the preparation of codes and rules in respect of advertising which relates to matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children is a matter for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland which is an independent statutory body.</P>
      <P>It is already on the record that in November 2002, I requested the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to prepare the codes envisaged under sections 19(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of the Broadcasting Act 2001. In accordance with section 19(2) of the Act, it was specified that the commission should give priority to the preparation of the codes and rules relating to advertising directed at children.</P>
      <P>The commission subsequently embarked on a public consultation process seeking the views of interested parties. With this phase of the process completed in July this year, the commission then moved to the next phase. It engaged in a process to raise public awareness of the development of the codes and gathered views on the content of the code using a second public consultation document. The commission is consulting widely, including consultation with children. I understand that the commission will publish a draft version of a children's advertising code and will then invite comments from the public. The intent is to finalise the codes by next summer.</P>

      <P>The digital hub, which is the Government's flagship project in the digital content sector, intends to provide a high quality environment for Irish and international new media companies, research and development and educational-community initiatives in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin. The digital content industry has been identified by our development agencies as a high growth, value added industry where this country already exhibits significant strengths. A substantial amount of progress, which I will outline, has already been made in realising the aims of the project.</P>
      <P>The Digital Hub Development Agency Act 2003 was enacted in July of this year. The legislation, which places the development company for the hub on a statutory footing, is an important indication of Government commitment to the project. Property purchase amounting to &euro;75 million has been completed. The property, which was vested in the Commissioners of Public Works, transferred to the new agency on enactment of the legislation. The digital hub is currently conducting negotiations to select a preferred developer for the refurbishment of the properties. Three consortia have bid for the development contract. These bids are currently being evaluated and a contract is expected to be awarded next year. It is envisaged that when completed, the project will deliver 500,000 sq. ft. of enterprise, learning and educational, residential and retail space.</P>
      <P>The refurbishment of the print depot, which has been progressed as a joint venture between the Digital Hub Development Agency, Enterprise Ireland and Dublin City Council catering for established and high potential start-up companies in the digital media sector, is complete. A number of firms in the digital media sector have already located in the hub. Construction of a 3 km. high speed, fibre broadband network in the hub at a cost of &euro;2.29 million is complete and the facility offers high quality competitively priced telecoms services to firms locating in the hub is now available.</P>
      <P>The Liberties learning initiative, an education-community based programme being run in conjunction with the development of the digital hub, has a number of projects using technology to tackle social and educational disadvantage. Initiatives include digital storytelling which is using digital technology to allow local children to become familiar with technology and the digital communities project where a number of partners have come together to fit out 11 housing complexes in the inner city with computers, printers and scanners.</P>

      <P>The Government decision of December 2002 provided for a mechanism for an annual adjustment in the television licence fee using a consumer price index, CPI, minus X formula. This formula would be used to take account of rising costs but also to reflect performance on execution of change management agenda and performance against programme commitments. I have received an application from RTE for an increase in the television licence fee equivalent to the rise in CPI.</P>
      <P>The Government decision provided that decisions on an annual increase would be informed by an independent evaluation of RTE's performance in the previous year.

      <P>I signed the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 2003 into force on 6 November 2003. These regulations fully implement EU requirements contained in Directive 2002/58/EC regarding the regulation of spam. Spam is a growing problem and remedial action is urgently required. The most recent figures indicate that in excess of 55% of global e-mail traffic is spam and that time wasted in clearing in-boxes cost firms over &euro;2.5 billion in productivity.</P>
      <P>As a large amount of spam currently originates in the US, it is important that appropriate international co-operation and enforcement measures can be agreed. The European Commission has initiated discussion with the US administration regarding the regulation of spam and the co-ordination of enforcement measures. My officials have recently held exploratory discussions with representatives of the US Chamber of Commerce to inform our position in advance of Ireland assuming the European Presidency.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is to issue a communication to member states on this subject in the new year. My Department has contributed to the discussions and deliberations which will inform this communication. An OECD debate on spam will be hosted by the European Commission in February 2004 where I anticipate further discussions with the US administration can be facilitated.</P>

      <P>Royalties on petroleum production were abolished by ministerial decision in 1987 as part of a number of adjustments. There are no plans to review the existing licensing terms. While the terms, including the taxation terms and the lack of royalties, may appear generous, no company has benefited from them since there has been no new production since Kinsale in 1978 until last Saturday when production started from the Seven Heads gas accumulation. The rationale for the terms have been accepted by every Government since their introduction.</P>
      <P>The Government considers that these terms are necessary to maintain a viable level of licensing and exploration. Ireland has a difficult environment in which to explore and develop finds, including deep water eight to ten times the average depth in the North Sea and distance from shore and lack of infrastructure. All of these factors make offshore Ireland expensive for petroleum exploration and development and put Ireland at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to the shallower and, to date, more productive waters of the North Sea. This disadvantage means that Ireland would be extremely unlikely to attract the interest of the industry, and subsequent funding of exploration, without the present terms. Despite the terms, the number of exploration licences and the level of exploration activity have declined significantly in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of demand side management for electricity is one for the industry but is encouraged and facilitated by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. CER has recently approved a new demand side management scheme that will be in place in time for this winter's peak demand periods. ESB national grid will operate this scheme which aims to secure a reduction in this winter's peak demand of about 120 MW. All customers currently open to competition and who have the appropriate metering will be able to participate in this scheme. This new demand side management arrangement will be running in parallel with the existing ESB winter peak demand scheme.</P>
      <P>The CER is also developing new wholesale trading arrangements that are expected to be operational in early 2006. The new trading arrangement will allow for demand side participation which will incentivise customers to reduce demand in response to changing electricity prices. I understand that the customer energy efficiency levy in place in Northern Ireland is used to fund energy efficiency programmes.</P>
      <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland already has a range of programmes focused on improving energy efficiency, including electricity across all sectors of the economy. These programmes are aimed at improving consumer awareness, promoting energy efficiency in the industrial and public sectors and providing services which support and promote the development of renewable and sustainable energy development. For example, SEI promotes the large industry energy network, a scheme which supports 78 of the largest industrial sites dedicated to reducing their energy intensity. This represents about 40% of industrial energy consumption, with an annual energy spend of approximately &euro;350 million. The scheme operates as a non-binding voluntary agreement managed by SEI and the firms involved achieve an average of 1.4% gain in efficiency per year through their participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Savings from individual sites vary reflecting the different starting points in terms of prior actions already taken by the firms to reduce emissions as well as the regulatory or technical constraints on process or operational changes. The energy savings achieved by the sites participating in the network is estimated at 285 GWh, equating in environmental terms to a saving of 120,000 tonnes of CO2. In time this approach may be rolled out to the medium and small industry sectors.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for fleet management within an overall EU policy framework is delegated to member states. I do not have details of the various systems that apply in each member state which do not, in any case, have any particular relevance for Ireland's situation.</P>
      <P>Under the EU fleet management framework which was in place up to 31 December 2002, member states' fleets were divided at EU level into fleet segments, taking account of factors including, <i>inter alia,</i> fishing activities, fishing gear and vessel size. Under the EU framework for the period 1997-2002, multi-annual guidance programme IV, the Irish fleet comprised three fleet segments, the refrigerated sea water, RSW, pelagic segment, the polyvalent segment and the beamer segment, and capacity limits were set for each segment. Other member states' fleets were segmented, taking account of each member state's own particular situation and its objectives for its fishing fleets and fishing industries.</P>
      <P>In December 2002, a new legal framework for the Common Fisheries Policy, Council Regulation 2371/2002, was adopted by the Fisheries Council, which sets out a new EU fleet policy. This regulation establishes overall capacity limits for each member states fleet and does away with the previous capacity limits established for individual fleet segments. It is a matter for each member state to determine, at national level, the policy that is appropriate for its fleet, taking account of its own situation. The approach taken by other member states does not have any particular implications for Irish fleet policy.</P>

      <P>I met my counterpart, Ian Pearson MP, the Northern Ireland Office Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment on Monday, 8 December, in Belfast. The purpose of our meeting was to review progress on the specific work areas that we had identified for action at our previous meeting on 17 July 2003. On that occasion, we established a joint steering group to advance work in six areas. The joint steering group is comprised of senior officials from our two Departments and the two regulatory authorities.</P>
      <P>On Monday last, Minister Pearson and I reviewed the body of work undertaken to date under the auspices of the joint steering group. We also decided to initiate some specific actions which we considered should be brought forward by the group. In particular, we requested the energy regulators, working with the transmission system operators, to report back in three months with a timetable and specific work programme designed to achieve the objective of joint transmission planning in the electricity sector.</P>
      <P>On the gas side, we invited the two regulators, within three months, to report on the costs, benefits and any constraints that may exist in relation to the harmonisation of gas transmission tariff structures on an island wide basis. In addition, we considered that it was now appropriate that details of the ongoing work of the joint steering group should be shared with interested parties and, to this end, decided that an information seminar should be held in the new year. We also agreed that the North-South energy dialogue would benefit from further review by Ministers in three to four months.</P>
      <P>The IBEC-CBI joint business council recently submitted a paper supporting the creation of an all-island energy market and Minister Pearson and I took the opportunity afforded by our meeting to publicly welcome the submission of this helpful contribution to discussions on this important issue from key players in our two economies.</P>

      <P>In April 2003, my Department issued a formal reply to a complaint from the EU Commission alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> failure by Ireland to designate shellfish growing waters in accordance with obligations under EU Council Directive 79/923/EEC on the quality of shellfish waters. The response advised that the Department will be addressing the issue of designation of all appropriate shellfish waters under the directive, the preparation of programmes in respect of designations and the setting of values for specific parameters under the directive.</P>
      <P>A European court judgment, published on 11 September 2003, found that Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under the directive. In this regard, the Commission requested on 27 October 2003 an update by end January 2004 on measures Ireland is taking to comply with the judgment. My Department, working closely with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, is urgently progressing the work involved in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and relevant agencies.</P>

      <P>At present the Government is considering how the effectiveness of the State's overall food marketing effort can be improved. In this regard, existing structures for delivery of services are being examined. While BIM has an enviable record in the marketing and promotion of Irish seafood, it would be unwise to rule out any initiatives which could improve the State's performance in this area, in the interests of underpinning and expanding jobs for Irish seafood producers and processors. I am aware of the concerns expressed by seafood industry representatives and these will be considered before a final decision is taken on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the British ambassador at a meeting on 12 November that the Government was opposed to the so-called ghost ships being transported from the US to Britain for dismantling because of risks posed to Ireland's coastline and territorial waters. I previously wrote to the UK and US authorities setting out the Government's concerns on the matter.</P>
      <P>The ambassador confirmed that the UK authorities would return the four ageing naval ships to the US. It had been planned to tow a total of 13 such vessels to Britain for dismantling. At the time of the UK's decision, two of the ships had already arrived in Britain and the other two were <i>en route</i>. The ambassador indicated that for safety reasons the vessels would be returned to the US during the summer months. The four vessels are in dock in Britain at this time.</P>
      <P>Prior to the vessels leaving the US, the Irish Coast Guard was informed of the US-UK plans for the transportation of the ships. It received detailed information on the status of the vessels, including threats from hazardous materials, the sea worthiness of the ships and the planned route. The coast guard monitored the progress of the tows on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>At no stage did the vessels enter Irish waters. The Government ordered that aerial surveillance take place of the vessels during their transit off the south coast, and a tug boat company was placed on stand by in the event of any incidents.</P>
      <P>I intend to avail of the opportunity of Ireland's Presidency of the EU to consider what additional measures might be taken to prevent European waters being used as a highway for vessels which pose serious threats to member state coastlines and communities and have asked the EU Transport Commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, to review what options are available to the Community at this time to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of activity. Ireland is continuing to monitor the situation regarding the disposal of the old ships in question to ensure that there is no attempt to re-activate the transportation arrangements at a future date.</P>

      <P>On 27 November 2003, I appointed Mr. John Doherty as the new chairperson of the Commission for Communications Regulation with effect from 1 December. This year I transposed five EU directives on electronic communications, networks and services into Irish law. This has significantly increased the powers of the Commission for Communications Regulation in several important areas.</P>
      <P>Following the transposition of the EU regulatory package, a new authorisation regime replaced the existing licensing regime. As a result the indictable offences provided for in the Communications Regulation Act 2002 became redundant. In 2004, I will be enacting legislation which will re-instate indictable offences provided for in the Communications Regulation Act 2002. This will strengthen the enforcement efforts of ComReg in the new regulatory regime.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> the reasoning behind his recent policy decision as set out in the policy directive 2/2003 that the segmentation of the Irish fishing fleet will remain largely in place and that the transfer of capacity between segments of the fleet will be prohibited; the overall pelagic tonnage that is available in each of these segments; and the regulations that define the segmentation by geographical area.</Quest>
      <QRef>[31383/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy directive 2/2003 takes account of the situation in place and the policies and structures, <i>inter alia,</i> for fleet and fisheries management that have evolved since 1990. The basic structure of the segmentation of the Irish fleet has been in place since the early 1990's and takes account of factors including fishing activities and fishing gears. Current segmentation of the fleet is not based on geographical area. When considering a review of licensing policy, I did not consider that there was a strong case for any change in this structure. Policy directive 2/2003 provides for some minor adjustments to the current segmentation of the fleet. The policy provides for the transfer of beamers with full-time beamer entitlement on the basis of historic beamer fishing activity from the polyvalent segment of the fleet to the beamer segment of the fleet and it also provides for the transfer of vessels with part time beamer entitlements to the beamer segment subject to meeting specified conditions.</P>
      <P>On the transfer of capacity between segments, transfers in the past were only allowed in very limited and particular situations. In respect of the new policy, I took the same approach and the policy provides for the transfer of capacity between segments only in relation to the safety tonnage owed by vessel owners in the RSW pelagic segment of the fleet which are required to remove polyvalent or beamer capacity on the basis set out in the policy.</P>
      <P>The policy directive 2/2003 provides that overall pelagic capacity in the RSW pelagic segment cannot exceed 36,363 GTs and 47,873 kWs, which were the capacity limits set by the EU under the fleet programme, the multi-annual guidance programme IV, for this segment. The policy directive also provides that the capacity of the polyvalent pelagic wet storage capacity cannot exceed 1,247 GT and 2,881 kW. The level of dry storage pelagic capacity in the polyvalent segment is determined by the policy requiring active pelagic replacement capacity in respect of the introduction of dry hold vessels with pelagic entitlement into the segment.</P>
      <P>In addition, all vessels in the polyvalent segment under 19.81 metres, 65 ft., have dry hold pelagic entitlements. Policy directive 2/2003 did not provide for any significant change to the active pelagic entitlement policy. However, this matter will be considered further by the fishing boat licensing policy review group with a view to making recommendations in respect of the existing policy on active pelagic replacement for dry hold pelagic vessels in the polyvalent segment of the fleet.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest> the initiatives he has taken and proposes to take to ensure a livelihood for Irish fishermen and their families, having particular regard to decreasing fish stocks and consequent EU restrictions on fish catches; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[31353/03]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Against a backdrop of declining whitefish stocks in particular and consequent restrictions on catch levels, the primary challenge facing fishermen and their families concerns the need for effective conservation measures to provide for the sustainable exploitation of these stocks into the future.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Government has identified a number of key priorities to protect the livelihood of fishermen in particular and the seafood industry generally into the future. These are being actively pursued at EU level in the context of ensuring a strong and effective Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>The key priorities relate to how the Common Fisheries Policy should operate in accordance with the principles of sustainable development, better governance, more stakeholder involvement and an increased emphasis on conservation and stock building. Significant progress was achieved on these policy fronts in the reformed CFP, which was agreed last year.</P>
      <P>Ireland's primary interest concerns fish stocks in western waters which are around our coast. In October, I secured agreement on a new Irish conservation box off the south and west coast of Ireland and a fishing effort management regime for western waters. The main implication of this agreement is the guarantee that there will be no increases in fishing effort by foreign fishing fleets in waters around Ireland and sensitive waters off the south and west coast will be given special protection. The western waters agreement also ensures that the current balance between northern and southern waters will be maintained, thus ensuring that there can be no transfer of effort by Spain from waters off its coast, where fish stocks are over exploited, into Irish waters.</P>
      <P>At the Fisheries Council this week, I will be working to ensure that those stocks outside safe biological limits are adequately protected and are governed, as necessary, by appropriate recovery regimes. Such regimes should take account of the individual situations involving strong technical conservation measures to protect juvenile fish and/or adult spawning stock and other conservation tools as necessary. Such regimes must have strong control and enforcement measures applied to them to ensure that any recovery plans introduced are implemented effectively in a fair and even-handed way across all member states.</P>
      <P>The question of how best to proceed with stock recovery plans is a key issue for discussion at Council and I will be working with colleagues to agree recovery plans for the stocks of importance to Ireland that take account of the particular specificities of the fisheries involved.</P>

      <P>The framework regulations which I signed into law in July this year, allied to the EU Commission's relevant market recommendations, provided the statutory basis for ComReg, the independent regulator for the communications sector, to investigate the area of voice call termination on individual mobile networks. I note that ComReg has subsequently proposed imposing regulatory obligations on the main players in the mobile market with respect to voice call termination prices and that Vodafone and O2 have given undertakings this year to further reduce their mobile termination rates. I note that ComReg estimates that by summer 2004 average mobile termination rates will have fallen by over 20% from the previous three years.</P>

      <P>The Irish Coast Guard maintains 24 hour all weather helicopters at Dublin and Waterford Airports. This enables full search and rescue services to be provided throughout the east and south eastern coasts and adjoining sea areas. The coast guard also maintains a similar 24 hour at Shannon Airport and this is available as a back up service to the eastern part of the country should the need arise. Each helicopter is available at 15 minutes readiness between 0730 and 2100 and at 45 minutes notice outside of these hours. I am satisfied that the arrangements in place are appropriate to the search and rescue requirements of the counties in question.</P>
      <P>The Dublin and Waterford helicopters were manufactured in 1977 and 1963, respectively. The manufacture date is not of relevance to the performance of the aircraft and its suitability for search and rescue work in that the aircraft is subject to a maintenance programme approved by the Irish Aviation Authority, based on requirements generated from the manufacturer. The approved maintenance programme involves replacement of all critical components at prescribed intervals. The basic structure of the helicopter is also subject to ongoing inspection at prescribed intervals. This ranges from a daily visual inspection regime up to a major inspection that entails completely stripping the airframe of all components and external paint to allow an in-depth inspection of the entire structure.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question Nos. 127 and 146 of 11 November 2003, the Marine Institute was mandated last July to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the significant levels of fish mortalities that were experienced by salmon farms in Donegal Bay. The scope of the investigation was broadened subsequently when it came to light that high mortality levels had also been experienced by certain other fish farms along the western seaboard. I am advised that the elements of the investigation relating to Donegal Bay are at an advanced stage and that an interim report covering this stage of the investigation will be finalised in the near future. As the investigation is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>

      <P>The setting of total allowable catches and quotas for 2004 is the main fisheries item to be considered at the Council meeting on 17-19 December 2003. In so far as Ireland is concerned, this means the setting of catch limits for Irish fishermen in respect of some 40 fish stocks, mainly in western waters around Ireland's coast. The European Commission has recently made proposals in this regard involving an average reduction in TAC levels of approximately 9% against 2003.</P>
      <P>In addition to discussing TACs and quotas for 2004, Ministers will also be discussing recovery measures for a number of whitefish stocks, particularly cod and hake, which are considered to be outside safe biological limits. The recovery plans include proposals for limiting fishing effort &ndash; days at sea &ndash; for the Irish Sea and for the west of Scotland, including waters off the north west of Ireland. I am maintaining close contact with industry representatives in these negotiations in relation to recovery plans to ensure that appropriate strategies for these recovery plans are agreed that provide for both the recovery of the stocks outside safe biological limits and sustainable fishing opportunities for fishermen affected by the recovery plans.</P>
      <P>The priority for Ireland in the forthcoming Council is to achieve a balanced outcome that will provide for a sustainable future for the Irish fishing industry. The need to take effective conservation measures so that fish stocks are managed and exploited on a sustainable basis is an overriding imperative for both the Government and the Irish fishing industry. Within that context, the primary aim will be to ensure that Irish fishermen all around the coast will have available to them the maximum possible quantity and range of fishing possibilities in 2004 that can be justified on a sustainable basis.</P>

      <P>The decision to transfer the services of the marine rescue co-ordination centre from Dublin was taken on foot of a study of the coast guard undertaken by independent consultants. Reflecting advances in modern communications technologies, the consultants recommended that the coast guard should operate two control centres as opposed to the three centres that exist at present. This approach will have the effect of achieving significant cost savings, thus enabling other elements of the coast guard service to be developed which, in turn, will lead to further improvements in our marine emergency response services nationally.</P>
      <P>My objective is that the remaining two centres at Valentia and Malin Head will be developed to handle all emergencies around our coast, on inland waters and mountain, cliff and cave rescue. Communications technology today is such that the geographical location of the co-ordination centres is less important now than in the past and, in this context, Government policies on decentralisation from Dublin are also relevant.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress that the capability of the coast guard to co-ordinate and manage incidents will not be diminished in any way as a result of the closure of the Dublin rather than the Valentia or Malin Head centres nor will the decision affect the very significant emergency response resources on the ground, which will remain available to the coast guard on a year round 24 hour basis.</P>
      <P>Coast guard management is examining all issues relating to the operation of the two centres going forward, including establishing what measures will be necessary to effect a smooth transfer from Dublin to the other two centres while ensuring that full co-ordination capability is maintained at all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigations into fish quality for last year's autumn-spring herring fishery was undertaken by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, on the basis of a series of onboard investigations on both traditional dry hold polyvalent vessels and refrigerated-seawater, RSW, pelagic vessels. The aims of this study included: ascertaining the effectiveness of temperature management throughout the catching cycle &ndash; that is, from the net right through to the fish processor &ndash; and monitoring the development of histamine and TVB-N in fish products as a quantitative measure of fish quality.</P>
      <P>The results from BIM's study show that the average TVB-N levels at point of landing for both dry hold polyvalent vessels and RSW pelagic vessels were not dissimilar. Indeed, of the samples tested, both cases recorded levels of TVB-N were 17 mg N/100g. For histamine, the levels recorded from dry hold polyvalent vessels were, on average, two parts per million and those recorded from RSW pelagic vessels were, on average, 0.8 parts per million. In both cases, the recorded levels were significantly less than the level stipulated in Council Directive 91/493/EEC laying down health conditions for the production and placing on the market of fishery products and the level currently demanded in the marketplace. While the average temperature of herring from dry hold polyvalent vessels measured on landing was 4ºC higher than similar landings from RSW pelagic vessels, the BIM study went on to show that with proper temperature management post landing, average temperatures of fish from both dry hold polyvalent and RSW pelagic vessels was approximately 7ºC.</P>
      <P>These studies, which focused on the traditional fisheries pursued by the dry hold polyvalent fleet where fishing trips are short due to the proximity of the fishing grounds, clearly demonstrated that with proper temperature management both on board vessels and post landing, the temperature and quality of fish from both dry hold and RSW pelagic vessels more than meet market place requirements. Fishing vessels which fish pelagic stocks further offshore and remain fishing for several days are typically dedicated pelagic vessels fitted with refrigerated seawater systems that enable the effective chilling of large volumes of fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new licensing policy contains a range of policy provisions and requirements in respect of the licensing of sea fishing boats, including replacement capacity. Some features of the policy have general application, while others relate to particular sectors of the industry. The common objective underpinning the development of the overall policy was to create a new, open and transparent policy to facilitate the achievement of a sustainable and viable livelihood for fishermen operating in various types of fisheries, taking account of available fishing opportunities and fishing resources. In addition to delivering the required fleet capacity targets set down in EU fleet policy, this policy is designed to give stability and certainty to the industry. The policy takes account of the current situation and the policies and structures for fleet and fisheries management that have evolved since 1990 and seeks to achieve the objectives already outlined. In this way the new policy should have a positive overall impact on the industry.</P>
      <P>The new licensing policy is a key element of the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure equity and transparency in fishing fleet management for the benefit of the fishing industry. Other important measures have also been taken to implement this element of the Government's programme. The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, enacted on 1 July last, transferred sea fishing boat licensing functions from the Minister to a legally independent licensing authority under the direction of the registrar general of fishing boats, an official of the Department. It also established an independent appeals system in respect of licensing decisions by the licensing authority.</P>

      <P>The headquarters of my Department are being transferred to Cavan with a target number of 425 jobs. Bord Iascaigh Mhara is being transferred to Clonakilty, 150 jobs, and the Central Fisheries Board to Carrick on Shannon, 40 jobs. The Minister for Finance has outlined the range of factors which have been taken into account and balanced against each other in selecting locations for decentralised Departments and agencies. Discussions have been held with staff representatives in meetings of the partnership committee and the departmental council last week when it was agreed that subgroups of both partnership and departmental council will be set up to ensure ongoing dialogue and communication and to deal with implementation issues going forward.</P>

      <P>To date in 2003 there has been 1,710 tonnes of sprat caught within Irish waters by commercial Irish fishermen. These catches have been landed primarily into the ports of Dunmore East and Killybegs. There has been no commercial fishery for sandeels. There are specific minimum sizes that prohibit the keeping onboard and landing of undersized fish. There has been no sprat used for the production of fishmeal this year, all the catches of sprat were sold to lucrative markets for human consumption.</P>

Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. A breakdown by postal district is not available. The most recent information available is for November 2003. It should be noted that the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the Quarterly National Household Survey.

      <P>Prior to the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 a company secretary had no specific statutory responsibilities, apart from the signing of certain forms, which are required by the Companies Acts to be signed by the company secretary. Section 100 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, which amended section 383 of the Companies Act 1963, provides that it is the duty of each director and secretary of a company to ensure that the requirements of the Companies Acts are complied with by the company. Apart from this general duty set out in the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, the Companies Acts do not set down any specific duties for a company secretary. A secretary's duties are those which are set down by the directors of a company and are normally administrative rather than managerial.</P>
      <P>Apart from a requirement to sign certain documents, there are no specific duties or responsibilities set down for the secretary of a co-operative society under co-operative legislation. A society's rules should normally provide for the appointment of a secretary to a co-operative and the functions, powers and duties of the secretary.</P>

      <P>According to the 2002 census of population, which was conducted on 28 April 2002, Ireland's unemployment rate was 8.8% as measured by responses to the question on principal economic status. However, the Quarterly National Household Survey, which is carried out on a regional basis by the Central Statistics Office, is a more reliable guide to unemployment. The national unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2002 as measured by this survey was 4.2%. The figure was 5.2% in the most recent quarterly survey.</P>
      <P>The objective of the State development agencies has been to encourage the design of a strategy that will enable as many areas as possible to share in balanced regional development and their efforts are directed towards its achievement. The effectiveness of the strategy will be strongly influenced by a supportive business environment in the regions.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the level of unemployment in the areas mentioned. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the relevant county enterprise boards are already actively involved in supporting enterprise development in these areas and will continue their efforts to address the jobs situation.</P>

      <P>The Italian Presidency European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, report, which includes the mandate for the incoming Irish Presidency, was approved by the European Council on 12 December 2003. In the mandate, the Irish Presidency is tasked with carrying forward work on developing the European Security and Defence Policy, within the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</P>
      <P>The EU Military Committee, EUMC, is the advisory authority on military capabilities in the EU and is responsible for providing the Political and Security Committee with military advice and recommendations on all military matters within the EU. The EUMC is chaired by a permanent chair, assisted by the Presidency. who will prepare a work programme based on the mandate received from the European Council. The EU Military Staff, EUMS, is made up of military personnel seconded from member states to the general secretariat of the council and is under the military direction of the EUMC. The EUMC will be assisted in progressing the EUMC work programme by the EUMS, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>At the European Council meeting of 19 and 20 June 2003 held at Thessaloniki, the Council noted the progress which had been made in the field of military capabilities since the inception of the headline goal, which is the more accurate description of what is commonly referred to as the Rapid Reaction Force. Significantly, the Council also noted that the EU now has an operational capability across the full range of Petersberg Tasks, limited and constrained by certain shortfalls. The Irish Presidency will continue to build on the work of previous Presidencies in the development of the EU military capabilities to carry out humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management operations, that is, the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the operational capability of the European Union was demonstrated through the launching of three ESDP operations: the EU Police Mission, EUPM, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Operation CONCORDIA in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Operation ARTEMIS in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The EU-led operations EUPM and ARTEMIS demonstrate the level of co-operation between the EU and the UN which continues to be developed and enhanced at EU level. Discussions are ongoing at EU level in terms of the prospective EU follow-on of the UN-mandated NATO-led stabilisation operation, SFOR, in Bosnia Herzegovina. These discussions are likely to continue during the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>I will be anxious to ensure that the momentum which has been maintained over previous Presidencies in relation to the development of the ESDP will continue in our Presidency.</P>

      <P>The school milk scheme has been operated by my Department since 1982. The scheme provides for the payment of aid on the sale of milk and milk products supplied to all nursery, primary and secondary school children. The objective of the scheme is to promote and encourage milk consumption among school-going children. Participation in the scheme is open to all schools. Approximately 2,500 schools participate in the scheme annually, covering over 90,000 pupils or 20% of the school going population.</P>
      <P>At present there are 49 schools in County Sligo and 14 schools in Leitrim availing of the school milk scheme.

      <P>The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 2004 national reserve under category A, which caters for first time applicants for suckler cow premium who are under 35 years of age. One of the conditions, which each applicant under all categories must satisfy, is that his or her total income, including that of spouse or partner, for the year ending 31 December 2002 must not exceed &euro;27,000, of which any off-farm income must not exceed &euro;13,500. All applicants are asked to submit a tax assessment or P60 certificate of income with their applications in order to verify their income. Since the person named did not submit the required documentation my Department wrote to him on 22 September 2003 requesting a P60 or tax assessment. When the documentation was not submitted following the issue of this letter, my Department wrote to the person named on 25 November 2003 informing him that he would not qualify for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 2004 national reserve. If the person named submits a P60 to the quota section of my Department at Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo, his case will be re-examined having regard to the conditions applying to category A applicants.</P>

      <QRef>[31508/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have placed a very high priority on improving Ireland's animal identification and traceability systems and I am determined to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control and remains at the forefront in terms of consumer assurance and food safety. In the wake of the FMD crisis of 2001, and against a backdrop of earlier unsuccessful efforts in this regard, I introduced a comprehensive individual sheep identification system &ndash; the national sheep identification system, NSIS, which provides full individual identification and traceability of sheep from farm of origin to carcass and which is designed to be multi-functional, facilitating aspects such as flock management, consumer assurance and disease monitoring and control</P>
      <P>The FMD crisis underscored the potential damage to which our economy and the agriculture sector is exposed in the event of serious disease outbreaks if shortcomings in animal identification and traceability were not addressed. Based on monitoring of NSIS and feedback to my Department from various quarters since 2001, I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are now firmly bedded in across the sheep sector and working well. I have, however, made it clear that I am always willing to enhance and improve NSIS and to address any operational difficulties which might arise, while maintaining its key components.</P>
      <P>A new harmonised system of identification for the whole of the European Union has today been agreed at the Council of Ministers. This system provides that there will be electronic individual identification of sheep from January 2008, together with a central movement database recording movements on a batch basis. The implementation date is subject to review following a Commission report in 2006. For the interim period all sheep will be double tagged and identified individually, but all recording will be on a flock basis, in line with the vote of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The agreed system affords member states which already have systems in place offering a higher level of traceability than would be the case during the interim period the option of retaining their own systems until the advent of electronic identification in a few years from now.</P>
      <P>I support the broad principle which underlies the agreed system. It is necessary to have in place a robust, harmonised system of sheep identification backed up with good record-keeping allowing full traceability of animal movements at all times. I have always been in favour of making use of new and efficient technologies to achieve this end, subject to practicalities and cost-effectiveness, and I am anxious that Ireland and other member states are in a position to move at the earliest possible date to an electronic system. In the interim, however, the system now in place and operating throughout the Irish sheep sector will continue to afford Ireland the level of protection and assurance in relation to both identification and traceability which I believe is strategically appropriate to this country.</P>
      <P>I have no plans, therefore, to dismantle NSIS and roll back the progress which has been made in this area since 2001, only to see Irish sheep farmers, marts, meat processors, etc. being asked a few years from now to once again re-instate and accommodate individual identification and traceability by the 2008 target date for the introduction of electronic systems. As I have earlier stated, I am willing to examine and address aspects relating to the operation of NSIS in so far as these be addressed within the EU system that is put in place.</P>

      <P>In general, a milk producer may temporarily lease a milk quota in its entirety for one year only. An entire quota may only be leased for a second year when, on application, the quota holder shows that he cannot resume production in the second year due to exceptional circumstances but intends to resume in the near future.</P>
      <P>While an application was received from the person named, it was not received by the specified closing date nor did it indicate that he intended to resume milk production in the future. In these circumstances permission to temporarily lease the quota for a second year was not granted.</P>
      <P>The position is, therefore, that unless deliveries are made against this quota or it is transferred in the current quota year, it may be taken into the national reserve as from 1 April 2004. However, if the person named or his successor were to commence milk deliveries after that date but within two years of it, all or part of that quota could again be made available to him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>Tá stádas &ldquo;teanga chonartha&rdquo; ag an nGaeilge san Aontas Eorpach. Tá an scéal amhlaidh de bhrí go bhfuil na conarthaí as Gaeilge agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar cheann de na teangacha ina bhfuil an téacs údarach. Foilsítear gach conradh i nGaeilge, mar aon leis na teangacha eile, agus tá an stádas céanna ag an téacs inti is atá ag na teangacha eile.</P>
      <P>Ag an am céanna, níl an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na teangacha oifigiúla de réir forálacha Airteagail 1 de Rialachán 1/1958. Mar a dúirt mé, agus mé ag tabhairt freagra ar cheist ar 2 Nollaig, ní bheidh athrú ar an scéal le fairsingiú an Aontais ar 1 Bhealtaine 2004.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana freisin, bímid i gcónaí ag iarraidh deise chuí a fháil leis an teanga a chur chun cinn san AE. Mar shampla, faoi na rialacháin úra atá faoi chaibidil i láthair na huaire, beidh an Ghaeilge i measc na dteangacha go bhféadfadh oifigigh a thaispeáint go bhfuil siad ábalta oibriú inti agus iad ag iarraidh a gcéad ardú céime a fháil tar éis dóibh dul isteach san AE.</P>
      <P>Agus an scéal amhlaidh, creidim go dtuigtear go mbíonn an Rialtas i gcónaí ag iarraidh breith ar an bhfaill leis an teanga a chur chun tosaigh san AE.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 140 to 144, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Political and Security Committee, PSC, consists of representatives appointed to the Committee by the member states and the European Commission. The EU High Representative, or his representative, also attends meetings of the committee. All PSC meetings take place in Brussels. The PSC can meet at any time but scheduled meetings take place consistently twice a week and then as required. There are periodic meetings between the PSC and representatives of third countries and international organisations such as the UN, NATO and the OSCE. As Presidency, Ireland will also lead the PSC in troika format &ndash; the Irish Presidency, the incoming Dutch Presidency and the Commission &ndash; which meets with a number of key regional groups and third countries throughout the six months of the Presidency. The PSC also occasionally holds informal meetings.</P>
      <P>As regards sponsorship for the Presidency, the sponsorship arrangements reported to this House in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 101 of 11 December 2003 are primarily for meetings in Ireland. Therefore, meetings at senior official level taking place in Brussels, including the regular PSC meetings, will not, in the main, benefit from these arrangements, although Kerrygold products are expected to be available at meeting venues in Brussels. Ministerial and senior official meetings taking place in Ireland may benefit from these sponsorship arrangements and this would include an informal meeting of the PSC, which will take place in Ireland during the Presidency.</P>

      <P>The Government-Commission meeting on 6 January 2004 will take place in Dublin Castle. It will take the form of bilateral meetings between Government Ministers and Ministers of State chairing Councils during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union and their Commission counterparts. This will be followed by a plenary session co-chaired by the Taoiseach and President Prodi. Apart from these meetings there are no other formal or informal side meetings envisaged. A list of the Government and Commission delegations can be read below. A number of officials will also attend.</P>
      <P>As announced last week, Eircom, Audi, Tipperary Natural Spring Water and Kerrygold have agreed to become sponsors of the Presidency. It is expected that products and services supplied by these companies will be available for this meeting.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 to 139, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, meets in Brussels during January, February, March and May and meets in Luxembourg in April and June.</P>
      <P>A first draft of the respective agendas of these meetings is currently being finalised and will be circulated to partners in the near future. These agendas will also list the meetings which are scheduled to be held on the margins of the council. When these agendas are available they will be forwarded to the Oireachtas. The draft agendas are kept under review and amended in light of developments closer to the date of the council meetings. Amended versions will also be forwarded to the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
      <P>I normally attend meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council and, during the Presidency, will chair the council's meetings. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, will be the Irish national representative at meetings of the council during our Presidency. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will attend Council meetings where items coming within his area of responsibility are on the agenda. Relevant officials will also attend these meetings as appropriate. Attendance at meetings to be held on the margins of the council will depend upon the nature of the meeting concerned and the relevant agenda.</P>
      <P>Concerning sponsorship, as I announced last week, Eircom, Audi, Tipperary Natural Spring Water and Kerrygold have agreed to become sponsors of the Presidency. Kerrygold products will be available for all meetings in Ireland and Brussels. However, as the sponsorship arrangements with the other companies are primarily for meetings in Ireland, it is not expected that products and services supplied by these companies under such arrangements will be availed of at meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>Questions Nos. 140 to 144, inclusive, answered with Question No. 132.</i>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the reason Ireland has not ratified the UN Convention for the Protection of Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families 1999; when it is intended to ratify this Convention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[31623/03]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has not signed and is not a party to the International Convention on the Protection and of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and their Members of their Families.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the convention, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990, entered into force on 1 July last, following its ratification by the requisite number of states (20). However, although the Convention on Migrant Workers has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990, to date only 22 states have ratified or acceded to the convention. The convention has not acquired universal recognition as a standard for the protection of the rights of migrant workers. No western or developed state has yet signed or ratified the convention, nor have any indicated an intention to do so.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position in regard to the ratification of international instruments generally, including the Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers, is constantly reviewed in light of prevailing circumstances and in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments.</P>
      <P>Where Ireland wishes to ratify or accede to an international instrument, the Government must first ensure that our domestic law is fully in conformity with the agreement in question. The Government must therefore make any necessary legislative changes, or be satisfied that none are required, before ratification takes place. As signature of an instrument is an indication of an intention to ratify it, the Government would consequently also have to have a firm intention to ratify and, be taking steps to do so, before signing an international instrument.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers has been examined by my Department. It would appear that in order for Ireland to ratify the convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our relations with our EU partners and the acceding states to the Union, none of whom have signed or ratified the convention &ndash; or have signalled an intention to do so &ndash; and possibly for the operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK. There are no plans at present to introduce the changes in these areas which would be necessary before Ireland could ratify or consider signing the convention.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the rights of migrant workers and their families are already comprehensively protected under existing legislation. In addition the human rights of migrant workers and their families are protected under the Constitution and by Ireland's commitments under international human rights instruments to which the State is party.</P>

      <P>Visa applicants are normally asked to submit their application through the embassy or consulate in their country of permanent residence. Applications can be submitted by post. The staff in the embassy or consulate are considered best placed to verify the authenticity of documents submitted, most of which will not be in English. Visa applications are normally only taken in Ireland where the person is resident here or if there is no Irish Embassy or consulate in their country of residence.</P>
      <P>However, as all the documentation in this case is already in Ireland, the application can be made directly to the Visa Office, Department of Foreign Affairs, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.</P>

      <P>The post leaving certificate review was commissioned by my Department to examine the sector and make recommendations as necessary regarding the organisational, support, development, technical and administrative structures and resources required in schools with large scale post leaving certificate, PLC, provision. The final report was completed in April 2003.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report are wide-ranging and encompass proposals that extend beyond PLC provision, including issues which impact on the shaping of structures for the delivery of further and adult education into the future, and on other sectors of the education system.</P>
      <P>During October 2003, in separate meetings, officials in my Department met with the management and staff representative interests in the sector to examine their respective priorities and to consider issues surrounding a number of the recommendations of the report as well as areas of common interest, having regard to the implications for other areas of the education system. Each side has agreed to review their position with regard to prioritisation of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>Further exploratory meetings with relevant stakeholders in the sector will be necessary in the period ahead in connection with this report.</P>

      <P>The Youth Work Act 2001 was enacted on 1 December 2001 and provides a statutory basis for the development of youth work in Ireland. The Act followed a widespread consultation process and provides a legal framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services to be organised by the Minister for Education and Science, the vocational education committees and national-regional youth work organisations.</P>
      <P>It was never the intention that the Act would be implemented fully at once. Section 1 of the Act provides for sections to be commenced at different stages. To date, sections 2 to 18, inclusive, and section 24 have been commenced.</P>
      <P>A sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee was established to make recommendations on the requirements necessary for the implementation of the various sections of the Act. This sub-committee comprises representatives of both statutory and voluntary sectors, as well as my Department. The work of this sub-committee is ongoing. It will also be necessary for my Department to have further discussions with the IVEA-CEO Association and the National Youth Council of Ireland on various aspects of the Act. The implementation of further sections of the Act will also depend on the availability of the necessary resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>At present, dance is a component of the physical education programme at primary and post-primary level here and is taught as an element of the physical education programme. In the leaving certificate applied programme, dance is a separate element and is formally examined. A number of schools also offer a post leaving certificate course in dance and students can study it up to Further Education and Training Awards Council level two.</P>
      <P>At third level dance is an element of the undergraduate physical education course at the University of Limerick and further postgraduate opportunities are provided for students who wish to pursue study in the area of dance.</P>
      <P>My Department has no function in the recognition or approval of colleges based outside the State. In relation to support available for students studying abroad, in 1996 my Department's student maintenance grant schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. Apart from the existing provisions in the maintenance grant schemes, there are no plans to introduce special grants or bursaries for Irish students wishing to study abroad.</P>
      <P>There is provision for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in other EU member states.

      <P>No discussions have taken place between me, or officials of my Department, and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in relation to funding assistance for arts students studying abroad.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to support available for students studying abroad is that in 1996 my Department's student maintenance grant schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.</P>

      <P>I am responding to the Deputy's question on behalf of myself and my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
      <P>Approximately &euro;6.5 million has been made available by the European Commission to part-fund projects throughout all member states of the European Union under the European Year of Education through Sport in 2004. Two types of project will be supported: projects involving one member state only, which may receive 50% Commission funding and trans-national projects, including eight or more member states which may receive 80% Commission funding.</P>
      <P>In both cases it will be necessary for the groups organising the project to meet the outstanding costs, the matching 50% or matching 20% of the organisational and running costs of projects.</P>
      <P>The amount of funding to be made available to each member state will be based on the EU Commission guidelines on the distribution of funding amongst member states based on the population of each country. Ireland's share of this overall amount of &euro;6.5 million in terms of co-funding for projects is approximately &euro;185,000.</P>

      <P>In 2001, following a review of the school transport scheme and taking into consideration the recommendations of the joint Oireachtas committee report on school transport, a number of improvements were put in place.</P>
      <P>These included: the reduction of the qualifying distace for eligibility purposes; reduction in the number of pupils required for the establishment of a service; the scope of the remote area grants was extended and the rates increased; travelling and waiting time for post primary pupils was reduced and where feasible pupils on the early pick up would be first home in the evening and vice versa; and over 120 older buses were replaced and all vehicles were provided with a communication system.</P>
      <P>Due to the rapidly escalating cost of providing the school transport service, my Department is undertaking a review designed to identify savings and efficiencies which can contribute to a containment of the cost of the service.</P>

      <P>At an extraordinary general meeting of ITE, held on 18 July 2003, the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. I understand that a meeting of the executive committee of ITE on 5 December agreed a timetable for the proposed appointment of a liquidator on 9 January 2004 and agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this. A briefing for staff of the institute was held on 5 December to apprise them of developments.</P>
      <P>My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its future intentions, in partnership with the staff of the institute. This will include arrangements for ensuring the continuation of the research functions previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate re-deployment or other appropriate arrangements for permanent staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance.</P>

The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate re-deployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts.

      <P>It is not the case that the intake of students to the colleges of education for the academic year 2003-04 has been halved. The colleges of education provide primary teacher training courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. The approved intake to the B.Ed. course has been 1,000 for the past number of years and this has not changed. The 18 month full-time postgraduate course was first provided in four of the colleges of education in the 1995-96 academic year as a response to a shortage in the supply of trained primary teachers and has been repeated on a number of occasions since then. The most recent course commenced in February of this year and it has been decided that, based on the continuing teacher shortage, a further course will commence early in 2004.</P>

      <P>The Education Council meetings scheduled for 26 February &ndash; education &ndash; and 27 to 28 May 2004 &ndash; education, youth and culture &ndash; will be held in the headquarters of the European Council, the Justus Lipsius building, in Brussels. Discussions on agenda items for both meetings are ongoing at the moment. At the February Council it is likely that the adoption of the joint interim report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the detailed work programme on the follow-up of the objectives of education and training systems in Europe will be the main item on the agenda. At the May Council, it is anticipated at this stage that the principal agenda item will be an exchange of views on the new generation of EU education and youth programmes due to commence in 2007.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for marine pollution prevention, preparedness, response and management is assigned to the Irish Coast Guard. This includes responsibility for supervising the planning and implementation by local and harbour authorities of arrangements for the protection of coastal amenity, fishery and wildlife areas, the removal of oil from the coastline and, in the event of a major pollution incident, the direction and co-ordination of the on-shore response. Offshore response to oil pollution incidents is mainly confined to monitoring, oil recovery or dispersing spraying.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard maintains national stockpiles of pollution response equipment at Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dublin. These stockpiles include offshore booms and skimmers. The Coast Guard also has a contract with a commercial company to provide additional equipment on-site within guaranteed timeframes in the event of a serious incident. This contract also provides for aerial dispersing spraying.</P>
      <P>No country has sufficient State equipment to respond to every pollution emergency. Under the Bonn agreement concluded by north European countries and to which Ireland has been invited to accede, mutual support in marine pollution incidents is available, including access to a purpose built oil recovery vessel so successfully utilised in the recent <i>Prestige</i> incident. Ireland is also a member of the EU pollution management committee which can provide experts and also facilitate supports on request.</P>
      <P>The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999 provides for harbour and port authorities, oil handling facilities and maritime local authorities to prepare pollution incident response plans to the Coast Guard for approval. These contingency plans are part of the overall national response framework. Plan templates have been provided to the parties concerned and plans are being finalised. The Coast Guard is also making arrangements for the provision of aerial surveillance facilities from 2004 onwards for the detection of oil spills and other harmful substances. It is also supporting research into the use of satellite technology to identify oil spills.</P>
      <P>Marine pollution response in Ireland is continuously developing and co-operation between harbour-port and local authorities and the oil companies is strongly encouraged and facilitated by the Coast Guard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is a party to OSPAR, the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, which aims to protect and conserve the ecosystems and the biological diversity of the maritime area which are, or could be, affected as a result of human activities and to restore, where practicable, marine areas which have been adversely affected. An enormous range of OSPAR related activities play an important role in the management and sustainable development of our marine resources while protecting the marine environment and the biological diversity of all those species and habitats contained therein.</P>
      <P>In the area of habitat classification and mapping there are a number of projects currently being undertaken in Ireland to protect and conserve the ecosystems and biological diversity of the maritime area of the north east Atlantic. Under the aegis of my Department, work has continued since 1999 on a &euro;27 million survey of Ireland's seabed by the Geological Survey of Ireland. This survey encompasses an area in excess of 400,000 sq. km. that is approximately ten times the size of Ireland's land area and represents one of the largest seabed mapping surveys undertaken anywhere in the world. Maps which result from this survey will provide the basis for identifying those habitats and species in need of protection in our offshore waters. Scientists from the Martin Ryan Institute at NUI, Galway have identified four areas for potential special area of conservation for designation by Dúchas under the EU habitats directive. If successful, Ireland will be one of the first countries taking steps to protect coral habitats in the EU.</P>
      <P>Many other activities are ongoing at EU and international level to prevent further pollution from ships, strengthen the protection of vulnerable coastlines through the declaration of particularly sensitive sea areas. Initiatives are also under way to improve the availability and use of port reception facilities for the disposal of ship generated waste and cargo residues. All these actions contribute to the on-going protection and conservation of the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Dumping At Sea (Amendment) Bill 2000, which amends the Dumping At Sea Act 1996, completed second stage in the Dáil last week. This Bill, <i>inter alia,</i> will provide for the inclusion of any likelihood of interference with important natural or archaeological heritage among the particular matters to be considered before a decision is made on any application for a dumping at sea permit, impose a statutory obligation on all applicants for permits to publish notice of their intentions in a newspaper circulating in the vicinity of the area or areas to which the applications relate and impose a statutory obligation to publish on the Department's website details of all applications for dumping at sea permits.</P>
      <P>Under the Common Fisheries Policy, the conservation of fish stocks is a critical priority. A review of the CFP was finalised at last year's December fisheries Council. The new policy is laid down in Council Regulation 2371/2002. This regulation sets down the framework for the CFP going forward. It identifies the importance of strengthened measures to address the decline of fish stocks to ensure the long-term viability of the fisheries sector through sustainable exploitation of fish stock based on sound scientific advice and on the precautionary approach.</P>
      <P>In relation to stocks outside safe biological limits, the regulation provides for multi-annual plans which establish targets for the sustainable exploitation of the stocks concerned taking account of the conservation status of the stocks, the urgency of their recovery and the characteristics of these stocks and the fisheries in which they are caught. The regulation also provides for the adoption by the Commission or a member state of emergency measures in the event of a serious threat to the conservation of resources which requires immediate action. Greater responsibility is also given to member states in respect of the management of fisheries within their 12 mile coastal zone.</P>
      <P>The December Fisheries Council, which is taking place this week, is considering recovery plans for stocks of interest to Ireland which are outside safe biological limits in the Irish Sea and the west of Scotland. I will be working to ensure that the recovery plans that are introduced for these stocks provide the appropriate balance between the protection of such stocks and the safeguarding of the livelihoods of fishing communities dependent on fishing.</P>

      <P>Where exploration companies make a find of petroleum, that find is then subject to a detailed assessment of its geological and commercial significance. It may be, as regularly happens, that the petroleum is either present in very small and insignificant quantities or is not present in sufficient quantity to justify the enormous costs of development. In these cases there is no commercial justification to proceed and the find is capped, that is, plugged and abandoned. This has happened a number of times in Ireland, most notably in the offshore Connemara oil discovery in 1997 and, more recently, in the two small onshore gas discoveries made in County Cavan &ndash; Dowra No. 2 &ndash; and County Leitrim &ndash; Thur Mountain No. 1 &ndash; during 2001. In other cases, such as the 2002 Dooish gas condensate discovery off Donegal, the capping of a find does not necessarily mean that a final decision has been taken on its commercial significance.</P>
      <P>In principle of course, any capped find is accessible to further appraisal drilling and re-assessment. Such work might be justified by the results of full post-drilling data evaluation, the availability of new technologies, nearby discoveries or changed economic conditions. During all stages of exploration or appraisal drilling programmes a decision to permanently cap a well is only made with the prior approval of my Department.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any circumstances as described by the Deputy in relation to non-petroleum minerals.</P>

      <P>My core broadcasting policy objectives are detailed in my Department's statement of strategy for 2003 to 2005. These objectives are to create an environment which encourages the maintenance of high quality Irish radio and television services by both independent broadcasters and RTE, to secure a viable future for high quality public service broadcasting and to seek to retain access to a range of high quality programming in analogue and digital form, on a universal and free-to-air basis. I have taken a series of practical steps to achieve these objectives.</P>
      <P>In my replies to Questions Nos. 112 of 29 January 2003 and 115 of 4 March 2003, I set out a range of measures to be taken to strengthen the accountability and transparency of RTE and my legislative proposals to give effect to the fundamental reform of public service broadcasting announced by me in December 2002. I have also brought forward new legislation where this was necessary. The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Act 2003 was signed into law earlier this year. The Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003 has passed all stages in the Dáil. I intend to bring forward a Bill in 2004 to establish a new entity to be known as the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. This new body will have responsibility for content regulation for all Irish broadcasters.</P>

      <P>An indicative &euro;200 million was set aside under the e-commerce and communications measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to leverage investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Following the first call for proposals under this measure, five private sector companies signed contracts with my Department with grant thresholds totalling &euro;31.7 million. With the assistance of this funding, Eircom and Esat BT have rolled out digital subscriber lines to many parts of the country, ESB telecoms have constructed a 1,300 km fibre trunk network along their main power transmission grid, and Crossan Cable and Energis have upgraded their cable networks and switches. All of these projects have now been completed.</P>
      <P>The current metropolitan area networks under construction in 19 towns and cities will be completed by the middle of next year with the assistance of Government funding of &euro;64 million. While this is a major investment programme in its own right, the intention is to deliver a great deal more on a new high speed agenda which a progressive economy demands.</P>
      <P>An additional &euro;140 million has been secured from Government in a multi-annual budget between now and 2007 which will, among other things, deliver broadband infrastructure to towns with an aggregate population of over 350,000 people who currently have no access to broadband and no immediate prospect of it. To ensure that small rural communities outside of the urban areas can also get broadband, a group broadband scheme is also proposed. These programmes will be delivered in co-operation with the telecoms industry here.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I outlined details of the new regional high-speed broadband connectivity framework deals with ESB telecoms and Esat BT that will be key drivers of broadband for over 40 towns in all four provinces. In addition to these developments, I welcome this week's announcement by Eircom that it intends to substantially extend its broadband coverage by 2005.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission has drawn up a scoreboard which details instances of infringements by member states in a number of areas, including overfishing of quotas. I have arranged for a copy of the scoreboard for 2001 and 2002 to be forwarded to the Deputy directly. The Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, contains provisions for member states to take the inspection and enforcement measures necessary to ensure compliance with its rules, including those relating to fishing within the quotas allocated to member states. It also provides for member states to follow up on infringements and to impose sanctions where appropriate. While the precise penalties to be taken are a matter for national legal jurisdiction, it is prescribed that these must act as a deterrent in respect of the offence in question.</P>
      <P>Following the review of the CFP last December, a new framework regulation was adopted which provides for a strengthened control and enforcement system to ensure effective implementation of the CFP including the extension of the use of vessel monitoring systems, VMS, and strengthened powers for enforcement officers.</P>
      <P>The new Common Fisheries Policy also contains a heightened emphasis on the need to conserve fish stocks and includes, in particular, provisions for the recovery of fish stocks such as cod which are considered to be outside safe biological limits. The Commission's proposals both for the short-term measures and long-term recovery plans provides for a control regime to ensure the effective implementation of such measures. These proposals are being discussed at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council this week. I am fully supportive of strengthened enforcement as a critical element of any recovery plans and will be working during Council to ensure that measures introduced to protect stocks are strongly supported by appropriate control and enforcement measures which must be consistently applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Marine Institute carries out Irish stock monitoring programmes which feed into the work of other scientific bodies to determine the current status of EU fish stocks. On the basis of the most recent advice, there is a serious concern that many stocks appear to be outside safe biological limits. In so far as the areas and species most affected are concerned, there is particular concern about a number of key whitefish stocks of importance to Irish fishermen, in particular cod and whiting in the Irish Sea, cod west of Scotland and northern hake.</P>
      <P>Stock recovery measures have been introduced for Irish Sea cod, northern hake and cod in the North Sea and west of Scotland. The Commission has prepared long-term recovery plans for these cod stocks and for northern hake and is preparing plans for other stocks. The long-term cod and northern hake plans are being discussed this week at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels and the Commission has placed great weight on achieving agreement on these plans. Ireland has been at the forefront at EU level in pushing for enhanced technical conservation measures to protect fish stocks. I will continue to push for further systematic action in this regard in the context of discussions on recovery plans. I am arranging to transmit to the Deputy the most recent stock assessment book published by the Marine Institute. The book outlines the current status of the fish stocks of interest to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission's recent expanded proposals to extend the limitations on fishing effort to the Irish Sea and the areas off the north west coast which were not included under this year's restrictions are being discussed this week at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels. The Commission's long-term proposals for cod and hake recovery are also being discussed. In discussions with other member states in the lead-up to Council, Ireland has reiterated its view that fishing effort limitation generally is a blunt instrument which will not provide adequate protection to the cod stock in the Irish Sea which is outside safe biological limits. I will continue to put forward a strong case for a continuation and strengthening of the current recovery plan, based on closed areas and technical measures.</P>
      <P>The socio-economic effects of the policies being proposed by the Commission cannot be ignored. I have consistently stressed to my EU Council colleagues and to Commissioner Fischler the severe socio-economic effects that such policies would have, and are having, on Irish fishermen and their families. I will endeavour at this week's Fisheries Council to achieve recovery plans that will provide the appropriate balance between the protection of fish stocks and the livelihoods of fishermen around the coast.</P>

    <P>*Health boards are experiencing difficulties in providing services for home births because of the practice of hospital confinement over the last 20-25 years and the consequent unavailability of experienced practitioners in home delivery. Where a woman chooses to have a home birth and the Health Board cannot provide the service, some boards provide a home birth grant towards the cost of contracting the services of a private midwife.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>These figures should not be readily compared to the figures which were provided on the costs of hospital births in Question No. 204 of 13 November 2003. Costs associated with hospital deliveries include complicated cases requiring consultant and theatre time and pregnancies which do not come to term. Home births are generally low risk, uncomplicated low intervention cases.</P>

      <P>Consultants for the Dublin Port tunnel contractors investigated the subsidence incident in December 2002 on the Dublin-Belfast railway line at Fairview. I understand a detailed review of the consultants' report on the incident has been undertaken by all parties concerned and a number of potential causes of the subsidence were identified. To ensure the safe operation of the railway, it was agreed by those parties that mitigation measures should address each of these potential causes, given that none could be definitively ruled out. An extensive programme of grouting was undertaken outside the tunnel construction envelope to fill any voids that might be present. In addition, detailed monitoring of the track and tunnel has continued and has been augmented by increased visual inspection of the track throughout the period of the works.</P>
      <P>The monitoring process and current activities at the site are discussed at weekly meetings involving all parties concerned and any difficulties or concerns are raised and addressed. Since the subsidence incident, no similar incident has occurred at the site. However, I understand that the monitoring of the track and tunnel will continue until the excavation below the railway has been completed around mid-2004.</P>
      <P>Every activity goes through a risk assessment process before approval is given. A live risk register is maintained for the site and regularly updated. The railway inspectorate of my Department receives fortnightly reports on the works and monitoring at the site and any concerns raised by them are followed up as appropriate. The inspectorate also meet regularly with Iarnród Éireann's divisional engineer in relation to the site.</P>

Under the regulations, local authorities may provide cycle tracks for the use of cyclists where they deem such facilities to be necessary or appropriate. Local authorities may provide such facilities as segregated parts of footways. I have no proposal to amend the current restrictions on the use of footways by vehicles, including cycles.</P>

No decision has been taken on the matter. Irish Rail has some operational concerns about the close proximity of the two stations. If a station were to be considered, it would have to be supported by high density housing developments.</P>

      <P>Support towards staffing costs under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000 to 2006 is only made available to community based projects which can demonstrate that they are addressing disadvantage and are assisting parents who are in employment, education or training. All applications are assessed initially against the programme criteria by Area Development Management Limited and examined by the programme appraisal committee which is chaired by my Department. The committee makes a funding recommendation to me.</P>
      <P>An appraisal of the initial application from the group in question led to a recommendation that the group receive staffing support for one year. The group was to be asked to show clear evidence of its focus on disadvantage in a development plan, the preparation of which would be a prerequisite to any further grant assistance. I agreed with this recommendation and the group was awarded funding towards its staffing costs of &euro;65,000 for one year. I understand that while the group has yet to submit its development plan establishing its focus on disadvantage, it recently submitted a request for additional funding towards its staffing costs. While this application will be appraised, the completion of the development plan focusing on disadvantage is essential to the appraisal process.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the primary role of the Garda Síochána is to enforce the law. At any protest its role is to preserve the peace or prevent any breaches of it. I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that there have been a number of protests concerning the importation of cheap milk at different retail outlets throughout the country. These protests involved farmers taking trolleys and filling them with frozen food and volumes of milk. They would then leave these trolleys in the aisles or at the checkouts causing obstructions. No gardaí were specifically deployed to deal with such protests which have been peaceful and trouble free to date.</P>

Following consideration of his case under the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, a deportation order against him issued on 19 February 2002. He was deported on 13 March 2002. Under the law, the effect of the deportation order is that such a person must leave the State and remain outside it thereafter.</P>
      <P>Our records indicate that both persons referred to had not married at the time of deportation but had indicated an intention to do so. Qualification for payment of one parent family allowance to the partner of the person deported is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.

This lists includes staff serving in my Department and those in other Departments who have expressed an interest in transferring to various locations in that county.</P>
      <P>I should mention the position regarding transfers to provincial areas for staff officers and clerical officers is that they are arranged in accordance with the standardised transfer system which has been agreed with the Civil and Public Service Union and applies to all Departments. The agreement provides that applications for transfer are recorded in order of the date of receipt of each application. When vacancies arise they must then be offered in this order. No formal transfer agreement with the relevant unions exists for staff at executive officer level or above.</P>
      <P>Between my Department and the Courts Service, there are a total of 198 applications for transfer to locations in County Kerry. This figure may include persons who, since making their application, have been promoted or left their parent Department for reasons unknown to my own Department. They also reflect multiple applications by individuals for separate locations.</P>

      <P>Castlebellingham, Kilsaran and Dromiskin are areas of residential development, which have grown at a very fast rate. Consequently, local Garda management have arranged for a change in Garda shifts, particularly in the mid-Louth area. This change has resulted in a greater availability of Garda resources particularly on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.</P>
      <P>I understand in recent months there have been a number of anti-social incidents in the Kilsaran and Dromiskin areas. A number of youths have been made amenable for this anti-social behaviour and were brought before Drogheda District Court.</P>

      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the Adjournment debates on the 12 and 19 November 2003 on the possible transfer to another agency of the running of both Loughan House in County Cavan and Shelton Abbey in County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The Government decision of 11 November last involves the progressive implementation, from 1 January 2004, of a number of measures in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association, POA, on the proposed change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Prison Service. These measures include the making of arrangements for the transformation of the open centres at Loughan House, Blacklion, County Cavan, and Shelton Abbey, Arklow, County Wicklow, into post-release centres for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. The Irish Prison Service is carefully examining the exact arrangements which need to be put in place to give effect to this aspect of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>I have already made it clear, however, that I have no desire to take away the running of Loughan House and Shelton Abbey from the Irish Prison Service.</P>
      <P>I want the POA to agree to a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the continued operation by them of our prisons and the open centres. However, if a consensus is not possible, I will have no option but to proceed, as soon as possible, with arrangements for the alternative operation of both Loughan House and Shelton Abbey and the other measures contained in the Government decision. The Prison Service will arrange for the transfer of prison officers from these locations to other prisons.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, contacts between the Irish Prison Service and the Prison Officers' Association are ongoing and a joint approach to the Labour Relations Commission which, it is hoped, will assist in breaking the current deadlock in negotiations, is under way.</P>

The most recent figures available to my Department from the local authorities concerned indicate that a total of 29 dwellings, provided by Sligo County Council and Sligo Borough Council, were vacant, at the end of December 2002; ten of these were de-tenanted for planned refurbishment.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have information as to particular reasons for the balance of the dwellings being vacant. Vacancies occur on an ongoing basis where dwellings require renovations or improvements to bring them up to an acceptable standard before re-letting. However, local authorities are encouraged to ensure that, once a dwelling becomes vacant, it is re-let as quickly as possible to a household on the waiting list.</P>

      <P>The maintenance of non-national roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from the authority's own resources supplemented by State grants.</P>
      <P>In 2002, the total non-national road grant payment from my Department to Sligo County Council was &euro;9,695,551, of which a sum of &euro;712,000 was paid in respect of the grant category, discretionary maintenance. This year, the initial non-national road grant allocation to Sligo County Council was &euro;9,846,210, of which a sum of &euro;712,000 was again allocated in respect of discretionary maintenance.</P>
      <P>The council may use discretionary maintenance grants, supplemented by its own resources, to fund various works including gritting on non-national roads. The prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for Sligo County Council.</P>

      <P>Details of approved water services schemes in Counties Sligo and Leitrim are set out in my Department's water services investment programme, a copy of which is available in the Library. The programme sets out a timetable under which funding will be provided by my Department to facilitate the commencement of specific schemes in each of the years 2003 to 2005. Funding is also available to allow schemes included in the programme under the rural towns and villages and serviced land initiatives to proceed to construction once the contract procurement process has been completed. In addition, the programme identifies schemes that have been approved to advance through planning and to which construction start dates will be assigned in future phases of the programme.</P>
      <P>The charging of households for water services is prohibited by law and, accordingly, no such charges arise in respect of the operation of wastewater treatment plants.</P>
      <P>Details of recoupments by my Department to Sligo and Leitrim County Councils under the water services investment programme in respect of wastewater schemes are set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the interim report on flooding on the River Shannon by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport were among the factors considered in determining non-national road grant allocations from 2001 to 2003. They will also be borne in mind in determining the 2004 non-national road grant allocations which will be announced in early 2004.</P>
      <P>The significant resurfacing of the non-national roads programme in recent years has provided the opportunity, at the discretion of the road authorities concerned, for prioritising action in relation to the problems identified in the interim report, if necessary on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>My Department will also be prepared to consider sympathetically any request from local authorities in the Shannon catchment area to adjust their multi-annual restoration programmes so as to prioritise works to repair flood damage to particular roads.</P>

      <P>According to the 2002 census of population, out of a total of 391,261 persons aged 65 years and over, usually resident in permanent private households, 1,128 had no water supply and 2,972 had no sewerage facilities. In addition 1,956 persons over 65 had neither facility.</P>
      <P>While there is no emergency funding available from my Department to provide for water and sanitary services for elderly homeowners, there are a number of schemes available to assist elderly persons to carry out essential works to their dwellings.</P>
      <P>The essential repairs grant, which is operated by local authorities, provides grant aid towards the carrying out of works which are reasonably necessary to prolong the useful life of a dwelling. The special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is operated by health boards, assists in improving the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary accommodation. In the interests of elderly persons, the scheme has, since its inception, sought to minimise formal procedural and other requirements. Typically, aid is available for necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant and, in appropriate circumstances, works are carried out at no cost to the applicant.</P>
      <P>Those who do not qualify for assistance under the essential repairs grant scheme or the housing aid for the elderly scheme may, if they would otherwise be in need of local authority housing, qualify to have works carried out under the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing. Alternatively the local authority may be able to provide a house improvement loan. Full details on these options, including application procedures, can be obtained from local authorities.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Question No. 72 of 26 November, it would not be practicable in the current budgetary circumstances to provide for Exchequer funding of a radon remediation grant scheme in respect of domestic dwellings.</P>
      <P>The carrying out of radon remediation works, where considered necessary in respect of private houses is a matter for the householder. My Department's booklet, Radon in Existing Buildings &ndash; Corrective Options, provides advice on a range of appropriate remediation options. For example, improved ventilation all year round would be an immediate and cheap action to prevent build up of radon gas in the home.</P>
      <P>My Department is developing guidelines for local authorities that will recommend a programme of testing for radon in existing rented housing stock, excluding flats above ground floor level. The programme will be prioritised in areas where high radon levels are identified by the RPII and will involve remediation works by the local authorities where necessary. These guidelines will be issued in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has tested 903 houses in County Wicklow and 409 houses in County Carlow for radon. Of the number of houses tested in County Wicklow, 158 were found to have radon concentration levels of over 200 Bq/m³. Of the number of houses tested in County Carlow, 67 were found to have levels over 200 Bq/m³. These figures relate to houses tested for radon by the RPII. There is another company operating in Ireland that also provides a radon testing service in respect of which my Department does not have figures.</P>
      <P>The radon concentration level of 200 Bq/m³ was adopted by Government in the early 1990s as the national reference level above which remedial action to reduce indoor radon concentration levels in domestic dwellings should be considered by the householder. My Department's booklet, Radon in Existing Buildings &ndash; Corrective Options, provides advice on a range of appropriate remediation options. For example, improved ventilation all year round would be an immediate and cheap action to prevent build up of radon gas in the home.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 20, 43, 44, 59 and 60 of 27 November, my Department identified the question of enhancing the status of the Irish language in the EU as an issue in its strategy statement for the period 2003 to 2005.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the need to distinguish between official status &ndash; in the constitutional sense &ndash; and status as a working language for the purposes of the European institutions. There is a list of languages in only one place in the draft European constitution. The Irish language is mentioned on an equal footing with the other national languages of the existing and new member states in that context. By virtue of that reference, which is a reflection of the position in the current treaties, Irish will continue to have constitutional status within the EU. As a result of this status a citizen has, for example, the right to write to any of the European institutes in Irish and to receive a reply in the same language.</P>
      <P>No language is mentioned as a working language in the new draft constitutional treaty. It is not an issue to be addressed in the new constitution. It should be addressed by legislation. It would have to be accepted or amended by unanimity at the Council of Ministers under Article III-339 of the draft constitution.</P>
      <P>My Department's officials are in regular contact with relevant Departments and keep the possibilities for progressing the issue under continuous review. It is too early to say what the outcome of these discussions might be.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board has advised that in the days immediately following the landslide the local community welfare service made efforts to visit every household in the area to ensure that people were aware that assistance was available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Information leaflets were distributed along with a mobile telephone number to be contacted. Health board staff also attended four public meetings to provide information to the community. The community welfare officer called to each family that was affected by the landslide. To date approximately 30 exceptional need payments have issued in response to assistance sought by people affected by the landslide.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 to 315, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There will be two meetings of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council formation during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2004. The first meeting will be held in Brussels on 4 and 5 March 2004 and the second will be held in Luxembourg on 1 and 2 June 2004. There will also be an informal meeting of employment and social policy ministers in Galway from 15 to 17 January 2004.</P>
      <P>The theme of the informal meeting in January is Making Work Pay &ndash; Exploring the Interaction between Social Protection and Work. It covers a wide range of areas where social protection and employment policies interact, for example, supporting transitions to employment, prolonging working life and reconciling work and family life. The purpose of the discussion is to advance the agenda at the political level by exploring the range of actions needed to ensure that benefit and employment policies are mutually supportive. There will also be a discussion entitled investment in human capital.</P>
      <P>The informal meeting will be preceded by a meeting with the European level representatives of the social partners and of civil society on 15 January 2004. It will focus on the topics adaptability and change and making work pay. The discussions will feed into the ministerial meeting the following day.</P>
      <P>The main social policy issues on the agenda for the March Council will involve the preparation of an integrated key messages paper for the spring European Council. The social policy areas covered are likely to include social inclusion, pensions and making work pay. The preparations will be informed by various reports from the Commission and the social protection committee and other committees.</P>
      <P>It is also envisaged that the March council will consider a proposal for amendments to Regulation 1408/71 that governs the social security rights of people moving within the Union. The issue is also likely to feature on the agenda for the June Council. Its policy agenda is likely to include consideration of two topics that will be the subject of conferences to be held in Ireland during our Presidency, namely, the social integration of migrant workers and the impact of family change on social policy in Europe. Full details of the March and June Councils, covering employment, social policy, health and consumer affairs, will not be finalised until nearer the dates of these meetings.</P>

      <P>Data of the type requested by the Deputy is not collated by my Department at county level as the boundaries of local offices are not co-terminus with county boundaries.

The following data are based on the number of people in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance at these offices during the period in question.</P>
      <P>The numbers of persons at local and branch social welfare offices in County Roscommon in receipt of both unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit in the past seven years is as follows:</P>
