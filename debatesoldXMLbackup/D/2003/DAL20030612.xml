      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 and will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notes to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the ongoing public health doctors' dispute, now in its ninth week, the necessity to have the strike resolved as a matter of extreme urgency, particularly in view of the imminent arrival in our country of Special Olympics athletes from all over the world, the extremely serious effects of the strike in many areas, including schools, nursing homes and national disease surveillance, and the immediate imperative to address the issues involved in the dispute in a realistic and constructive manner.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil on the following urgent matter of national importance: the crisis level of bed closures in public hospitals, with more than 500 beds closed throughout the State this year, in particular the situation at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, where facilities have been described by a senior member of the medical team as being of eastern European standards or lower, children with vulnerable immune systems do not have the necessary separate rooms to avoid infections, communal toilets have been described as unhygienic, and up to six children per week in need of chemotherapy are being turned away because of bed shortages.</P>

      <P>I call for the adjournment of the business of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to allow it to discuss a matter of urgent national interest, namely, to ask the Government to explain why the owners of the Atlantic Dawn shipping vessel were freely allocated 14,000 tonnes on the Irish fleet register, which has an <Col N="742" /> estimated market value of &euro;70 million, while other private fishing interests which have contracts at the same time to improve their own boats will not now be allocated any new tonnage, meaning that they or the State may have to carry the cost of the broken contracts that will result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the Order of Business for the following reasons. I welcome the fact that the House is to sit on Fridays to discuss important business, but it should sit with an Order of Business, giving Deputies the right and opportunity to call for votes. The Taoiseach is not here again today, and most of the Ministers are not&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. Perhaps the Deputy might discuss that under Proposal No. 2, which deals with Friday sittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say this while I am on my feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protection of the Environment Bill 2003&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is standing up to speak, and I take it he is opposing the late sitting this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="743" />
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I will explain another reason for my doing so. The Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 is down for Second Stage today and tomorrow, and the vote will not be taken until Tuesday. It is expected that amendments for Committee Stage will have to be submitted by 12 p.m. on Tuesday, when the Bill might not even be finished. It is completely unsatisfactory to have a situation whereby the Bill is scheduled for discussion on Second Stage and Deputies are expected to submit amendments for Committee Stage on Tuesday when that may not even be finished. For those reasons I oppose this Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On that issue, I agree with Deputy Kenny and Deputy Allen, who raised it at the Committee on the Environment and Local Government yesterday. It is presumptuous to schedule the Committee Stage of this Bill for Wednesday and presumptuous to ask Members to submit amendments to the Bill by a deadline which will expire before the division has been taken on the Second Stage. We do not know if Second Stage will be completed tomorrow. It may well be that the Second Stage lasts longer than tomorrow. In any event, even if it is completed, the division on the Bill will probably not take place until around 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. on Tuesday, which is six hours after the deadline which has now been set for the submission of amendments. It is presumptuous of the Government to ask us to deal with the Bill in this way.</P>
      <P>This is a controversial Bill. Under the guise of protection of the environment, the Government proposes to increase charges for refuse services and to make significant changes in the way that regime is administered. Now it wants to bury detailed examination of the Bill by running the deadline for Committee Stage into the Second Stage debate. It is unacceptable and typical of this arrogant Government, which now runs the House by abstention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The late sitting tonight is now becoming the focus of the Protection of the Environment Bill, and rightly so. We should be talking of a later sitting if the Government is serious about finishing the debate on the Bill in the timeframe it arrogantly presumes the debate will need. The Government is not reckoning with the level of anger with the Bill which will ensure many more speakers than the number it is taking for granted. To many people this Bill could be called the protection of the Government Bill or the protection of the county manager Bill. It has very little to do with protection of the environment when one sees the powers in the legislation and the motivation of the Government and its employees at local government level &ndash; the county managers. The Bill should be left to run its normal course if we have any respect for democracy in this House. The committee is being told to have amendments in by midday, before the Bill has run its course which indicates the <Col N="744" /> arrogance of the Government is blinding it to the <i>realpolitik </i>of the situation. We should not allow the guillotine which the Government is trying to introduce regarding the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another example of the cavalier attitude of the Government to waste management. The Government sponsored a referendum to enshrine local government in the Constitution yet within 18 months it withdrew the power of determination of waste management from local government representatives. Here again we see a situation, related to waste management, in which the Government is proposing in cavalier fashion to go to Committee Stage without even concluding Second Stage. The Government has demonstrated it has no interest in the concerns of communities about waste management or the real effects of its measures on individuals and their families. I reject the proposition.</P>

      <P>I raised this issue yesterday at the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government, asking if it was in order to have a deadline for Committee Stage amendments at 12 noon on Tuesday, before the vote on Second Stage is taken? The earliest time a Second Stage vote can be taken is approximately 6 p.m. on Tuesday and the deadline for Committee Stage amendments is 12 noon that day. That is absurd and irregular.</P>

      <P>The ordering of Second and Committee Stages is a matter for the House. The House has to decide the Second Stage before arrangements can be made for Committee Stage. We must clarify that. I ask the Minister for Defence to make clear that the arrangements for the submission of amendments for Committee Stage cannot be made until Second Stage has been disposed of here by the House as a whole.</P>

      <P>I would like to be as helpful as possible to the House. It seems there is a difficulty here and I will ask the Chief Whip to discuss this matter with the committee and see to what extent the requirements of the Opposition can be facilitated in this area. I am anxious to see the Opposition facilitated. We are now setting the business for today and tomorrow but while I want this matter reviewed, I want it reviewed in the context of enabling people to put forward amendments in the proper and appropriate way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This business of Friday sittings which has crept in recently to take the bare look off the paucity of days this Government dictates that the Dáil sits is a fraud. This side of the House is not opposed to a Friday sitting but it is meaningless when the House is convened on a Friday with no Order of Business, no provision for questions, no Adjournment debate, no divisions and no opportunity to challenge the Government. It is entirely meaningless and as my colleague, Deputy Stagg, has pointed out on a number of occasions, it is a new sanitised form of the Dáil being seen to be in session but with no opportunity to function as a Parliament. It is a further step in the erosion of the status of Dáil Éireann <i>vis-à-vis </i>the Executive and the Government. It really is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste does not even bother to come into the House, not to mention the Taoiseach. The Minister for Defence presented himself to do <Col N="747" /> his duty this morning. He was initially unaccompanied on the front bench and is now accompanied by one Minister with a smattering of backbenchers coming in. It is a denigration of democracy.</P>
    <P>This Government, even more than the previous one, has contempt for the normal procedures of Parliament which perhaps arises from the smugness and complacency which comes from having a clear majority in this House. We just heard a discussion on the issue raised by Deputies Kenny and Gilmore where an absurd proposition is being inflicted on the House whereby a deadline has been set for amendments to legislation which has not completed Second Stage. That is an example of the decline in standards in this House in recent times. It is simply not acceptable that we should agree in a cavalier manner that if anybody happens to be around tomorrow, he or she can wander in and there will be no competition from the usual speakers. That is the basis on which Friday sittings are being held. It is not acceptable and I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, as the guarantor of the rights of the Members of this House, to make plain to the Government Whip that we will not continue to tolerate this contempt for democracy and this charade.</P>

      <P>The Green Party shares the sentiments expressed by Deputy Rabbitte. The Dáil is essentially operating as a closed shop. The shop window is open for viewing but, effectively, no business is being carried out. In regard to the legislation which will be debated, the Government has blatantly stated it will be decided and voted on four days after the Friday sitting &ndash; on the following Tuesday. The meaning of the debate will be lost or will be exposed as meaningless and it will be of no consequence since no political decision will be taken tomorrow. The Government does not even have to bother coming in. It can simply open up, turn on the lights and allow Members to come in, so it can get on with what it sees as the real business of Govern<Col N="748" /> ment, namely the moving and the shaking behind closed doors. This House is left to carry on the semblance of a Parliament without the power of one. I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to challenge that.</P>

      <P>The reality of tomorrow's sitting and of the two further Friday sittings which remain this month is that those of us who will engage in debate on the Protection of the Environment Bill might as well be standing at Speaker's Corner in London speaking out on these issues as opposed to being in the House tomorrow because our contributions will have as little relevance or impact. Very few Members will be here other than those who are directly engaged. There will be an exodus from this building this evening in the normal course. The reality is that will be replicated on each of the subsequent two Fridays for all the reasons which have already been outlined.</P>
      <P>I not only object to the absolute unacceptability of the approach to Friday sittings but I reaffirm once again the absolute unacceptability of the means of conduct of Thursday sittings where the Taoiseach has been facilitated in his absence from and accountability to this House by more than just the Government parties, much to the discredit of those who entered into a shoddy deal to allow for his absence.</P>

      <P>On 17 December 2002, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that he would introduce substantial amendments to the Immigration Bill. I raised this with the Tánaiste on the Order of Business some time ago. She agreed the substantive amendments, which would require Cabinet approval, would be circulated to the Opposition spokespeople well before they would be presented. The Immigration Bill is scheduled to be completed before the recess but there is still no sign of the amendments. Could the Minister indicate whether any amendments have been brought to Cabinet, and, if not, when they will be brought to Cabinet, and why the commitment made has not been honoured?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 2, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and in <i>Part 3</i> includes a licence, authorisation, permit or instrument made under sections 222C or 223A of that Act or <i>section 20,</i> or such other licences as may be prescribed by the Minister for the purposes of this definition, provided that any fee chargeable in respect of a licence for the purpose of this definition as extended for the purposes of <i>Part 3</i> shall be limited to the costs of providing the services of the Appeals Officer to such licensees under that Part&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The manner in which this Bill was presented to the Oireachtas was very unsatisfactory. It seems a long time ago since the Bill was in the Seanad and a long time since it was discussed in this House on Second Stage. At that time, Members believed they were discussing a Bill regarding a licensing appeals system and the ratification of international conventions regarding fish stocks. However, in the meantime and as I said to the Minister on Committee Stage, the Bill has grown. We have ended up with a major innovation which is the new licensing system now included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As the House will know, Committee Stage was deferred because of the increasing confusion over the presentation of this legislation. At one point during Committee Stage, when the Opposition spokespersons and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, were trying to wade through most of the amendments, there was the incredible situation where, on one section of the Bill, there were amendments to amendments to amendments to the Minister's new section of the Bill. In the almost 11 years I have been in the House, I have not seen such a messily presented Bill. Given that this vast Department is responsible for a great deal of our key natural resources and infrastructure, legislation in the next term should be more coherent and in finished form when it is first presented to the House. I am not criticising the Minister of State, but his Department has had a year in which to integrate two and a half other Departments and it should be possible, on such a fundamental issue as fisheries licensing, to present a reasonably coherent Bill to the House. The Labour Party is unhappy with the way the Bill has been presented, but we will try to get through as many amendments as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment would have the effect of extending the appeals system to other licenses <Col N="758" /> under the general Act. I hope we will have a full fisheries consolidation Bill in the next year or so and this measure would be a useful addition until the comprehensive legislation is in place. The Minister of State made a number of points about this issue on Committee Stage. The Labour Party studied the Bill at that stage and adjusted the wording to try and take account of the Minister of State's concerns, which was a reversal of the usual situation.</P>

      <P>It is not intended at this time to extend the statutory appeals process beyond sea fishing boat licensing, for which there is an acknowledged and pressing need. A statutory appeals process for sea fishing boat licensing must be given time to operate and will be reviewed after a suitable period. Amending legislation will be needed for extending the remit of an appeals officer and that amending legislation would have to make appropriate tailored provisions for any extended remit considered necessary. We will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Registrar General of Fishing Boats shall be appointed following approval of his or her nomination by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is not here, but I understand he is representing the country at another difficult stage in the defence of the Irish Box, which is of great value to some 25,000 families from Greencastle to Howth to Louth, and I wish him well in that regard. Yesterday, I called for the Minister of State's promotion because he seems to represent his Department to the House on all the key issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key section of Part 2 of the Bill creates an independent licensing authority under the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. This is a valuable initiative which is welcomed by the industry and the Labour Party. This position will be one of the most significant in the administration of the critically important fisheries industry. I feel about this, the same way I did at the time of the appointment of the Ombudsman, Ms O'Reilly, that significant positions like this should require that candidates be presented to the relevant Oireachtas committee, as is the case in the United States. Having heard the views of members, the Minister could then make the decision. The position is sufficiently important to be placed before the Oireachtas, as it will be a key role in the administration of fisheries from now on. It is important that we set out to create an indepen<Col N="759" /> dent licensing and appeals system. It is also critical that these systems be seen to be independent from day one. The best way in which to do so is for candidates for the position to be presented to and approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State told us on Committee Stage that there are some positions in the public service which are at a lower level than that of the Ombudsman. Nevertheless, there is a general feeling that the role should be provided for in the Constitution. I hope Ms O'Reilly is about to set out on six good years of service to the State. The fisheries registrar's role is a particularly important one, given the history and future of the industry, as well as developments in aquaculture, water sports and the fact that we are an island nation. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the Deputy's consistency. He has been vocal on this issue for some time. However, as I said on Committee Stage, there are few public offices which can be filled only following approval of a nominee by the Dáil or Seanad Éireann. One is the office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner and that office, with its extensive remit across the public service, is clearly not comparable with the office of Registrar General of Fishing Boats, with its limited remit. The Registrar General of Fishing Boats has traditionally been a senior civil servant in the Department of the relevant Minister and, as such, is therefore subject to the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 and also the Ethics in Public Office Acts of 1995 and 2001, which require the furnishing of an annual statement of interests. Therefore, I do not accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Registrar General of Fishing Boats shall make and submit to the Standards in Public Office Commission a statement of his or her interests each year.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment follows logically from the previous one. We had a discussion this morning with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, on the Order of Business about spending by Deputies and Ministers during the general election campaign last year. This is a process which has obtained over the last five or six years to try and make public life as transparent as possible, to make it clear how our democracy works and to <Col N="760" /> make sure there is no golden inner circle that can bypass rules. As regards yesterday's publication, the Labour Party has grave concerns about attempts to raise the level of spending. We are used to the fact that we declare our interests. There was controversy in recent days regarding the declarations of interest by one Member of the House concerning the political philosophy he espouses.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the Standards in Public Office Commission. All senior public servants, including elected representatives, should declare their interests. This is an opportunity for the Minister to insert this in the Bill and to create a useful and important precedent. People should be aware of the interests of a person who is maintaining a register of licences and exercising an almost quasi-judicial function. Such a submission to the Standards in Public Office Commission should be a requirement for this office as well as all senior public offices at both national and local government levels. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A policy directive given under <i>subsection (2)(b)</i> may require certain prohibitions or conditions to be imposed in relation to sea-fishing for the purposes of protecting, conserving or allowing the sustainable exploitation of living marine aquatic species.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I advise the House that since Committee Stage I have again very carefully reviewed the Bill in light of concerns expressed by Deputies Broughan, Coveney and Ryan, in particular, to ensure that only safe and sustainable fishing activity is permitted. I share fully those concerns. The substantial package of amendments I propose for the approval of this House addresses specifically the sustainability issue in terms of safeguarding fish stocks and marine aquatic eco-systems from over fishing. It strengthens the law against illegal fishing which undermines sustainability. The safety and sea-worthiness requirements on fishing boats are also being copperfastened.</P>
      <P>With amendments Nos. 13 and 24, amendment No. 4 addresses concerns raised by Deputies Broughan, Coveney and Ryan on Committee Stage about the sustainability of fishing activity which may be licensed. Amendment No. 4 expressly signals that sustainability could be covered in a ministerial policy directive to the licensing authority under section 3 while amendment No. 24 makes parallel provision for ministerial policy directives to an appeals officer under section 6. Amendment No. 13 is consequential on amendment No. 4.</P>

It is addressed by the Minister in amendment No. 16 and I thank him for emphasising the need for vessel inspections to ensure the necessary safety standards are met. We cannot over-emphasise the safety issue. Every summer there are tragic and needless drownings and deaths at sea. After the event, we <Col N="764" /> say it would have been different if only we had done something about safety equipment, safety regulations and improved guidelines. This is the reason I insisted on Committee Stage about requesting the Minister to bring a wording forward which would be legally acceptable and which would emphasise the need for independently carried out inspections of boats prior to the issue of any licence. I thank the Minister for bringing forward amendment No. 16 on the basis of which I will not move amendment No. 14.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will have to excuse me as I have misplaced my glasses and it will take me a little longer to read the wording of the amendment. The Minister of State will see a consistency among my amendments in terms of attempting to introduce time limits on employees of the Department and on the Minister in relation to directives which are to be brought before the Oireachtas. I feel strongly that if we impose time limits on applicants and on the licence applications procedure, we should also impose time limits on Ministers and on the Department in responding to queries and putting policy directives before the Oireachtas. I am a strong believer in setting specific targets rather than using grey terms such as &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. With amendment No. 5 I seek to impose a time limit on the Minister whereby he will place any policy directive he makes before the House within a period of 21 days.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Coveney strongly in this regard. Across a range of Departments we see matters announced in the press many weeks before Opposition Deputies get a chance to respond. Documents may be placed in the Oireachtas Library early on, but the general way in which Government informs the Oireachtas of its decisions is unsatisfactory. The policy directive on the Registrar General of fishing boats is very significant and it is important that the House be informed of the matter as soon as possible. This should be the rule across Government which is why I commend the amendment to the House and support Deputy Coveney.</P>

      <P>This amendment is not accepted. It is not envisaged that there would be a delay of up to 21 days in publishing or presenting to the Dáil or Seanad a written ministerial policy directive to the licensing authority under section 3. No delay is envisaged in publishing or presenting any such directive which will also be available on the Department's website as soon as is practicable after it is made. A matter of two days at most will be involved. As Deputies will know, the Minister has made a commitment that all issues in our Department will be on the website.

      <P>The Minister is missing the point. I accept that things have improved in terms of information being published on the Department's website. When press releases are made and press conferences are called we see it on the website before we are informed in this House. I am attempting to copperfasten in legislation what the Minister is saying will be the case. The wording of the amendment suggests that directives be placed before the House as soon as is practicable while imposing a time limit of three weeks. If it is practical to put a directive before the House within 24 hours, that is great, but it is not acceptable to say it was not practical to place a matter before the House within four weeks. The three week limit will not be relevant most of the time as policy directives will be placed before the House within a couple of days, but Opposition parties need to be sure that they are fully up to speed within three weeks of a decision being made on a directive. The only way to be absolutely sure is not to rely on the good will and transparency of the Department, which exists; it is to copperfasten this provision in legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is proposed in response to concerns raised by Deputy Coveney on Committee Stage. It requires the licensing authority to prepare and present an annual report of its activities. <Col N="767" /> That requirement is on the same lines as the requirements on an appeals officer under paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 22, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, or any commitments given in writing by the Minister or his predecessor,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is probably crudely worded. The intention is to address a concern that does not appear to be covered under the legislation at present. A commitment is given under subsection (7)(<i>a</i>) that any process under the Minister's control in relation to licensing that had commenced before this legislation is enacted would be continued through the licensing authority when this Bill is passed. I am trying to provide the same for any commitments that had been given to boat owners in relation to licensing should they exist, although I doubt that there are many. However, if commitments were given in writing by the Department or the Minister, they should be honoured by the new licensing authority.</P>
      <P>I am willing to withdraw the amendment if the Minister gives me a verbal assurance that if commitments are given in writing by the Minister or his predecessor to boat owners or boat owning companies in relation to licensing, they will be honoured.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 44, after &ldquo;application&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;within a period of 28 days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment reflects my approach of trying to impose timetables on the Department and the Minister to prevent undue or unfair delays for an applicant or for the House in the case of requiring the Minister to put a policy directive before the House. This applies to subsection (3)(<i>c</i>) which provides that where an application is made for a sea-fishing boat licence, the licensing authority may, subject to subsection (4) of this section, allow or refuse the application. I am seeking to insert the phrase &ldquo;within a period of 28 days&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unreasonable that when an application is made, the applicant should know within a month whether it has been successful. That gives ample time to the Department or the licensing authority to process the application. The Minister will say that standard practice to date in the Department is that decisions on licensing are expected to be made within 21 days or less. If that <Col N="768" /> is the standard practice, it is welcome but let us still insist on a time limit and provide that it is unacceptable to go beyond a month in making a decision on a licensing application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not acceptable. In the majority of cases the final decision on sea-fishing boat licence applications must await the response from the applicant with precise details of the boat proposed to be licensed and submission of the necessary condition survey report confirming the safety and seaworthiness of the boat. This often takes up to a year. A substantive reply is issued to most licence applicants within 21 days and all applications are quickly acknowledged on their receipt.</P>
      <P>Licensing of sea-fishing boats is done on a case-by-case basis and the level of customer service by the Department is directly dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the applications received. Obviously, the application must go through a process where the Department surveys the boat. The surveyor must see the boat and sometimes there are enormous delays in that regard. What the Deputy is seeking could not be practically operated.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I will have to withdraw the amendment because the wording does not address that specific concern. The amendment would provide that the decision on the licensing application would have to be made within 28 days and that is not practical.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 48, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;shall have regard to the projected annual targets for economic development under the State's regional and spatial policies and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to section 4 which lays out the criteria by which licences will be granted. There was a lengthy discussion on this on Committee Stage. In my amendments I sought to include more specific consideration of socio-economic and environmental issues under subsection (3)(<i>d</i>). The Minister said the authority may take account of the economic and social benefits which the operation of the boat would be likely to contribute to the coastal communities, the projected number of landings at the ports, the annual tonnage and value of fish and the projected annual level of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this Bill is so welcome is that we have had to put up with much criticism, much of it justified, over the years of the bizarre nature of licensing. I remember referring to the Dingle <Col N="769" /> licences and problems in Lough Swilly and other locations around the coast. Obviously, for these coastal communities the sustainability of the fishing industry into the future and the protection of jobs for fishery workers has to be a critical factor.</P>
    <P>What I have sought to do in this simple amendment is to make it a necessary requirement for the registrar general to have regard to the projected annual targets for economic development under the State regional and spatial policies. The Government outlined its spatial policy some months ago, and my own party has a long-standing regional and spatial policy. Either we are serious about this or we are not. We are all aware that in most of the main fishing ports around the coast, such as Kilmore Quay in the Minister of State's territory, Castletownbere and Greencastle, the industry is very often the most important generator of jobs and wealth.</P>
    <P>Around Greencastle, for example, we have read again in recent days of the great difficulty of the Greencastle fleet in relation to the restrictions on Area 6 in the north-east waters, where the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources allowed Ireland to literally get tangled up in the Scottish nets. Scottish issues were allowed to rebound very adversely on our fishermen and our industry in north-east Donegal. In future, it behoves the registrar general and the Minister, by way of directives, to directly refer to what our employment targets are.</P>
    <P>In recent days I have noted the reports from Castletownbere &ndash; one of our great fishing ports and an area with which I am very familiar &ndash; indicating that 70% of the people of the Beara peninsula are dependent on fishing. It is by far the biggest generator of economic wealth in an area that does not have famous beaches and that is quite remote, being located 240 miles from where I am standing now. It is critical that there be some specific targets for social and economic development. If we are to sustain employment in Beara, Connemara, Donegal, Kerry, south Wexford and my own area of the Howth peninsula, where the industry is an important provider of jobs, then we need specific targets. I urge the Minister of State again to come the extra mile on this. I know he has come some distance with us but my requirement is that he would be more specific. Otherwise, what is the point of having spatial and regional plans?</P>
    <P>I am a member of the regional authority in the east which is in the process of joining up with the mid-east to form a very strong region comprising Dublin and the surrounding counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow. We have regional targets in this kind of development, so why should we not have the same in the fishing industry? Why should it not be a key parameter of the issuing of licences into the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I wish to support Deputy Broughan on this. If regional and spatial strategies are to have any teeth at all, then they need to be confirmed and supported in legis<Col N="770" /> lation. We are not saying that licensing decisions would be dictated by the spatial strategy but that it should be a factor. The wording of the amendment is reasonably balanced. I accept that the Minister of State has come quite a long way in this area and has already accepted an amended wording on Committee Stage which moved things in this direction, but what Deputy Broughan is saying makes some sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not appropriate. The licensing of sea-fishing boats is necessarily done on a case-by-case basis following due consideration of each application. However, within the parameters of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, Section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 &ndash; as restated in section 4 of the Bill &ndash; specifically allows the licensing authority, in assessing any such application, to take account of the economic and social links of the sea-fishing boat concerned with a particular coastal community or region in the State.</P>
      <P>Clearly, sea-fishing boats which could not demonstrate having such economic and social links would have fewer prospects of being licensed. Moreover, the overriding issue, namely, the sustainability or otherwise of the sea-fishing proposed in regard to living marine aquatic species will have to be considered by the licensing authority before deciding on an application for a sea-fishing boat licence. As a result of the ministerial amendment to replace lines 21 to 26 of page 9 of the Bill, any economic development targets which might be specified under the State's regional and spatial policies would have to take sustainability into account, not the other way round.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 1, to delete &ldquo;and social&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, social and environmental&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State because we can be frank and honest and say that he has come a long way in meeting some of the concerns raised on Committee Stage. That is very welcome, and it is rewarding for the Opposition to see that some of the comments and thoughts we put into such matters do bear fruit. I commend the Minister of State and thank him for that. I do not have any problem with amendment No. 24 in his name or with amendment No. 4 which we have already agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would still argue the need for amendment No. 11 on the basis that while <Col N="771" /> amendments Nos. 4 and 24 do go some of the way, they are subject to ministerial directives having to be applied on the particular issue. It is right for us in the wording of amendment No. 11 to take in the full spirit of what the Minister of State himself has agreed in his other amendments &ndash; that our policy in licensing our fishing has to be a balanced one. We have to take into account our economic and social interests but also environmental considerations. Given that the Minister of State has moved in that direction or has recognised it in his own amendments, I hope he will accept this wording.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister of State to amend the Bill himself from the floor on Report Stage. I have looked at the Bill in terms of how else he could encompass what I am trying to get across. One change of wording in the Bill which would achieve this would be to a later section which provides that the licensee has to take into account conservation and rational exploitation of fish stocks. By simply substituting the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; for &ldquo;rational,&rdquo; we would address some of my concerns.</P>
    <P>Even taking that on board, I would still argue that the approach in amendment No. 11, that the licensing authority would have to take into account social and environmental, as well as economic considerations, is the right one. One could look at the type of craft and at its own sustainability in terms of the amount of fuel it uses and the amount of pollution and discharges it produces. One could look at the equipment it is using as certain trawling equipment can be quite damaging to an eco-system. One could look also at whether it is involved in sustainable fisheries or not. The very introduction of the word &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; would give the licensing authority the broad scope by which it could actually take into account all of those different environmental issues. The wording of the amendment is simple and I would be happy to withdraw amendment No. 12 if it is accepted. While the Minister has gone a long way to meet my concerns, without this wording the legislation will require further a ministerial directive to deal with the environmental aspect. It would be easier and preferable to accept the amendment, which is in the same spirit as the Minister's.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>An essential requirement for the licensing authority is to assess the sustainability or otherwise of the proposed sea-fishing activity in terms of the exploitation of living marine aquatic resources. This is highlighted in Government amendment No. 13, as well as Government amendments Nos. 4 and 24. It represent a major policy advance. Wider environmental issues are a matter for the relevant competent authorities with a wider remit than the licensing authority. In addition, the licensing authority is specifically obliged to consider whether a sea-fishing boat proposed for licensing would confer economic or <Col N="772" /> social benefits on any coastal community in the State. Sustainability would be a key factor in such consideration.</P>

      <P>This is the most complicated process in which I have been involved in the House in that we are considering amendments to amendments that were originally amendments. I take the Minister of State's point regarding amendment No. 13, which also addresses some of my concerns. However, perhaps he will elaborate on the problem in terms of general Government policy. I believe the Government is interested in moving in the direction of sustainability and, on that basis, I would have thought that when setting broad policy objectives, the Government would consider economic, social and environmental interests, which constitute a definition of how sustainability is measured. In view of this, I do not understand the Minister of State's problem with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <P>I accept the Minister has gone a long way to meet the concerns expressed by the House on the environment and sustainability. However, one of the difficulties with the Common Fisheries Policy is that decisions are made by qualified majority voting. With the expansion of the Union next year to 25 member states, Ireland's influence as a small country will be even more diminished. Does the Minister of State envisage that a common fisheries policy could be decided against our will, or is it possible that we would be out-voted on the need to conserve the environment and the sustainability of our fish stocks and industry? I hope the Minister will be successful in the ongoing discussions on this aspect.</P>
      <P>Is there a danger that the use of the word &ldquo;requirements&rdquo;, set out in the amendment, may be too weak, especially in a situation where the Government may consider it has been maltreated by the European Union? It must be acknowledged that Ireland's fisheries interests were sacrificed in the negotiations on our accession to the EEC. As a result there has been an ongoing battle for 30 years to retrieve some of the losses incurred in this area. Does the Minister of State foresee any dangers if, God between us and all harm, the Minister does not deliver?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's amendment is excellent. We know what Deputy Eamon Ryan was trying to achieve on Committee Stage, although we agreed it would not be possible, especially in the context of EU requirements, where it is not possible to refuse a licence in respect of a fishing boat in the Irish fleet because the individual concerned does not live in Ireland. The Minister of State's amendment will require that details regarding boat ownership, regardless of whether the owner lives in Ireland, be provided to the licensing authority and be available to an agent in this country. It is a progressive step. I had not expected the Minister of State to introduce such a positive amendment in terms of addressing Deputy Eamon Ryan's concerns. It is very welcome.</P>

This is in response to Deputy Eamon Ryan, supported by Deputies Broughan and Coveney, and I thank the officials, in particular Mr. Tobin, for finding a wording that could deal with this matter without interfering with EU regulations. It is a worthwhile amendment and I thank the Deputies on the opposite side of the House.</P>

      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 5 to 11.</P>
      <P>I have a concern which I raised in the form of a question on Committee Stage and that I hope the Minister of State may solve. There is a practical concern about linking specified conditions on the nationality of crew with licensing and expecting that the portion of crew that may be non-Irish would not be allowed to change during the term of the licence. The reality, as we all know, in the fishing industry is that it is at times very difficult to get crew, and at other times, depending on economic conditions it is not so difficult. The nationality of crew changes from time to time, depending on the size of the vessel, where it is going and what it is doing. I have a real concern that the wording is too restrictive on the flexibility that boat owners and skippers need to employ crew from inside and outside the EU, from within or outside Ireland. I hope the Minister of State will be able to allay my concerns so that I can withdraw the amendment but if he cannot I will have to press it because I think it does not make any practical sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not accepted under the Fisheries Acts. The current requirement is that at least 50% of the crew of licensed sea-fishing boats are EU nationals, whether nationals of Ireland and/or of another EU member state. That requirement, which is in line with EU policy, is designed to foster economic links of EU sea fishing boats with coastal areas in the EU and is subject to review over time. It is clearly in the national interest to retain that requirement. For example, the requirement was reduced from 75% to 50% a few years ago in the face of crewing difficulties being experienced by some Irish sea-fishing boat owners. With the scheduled addition of up to ten EU member states next year <Col N="776" /> continuance of the 50% requirement should pose no difficulty for Irish sea-fishing boats in crewing their boats, rather the opposite. Nevertheless the Minister and I hope to see more Irish people crewing Irish fishing boats and to help sustain Irish coastal communities in the future. BIM has been promoting careers at sea recently in a major way by offering FETAC courses in commercial fishing and intensive one year Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources fishing vessel engineering class courses for new entrants. Within the Department, and with BIM, we are promoting possibilities and opportunities for Irish people to enter and work on these boats but the situation that exists at the moment has to be adhered to and it is working reasonably well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister of State is saying about requiring a 50% EU nationality within the crew. My concern is the wording here where it says: &ldquo;required for so long as the licence is in force the members of the crew of such boat or any portion of such members specified in the condition shall be of a nationality specified in the condition.&rdquo;  Does that mean that if, for example, a boat has 70% Irish crew at the moment and they want to change that to 80% the portion of crew is changing and is not under the same conditions as when they got the licence? I do not want to facilitate boats having more than 50% of their crew from outside the EU. If the portion is changing from 60% to 80% or from 70% back to 50% of Irish or EU nationals, my reading of the wording, and I may be wrong in this, is that one cannot change the portion of such members specified in the condition. Does that mean that the condition is 50% and one cannot change that portion, in other words one cannot change the 50% figure that has been agreed? Is that what the wording is saying? If when one gets the licence 60% of the crew are Irish and 40% are Lithuanian and in six months time one wants to change that to 50/50 proportions is that allowed under this wording? If it is, my concerns are baseless. I just want to get the Minister of State's assurance.</P>

      <P>That is a ridiculous situation. Is the Minister of State saying that if somebody needs to change crewing over a weekend, for example, before the boat goes out, he or she has to re-apply to the Department to change the make up of the crew? In a vessel that employs 40 or 50 people, as many of the vessels would, particularly coming out of a port such as Killybegs or Castletownbere, is the Minister of State saying that the captain cannot change the portion over the weekend depending on who is available? It seems to be far too rigid a system. If one is changing from 50% Irish to 55% over a weekend does one have to apply to the Department to get permission to do that?</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 22, after &ldquo;revoke&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or suspend (for such period as he or she sees fit)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the suspension of a sea-fishing boat licence in the event of illegal fishing coming to the attention of the licensing authority. The current law provides only for the revocation of the licence in such circumstances, which may be too drastic a measure. The timing and duration of the suspension would be a matter for the licensing authority to decide, subject to appeal to the court under the new subsection being inserted into Section 4 of the Bill by amendment No. 21.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 21 is consequential on amendments Nos. 16 and 20 and comprises three paragraphs. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) requires the holder of any licence suspended or revoked by the licensing authority to return the licence to the licensing authority as soon as practicable. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) makes it a summary offence punishable by a fine of not more than &euro;500 for the licence-holder who fails to return to the licensing authority a sea-fishing boat licence suspended or revoked by the licensing authority. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) empowers the District Court to vary or end the period of suspension if appeal is made to it.</P>

      <P>These seem reasonable amendments to give the registrar general sufficient powers. On amendment No. 20, which gives the officeholder the power to suspend a licence for such period as he or she sees fit, is there any guidance in the original legislation to which we have referred, such as the Fisheries Act 1959 or the Fisheries Act 1967? I hope that there will be a consolidation Act in order that we have a basic reference for the industry. Is there any precedence in any other part of the current controls?

      <P>I welcome amendment No. 20. The licensing authority should have the power to suspend as well as revoke a licence for such time as it sees fit. Essentially, it gives it an extra option. Otherwise the licensing authority may feel that it needs to take some action against a boat-owner but that revoking a licence is probably over the top. For economic reasons it may not want to damage the industry but may need to impose a sanction or punishment of some sort. I am glad the Minister has proposed this amendment, which gives the licensing authority another weapon in its armoury, and that is welcome.</P>
      <P>On subsection 6(<i>b</i>), dealt with in amendment No. 21, a fine not exceeding &euro;500 is a fairly derisory amount. If someone is required to hand over his or her licence because it is suspended or revoked and refuses to do so, we should consider a fine far in excess of &euro;500. I know that there is also the option of summary conviction, but it is not appropriate to put people in prison for such an offence &ndash; fining them is far more appropriate. People should not be in prison unless they are a danger to society as it is costly to keep them there. The natural alternative is to fine them but &euro;500 is no deterrent whatsoever.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 4, to delete &ldquo;registered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical point regarding the original amendment and goes back to when this was a much smaller Bill. I am not sure what the Minister of State is doing but the Labour Party view is that the phrase &ldquo;registered post&rdquo; in section 7(2)(<i>a</i>) is unnecessarily restrictive. With this type of appeals system it has been the practice that unless the postage has to be proved, we can use ordinary post.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair probably finds this strange but this is possibly the fifth set of amendments and some are amendments to amendments. The hard-pressed officials accompanying the Minister <Col N="782" /> should come in with a Bill they are going to accept. We are making law and it is important we do not make a mistake.</P>
    <P>This amendment refers to the right of appeal and relates to the matter accepted by the Minister of State &ndash; the Bill did not expressly state that an appeal by a third party must be served on the applicant, though that seems to be clearly the Minister's intention. On a previous Stage the Minister said an applicant will be kept informed, but we feel the applicant should know what the position is from the start. That is what we are trying to achieve with this amendment. Is the Minister of State moving on this?</P>

      <P>I remembered another Bill in which we moved similar amendments. This amendment relates to the appeals officer conducting oral hearings. He or she may take evidence on oath or affirmation and we sought this amendment because the Oaths Act 1888 may only apply to legal proceedings as opposed to administrative proceedings. We felt it was better to put the matter beyond doubt and on a previous Stage the Minister said that under the Interpretation Act 1937 &ldquo;oaths&rdquo; includes affirmation. However, the Interpretation Act does not say that but that oaths include affirmation for any person entitled by law to affirm rather than swear. Where is the entitlement in this regard? The Oaths Act provides an entitlement to affirm for certain persons for proceedings, which may mean legal proceedings, but to cater for this kind of administrative proceeding we should also refer to affirmations. That is our legal advice.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) A solicitor or counsel appearing before an Appeals Officer at an oral hearing shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were acting in proceedings before the High Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because the Bill as it stands deals with the immunity of witnesses but not of legal representatives. The Minister of State already mentioned immunity for legal advisers but when they become advocates they represent their clients and are liable to be sued. The Minister of State says they still have privilege, but under what statute or rule of law does that arise? Is the Minister of State accepting this amendment? </P>

      <P>This amendment is not appropriate. Counsel and solicitors are entitled to certain privileges by virtue of their role as legal advisers.

      <P>This amendment is an attempt to require an appeals officer to supply a copy of the details of an appeal to each party involved and to include a timetable within 21 days. We seem very fond of the phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; but that does not mean much. I do not feel that strongly about this but if one looks at the planning process one sees that timetables have been put in place very successfully to ensure we get results within a certain period. I do not see why we cannot use that rationale in other areas and a three week time limit is reasonable, though I hope &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; would mean a lot less than three weeks. I have made this point twice already so I will not labour it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" />In page 18, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;16.&ndash;Where an appellant who is not the applicant for or holder of a licence to which the appeal relates makes comment in writing pursuant to <i>section 13</i> or <i>15,</i> an Appeals Officer shall, as soon as practicable, give a copy of any such comment to the applicant or holder and the applicant or holder may make a final comment in writing thereon to the Appeals Officer not later than 14 days after having been given the copy.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the final right of appeal by the applicant or holder. Based on our experience of the planning area, I believe there is a loophole in the Bill where a person whose livelihood is at stake is the applicant for or a holder of a licence. That person must have a right of reply which must be final. The right of that person must take precedence over the right of the third party objector. As it stands, this is not the case. Where the third party appellant makes submissions under sections 13 or 15, the applicant holder is left out of what the Minister called the &ldquo;documentary loop&rdquo;. He or she has no right of reply, save on an exceptional discretionary basis. If that right of reply is not exercised, the third party has a further right of reply. Clearly, the cycle of reply and rejoinder cannot continue forever. We are of the view that the applicant holder of a licence must be the person who has the last word. This is, to some extent, reflected in sections 13 and 15, as the Bill stands. However, the Minister has left a loophole which the Labour Party wants to close. A right of reply is a matter of right and not of discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not considered to be necessary having regard, in particular, to the wide powers of the appeals officer in section 12. The word &ldquo;final&rdquo; in the suggested amendment would unnecessarily limit the application of section 12. Under section 12 the appeals officer, where he or she considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so, can request any party or other person who made or was entitled to make a submission or observation to the appeals officer on an appeal to make a submission or observation on any matter which has arisen in the appeal in question. Thus section 12 is not confined to matters arising under previous sections of the Bill on the appeal in question but extends also to matters arising under sections 13 to 15 on that appeal. The appeals officer must have the final say in bringing the appeals process to a close as section 16 envisages, subject to the possibility of a judicial review as provided for in section 19.</P>

The applicant or the holder would be placed in a difficult situation by perhaps omitting something <Col N="787" /> from the original appeal and not having a final opportunity. This might be a slightly cumbersome process but we, as public representatives, have some experience of appeals processes. It is important that the person whose livelihood is most at stake should have a fundamental last word in this regard.</P>

    <P>The Supreme Court should be included in respect of the application for judicial review. It should be entitled to decide whether it wants <Col N="788" /> to hear an appeal. On Committee Stage, the Minister may have been incorrect when he said he was not shutting off the possibility of appeal and that refusal of leave to appeal could be appealed to the Supreme Court. This is because the Supreme Court has held that a refusal of leave to appeal by the High Court is not appealable to the Supreme Court. Consider this in light of the case of Baby O <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the 2002 Irish law reports.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the amendments would involve forum shopping but this is also incorrect because one would have to make an application to the High Court first in any event.

    <P>(<i>e</i>) the introduction of regulations which set dolphin bycatch limits and mortality caps for certain specific fisheries with high bycatch rates based on scientific advice and agreed observer protocols with set reductions in fishing effort being introduced once agreed bycatch limits had been reached;</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>) as required by the European Union Habitats Directive, the Minister may designate suitable areas as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) for the harbour porpoise and the bottlenose dolphin. The Minister may introduce fishing restrictions including&ndash;</P>
    <P>(i) bycatch reduction measures specified above,</P>
    <P>(ii) measures to reduce fishing impacts on important prey species for harbour porpoise and/or bottlenose dolphin within or bordering the SAC,</P>
    <P>(iii) measures to reduce disturbance impacts by fisheries,</P>
    <P>(iv) measures to reduce impact of fisheries on habitats within SACs to reduce bycatch,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(<i>g</i>) the Minister may establish an accreditation scheme for those fisheries or fishing vessels adopting or providing assistance in researching cetacean-friendly methods of fishing.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the appropriate legislation in which to include the measures I propose by way of this amendment. The Schedule lists the highly migratory fish stocks that I am concerned are suffering at present or which are being lost unnecessarily because of our fishing activities. The main purpose of the amendment is to reduce the level of bycatch of small dolphins and cetaceans and to put in place measures whereby we can monitor this level statistically and with accuracy.</P>
    <P>The first part of the amendment is probably the most important and seeks the allocation of independent, on-board observers who can monitor bycatch levels so we can be statistically certain of them. There are many different estimates. In certain cases, up to 30 dolphins have been caught in one trawl involving Irish boats. We know that many of the gill netting methods we use are trap<Col N="790" /> ping a large number of dolphins in Irish waters. The belief among the environmental community, based on the statistics we have to hand, is that bycatch is reducing the population of dolphins and small cetaceans.</P>
    <P>People will be aware of the high profile of certain dolphins, such as Fungie or the Fanore dolphin, but they may not be aware that thousands of dolphins are being killed every year in Irish waters due to fishing activities. This is also the case in other waters, such as those along the French and other coasts, where we are engaged in pair trawling and other trawling methods, which have a serious effect in terms of the level of bycatch. This is a serious issue. We have declared our own whale and dolphin sanctuaries, yet we are allowing the mammal species which share our waters to be killed.</P>
    <P>The main content of the amendment is similar to that in recent reports on how the UK hopes to develop its policy. We also have had some help from the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group and other international organisations. We are suggesting what will probably come into effect throughout Europe in the coming years. We know the European Commission is keen to tackle this issue. It has stated that we should now be introducing independent monitoring systems on boats. Therefore, I am not proposing something which is radically ahead of European policy or which is radically different to what other countries are considering. If we do not introduce the proposed measures in this Bill, we will have to wait some years for the slow legislative process to put them into place.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to introduce the changes. The conservation section is looking at the same sort of measures as I am speaking about. The Minister of State may state the same effect can be achieved by regulation but it is important that we be seen to take the issue seriously and put it into legislation when we have the chance to do so, and not just do so when we are compelled by some order from the European Union.</P>
    <P>Some technologies are more effective than others. The issues of whether pingers or certain grids are successful is debatable and requires scientific analysis. We are not saying that they have to be introduced immediately but they might be of some benefit. I promote the use of certain reflective nets, which will be effective in reducing bycatch. The use of such technologies costs money and, in certain cases, reduces the level of fishing and leads to more expensive equipment. In the longer term, it leads to a reduction in bycatch and allows us sell our fishing products abroad and say we are doing the right thing and achieving our objectives in terms of sustainability. The customers will recognise that we will get a premium price. It will be better for the Irish fishing industry in the longer term even if there are costs and impositions involved in the shorter term.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will take this issue seriously and accept the amendment in the spirit that it has been tabled. This Bill is the appropri<Col N="791" /> ate legislation in which the Government should state that it treats the issue of bycatch of small dolphins seriously. The public wants it to be taken seriously, as does the European Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a wide-ranging discussion on this issue on Committee Stage. The detail of effective controls to be imposed by regulations under section 25 of the Bill on highly valuable and vulnerable fish stocks, including certain cetaceans, has yet to be decided at EU level and beyond but could include some or all of the measures mentioned in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) of the Deputy's amendment if the considered expert view is that they could be effectively put in place. Other non-regulatory measures may have better prospects of success than some of the technical regulatory ones identified so far in the context of required concerted international actions. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to specify particular technical regulatory measures and not others in section 25 of the Bill, which is purposely wide enough to give effect to the concerted international measures to be agreed in due course.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>f</i>) is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and paragraph (<i>g</i>) is essentially a matter for the fishing industry to pursue as a market initiative. I understand where Deputy Eamon Ryan is coming from and he would have support from our Department in terms of the overall picture. The protection of small cetaceans against over-fishing is an international problem requiring effective international actions, both within the EU and beyond. The recent UK consultation document emphasises that the issue transcends EU boundaries. Considerable attention is being paid at national and international levels to measures to address the problem. The banning of drift netting for tuna represents a measure of progress but much remains to be done, and Ireland will continue to participate actively in the relevant international fora for addressing these issues.</P>
      <P>If conclusions could be reached at EU and international level, what the Deputy is talking about could be introduced through ministerial regulations and would not necessarily mean reintroducing a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the Minister of State is saying this must be dealt with on an international basis but that it is likely that the type of regulations proposed in our amendment are ones that probably will come in the near future through international community efforts. Surely it is no harm for the Government to make a stand and take a lead. We did that when we set out Irish waters as a whale and dolphin sanctuary. We must back that up with some real detailed measures, particularly the allowing of observer status on boats to measure bycatch. We are good at lip service and at doing the easy thing but not so good at doing the harder thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" />I take the point that ministerial regulations might allow some of the measures, but this amendment would allow us to make a statement as to how we want to go and that is why I am pressing it. Could we set up, under the current system or by ministerial regulations, onboard observers to measure bycatch on a statistically accurate level? </P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed in committee a couple of weeks ago the Council regulation for the conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms, COM/2002/672 of 4 December 2002. The committee is just trying to get used to the idea of what invigilating the regulations involve. It is supposed to invigilate the regulation and hand the committee's deliberations to the Minister when he goes to Brussels.</P>
      <P>I am sympathetic towards my Green Party colleague in regard to this matter. The Government has an awful record in this regard. One of the worst decisions made in this area regards the assurance the Taoiseach gave about three or four years ago to the people I represent in Fingal, north County Dublin, that he was going to save the seal sanctuary. Despite endless questions from Deputy Ryan, former Deputy Owen, myself and others, he blithely disregarded the commitment.</P>
      <P>Given that as island nations ourselves and the British are unique in the EU general marine ecosystem, although we will be joined by Malta, we should take a lead. In this regard Deputy Ryan's well thought out and well crafted amendment deserves support. Obviously, we must strike a balance between protecting the livelihoods of the workers in the industry and our fragile and valuable marine ecosystem. The amendment is extremely valuable in regard to the small cetaceans. Can the Minister of State give us some assurance that we are going to move and will have immediate European legislation in this regard?</P>
      <P>It seems that many areas of the marine have been forgotten once again. Initially this Government forgot to have a Department of the Marine. Unfortunately, this signifies the way the Fianna Fáil Party down through the years has treated marine issues. The reality is that there has been 30 years of neglect. Hopefully this side of the House will get the chance to remedy that some day. This valuable amendment is one small step forward and should be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This detailed amendment is clearly well thought out. However, I have some concerns. Is it appropriate to highlight dolphins as opposed to another species or type of fish or mammal requiring conservation? I have limited experience regarding marine legislation but I am not sure that it is normal to specify what the Minister may do. The wording in the legislation already says quite clearly that conservation regulations may include such incidental, supplemen<Col N="793" /> tary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary for the purpose of regulations. Having said that, I accept Deputy Ryan's point that this is an opportunity for us to make a statement in legislation. Perhaps we should not pass up that opportunity.</P>
      <P>Bycatches are a huge issue and a case the industry itself would argue. The concept of putting independent observers on vessels is something we should examine seriously. Did the Minister respond as to whether that is possible under directive or regulation without further legislation? He should have it within his power to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Minister would have that power and we should ensure this legislation gives it. In regard to dolphins, I would like some stronger mention of the need for conservation of other species. Perhaps we should say &ldquo;species such as dolphins&rdquo;. I am not sure what power we have now to include amendments or to agree them from the floor. On balance, I support Deputy Ryan's amendment. He does make a qualification within the amendment by saying &ldquo;These measures could include&rdquo;. It is really a statement of intent that we are taking the issue seriously in regard to dolphin bycatches. He is not committing the Minister to introducing these measures but just giving the Minister an option. On that basis I am happy to support his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We will certainly give Deputy Ryan's request some consideration. I understand where he is coming from and the support of the other Deputies. The decisions in this particular area must be made in the wider fora at EU and international level. Once this Bill is passed it will give us a stronger voice to put Deputies' views at EU level on making decisions quicker in this regard. I assure Deputies that the Department will be fully involved in the debate and will reflect the views of Deputy Ryan and his colleagues. At the moment what we have is as far as we can go today.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said that section 25(3)(<i>f</i>) is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local <Col N="794" /> Government. Section 24 of the Bill allows for conservation areas along similar lines to what I propose. Why I feel 25(3)(<i>f</i>) is necessary is that it takes the statistical information we would glean from having onboard observations and uses it to decide whether areas should be declared special areas or whether fishing should be restricted in certain areas. My point is that section 25(3)(<i>f</i>) is necessary and should not relate back to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It is a fishing related issue. Can the Minister of State clarify whether we have the ability, under regulations or legislation, to operate an onboard observation system for bycatch?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill 2002, which gives a statutory basis to its three constituent bodies, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance.</P>
      <P>This Bill was initiated two weeks ago and during the wide-ranging debate on the evolution of the economy, I was reminded that prior to my entry to Dáil Éireann, I spent 20 years in the same line of work. It is a privilege that I was able to be self-employed from the early 1980s until last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy of this State over that 20 years, which is not a long time in real terms, has changed radically. At times, when one listens to the comments made in the House, one would think nothing in the State is working satisfactorily and that the situation is dismal. I am the first to <Col N="799" /> admit that there are problems but we have seen considerable progress over the past two decades.</P>
    <P>In the early 1980s there was high unemployment, inflation, bank interest rates and large-scale emigration. To this day the effects of that era are still palpable &ndash; many of my best friends from college and university emigrated. It was known as the &ldquo;brain drain&rdquo;, we educated people here and they left. It was a sad reflection on the State at the time.</P>
    <P>I have lived in Clondalkin all my life and I have seen the area grow, develop and change considerably. I have been involved in community activities there for many years and could see that there were parts of Clondalkin which experienced very high unemployment in the 1980s. It still exists but the rates experienced then are not the case now. We must, however, look at the effect of unemployment, not just on the individual but on the whole community. It devastated part of my constituency for a decade. People lived with no hope and the only prospect was to get out. That was a sad reflection on the country then. People had no dignity, self-worth or self-belief.</P>
    <P>My involvement in education brought that home to me. I have been involved in the boards of management of a number of schools for some years and often we would examine absenteeism in detail. When we took the time to discuss the situation with teachers and families, we saw that many of the young people going through the educational process had no interest, enthusiasm or motivation. They came from a background where there was no prospect of employment. They could not remember their fathers ever working and their older brothers and sisters could not find work or emigrated. Motivating young people in such a system was difficult. We were fighting a losing battle. Many of those who went through the system and did well for themselves emigrated. That was the situation in the State in the early 1980s.</P>
    <P>Today things have changed. Not everything is right, I recognise many of the problems we face and although there are still parts of my constituency experiencing social and economic disadvantage, if we look back, we can see the significant improvements that have been made since then. I meet people who suffer as a result of disadvantage on a regular basis but on a macro level the situation has improved significantly.</P>
    <P>Participation rates in primary, secondary and third level education have greatly improved. We have broken the cycle of extremely high unemployment in areas where we thought we would never break it. There are many initiatives for children which are vital because we must get children at a young age into education. That cannot be emphasised enough because the future economic prosperity depends on it. If people living in disadvantaged areas cannot understand the necessity of education or cannot be afforded that opportunity they will always be at a disadvantage economically.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" />We have broken out of that cycle to an extent, although perhaps not enough. Travelling through parts of my constituency that would be classed as disadvantaged, the improvements of the past two decades are obvious. There is an emphasis on the involvement of pre-school children, there are after-school education and homework clubs and a wide range of other activities. While the area has one of the lowest take-up rates for third level education, it is far higher now than it has ever been in the past. It is not high enough but it is heading in the right direction.</P>
    <P>More people are working in my area than ever before. They all have good jobs but more people are working. The difference work makes both to the individual and to the community he or she represents and in which he or she lives is unbelievable. All one has to do is walk down the street and one sees a different way of life. These people no longer appear grey, dull and fed up, they have a purpose and they aspire to better jobs. Many who have young children can see that their children should aspire to better jobs. Employment has given people a dignity, a self-belief and a self-esteem that many from my constituency have never had. The period from the early 1980s to date has probably seen the greatest growth in prosperity.</P>
    <P>Those who emigrate nowadays do so by choice. Most school leavers decide to go to Australia, America or elsewhere. In the past it was known as the brain drain and it occurred because there was very little opportunity. Individuals and communities have found a dignity of which they had been robbed for so long because of unemployment. This dramatic change did not happen overnight or by chance. Much as Fianna Fáil and various Ministers would like to claim, it did not happen solely under Fianna Fáil, but over an extended period. Numerous Ministers from both sides of the House were involved in the transformation. A key element of the transformation was not merely what the Government of the day did &ndash; certainly it had a major role to contribute &ndash; but also social partnership. Social partnership, into which we entered in 1987, was a new way of doing business in Ireland. Those who engaged in it would freely admit they did not get everything they wanted but would also admit their lot has been greatly improved. There are sections that have not done as well as others. If one looks at the country as a whole, those who engaged in that social partnership from trade union leaders, trade union members, workers who were not members of trade unions, employers and nationally across the country have seen the benefit of partnership. It should be acknowledged there have been significant improvements during that period. It has been primarily due to the partnership engagement that endured here for that period. I would love to stand up and say it was a successful Fianna Fáil Government &ndash; it played its part &ndash; but it was social partnership.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced a couple of weeks ago I listened with interest to the Taoi<Col N="801" /> seach, as I always do, when he made his contribution. A point to which he alluded was that Ireland's debt-GDP position is such that the ratio has fallen from 65% in 1997 to about 34% at the end of last year. In reality this means we have one of the lowest debt ratios in the EU with the exception of Luxembourg. The reduction in the debt GDP ratio has largely been achieved by the economic policies pursued by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>We are going through difficult and turbulent times from a global point of view. Economic growth in Ireland certainly is not what is was as there is a slowdown, with the resultant reduction in revenue available to Government. We are committed to driving the economy forward and managing it in a sustainable way. One of the key elements of that is to successfully target foreign direct investment in Ireland. When revenue to Government is reduced, despite the fact that the economy is growing albeit at a slower pace than we had been used to, but at a higher rate than the EU average and most EU states, if we want to continue our economic advance what is the best way to do that? Is it now time to consider borrowing for major infrastructural projects? I say that with a degree of caution, because borrowing in the past has not always been successful. I appreciate there are various guidelines on debt within EU guidelines for stability and growth. If we want to maintain our growth and our economic focus for the next five to ten years, is the possibility of borrowing for major infrastructural projects worth considering? This is a debate that needs to be entered into but there is a certain caution because in the past borrowing has not always been for viable projects with a financial return. At a time when interest rates globally are relatively low, it is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I look at the whole idea of borrowing at this stage because it is important to provide the necessary internal infrastructure if we are to continue to attract foreign investment. There has been a tendency by foreign investors to try to locate around the city. As the House is aware we have adopted a spatial strategy but if we are to be successful in implementing it one of the key elements must be to provide the necessary infrastructure. Up to the current year investors have chosen to invest in and around our city. The idea of borrowing to fast track the necessary infrastructure is an issue that will have to be addressed. I pose that as a question rather than making a political statement. Members of the Opposition will probably jump on the bandwagon and say, we have to assess it in economic terms, what it will cost, what it will deliver and if the return is worth the investment. I put it down as a genuine question. Because of the economic slowdown, if we are to try to maintain our economic progress, it is something we need to look at. I am convinced it is worth trying to provide this infrastructure because we have a history of being successful at bringing foreign direct investment into Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" />This morning I looked at the recent IDA Ireland report which refers to direct investment into the country. It states that it was cautiously optimistic for 2003 in regard to inward investment activity, despite the turbulent global conditions. The optimism has now been confirmed by the delivery of 36 IDA supported projects with about 6,300 jobs announced since last September. That is significant. I shall refer to the nature of those jobs later. Earlier I mentioned the importance of education. That was 6,300 jobs coming from direct investment into Ireland. Seán Dorgan went on to say that Ireland's economy was in a significant transition in relation to inward investment. With the changing local and global economic circumstances inward investment has to move up the value chain and become more skills based and innovation led. That brings me to the point about the importance of education. The jobs we are getting are higher skilled.</P>
    <P>In my area in Clondalkin, Grange Castle, a world class biotechnology campus, one of the first companies which moved was Wyeth BioPharma which will employ 1,300, more than 50% of whom will be third level graduates, high earners and highly skilled. At present approximately 600 are employed and the number is expected to increase to 900 by the end of the year. Of the 6,300 jobs to which the IDA referred, more than two-thirds would be for graduates of third level, certificate, diploma, degree and post-graduates. It is important to get young people, especially from disadvantaged areas, into the education cycle and to keep them there. This is crucial if they are to have an expectation of a job with future prospects. Certainly the jobs that have been targeted by the IDA are in that category. Some 40% of the jobs in salary scale terms would be what the IDA call above the high skills guideline of &euro;37,000 per annum. The success story is continuing.</P>
    <P>As a nation, we have contributed significantly to it by means of social partnership. To sustain it, we must build very rapidly on our infrastructure. I suggested earlier that if we are to fast track the necessary infrastructure, we must consider borrowing. I say that with caution. If we borrow for capital projects of this nature, it is imperative that we ensure a number of things. Construction inflation on a number of projects in recent years has been horrendous and supply and demand issues must be addressed. If we are to invite foreign investment and to adapt it to our spatial strategy, we have little choice but to put the necessary infrastructure in place. If we do that, the people I have represented in socially disadvantaged areas will have real future prospects. I have seen remarkable improvements since the early 1980s. If I were to see the same rate of improvement over the next 20 years, I would be a very happy man.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Hanafin has left. I heard that today is very important for her as it is her birthday. I am told she is 21, but I do not <Col N="803" /> believe it. I think she is 19. Perhaps the Minister of State will pass on my good wishes to her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I come from County Mayo and Deputy Kitt comes from a bordering county, although he has moved to Dublin. I am a little disappointed that he has not looked after the west of Ireland better as a west of Ireland man. We are united when it comes to the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that very shortly and we will deal with Galway in the Connacht final.</P>
      <P>As a national politician, I like to see the economy doing well and I like to see people in employment regardless of what part of Ireland they live in. As with any Deputy, however, the people of my constituency elected me to this Parliament to represent them. We are here to do our best, to air views from our region or county and to make those areas as good as they can be for the people who live in them. We saw another report from the IDA this week which shows that it has failed to attract IDA-backed jobs to the BMW region. I am very disappointed that out of 20 projects established in the past year, only seven were located in the regions despite the Government's commitment to direct half of all jobs created by the IDA to the BMW area.</P>
      <P>The BMW area is recognised by Europe as having a problem which is why we have been given Objective One status until 2006. Europe recognises the imbalance in the development of this country. Everything is developed within 60 miles of this House while for the next 60 miles everything is forgotten about. We see that with job creation. Europe tells us that we are to be allocated &euro;1.3 billion. That is &euro;1,300 million to be spent to attract industry, infrastructure and development to the regions. Despite this, the IDA accepts that it failed last year to achieve the Government's regional development policy. If the IDA could not accomplish this during the good times, how is it to honour the Government's commitment now that there has been a downturn in the economy? We see jobs being lost every day and every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Shannon stopover, I listen to people on radio programmes, some of whom are from the west of Ireland but have moved to Dublin. They become very sophisticated when they come to Dublin and can forget about the west once they get used to the DART, the traffic and the high life. On Sunday morning I listened to someone I will not name, as I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will give out to me if I do. The person complained about the Shannon stopover and explained the reasons he does not wish to fly <Col N="804" /> to Shannon when he is travelling to Dublin. I do not say that every flight from America should land at Shannon Airport, but if we are serious about regional development, we have to spread it out. Last year I had a row with a colleague of Deputy Kitt's, Deputy Ó Cuív, in regard to the upgrading of Galway Airport which received a fortune in Government grants while there is a regional airport in Knock.</P>
    <P>As well as providing for regional development, provision must be made to spread development within the regions. Galway has hospitals, a university and an institute of technology, which I am delighted to say are excellent facilities. If there is one thing the west of Ireland has been good at, it is producing graduates. I must pay tribute to the EU regarding the infrastructure that has been put in place. We are very lucky to have so many graduates in the west of Ireland who are well able to take up any job in any part of this or any other country. They have proven that. I am, therefore, disappointed with the IDA which has not been able to put the necessary infrastructure in place despite the presence of educated third level graduates in the region.</P>
    <P>There was a time when mothers and fathers reared their children to emigrate but this trend has, thank God, been reversed. Many people are returning to this country with a wish to work here. When the economy was doing well, thousands came back each week and the train of people leaving for England, America and elsewhere was stopped. I am afraid that many who returned are disillusioned and disappointed. They packed up in Britain, America and elsewhere and returned to find they have to leave once more. Many of these people made major investments in homes and businesses, but they are finding it more and more difficult to operate here. The Government has a responsibility to the regions to promote and help them.</P>
    <P>The BMW region has been identified and it should be supported. I do not make any apologies in this regard. If Europe recognises the region as the poorest, the Government should recognise that there is a serious problem. We should not be afraid to make 50% of flights from Dublin stop in Shannon as this would promote regional development. It would take courage and commitment. I know there are EU regulations in place, but we are the only member state to obey every one of those. In the next few months it is proposed to stop people smoking in pubs, although I will not say whether I agree or disagree with the measure. I used to smoke, but I do not smoke any more. I was on holiday in France two years ago and while I ate in a restaurant a dog came in and cocked his leg as the guy behind the counter smoked a cigarette. No one took any notice. If that happened here, about 40 inspectors from the Department of Health and Children would be involved, major fines would be imposed and the restaurant would go out of business.</P>
    <P>I believe in EU regulations, but we should not go too far. We are great for implementing EU <Col N="805" /> regulations and in this instance the EU has told us that Government should support the BMW region with grants, infrastructure and through the encouragement of investment. Whatever has to be done, should be done. Instead, of the 20 projects established by the IDA, only seven were for the regions while the rest went to Dublin and its environs. People in this city have to get up two hours earlier in the morning to go to work and it takes them two hours longer to get home in the evening. At the same time, civil servants in Dublin offices make decisions on regional development despite the fact that some of them have never slept a night in any region of this country. Some of those talking about south, north and east Mayo do not know where Bangor Erris or Belmullet are, yet they are up here with their pencils making decisions about the regions.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael set up the Western Development Commission when it was in Government. All parties spoke about it when they were in Opposition and talked about what they would do for the regions. However, as soon as they reached the Government side of the House they forgot about the west, western development and the BMW. Everything had to be put into Dublin.</P>
    <P>My colleagues, the ushers, who do such good work in the House, think I am hard on Dublin. I love Dublin people. In fact, if Mayo do not win the All-Ireland this year, and I believe Mayo will win, I hope Dublin will win it. I am not against Dublin. The ushers give out to me that I am hard on Dublin but I like Dublin, the people of Dublin and the ushers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the politicians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am working for Dublin on this occasion. Dublin people tell me they agree with me about regional development. They would like to see the State agencies taken out of this city to free its traffic and to give Dublin people an opportunity to live. They cannot live in this city. I used to give out about Dublin people but I cannot any more because I feel sorry for them. It takes them so long to travel to work in the morning and to travel home in the evening that they spend more time in their cars than in their homes. That is not right and it is not good for family life. It is not right to choke a region.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to criticise the Luas but I hope it will work. All I see at present is chaos throughout the city. People in Dublin have been extremely patient with road works and so forth. It should have been put underground but that is a debate for another day. In the long term it would have been cheaper to put it underground. We should have installed an underground system like those in most modern cities and not have been afraid to put the money in place to do it now rather than have to do it in the future. I do not believe Luas will work. It will create further problems in the city. It should have been put underground from the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" />The Western Development Commission has the reports on what is needed in the region. However, the finances for that were drastically reduced in this year's budget. That is not right; it should not happen. The IDA report this week showed there was a downturn in the economy and in job creation but the first area to suffer was the west. It is down 10% this year in terms of jobs. The IDA figure is actually 9.6%. Something is terribly wrong when that is allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>There is no point setting up more committees or agencies. Everybody knows what the problems are. One can go into any library in the country and see nothing but reports, including consultants' reports. All of them cost a fortune. If another report is needed tomorrow on health, education, jobs or social welfare these consultants, having been appointed by the Government, go into the libraries and simply update the reports and charge the Government up to &euro;300,000 for doing it. The greatest growth in employment in this country in the last five or six years has been among consultants and spin doctors. If we could get them to come to the regions when they are compiling reports and ensure that they stay there for two or three weeks and actually see what is happening there, they might have more sympathy for us. They might at least be able to tell the Government what should be done for the west.</P>
    <P>There are peat power stations in the midlands because the deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, a Minister in the Cabinet, ensured that although one was closed down another two power stations were built. Bellacorick is located in my constituency and, until recently, when there was a storm the lights used to go out because the power supply was bad. It has been upgraded a little by the ESB yet, next year, 300 people will lose their jobs in Bellacorick. That could have been upgraded. If we were serious about regional development, that is where the investment would have taken place and where the jobs would have been maintained. However, Connacht did not have anybody in Cabinet. The last two Governments have been the first since the foundation of State not to include a Minister from Mayo in Cabinet. If there had been a Minister from Mayo, Bellacorick would not be closing next year.</P>
    <P>There is major unemployment in Erris, an area as big as County Louth. Part of the area is the responsibility of Údaras na Gaeltachta while the rest is the responsibility of the IDA. The area is losing 300 jobs, which is the equivalent of Lucan or Tallaght losing 3,000 jobs. There are no prospects of job creation in the future, if we are to go by the IDA report. The IDA could not implement Government policy last year. The Government said that half of all jobs to be created in the country were to be in the BMW region. When the IDA could not do that last year, it will hardly do it next year. That does not look good for the future of Mayo or the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Éamon Ó Cuív, has a great responsibility at Cabinet. He is from Galway and <Col N="807" /> will have to look after the interests of the west and the BMW area because there is nobody else to do it. Decentralisation will show whether the Government is serious about regional development. It is not all bad in Mayo. Westport, Ballina and Castlebar are fine towns and the IDA is committed to ensuring that whatever development is available will be focused on them. What about places such as Kiltimagh, Ballinrobe and Belmullet? These towns are capable of catering for decentralisation. Recently my colleague, Deputy Kenny, conducted a survey of the people working in the Civil Service in Dublin. A significant number of them wanted to move to Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim or Roscommon in the western region. If the Government is serious about regional policy and about doing something to redress the imbalance with the east, most of the decentralisation should go to the BMW region.</P>
    <P>I believe there are squabbles in the Cabinet about this. Ministers are seeking decentralisation to towns that do not need it. It should only go to towns that need it. If the Government does not do that, it will prove once and for all that it is not serious about regional development. Decentralisation will revitalise the west and areas to which the IDA cannot attract industry. Moving Government agencies to these regions will give the regions a boost and allow civil servants to move to the regions, become part of the community and have their children educated there. That will help the communities and the regions. Decentralisation will be the first test of whether the Government is serious about regionalisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is from the west. He knows it needs development. Europe recognised that need, as does the IDA. It needs infrastructure. Another Minister of State from the west, Deputy Treacy, has just joined us. The full team is present. Now is the time to deal with regional development and decentralisation. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will know from a recent report that the IDA has failed the west. It was unable to implement Government policy.</P>
    <P>Bellacorick in north Mayo will lose 300 jobs. I mentioned this yesterday with regard to gas. This is something that can assist in developing the west if the Government is serious about it. Natural gas will flow from north Mayo and into the national grid&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we have planning permission yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should not mind the planning &ndash; that will come at some stage when they do it properly. In relation to the gas, the Minister of State would help us with the planning if he had the courage and the guts. I ask him to tell us at the end of this debate which towns in County Mayo are getting gas. It is fine for him to speak &ndash; he has annoyed me now &ndash; because he, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, have the national grid <Col N="808" /> coming from Dublin to Galway. The Government entered into an agreement with a private company to bring the pipeline from north Mayo to Galway but without a mention of Castlebar, Westport, Ballina or any other town in Mayo.</P>
      <P>I hope that in the next few weeks the Minister of State and his colleagues will tell the people of Mayo what they are going to get out of the gas. When I put down Dáil questions on Bord Gáis, they will respond that gas will be extended to the people of Mayo &ldquo;if it is viable.&rdquo;  If it is anything like the IDA, and the way it has committed itself to the west, or like the Government, I can tell the House what will happen. The gas will be taken out and used to benefit Galway, Dublin and Belfast &ndash; I think they are even talking about sending it over to Scotland &ndash; but it will be of no benefit to the west.</P>
      <P>I am going to mark the Minister of State and his colleagues' form here on in. This will be worse than the Connacht final, and I will be watching what commitment&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have now been a Member of this House for 371 days. It is good to hear from colleagues that we all have the same problems. At the same time, we have to be parochial and loyal to our own constituents. I wish I could spend the time being proud about Galway or Mayo, but the fact is I have to be proud about Dublin. When I stand in the Dáil I have to talk about Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills because it was from those areas that 7,155 people sent me here. Others from the area sent Deputy Sean Crowe here. While taking the opportunity to support all colleagues, those of us privileged enough to be Members of the Dáil have a job to do as far as our own constituencies are concerned, and we must remain focused on that.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned Tallaght on a number of occasions. It is now the third largest population centre in the country. It was said of Tallaght for a long time that it had the population of a city but the status of a village. Since the opening of The Square by a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach in October 1990, it has come on tremendously and has fulfilled an enormous amount of potential. Of course, it is still developing. We have the world famous Square, the institute of technology, the general hospital, civic headquarters, a number of libraries and the National Basketball Arena. As I said in the course of another debate last night, the Special Olympics will come to Tallaght, with the pitch and putt competition being held in Kiltipper, Tallaght and the basketball in the National Basketball Arena.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I am allowed to mention the Ceann Comhairle, but as many Deputies know, he always took a great interest in Tallaght and was hugely responsible for the early development of Tallaght Hospital. Tallaght is a great place of which I am proud. I am not a bit embarrassed to compete with colleagues, even more articulate and famous colleagues, in mentioning my town and talking about the needs of Tallaght and Dublin south-west.</P>
      <P>I was cheered up a little this morning &ndash; the Minister of State will be happy to hear this &ndash; when I spent a little time, as I do every Thursday, reading the <i>Tallaght Echo</i> just to see if I or Deputies Sean Crowe, Pat Rabbitte or Conor Lenihan or even Senator Brian Hayes are mentioned. The paper talked about the live register figures falling. Happily, the figures for the past month fell again in Tallaght. That is positive, but we cannot take our foot off the pedal and must continue to stress the needs of our town. Last month, we suffered a huge blow when 121 jobs, with perhaps more to follow, were lost in Gallaghers. We need to keep focusing on the positives of our constituency and the needs of our area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ring has spoken very well about the west, but there are problems in urban areas like <Col N="810" /> Tallaght, which, as I said, is the third largest population area in the country. It has a very young population. We need to stress the needs of the town and I will continue to do that on a regular basis. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has been to Tallaght on a number of occasions, and we always take such opportunities to fight the good cause. This is not to compete with Mayo or anywhere else but to make the point about what we need in Tallaght and throughout Dublin South-West constituency.</P>
    <P>As the House continues to enact legislation for the establishment of various new bodies, I continue to be a strong supporter of the need to have bodies which contribute to the future development of a changing Ireland placed on a statutory footing. Indeed, I spoke recently on the Digital Hub, an organisation of which I had very little knowledge until I chose to speak on the Bill establishing it. Having researched the organisation, I am now a strong supporter of its aims and development.</P>
    <P>Today I find myself once again researching in detail the organisations for which this Bill will create an umbrella office. While I was aware of their existence, I must admit to never having looked at their extensive workload until now. The National Economic and Social Council, which has been in operation since 1973, has provided advice to the Government on the development of the economy and improvements in social justice in a period of dramatically changing economic fortunes, from the bad old 1980s to the rough early 1990s to the growth of the last five years.</P>
    <P>With 111 reports covering many issues, the NESC has been an active body with a low public profile. The most controversial report in recent times was on the benchmarking provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which was a genuine effort to respond to the differences in earnings between the public and private sectors. Unfortunately, as is all too often the case these days, sectoral self interest ensured that benchmarking was relegated to being just a wage increase, rolled over into the current agreement, Sustaining Progress. It did not become the adjustment which the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness had indicated. This was a lost opportunity for public sector employees, who have now had to embrace a level of change over the life-span of Sustaining Progress that took the private sector more than 90 years to reach.</P>
    <P>Going over the long list of reports which the NESC has produced, I congratulate it on its endeavours. I expect that under this new office, the work of the organisation will have a specific focus for the advancement of policy to support change for our future growth. I suspect it will have an expanded role as a provider of independent research for all Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the high level of expenditure by various Departments on research reports to justify, at times, an unwillingness to make use of existing expertise within the Civil Service. The reports then gather dust or, worse, <Col N="811" /> get lost in departmental working groups. I strongly suggest that this new office should be the first port of call by Departments for their research needs in developing policy. Requests should only be tendered externally when they are outside the capacity of the office. This type of in-house service would more than justify an appropriate budget for the office and provide a secondment channel for the pool of expertise that exists within the Civil Service. The need for the NESC will be best justified when we as legislators and the Departments can use its reports to underpin the changes that are now a permanent part of all our lives and plan for the future.</P>
    <P>In its ten years of existence, the National Economic and Social Forum has had a major impact on the social policy changes in that period. Its work in evaluating the implementation of policy and its involvement with equality and social inclusion has included issues such as long-term unemployment, income maintenance, the delivery of social services, early school leavers and social and affordable housing and accommodation. Like many constituencies, Dublin South-West has many problems in these areas, although on a positive note, the constituency is competing. We must continue to make our points to the Government and I am always happy to do so.</P>
    <P>My experience as a Fianna Fáil Government backbencher has been very positive. It has been strange in the context of the views expressed by my colleagues on the other side of the House who seem to think that because we are on the Government backbenches we are incapable of thought and expressing our ideas. That is a myth. I am sorry that many journalists who frequent the House do not seem to know us. It seems that Fianna Fáil backbenchers who wish to be known must kick up a fuss, say something outrageous or do something to upset the Chair, but I am not prepared to take that route. I will stick to what I am doing and will use every waking moment of every day to represent my constituents in the House. It is why I contributed to this week's Private Members' debate on disability.</P>
    <P>On matters of disability, community employment, education and health care, I have a role to play in notifying the House and the Government of the views expressed to me on a daily basis by my constituents on the streets of Tallaght and Dublin South-West. I know I have the support of the Minster of State, Deputy Treacy, when I say we must continue to support the disadvantaged and promote our social inclusion policy, which has been very successful over the past five years. This is especially important at a time when the economy is under challenge.</P>
    <P>The NESF reports, especially those dealing with equality of access to hospital care, labour issues for older workers, early school leavers and lone parents show that it can be a strong and effective advocate of change. I hope its role in the new office will be strengthened in that its evaluations will become either performance targets <Col N="812" /> for the relevant Departments to include in their strategic statements or an achieved goal for which the country is better off. I also congratulate the forum for its opinions on matters such as the national anti-poverty strategy, equality issues and Partnership 2000. I trust it will continue to make an input into the current Sustaining Progress agreement and the review of the national anti-poverty strategy. In this regard, I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, for the inclusion of key targets in the national anti-poverty strategy, as outlined in her Department's strategy statement.</P>
    <P>The third part of the office, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, is the new kid on the block. Since its establishment in 2001, it has yet to find its feet. I do not envy the task of the NCPP. It must introduce in the public and private sectors a spirit of partnership that seeks to circumvent the traditional opposition to change and overcome the entrenched psyche of empire building, confrontation and indifference that are prevalent in the modern working environment. A key work area for the NCPP will be the partnership process within Departments, where the changes required under Sustaining Progress and the roll-out of the modernisation programme of the Civil Service need to be embedded. The lack of structured communication channels and the lip service support offered by some Department managers will be a significant challenge.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows what is becoming a standard format and I support the details. I wish the three organisations every success. I look forward to seeing their combined strengths being effectively used by all Departments and their roles being extended to ensure that the future development of society continues to take account of the needs of all our people. In this regard, it is important to understand that we are here to represent our constituencies. We take an honest approach to getting the best possible deal for them.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Ring has left the House because while I admire what he said, it must be said in fairness that Ministers serve the wider country as well as their local area. They listen to their colleagues, although the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, would be the first to remind me he is from Galway. Progress is being made, albeit slowly in some areas. All constituencies are on the Government agenda and it is for all Members to represents the needs of their constituents.</P>
    <P>I sometimes smile when I hear my colleagues from the west and elsewhere. While I support their views, I remind them that there are places in urban areas and in Dublin which have as many problems. When I was young I, like many others, emigrated. Deputy Ring reminded me of it. I spent a little time in England, in London. It did not do me any harm and did not affect my interest in politics. When I returned home I made a conscious decision on which political party to join. Throughout my political career there was <Col N="813" /> often speculation about what party I might join and it was often said that had I joined another party I would have been elected to the House earlier, but I never took that view. I was happy with the path I took. I am happy where I am and with my position as a Deputy. It gives me pleasure on occasions such as this to express pride in my constituency, to talk about Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills and Templeogue and to represent the good people who live there. They are just as entitled to have their case made as those living elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation and is deserving of support. I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Ministers on introducing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the debate on the legislation before us has centred on whether social partnership has been a success. I believe it has been very successful in that it has succeeded in creating one of the most unequal societies in the developed world. It has succeeded in maximising profits and minimising wages, in pushing the agenda of organisations like IBEC and their political wing, the Progressive Democrats. It has done all this at the expense of Irish workers.</P>
      <P>In his contribution to the debate, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, said social partnership has served Ireland well. He should have clarified the section of the country to which he was referring. There has been great talk during this debate about the levels of economic growth stimulated by what Government members call social partnership. To talk about economic growth in itself is a deeply flawed way of determining the success of a country. James Connolly pointed out the flaw in such an analysis when he wrote that, &ldquo;prosperity such as they speak of is purely capitalistic prosperity, that is to say, prosperity gauged merely by the volume of wealth produced entirely ignoring the manner in which wealth is distributed amongst workers who produce it.&rdquo;  The success of the Irish economy is often described in terms of the gross national product or gross domestic product. These measures do not show how this growth in income is distributed among the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of income distribution, Ireland is one of the most unequal countries in the EU and the OECD and these inequalities have been worsening over the period of partnership. Analysis of shares of income and other inequality measures show the same thing. In the mid-1990s the bottom 10% of households had approximately 4% of total income whereas the top 10% had about 25%. This was bad enough but between 1994 and 1998 there was a further redistribution of income away from the poorest towards the wealthiest. In 1987, 6.2% of households were below the relative <Col N="814" /> income poverty line. By 2000 this had increased to almost 12% and one third of households were below 60% of the average income. These are the statistics of partnership that the Government does not use. This is the kind of Ireland created by partnership and which is to be sustained for as long as this Government is in power.</P>
    <P>If a country has experienced a time of unprecedented economic growth, as this State has done over the last ten years, this alone is not good enough. A careful analysis from an Irish republican's perspective exposes the truth at the core of the partnership process, which is about maximising profit and exploiting labour. Far from delivering a more just society this process has in fact created wider divisions than ever before in Irish society. The gap between rich and poor has become a yawning gulf. Our health and social services are in continual crisis, the quality of life has deteriorated while the cost of living has soared and the productivity of Irish workers has increased. Their wages have not kept pace. During the 1990s output per head almost doubled, while at the same time between 1985 and 1999 the cost of labour fell by about 20%. There might have been a reduction in the cost of labour but there was no reduction in the profits made by big business. This is redistribution of wealth at its worst. Wealth is being taken from the people who created it, in many cases PAYE workers, and given it to the profiteers and speculators in the private sector.</P>
    <P>This is the point that must be driven home. The wealth of this nation is produced by workers, not by businessmen and businesswomen or multinationals who take their profits out of the country. Workers have not benefited from partnership. One supposed protection for workers has been that the trade union leadership, an integral part of the social partnership process, would be able to influence Government policy. We were told it would deliver rights for workers in the area of trade union recognition. Seventeen years of social partnership and we still have not achieved the basic minimum. Instead, over the lifetime of the process we have seen anti-union legislation being introduced in the form of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. In 1996 the community and voluntary sector was included as one of the social partners. Speaking on the debate earlier, several Government Deputies praised this element of the partnership process in particular. There is a growing feeling within that sector that this has resulted in a measure of institutionalisation into the structures of partnership, at the expense of local activities.</P>
    <P>The community platform and Sinn Féin opposed this latest chapter in the social partnership process, Sustaining Progress. They did state, however, that while they oppose this agreement they were still committed to the process of social partnership and wish to continue to try and work with Government. They received a rude awakening from Government which booted them out of <Col N="815" /> the process entirely. The Simon Community, which deals with homelessness, claimed that the Taoiseach misrepresented its position in the Dáil when he said that it rejected the proposals and the whole partnership process so it is out of the process. This is simply untrue. It rejected the deal, not the process that led to the deal. It would appear that the so-called partnership is now open only to those who fully endorse the Government's position. In this treatment the Simon Community perhaps saw exposed again the true nature of social partnership and the cosy cartel of Government and big business which gangs up on Irish workers every time a partnership deal is negotiated.</P>
    <P>The Government is far from being a neutral player or honest broker. It is an ideological partner of IBEC. Partnership negotiations revolve around IBEC and the Government taking on the trade union leadership while the community and voluntary sector is ignored. When the community and voluntary sector raises its voice in opposition it is kicked out of the process and what does it oppose? Let us examine some of the statistics since the rate of return on capital doubled in 1987. This is one of the statistics that the Government is fond of quoting. I note that it has failed to point out that this means a corresponding decline in the wage share of the national income of almost 10%. By 1998 the profit share of national income had risen to 38%. This is even more remarkable given that the number of people in work has risen since 1987.</P>
    <P>Internationally, Ireland experienced the largest increase in profit share among the European Union members, Japan and the United States. In other words, workers have lost out while business has profited. Even when times are harder, as they are now, the first instinct of this Government is to give business a tax break without another massive reduction in corporation tax. In order to fund this tax break it implements savage cutbacks in community employment, public sector workers and capital investment in schools, to name but a few. It abandons one of its election promises every day. Social partnership has failed Irish workers, it has failed the poor and the disadvantaged in Irish society. The legislation before us will do little to tackle the root cause of inequality in Irish society. It is little more than tinkering around the edge of the system. The workers saw through this and saw that with this system, inequality, poverty and disadvantage are inevitable, no matter what so-called partnership agreement is in place. Plato said there can be no partnership between the unequal, and he was correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives outlined in this Bill are undoubtedly praiseworthy. It proposes to establish a new body that will enhance the excellent work conducted by the organisations that will be taken under the umbrella of the National Economic and Social Development Office. If we look at the functions of the new body we also <Col N="816" /> find that its aims are all ones which any person interested in people's well-being would have to support. As outlined in sections 8 to 11 they include: to advise the Taoiseach on all strategic matters relevant to economic and social development; to submit reports, recommendations, and conclusions arising from research and surveys; to analyse and report to the Taoiseach on strategic efforts regarding the efficient development of the economy and the achievement of social justice; to advise the Taoiseach on policies to achieve greater social equality and social inclusion; to advise the Taoiseach on such matters regarding the deepening of workplace partnership in the public and private sectors, and so on. Nobody could disagree with that. These are perfectly valid objectives and ones which my party has no problem supporting.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear too from reading reports such as those compiled by the National Economic and Social Council that the quality of research being carried out is of the highest calibre. However, it is also clear from reading the NESC report on investment in quality services, including enterprise, that while the Taoiseach and the Government may formally welcome such reports, they do not pay much attention to them. However, it is also clear from reading the NESC report, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise, that, while the Taoiseach and Government may formally welcome such reports, they do not pay very much attention to them. That is the problem. For example, the NESC report draws attention to the need to address what it terms this State's &ldquo;infrastructural deficit&rdquo; in housing, public transport, roads and so on. It is quite clear from the Government's actions that is has paid no heed to the need to address those problems, the scale of which will become even more apparent over the next few years. It is making them worse by the kind of fiscal and structural policies it is implementing.</P>
      <P>Sections of my area of north Kerry suffer from rural decline, with the last census showing a decline in the population. The business people of Listowel have come together and invested their money to put in place infrastructure such as access units for development and economic investment. The downside is that, because of the condition of the roads in that area, there has been no take-up of that facility for the past few years. That is the problem the people of rural Ireland face, and it must be addressed. However, that can only happen when such reports make a positive, active contribution. That is the essence of the difficulty which my party and I have with measures such as this. While there is a great deal of work being done on researching social and economic problems and the policy options available to tackle them, very little of that finds practical expression in measures put in place by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current cutbacks across the whole range of services, including health, education and employment schemes mean that, not only is this Govern<Col N="817" /> ment not acting on recommendations such as that to which I have referred, it is actively working against them, rolling back whatever small progress may have been made over the relatively prosperous years of the so-called Celtic tiger. Of course, when we draw attention to the consequences of the current cuts, the response is that we are now in a radically different financial situation and that the resources are no longer available to develop the social and economic infrastructure further or to maintain the current levels of provision which are under attack. The implication of that argument is that the resources were there, but were not used for infrastructural development particularly on the western seaboard and in the south-western parts of our country.</P>
    <P>Anyone who doubts this need only ask a member of those groups who protested outside the House this week against the consequences of the cuts, for example, in the provision of services for the intellectually disabled or in the scrapping of 194 of 414 community employment placements currently available to assist the Irish Wheelchair Association in maintaining its day centres. Together with many other Deputies, I was outside the gate today, and it is heartbreaking to see people in wheelchairs having to come from all over the country to bring to the attention of the House and the present Government the neglect they are suffering as a result of the latter's cuts. When one goes outside the gate and talks to people in that situation and deals daily with the parents of children whose special needs cannot be met, one realises only too well the real consequences of fiscal rectitude.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that there are no alternatives to making the disadvantaged pay for a situation they had no part in creating. As many of the reports emanating from Government-sponsored bodies such as the NESC and the NESF have made clear, there are other policy options. They have been outlined in reports such as that to which I have referred, and will no doubt also be contained in reports published by the new national economic and social development office, if and when it is established. The problem is of course that many of the recommendations of those who have extensively researched the relevant social and economic issues conflict with the current right-wing ethos of this Government. That is why they are being ignored. That is why the Government places the burden of blame for the downturn in the State's finances on those least able to bear any further reduction in their living standards. One need only look at the reduction in capital gains tax from 40% to 20% to facilitate those who speculate on the property market or the cuts imposed on those most in need in society.</P>
    <P>Another interesting recommendation that came from the same NESC report concerns the extension of local democracy. As a former member of Tralee Town Council and a present member of Kerry County Council, I fully concur with <Col N="818" /> that sentiment, as it is quite obvious that many decisions made on even the most basic issues concerning local people are decided centrally, with very little, if any, input from elected representatives. Tralee Town Council and Kerry County Council had the option, during the discussion of estimates, of increasing service charges or rates to raise money. That is the only way open. That is not what I understand to constitute representing people equally across the board. No matter what one does, one will be penalising either the housewife and those living in local authority areas or the small business that creates employment.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is on record as having said that local government is over-democratised. Is the Government over-democratised? Is it democratic that we penalise the poor? Is there a democratic mandate in this House or any part of local government to do so? This Government and successive predecessors are right-wing and exist primarily to facilitate those least in need. Deputy Cullen also wonders why local elected representatives should have a say on important issues. At least he is consistent as this is also how many important decisions affecting the environment are being made.</P>
    <P>There is currently a situation in the Minister's constituency in Waterford, whose unelected port authority wants to allow a company to build an incinerator at Belview in south Kilkenny. The county councils of Waterford and Wexford have voted to oppose the incinerator. Yet the unelected county managers of both counties over-ruled their democratic decisions. This Government calls that democracy. A question must be asked about the purpose of creating and funding bodies such as that proposed in this Bill if their valuable research and recommendations are ignored. It is simply another effort to conceal the real intentions and consequences of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has no problem with social partnership as what it is reported to be &ndash; an equal sharing of power and responsibility between all those with a stake in Irish society and not simply an increasingly weak attempt to win the acquiescence of the workers and others who will bear the brunt of the current downturn in whatever cuts and sacrifices they will be expected to make.</P>
    <P>I support the principles and proposed outline of the Bill. At the very least, it will ensure that Deputies and the public at large will continue to be supplied with top-quality research. We can only hope that the Government will also take some of its recommendations on board in forming policy. Otherwise, it will certainly be binned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislative measure to establish the national economic and social development office. I was an Oireachtas representative at the first National Economic and Social Forum, which met in the early 1990s. The difficulties we faced as public representatives then were far different to today's problems, which <Col N="819" /> arise in large part as a result of the success and growth of the economy. The two previous speakers referred to failed economic models. I heard those failed theories espoused in Marxist countries as well as the South American political theories of many years ago.</P>
      <P>Most parliamentary democracies find the best judgment of the strength of an economy is the number of long-term unemployed. In the late 1980s and early 1990s we were constantly referring to the numbers of long-term unemployed but thankfully in recent years those numbers have reduced dramatically. There is one way to take people out of poverty and to provide equality, namely to put them to work. People can espouse any economic jargon or throw about classifications of others' beliefs but this Government and I stand for equality and putting more people to work. I am not right-wing and I do not classify others according to the wings they belong to, but in the early 1990s I did not receive calls from people having planning difficulties after coming home from America or England to build houses. Neither did the Ceann Comhairle, who shares my constituency. We were talking to young people who were emigrating to America, Britain or elsewhere to seek employment. That is not the case today, though unfortunately many of those who left in the 1980s or earlier for the United States are still classified as undocumented. The Ceann Comhairle and I were at a meeting recently which was addressed by members of the US Congress. They said legislation was due before both Houses of Congress of the United States on 11 September 2001 to improve the position of those people in America without proper accreditation. Unfortunately international terrorism intervened and the terrible atrocities in New York and Washington obviously put that legislation on the back burner, if it is ever in fact to see the light of day.</P>
      <P>In Cavan-Monaghan and other Border constituencies we dealt constantly with people who were being harassed at checkpoints and having difficulties with both paramilitary organisations and British institutions. Thankfully that era is behind us since the 1990s. All the Ulster counties, particularly those south of the Border, suffered immensely because of paramilitary activity and the Troubles.</P>

      <P>Thankfully those difficulties, which all Border county public representatives faced, are now behind us. We welcome that progress, which has been driven by those who believe in politics and democracy. The Border economy suffered immensely during that period and it will take longer than we would like for it to catch up with the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>We had huge numbers of long-term unemployed and no inward investment. The policies and partnerships begun in 1987, which involved Government, trade unions, employers, farming organisations and the community sector, have acted as a catalyst in improving economic conditions in the country. That is the simple reality. The point at which people entered the tax net is now twice as high as it was a few years ago. There are jobs all over the country, though we need more of those jobs in rural areas, and we must address the imbalance between the east and west coasts. However, we must all admit there has been a huge improvement in the provision of infrastructure and job creation.</P>
      <P>We often think only of major firms from America or Europe and forget the role of the county enterprise boards which were established by the Government in 1992-3. Those boards are locally accountable and local public representatives as well as representatives of other bodies participate in them. The boards were given a remit to create 8,000 jobs from 1994 to 1999 but during that period they created 18,087 jobs, more than twice the target. From January 2000 to December 2002, 8,500 jobs were created with the assistance of county enterprise boards. Those jobs are welcome and by their nature they are dispersed quite evenly throughout the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
      <P>I mentioned emigration earlier. All of us saw at first hand the devastation caused to many communities, particularly in rural areas, by the departure of their young people. Thankfully that trend has been reversed and there is an increase in population in rural areas. In the census period 1996 to 2001 the population of Cavan increased by 7%, the first increase since the Famine. That is replicated, though at higher percentages, in other rural counties but for Cavan, which is not at the forefront of economic development, that 7% increase is particularly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives in rural areas now face difficulties with planning issues. This was not the case some years ago when the people were not there to populate the countryside. Thankfully today people are staying at home and returning to the country to avail of job opportunities, so there is a demand for housing. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made a huge investment in the provision of water and sewerage schemes throughout the <Col N="821" /> country. He identified in particular the need to provide infrastructure for smaller towns and villages and by providing that he ensured housing could be provided to ease pressures on the housing market in larger towns and urban centres. That investment is paying dividends today as we see our smaller towns and villages with new housing schemes provided by both local authorities and the private sector.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the schools building programme being abandoned, which is absolute nonsense. The greatest investment in the school building programme is under way this year. Throughout the length and breadth of this country, there are new school facilities of the most modern design.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 5 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IRFU and the FAI, in response to an earlier invitation from me to set out their prioritised proposals for stadium development, presented a report to me on 29 April in which they identified five options for meeting their requirement for modern stadium accommodation to host major international fixtures in the greater Dublin area. <Col N="822" /> The report evaluated the pros and cons associated with stadium development at each of the following locations: Lansdowne Road, the IRFU-owned site at Newlands Cross, Abbotstown, the former Irish Glass Bottle Company site and a site at Sillogue, north Dublin, but did not indicate a preference for a particular location.</P>
    <P>This report has been subjected to detailed examination over the past six weeks by the Office of Public Works, which is the Department's professional adviser for this project. The Office of Public Works in turn commissioned advice from private sector construction consultants, Davis Langdon PKS, to ensure that all aspects of the proposal were thoroughly evaluated. It also met the FAI-IRFU advisers for the purposes of clarifying elements of the proposal.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Office of Public Works report is now nearing finality and should be transmitted to my Department by the end of this month. Until the Office of Public Works report is to hand and I have had an opportunity of considering its implications, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in premature speculation as to its contents or indeed to respond to purely speculative material which appeared in a newspaper article last week.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated, when the evaluation of the FAI-IRFU proposal has been completed, I will present my conclusions and recommendations to the Government in the context of an overall report on all options for the provision of state-of-the-art stadium facilities for major sporting events. The report will also incorporate my evaluation of expressions of interest received in the procurement of a privately-funded stadium at Abbotstown. I do not intend to make any further statement on this matter until the Government has decided on the further action to be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister refute headlines which have appeared in a number of the national newspapers recently, including one stating that the new stadium plan is axed as the Progressive Democrats baulked at the &euro;500 million cost? Will he also refute the various statements, mostly speculative, which have been made in the newspapers recently about the national stadium? Does he agree that but for the meddling of the Government and the Taoiseach, we would now have Eircom Park rather than offering the FAI a phantom stadium? If the Government had supported the FAI and provided it with funding, Eircom Park would have been completed and we would have watched the match last night in Eircom Park rather than in Lansdowne Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IRFU deserves better treatment given that it paid &euro;500,000 for the OVE Arup report which the Minister is now assessing. A statement should be made and there should be clarity. The time for dithering, spinning, posturing and procrastination is over. It is now decision time. When will the Minister make a detailed proposal to Government? When will Government make a decision? This has been going on for almost four years and <Col N="823" /> the organisations in question and the public deserve to know where the Government stands on this important national issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little point in me raking over old coals or going into the history of this matter, which is well known. I have not brought my proposals on the provision of a new stadium to the Government. In those circumstances, it could not be the case that the Government rejected such a proposal. As I said, I await the report which I expect from the Government's technical advisers in the near future. After we have received that report, we will examine it in detail and then prepare a memorandum which will go before the Government. It will be a matter for the Government to decide whether the proposals stand or fall.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that up to now meddling, as Deputy Deenihan describes it, has prevented the construction of a stadium. The FAI would not have the financial wherewithal to build a stadium on its own. The truth is that when asked for a contribution, the FAI and the IRFU between them were able to come up with a total of &euro;120 million which, on the basis of all known cost factors, would go nowhere near building a stadium even if &euro;50 million was added by the Government.</P>
      <P>The IRFU has not been badly treated. It was requested to look at its plans and priorities, as was the FAI, and to report back, which it did through the OVE Arup report. This report is being examined by the Government's technical advisers. As I said, I expect to hear from them in the not too distance future.</P>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy Deenihan believes there has been dithering. He knows the history of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>What will happen now is that the proposals will be put before the Government for a decision. The Government will then make a decision in its own time and wisdom. It is of immense importance in that context that the sporting considerations of not only participants and potential participants but of spectators are taken into account. It is important we do not underestimate the value of sport to society. As a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I am well aware that it is no coincidence that where sport thrived, there was less crime. Sometimes one hears people say that we must give more to health and to tackling crime and less to sport but I think that misses the point. Where one has decent sports facilities, one has less crime and a healthier population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meeting this morning on the Estimates, I said it was time for everyone to get off the fence on this new stadium and I reiterate <Col N="824" /> that here. We have seen all the reports in the newspapers and so on but having listened to the Minister this morning and again this afternoon and having reflected on previous questions in the House, I understood that the 23 consortia which expressed an interest in providing a stadium in Abbotstown had been ruled out of the equation. I find it a bit disturbing to hear today that they are still in the equation.</P>
      <P>A positive approach has been taken by the new president of Cumann Lúthchleas Gael in relation to the opening of Croke Park. Have there been any formal or informal meetings which him since he took up his post in this regard? He certainly seems to have a positive view towards seeing what can happen in that regard. Given the timescale in terms of the provision of a new stadium, the positive approach taken by the new president and the fact the GAA has a facility in Croke Park, would it not be appropriate to make representations to him to see if we can provide a facility for the two associations in the short term, so that they can overcome the problems they face? I know there are problems in terms of the agreements the GAA has reached with residents' associations and so on.</P>
      <P>During the Question Time on which I last had the opportunity to question the Minister, I asked about the £50 million contribution to a national stadium promised by J. P. McManus. What is the position on this funding? Does it depend on the stadium being situated in Abbotstown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>After we had assessed the private expressions of interest, I indicated that many of them had conditions attached which I described as unsatisfactory. I have stated on many occasions that there could be no question of any company, person or group of persons making a killing at the taxpayers' expense, and that remains the position. However, it would not be possible for me to rule out the 23 expressions of interest on my own &ndash; only the Government could do that. The expressions of interest will be considered in the context of the memorandum which will be brought before the Government.</P>
      <P>The GAA president has indicated that he favours opening Croke Park to other sports events. However, a vote by the GAA congress would still be required. I would broadly welcome a positive vote by the congress. However, nobody should be under the illusion that opening Croke Park to other sports will resolve the stadium problem because it will not. There are problems regarding the overlapping of fixtures, residents' objections, floodlighting and obtaining planning permission to play other sports in the stadium.</P>
      <P>We have not had any formal discussions with Mr. McManus regarding his generous offer of £50 million for the simple reason that we have not been in a position to put forward a positive proposal to him. When we can do so, we will certainly enter into negotiations with him to discuss the enormous contribution he has signalled he is willing to make if circumstances are favourable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of Eircom Park would have amounted to about &euro;100 million. Is it possible to stop the spin in the newspapers and leaks from Government until a decision is made? I know the Minister cannot give a guarantee in this respect. There seems to be spin emerging from the Progressive Democrats side of the Government almost on a weekly basis regarding its attitude towards the stadium. It is not doing the credibility of the stadium any good whatsoever. A decision is needed from Government on whether it will build on a new site or go ahead with the refurbishment of Lansdowne Road, which is my preferred option and that of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Would it not be appropriate if the Minister arranged a meeting between the three main sports organisations &ndash; the GAA, FAI and IRFU &ndash; to discuss the national facilities needed in the future? This meeting should have no agenda or preconditions other than to consider the interests of sport in Ireland. Such a meeting might help to eliminate some of the obstacles to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear to everybody that it would not be possible for me to comment definitively on whether there has been spin on the part of the Progressive Democrats. I will not indulge in speculation on that issue. The proposals have not yet been brought before Government but when they are, it will make a decision. I appreciate the consistent support of the two main Opposition spokespersons and their respective parties for the stadium. It is important that a stadium is provided.</P>
      <P>I would not benefit from a meeting with the three sports organisations to discuss a stadium given that I do not have concrete proposals to put to them. I had exploratory talks, as I have already outlined. The imperative is to consider the OVE Arup report in detail, ascertain the views of the consultants that the Government's technical advisers have employed with a view to obtaining an evaluation, put the memorandum before the Government and determine how to make progress thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have the specific date on which the memorandum will go to Government? What is the timescale for a Government decision after its having received it? It is urgent that clarity be provided after four years of procrastination and posturing. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has been in charge of this project only for the past year and I accept his bona fides but it is important that the memorandum go to Government and that it make a decision immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to tie myself to a timescale at this stage but I recognise the need to get the memorandum to Government as soon as possible. It is important to point out that there seems to be a consensus that there is a <Col N="826" /> requirement for the building of a new stadium. The position of the FAI and the IRFU in particular is now untenable. We know that FIFA has told the FAI that it cannot continue to use temporary seating at Lansdowne Road indefinitely. It wants some idea from the FAI on how it will resolve this problem. The IRFU is losing out on a considerable sum of money in the order of &euro;2.5 million with each international home game because it does not have sufficient capacity. There is no question but that there is a problem to be resolved.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the building of a new stadium has the support of the main Opposition parties. I have expressed my view on the matter on several occasions and the item was put on the national agenda by the Taoiseach. I sincerely hope we are in a position to provide a stadium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 4, 66, 67, 68 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated on 28 May 2003, at the publication of the interim report of the tourism policy <Col N="827" /> review group, I believe the report contains a number of very important and substantive conclusions on issues of strategic importance to the future of the tourism industry, such as access, competitiveness, information technology and product development. It provides an outline framework for the way forward for tourism and its contents should be carefully considered by all those with an interest in the continued successful development of the sector.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have begun to implement the key recommendations that relate to my Department and the State agencies under my remit. At the inaugural meeting of Fáilte Ireland, the new tourism development agency, I specifically asked the authority to consider the contents of the report and to identify a number of key areas that it might pursue with immediate effect. I have also written to the chairman of Tourism Ireland Limited along similar lines.</P>
    <P>I have called on the industry to take on board the recommendations of the review group directed to it and to expedite the implementation of the suggested actions. A number of the recommendations are directed to Ministers other than myself, and I have already been in touch directly with the Ministers concerned to seek their considered views. For the longer term, and in line with the recommendation that my Department should play a more dynamic and effective role in shaping the range of Government policies that impact upon the development of tourism in a significant way, I have initiated arrangements to put in place appropriate bilateral structures, with ministerial colleagues and their Departments, to pursue issues of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the tourism goal of my Department is to facilitate continued development by the tourism industry of an economic, environmentally sustainable and spatially balanced tourism sector, through the formulation, ongoing monitoring and review of a range of supporting policies and programmes, particularly within the framework of the national development plan and North-South co-operation.</P>
    <P>As outlined in Sustaining Progress, the social partnership agreement 2003-05, tackling inflation requires a number of different responses and approaches from the public and private sectors alike. Renewing competitiveness, not just in the tourism sector but for the economy as a whole, is central to the Government's overall macroeconomic policy of sustaining non-inflationary economic growth and high levels of employment. Deteriorating competitiveness is certainly one of the threats to the industry but so too is the growing dissatisfaction of visitors with overall value for money. This is much more than merely a complaint about prices paid and it is appropriate, as I have often stated, that the industry leads the way in improving satisfaction ratings by continuing to control costs, improve productivity, better manage its human resources and utilise modern technology to best advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" />At this stage, there is a significant volume of research available on the drivers of national inflation, which is of direct relevance to the tourism industry. Going forward, the analysis of this data will provide, I have no doubt, an improved basis for the development of initiatives aimed at countering future inflation and renewing competitiveness.</P>
    <P>For the medium and longer term I look to Fáilte Ireland, which had its inaugural meeting on 28 May last, and the tourism policy review group, which is due to submit its full report in July, to help chart a new direction for tourism. I have every confidence the industry, with the support of the tourism State agencies, will make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead as they have so ably demonstrated in the past. I look forward to seeing a new agenda that will be driven by innovative approaches to product development, co-operative marketing initiatives and quality employment and in-career development opportunities in an industry where the prospects, despite recent setbacks, are highly positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply detailing what we want to hear about the industry and what the industry wants to hear in regard to the problems facing it given the lack of competitiveness in the country and the problems of the industry as a result of world events. The Minister stated that he has contacted all the relevant Ministers where there is a crossover of responsibility in regard to the proposals of the interim report.</P>
      <P>Was this report discussed at Cabinet or only on an individual basis with each Minister? It must be a combined effort. I know Cabinet decisions have been made and various methods proposed regarding Government efforts to try and restore the competitive edge we had. In regard to this particular report it is vital that it has the full support of Cabinet. We must ensure it gets its full backing and that the finance etc. necessary to overcome the problems are readily available. We are well into the tourism season now and anything that can be done in the short term to address the problems stated here, and earlier this morning at the Estimates meeting, should be done. In his report to the Estimates meeting this morning the Minister said the outlook was a little brighter than we would have expected. The full backing of the Cabinet in regard to this, and early decisions in regard to its proposals, would be welcome. I would like to hear the Minister's views in this regard.</P>

      <P>I confirm that I brought the interim report to Government for noting. However, it is not the full report and therefore a full implementation of it is not on the cards at this point. Nevertheless, I took the opportunity to brief my colleagues in Cabinet in regard to the contents of the report. I then wrote individually to the Ministers involved in tourism policy with a view to ensuring we will have bilateral structures that will better enable us to jointly implement <Col N="829" /> policy. By that I mean that there are many Departments which impinge on tourism policy whereas they might not be directly, distinctly or individually responsible for tourism. Accordingly, it is necessary that we have these structures to enable us to move the policy agenda forward. I anticipate that the full report should be available by the end of July. I will then bring that report to Government with a view to ensuring that as many of the recommendations as possible are implemented.</P>

      <P>The report confirmed what I have been saying here for the last year regarding inflation. Since 1996 it is double the European average and has made Irish tourism uncompetitive. VAT in the industry increased by 1% in the last budget. VAT in Spain is 5%, and 7.5% in France. In other countries there is no excise duty on wine or spirits. This and VAT make Ireland an expensive country. Also, insurance costs are six times higher than many of our European competitors. Simple things such as transport, road access and signposting were also highlighted in the report.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state his views on the Ireland-US bilateral air agreement? The review group strongly advocated changing the status of Shannon. Given that it has been shown that Kerry, for example, would benefit by 50% from the flow of visitors from Shannon, whereas if they end up in Dublin the flow would only be 22%, what is his view on the effect that any change of status would have on Kerry? The review group also identified Kerry as having poor access roads. Is there any possibility that the Government will make a priority of the main access roads in Kerry such as the Ring of Kerry road, the Dingle road or the N69?</P>
      <P>The report raises important questions. It confirms what we have been saying in the House for the past year. For that reason I welcome the report and ask the Minister to respond to the two points I raised on it.</P>

      <P>In regard to inflation, the full implementation by the social partners of the anti-inflation and competitiveness enhancing provisions of the social partnership agreement 2003-05, Sustaining Progress, is clearly essential, particularly those provisions relating to pay, productivity and the facilitation of change in the workplace.</P>
      <P>Also, the industry can implement measures with a view to improving competitiveness at company level by improved human resource practices, more efficient use of information technology, more innovative pricing initiatives and a relentless drive to reduce costs. Naturally, the Government also has a role in tackling price inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Ireland-US bilateral air agreement, it is true that the interim report recommends that it be renegotiated. This is not a matter for me as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism <Col N="830" /> but for the Minister for Transport. The Deputy will be aware that recently the EU Council of Ministers on Transport decided they were going to renegotiate the open skies position with the United States of America. The transport Ministers gave the Commission the authority to carry on with those negotiations. I understand that there may be some resistance from the United States side to change. It would be premature to say what the outcome will be.</P>
    <P>There was also an EU court judgment which has implications in regard to the bilateral agreement. In addition, the Minister for Transport has stated that it is his intention to introduce a restructuring of Aer Rianta in so far as it concerns Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports, and this a matter for that Minister. The bottom line is that if there is to be any change in the status of Shannon &ndash; I am not saying there will be &ndash; it could not occur unless specific guarantees were given to Shannon and the mid-west in regard to their future. However, it is very early days to speak in that context.</P>
    <P>With regard to access roads, the report, among other things, referred to the need to upgrade certain routes which are often used by visitors. The objective of the report was to improve the product, to ensure that we become more attractive to visitors and that there be a greater degree of access for them. It is an objective report that impinges on many areas which have but an indirect bearing on my Department. That is the reason I wrote to all Ministers and the reason the full report will be discussed by Government in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, in formulating it's first statement of strategy, 2003 to 2005, explicitly recognised the need for more balanced, sustainable regional economic and social <Col N="831" /> development in the context of the national spatial strategy, NSS, as one of the environmental factors impacting on the overall direction of its policy objectives. My Department's current tourism product policy closely mirrors the approach of the NSS. It anticipated much of the thrust of the strategy as the tourism division of my Department was represented on the interdepartmental committee which oversaw the work of the NSS.</P>
      <P>The NSS makes the point that tourism is characterised by the fact that consumption takes place where the service is provided. Tourism activity is focused, in some cases, on areas with an otherwise weak economic base. As a result it can have a positive influence on regional development and its potential into the future. The NSS distinguishes between different parts of the country in terms of their current level of tourism development.</P>
      <P>The approach to tourism set out in the NSS is reflected in the tourism product development sub-measures of the national development plan's regional operational programmes. These sub-measures will support the development of up to five major attractors in identified catchment areas; support the development of a number of clusters based on existing attractions and facilities; further develop the range and quality of niche product, particularly in the least developed tourism areas; and provide some support for the better management of the relationship between tourism and the environment in the established tourism areas.</P>
      <P>My Department is also represented on the new steering group established to oversee implementation of the strategy. We will in this context, with various other Departments, be examining policies and programmes over the next few months to see if there are issues in those programmes which need to be considered further in light of the NSS. Should issues be identified they will be discussed with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a view to seeing what action is necessary.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the various expenditure reviews planned by my Department in the context of its 2003 to 2005 programme, which includes a review of the local authority swimming pool programme, will take account of the NSS. The agencies under the aegis of my Department will continue to consult as appropriate with the relevant local authorities in relation to their own programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and note what he says. However, I am still concerned regarding the national spatial strategy launched a few months ago. While I welcomed the strategy, it is unfortunate that, since its launch, there has been no specific Government support for it. In effect, the plan was conceived, the strategy was born, but the parents &ndash; in this case, the Government &ndash; have deserted the new-born strategy &ndash; it is now an orphan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" />The Minister told the House that discussions are under way here and there. However, my question was specific and I would like to get a specific answer to it. Have specific guidelines been developed by the Minister and his Department to ensure that policies are tailored to give support to the national spatial strategy? For example, have guidelines or policies been developed for circulation to local authorities to encourage them to give precedence to the strategy? Has the Government as a whole discussed or set in train any coherent policy to underpin the strategy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to state that the national spatial strategy, which the Government spent considerable time formulating, is an orphan. However, it should be realised that the targets set out in the strategy are extremely ambitious and that the plan is to roll out over 20 years, though that does not mean that there has been any lack of effort by the Government in recent times in regard to the strategy.</P>
      <P>My Department is represented on the interdepartmental committee which oversaw the work on the national spatial strategy. It is also represented on the new interdepartmental national spatial strategy implementation group. If proof positive is required by Deputy McHugh that the national spatial strategy is not an orphan, the implementation group met in recent weeks and decided that relevant Departments, including my own, would examine their policies and programmes over the next few months to discover whether there are issues in those programmes which need to be considered further in respect of the strategy. Any issues identified will be discussed with the lead Department &ndash; the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government &ndash; with a view to seeing what action is necessary.</P>
      <P>The current tourism product policy of my Department closely mirrors the approach of the national spatial strategy and anticipated much of the thrust of that strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has confirmed that the review group is doing some work. I realise that the national spatial strategy and its terms are ambitious and I hope it works. If it does not, this country will go down the Swanee and balanced regional development, which everybody likes to talk about, will never happen. I welcome the Minister's statement that some work is being done to try to give substance to the strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my address to the Ireland travel trade workshop on 12 May, as never before, tourism business will be won or lost on the basis of value for money. I went on to suggest that the Irish industry will need to redouble its efforts to ensure that the quality of the product and service on offer matches the price being sought. Already, we are seeing initiatives from, for example, the restaurant sector which aim to address the pricing issue head on. With the euro strengthening against the dollar and sterling, the industry will need to focus its efforts on this issue to maintain and grow its share of the international market.</P>
      <P>It is increasingly clear that the tourism industry is exposed to a very competitive international marketplace. While Ireland has never been perceived as a cheap destination, the issue of value for money is now emerging as a serious issue and must be addressed by all involved. As I have mentioned already, in response to the earlier priority question on inflation in the tourism industry, Sustaining Progress &ndash; the Social Partnership Agreement 2003-2005, proposes that different responses, from the public and private sector alike, will be required to tackle inflation. Renewing competitiveness, not just in the tourism sector, but for the economy as a whole, is central to the Government's overall macro-economic policy of sustaining non-inflationary economic growth and high levels of employment.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that the tourism industry leads the way in improving satisfaction ratings by continuing to control costs, improve productivity, better manage its human resources and utilise modern technology to best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Minister's statements today, is there a problem in regard to our linkage with the UK in attracting tourism? He spoke about a possible holding of the US market and a possible increase in regard to mainland European countries, and yet we do not seem to have developed in regard to the UK market. I would have imagined, given the exchange rate between sterling and the euro, that we would have seen a major increase in UK visitors. However, the Minister has not reflected on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were there any informal talks with UK representatives at the conference? Was there any <Col N="834" /> explanation of the failure of the expected improvement to materialise? Many people I know in the tourism industry certainly expected such an improvement. What is the Minister's view of what is seen to be, and should be, our biggest customer for tourism?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the UK is of immense importance to Ireland in tourism terms. The number of visitors coming from the UK far outweighs the numbers from any other country and accounted for 4.5 million in 2002. We know from the CSO figures released today what the position is for the first three months of the year. While the backdrop has been difficult, with war in the Persian Gulf, SARS and the global economic downturn, the industry has again proven itself to be extremely resilient. At this point, the fall in numbers appears to be small for the first quarter and is in the order of 0.3%. It is encouraging, however, that the value of this has increased by 10%, which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>In recent times, the UK market has shown a remarkable fall on the outbound holiday market, in the order of 15%. Ireland's fall over the first quarter would appear to be in the order of 3%. That indicates that, relative to other destinations, Ireland is actually gaining ground. That is down to the fact that we have put in a huge effort in the UK and will continue to do so. I repeat my prediction that, while we will have a difficult year, I do not believe it will be as bad as many have predicted.</P>

      <P>Did operators at the travel trade conference express their concerns about the increasing costs in tourism and our lack of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> other destinations, given that some of their customers will have provided them with feedback that Ireland has become expensive?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the number of tourists visiting from the UK is somewhat distorted because of the large number of people who commute on a weekly and even daily basis to the UK for work and the number of people at college in the UK who return home? A different type of traveller comes from the UK, as opposed to the US, from where more tourists come. Does the Minister agree, therefore, that the UK tourism figures are distorted because of the differing definitions of what is a tourist? Perhaps the Minister will give the House his definition of what is a tourist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We must face the reality that, in general, prices are set by industry providers. Many of the increased costs in food, drink and entertainment, which absorb a huge proportion of a visitor's budget, must be met on an everyday basis by all of us. In the debate on pricing, it has often been argued that Ireland has never been a low cost destination and that visitors are prepared to pay for a quality product. To my mind, this is the crux of the matter. It is worrying <Col N="835" /> that visitors' perceptions of value for money have decreased so sharply. However, this should also be seen in the context of a great many overseas visitors still recommending Ireland as a holiday destination to their friends.</P>
      <P>From the outset of my appointment as Minister, I have been a strong advocate of ensuring our international competitiveness in terms of pricing, access and the quality of our product. I am confident that the programme of action for competitiveness and inflation, identified in the social partnership talks and the tourism review, will address this issue in greater depth.</P>
      <P>With regard to my definition of a tourist, I am greatly reminded of Lord Denning's description of how to know when a man is drunk, which is that when he is lying prostrate on the ground, and he falls off, he is definitely drunk. One man's beer is another's poison, therefore, it does not matter what my personal definition of a tourist is. Nonetheless, Tourism Ireland has ways of monitoring the number of tourists coming to the country and it supplies those figures to the Department. The CSO also has its method of deciding who is and is not on holidays. When the CSO produces its figures, I must take them at face value. I respectfully suggest that Deputy Deenihan writes to the CSO seeking the detail and data he has requested.</P>

      <P>A group of footballers and I travelled to Old Trafford a week ago and we were interviewed on the way back and declared to be tourists. Therefore, we added to the tourist numbers by virtue of the fact that we were in Old Trafford. There should be a clearer definition of what a tourist is, in order that we can plan properly with a greater appreciation of the real numbers visiting. Some 2.3 million real tourists come to this country each year, according to incoming tour operators. It would be better for everyone if we had clearer definition of the number of actual tourists coming here, rather than casual and commercial visitors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has approved my proposal to invite expressions of interest by way of public invitation from the private sector in participating, on the basis of a public private partnership, in the capital redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre in <Col N="836" /> and-or around the vicinity of the site of the existing theatre. I understand that the Office of Public Works will shortly be advertising in the Official Journal of the EU to engage advisers to help with the drawing up of a detailed specification for the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>When will the Minister invite expressions of interest in a PPP from the private sector? If there is no interest from the private sector, how will the Minister proceed? What incentives will there be for the private sector when interest is being sought in this important project? Did the Minister consider a joint project with the National Concert Hall in view of his response on the Estimates that the National Concert Hall may have to move from its present location? Does this present an opportunity to locate the Abbey Theatre and the National Concert Hall on the same site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was asked to name one project out of all those in my Department which would be highly attractive to a private investor, it would be the Abbey Theatre. It is true that the footprint of the present location would have to be expanded to provide an adequate national theatre but it is important that we have a decision from the Government that we are going to proceed and that it has agreed that expressions of interest be invited from potential private sector partners for the redevelopment of the theatre.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is preparing to commission a group of experts to advise on the detail of this invitation. A draft advertisement and tender documents have been prepared to invite tenders from a consortium of financial, process, legal and technical client advisers to advise in the first instance on the appropriateness of a public private partnership approach to the project. These documents have been circulated to the Abbey Theatre steering group for its observations. It is expected that the advertisement will be placed in the national newspapers and the official journal of the EU at the earliest possible date after the necessary approvals are received.</P>
      <P>A steering group consisting of representatives of the Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance, the Abbey Theatre, my Department and the consortium team leader, when appointed, will oversee management of the project. It is envisaged that the Office of Public Works will be in a position to appoint the consortium 11 weeks from the date of advertisement. Subject to the advice received from the consortium, Office of Public Works will then be in a position to revert to the Department of Finance. We will then reach the crucial stage of proceedings.</P>

The infrastructure for car parking and the theatre's proximity to Busáras is appropriate, particularly for those from the rural community <Col N="837" /> who attend the Abbey Theatre. I hope that the proposal will not envisage moving the theatre from its present location.</P>
      <P>What criteria are laid down for the possible size of the theatre? Will its size be increased by a particular margin or will that decision be made when technical advice is given to the Department? Are national theatres in other cities being examined, particularly if there is a rule of thumb for the size of such developments and will the public be able to debate the matter? We should ensure the project is brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This generation of Irish people is extremely creative and imaginative. It is remarkable that at this point we still do not have a public building that gives architectural expression to that creativity and imagination and the provision of a new national theatre would give us the opportunity to do that. The existing site of the Abbey Theatre is the chosen site at present. The size of that site must be increased if we are to have a theatre which is worthy of the title &ldquo;national theatre&rdquo; and which can celebrate Irish tradition, culture and literature in all its diversity. It would not be beneficial for me to speculate on what might happen as a result of the process we are undertaking but I sincerely hope that it will lead to the provision of a truly national theatre in Dublin.</P>

It is appropriate to make decisions now and set a timescale. Can the Minister be specific? Will the new theatre be ready within five years?</P>
      <P>The present footprint of the theatre is not large enough to provide the type of theatre that is needed. How much private property will have to be acquired to facilitate the increase in size?</P>

The feasibility of a public private partnership is being investigated at this point. It is a complex area and it would be unhelpful of me to put a timescale on what might occur in a public private partnership. We have embarked on this path and I hope to ensure that it reaches a successful conclusion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The meeting with Theatre Forum, as with the many other meetings I have had with individuals and groups from the arts sector, served to give me a real and practical sense of the impact of current economic circumstances on the sector. While it is clear that no sector can be immune from current economic reality, I will certainly advocate the case for funding the arts sector as effectively as is possible in the context of the Estimates for 2004 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the cutback to the Arts Council has the effect of passing on costs to the Exchequer given that many performing arts companies have not been in a position, due to lack of funding, to provide their programme of entertainment for a particular year? Many actors and actresses are unemployed and have to be paid by the Exchequer in the form of social welfare payments. It also affects the development of the arts in rural areas and in many towns, such as Portlaoise and other areas, which have wonderful theatres, as the performing groups do not have the funds to provide entertainment. The development of the arts is vital given that many groups do not wish to come to the city, for whatever reason. Due to the lack of funding and the cutbacks to the Arts Council, they cannot be facilitated. Can anything be done to rectify the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government endorsed the principles upon which the arts plan is based and the Government stands by that endorsement. However, there was never any guarantee of Government approval for this specific annual target included in the plan by the Arts Council. From the Government's perspective, it was always utterly clear that the phasing of the plan and the funding that could be provided in any given year would have to be addressed through the normal annual Estimates campaign. That is how it is with every Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to enter into a multi-annual funding arrangement was made by the Arts Council and not by the Government. Government fund<Col N="839" /> ing for the Arts Council was always subject to an annual Estimates process and there has been no change. It would be silly of me to allege that funding cutbacks, however unavoidable they may be, have a positive effect on any sector and I do not propose to do that. The funding available to the Arts Council in 2002 represents an 80% increase over the 1997 level of funding and the decrease of 8% in 2003 must be viewed against this tremendous increase over the previous five years. Part of the problem is that during the good times structures change, employment levels increase, venues multiply and so on. When the financial tap flows less freely it can be quite traumatic to retrench and difficulties of this kind have arisen. The argument could be made that if increases were not so generous in good times, the bad times could be handled more easily. However, I would still argue that we have a right to be generous during the good years. My ambition is to fight as hard as I possibly can to ensure improved funding for the Arts Council next year. That is a debate for another day between the Minister for Finance and me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister that in the third arts plan the target for 2003 was &euro;53.79 million, yet the amount allocated in the Estimates was &euro;44 million, a reduction of &euro;9 million. Is the Minister aware that most arts groups base their work practices on multi-annual funding over a period of three years and have been encouraged to do so? Due to the expectation of increased funding they have employed people, embarked on certain educational programmes and set out their targets but as a result of the reduction in funding, they cannot proceed. Is the Minister aware that a number of arts groups around the country have slashed their educational programmes and are not touring? For example, Ballet Ireland is almost decimated as its funding was cut by approximately 70%. A range of groups has been affected by the cut in the allocation and also by the community employment scheme. Given that there has not been a major drawdown of ACCESS funds and if there are surplus funds available, is there any possibility of re-allocating those funds to the Arts Council with a view to providing further assistance this year to those arts groups who are in danger of going out of existence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The multi-annual funding arrangement was introduced by the Arts Council. The Government endorsed the general principles of the arts plan but never stated that the funding would be X, Y or Z over the following three years. That was a matter for the Arts Council. Deputy Deenihan who is an experienced politician is well aware that the provision of funding for any Department is contingent upon the Esti<Col N="840" /> mates debates which take place bilaterally and within Government. The decrease to the Arts Council was 8%. That must be set against a backdrop of an 80% increase over the previous five years. It is my job to ensure I get the maximum amount possible for the Arts Council and I will do that. However, it is important that the matter be set in context. With regard to the ACCESS funding, this money was made available for capital projects. It would not be possible to transfer that into revenue. On the question of whether it can be used for new projects, the position is that if some projects are not going ahead it will be due to the fact that they are unable to meet the time schedule. If those projects could not meet the time schedule, and if that is the reason they lose funding, it is extremely doubtful that late applicants could overtake projects which have been in the pipeline for some time and which would not make the time schedule.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 26 February last, the National Concert Hall is the premier venue for classical musical performance in Dublin. It was built within the Earlsfort Terrace complex and shares its accommodation with University College Dublin. From the outset, it was recognised that there were inadequacies in relation to the overall space allocated to it and that backstage accommodation, in particular, was limited.</P>
      <P>On foot of Government consideration of the report of the high level group &ndash; established in July 2000 to examine and report on all the issues involved in relation to the NCH at Earlsfort Terrace and comprising the Secretaries General of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of Education and Science and the chairman of the Office of Public Works &ndash; the Office of Public Works was asked to put together, in consultation with the management of the National Concert Hall, a full brief of physical and other requirements tailored to serve the needs of the National Concert Hall for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>In the light of this brief, my Department, together with the Office of Public works, is in detailed discussion with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority regarding the adequacy and suitability of a site in the Grand Canal Dock area of Dublin as a site to relocate the National Concert Hall. These discussions are ongoing.</P>

      <P>Given that we are losing major international performances because we are unable to stage them in the National Concert Hall due to space limitations and the size of the auditorium, does the Minister agree it is urgent to provide a new arrangement? Does the Minister foresee the National Concert Hall moving to a new site, as he more or less indicated this morning during the debate on the Estimates, or is there a possibility that by expanding the present National Concert Hall that it could accommodate the type of international performance that is needed? I remind the Minister that some 300,000 domestic patrons watched performances in the National Concert Hall last year. It is important that our own people have proper facilities as well. When assessing the requirements, will the Minister clarify whether the concert hall will be moved to a new site or will there be an expanded National Concert Hall on the existing site? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite its drawbacks, the present location of the National Concert Hall is premier in terms of the design of the building in which it is housed and its location. Accordingly, any recommendation we make to Government to relocate the hall must take account of this reality. A relocated National Concert Hall complex at the Grand Canal Harbour site must adequately provide a remedy for the many serious and long-standing shortcomings of the current location at Earlsfort Terrace. It should have its own unique building identity, adequate surrounding public space and it should give a sense of place. A feasibility study was undertaken on behalf of the Office of Public Works regarding the adequacy of a site offered by the Dublin Docklands Authority in the Grand Canal Docks area for the purposes of a new national concert hall. My Department and the Office of Public Works are involved in discussions with the authority regarding the availability of an adequate site at that location. These discussions are ongoing and it would be premature to anticipate their outcome.</P>

In its first strategy document A New Era for Irish Sport (2000-2002) the Irish Sports Council included the establishment of local sports partnerships as one of its main priorities. Following <Col N="843" /> the receipt of proposals from local bodies, the council approved and funded the establishment of eight partnerships in May 2001 and a further four were established in early 2002.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There have, thankfully, been significant improvements in this country, but those of us who represent less-developed areas have an obligation to push for further inward investment and the economic development which is so important. Thankfully, emigration has stopped and people are returning to live in rural areas. We see a turn around in rural areas such as Cavan-Monaghan which suffered immensely due to the Troubles in the North of Ireland and depopulation. We want the necessary infrastructure to be put in place as quickly as possible to ensure that we promote further investment and job creation. This legislation is important in that it will provide a means of co-ordinating and linking the work of the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned in recent years by the growth of new organisations and bodies. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is right to streamline many of the various organisations which have been established at national and local levels. There is enough public money being spent, but it should be better targeted. There is too much duplication at local development level and in community and voluntary sector support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in this House some months ago that many of the executives and administrators of the community and voluntary groups supported by the State have much greater resources and backup than Oireachtas Members. I instanced that day the case of Opposition Front Bench spokespersons who have that additional responsibility apart from their work as Deputies. They do not have the resources they should have. Those <Col N="845" /> of us who have been here for a few years appreciate the improvements there have been in recent years in support services provided to Dáil and Seanad Members.</P>
    <P>We need further research and support services. Many of the people who are employed in local development and who may be in charge of community or resource centres will have a plethora of staff to help them. Oireachtas Members, who represent huge numbers of constituents, do not have that support. Their support consists of just one secretary each. All Members could contribute more handsomely to the ongoing discussions of bodies such as the National Economic and Social Forum if we had the time to do the necessary research or if research facilities and services were available to us.</P>
    <P>In the Border region there have been many worthwhile schemes of financial assistance for regenerating areas that suffered immensely over the years, for rural regeneration and to wipe out urban blight. In many instances, however, the funding could be better directed and targeted at the people who should be the recipients. There is duplication and overlapping and the intended recipients do not always receive the benefits which were intended for them when the scheme was initiated. I hope the council to be established by this legislation will have some role in curtailing this type of organisation growth.</P>
    <P>There has been a welcome increase in expenditure on infrastructure, such as water and sewerage schemes, in our towns and villages. That investment is enabling local authorities and private developers to provide additional housing in these areas, which has helped to ease pressure on the housing market in larger urban centres. In many instances, smaller towns and villages in rural areas have the necessary infrastructure of shops, schools, churches and community centres. Indeed, until recently that infrastructure would not have been utilised fully because of the low population. The decision to improve the water and sewerage infrastructure in these areas is particularly important for ensuring a better spread of population and better balance in economic growth.</P>
    <P>I hope this council will have links with similar organisations in Northern Ireland. Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 there has been increased co-operation at all levels between North and South. If it is not already provided for in the legislation, the remit of this body should be extended to facilitate working in close co-operation with similar bodies north of the Border. This island is too small to be divided and seen as two different economies. Significant benefits can be gained from researching projects and planning for the future on an all-island basis, rather than planning on a 26 county and six county basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" />The national spatial strategy demonstrates this forward thinking in that both Letterkenny and Derry contribute to the classification of one gateway centre. That is the right way to go. Similarly, Monaghan as a hub town is linked with Armagh while Cavan town is linked with Enniskillen. That is realistic planning. The towns of Armagh and Enniskillen are practically sister towns of Monaghan and Cavan and the growth of one will enhance the potential for the other towns to grow as well.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will be in a position to advance the decentralisation programme quickly. In this era of rapid telecommunications and important technological advances there should be no deterrent to entire Departments being decentralised to provincial centres. Members who live within 75 miles of Dublin are aware of neighbours who commute to Dublin each day to work, primarily in the public service. That burden on employees cannot enhance their lifestyles. Most provincial centres could cater adequately for a decentralised Department. The Government should make radical decisions in the decentralisation programme. The opportunity to do so exists because of technological advances.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation of 150 or 200 civil servants to a provincial town would have a significant impact on the local economy. Towns the size of Cavan or Monaghan are particularly anxious to be considered for decentralised Departments. The Government, in considering decentralisation, should give particular recognition to the needs of the Border area, which has had particular difficulties for 30 years. Given the Good Friday Agreement and the need to regenerate the Ulster economy, the Government should bring public service employment to centres in the Border region. That is essential and I hope positive decisions will be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>The new council should work in tandem with the all-Ireland bodies which have already been established as a result of the Good Friday Agreement. Waterways Ireland is one such body, as is InterTradeIreland, the special EU programmes body. Even though the political institutions in Northern Ireland are in suspension, the daily work of those bodies continues. The personnel employed in the bodies are drawn from north and south of the Border and they are continuing their daily work dealing with the issues of the day. The real benefit of the Good Friday Agreement is that these bodies are working well. It is a positive sign, especially when one hears so much negative talk about the political situation in Northern Ireland, to have these bodies working efficiently on an all-island basis and contributing to the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill. I will first comment on the three bodies concerned in putting together the National Economic and Social Development <Col N="847" /> Office. The National Centre for Partnership and Performance has finalised its strategy and operational plan, which includes research into identifying best practices and developing new national strategies for partnership in the workplace.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council was established in 1973. Its main task was to advise the Government on the development of the national economy and the achievement of social justice. Until 1997, the social partners represented on the NESC were the trade unions, the business and employer organisations and the agriculture and farming organisations. Since 1998 the community and voluntary sectors have also had representations on the council, and I understand that the Government also nominates civil servants and other independent members to the NESC.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum was set up in 1993 for the purpose of achieving consensus on major economic and social issues. Since 1998 the forum's work has focused on the evaluation and implementation of policies dealing with equality and social inclusion. The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the establishment of a body known as the National Economic and Social Development Office, comprising the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. These bodies will now form the new office and will continue to pursue their own distinct agendas.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the Bill include its function, which is covered in section 8, its composition, which is covered in sections 13 to 16, inclusive, the nomination procedures for ordinary membership of each of the bodies and the term of office of both the chairperson and the ordinary members of the various bodies. Most provisions of the Bill deal with the operating arrangements for the office and put into place on a statutory basis structures to ensure that the complementary roles of the three bodies are acknowledged and developed to support the country's economic and social fabric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In principle, the Fine Gael Party is in favour of partnership but we feel that changes need to be made to the present arrangements. The first partnership agreement was signed back in 1987. I am sure the Minister of State will recall that there was a very high unemployment rate at the time of about 17.5%. There was also mass emigration. Over a five-year period about 160,000 people left the country. Not that many women were employed in the labour force either. Ireland has come a long way since the 1980s, when the country was hit by many economic disasters. Perhaps the model we have is outdated in a modern Ireland with a much more educated workforce, a country that has achieved a lot over the last 20 <Col N="848" /> years. Modern technology and telecommunications have changed the workplace and the workforce.</P>
    <P>Membership of the European Union has also had a direct effect on the social fabric of the country. We have to comply with much more EU legislation, which has changed our society. With the imminent enlargement of the European Union to embrace many former eastern bloc countries, that fabric will change even more. There will be much greater movement of people throughout the European Union. We have seen the effect this has had in Ireland in recent times, with many foreign workers coming here to work in hotels and other industries throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The recent downturn in the economy resulting in many job losses is a worrying trend. We currently have one of the highest inflation rates in Europe, and families now find it much more difficult to meet their financial commitments. About two weeks ago I watched on the news on RTE a comparison of two shopping baskets, one in Dublin and one in Brussels. The basket in Brussels was much cheaper then the one in Dublin. Brussels used to be known as the home of the Eurocrats and was always supposed to be much more expensive, but a basket of groceries is now much dearer in Dublin than in Brussels. The introduction of the euro has magnified this trend.</P>
    <P>We can also see the effects of Deputy McCreevy's budget of December 2002, and the significant increases in VAT, fuel prices, health charges, third level registration fees and insurance costs, which have had a detrimental effect in many industries. We all know many small companies that have had to close their doors because insurance costs have driven them out of business. All of these factors are having an effect on people's salaries, together with the job losses that are being announced almost on a daily basis in various parts of the country</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Clare, the number of light industrial jobs lost in the last two years is fast approaching 500. That is worrying in a town like Ennis, which was designated as an information age town in the 1990s. People in Ennis thought that with information-age technology and every home having a computer, the area would be a magnet for that type of industry. Unfortunately that has not occurred and there have been many job losses in recent times.</P>
    <P>The dwindling number of Ennis industrialists have spent the last two years watching their neighbours leave unchecked with virtually no replacement of jobs in the light industrial sector. There has also been an increase of about 12% in the numbers on the live register in Ennis over the last 12 months, so in real terms unemployment in Ennis has increased by 40% in the last two years. Very little has been done by this Government to attract new industry into the Ennis area. In fact, <Col N="849" /> only last week two companies announced job losses in Shannon. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, will be aware of that. Lufthansa Technologies is shedding 29 jobs in the aviation business in Shannon over the next few months. We also had notification from Sifa, a company in the Shannon industrial estate, of about 65 job losses.</P>
    <P>These are small numbers but this is happening on a regular basis. These job losses often go unnoticed by the media, but when one adds up the figures over a period of years they do amount to quite a lot of job losses. My colleague, Deputy Ring, spoke of the Shannon stopover. I point out to the House that there is no such thing as the Shannon stopover. We in the mid-west call it the Shannon gateway. This has been in place since 1947, and to call the Shannon gateway the Shannon stopover is a misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>Jobs around the mid-west area are very dependent on Shannon Airport. I was disappointed last week that the Minister for Transport allowed his partners in the European Union the freedom to negotiate a new EU-US agreement without putting the case for Shannon before the Council of Ministers. I am a firm believer that what one has one keeps &ndash; and I am talking about the current bilateral arrangements with the US &ndash; until one gets something better. I am disappointed in that as I believe our case has been weakened in Europe, an issue of which I urge the Minister to take note. I am pleased to see that my constituency colleague, Deputy Killeen, has joined the debate. He is aware of the importance of Shannon Airport to the local economy, especially in the interest of balanced regional development and the national spatial strategy, launched last year, which designated Shannon as a gateway and Ennis as a hub.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor spoke about Tallaght in his constituency having almost every facility. By contrast, the IDA Ireland report for 2002, published last week, indicates that the west and mid-west were the worst performing regions in terms of the number of IDA Ireland job losses, despite the fact that the western region has Objective One status. It is an appalling situation given the decline in development in the region. IDA Ireland states the deficit is due to the easing of pressure in the Dublin region, which is causing more firms to invest in the capital rather than considering relocation to the regions.</P>
    <P>Every flight lost to Shannon Airport has an attendant loss in terms of cargo facilities, which is very important for the region, including the western seaboard area. The region will not develop unless the necessary infrastructure is put in place. It is hoped that work on the Ennis bypass will commence in 2004, but further delays may be experienced in view of the slow implementation of the national development plan. Even the Institute of Engineers of Ireland main<Col N="850" /> tains that it could take until 2016 to complete projects under the plan. I hope the money for the bypass will be put in place to allow work to commence in 2004. This three year project is needed, not only for Shannon Airport but as a gateway for the west. At present, many passengers travel to Dublin Airport because of the traffic jams at Gort and Ennis.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance will be in a position to approve Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastlewest as centres for decentralisation. These towns have been included in the ISDN application. Decentralisation will mean so much to a place like Kilrush, which has suffered depopulation and job losses. The relocation of one Department to the town would be the equivalent to the creation of 10,000 jobs in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>While Fine Gael does not want partnership at any price, we must develop a model to suit the workforce and employers. We do not want measures that will create rigidities in the economy or hurt workers or small business people. It would be better to have no agreement than one that will be detrimental to the economy.</P>
    <P>Small businesses are not represented at partnership negotiations. Workers in large businesses or corporations have totally different concerns from those involved in small industries, yet small businesses must abide by the parameters of the partnership agreement. This can restrict their activities and sometimes drive them out of business. In my constituency of Clare, small businesses constitute the backbone of the economy in the county.</P>
    <P>The challenge for social partnership is inclusion for all sectors of society, not only for the few with vested interests. I welcome the establishment of the National Economic and Social Development Office as it will provide for accountability to the Dáil. I hope the problems I have highlighted can be addressed.</P>
    <P>Farming organisations are represented on the bodies concerned. Commissioner Fischler's proposals are subject to ongoing negotiations in Luxembourg this afternoon. I have a copy of a press release issued today by Clare ICMSA which indicates that if decoupling is introduced, Clare farmers could lose approximately &euro;2.4 million. This would be a significant loss for farming in the county, especially in west Clare where farmer numbers have dwindled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill. The office has as its constituent bodies the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. The Bill puts these offices on a statutory footing for the first time, which will be a surprise to a number of people, especially to those who have tried to pay some <Col N="851" /> attention to the reports of these offices, particularly those issued by the council and the forum. The reports of both bodies have had a considerable impact on public policy and I welcome the fact that they will be drawn together under this new office and that there may be greater integration between them.</P>
      <P>The NESC has operated for 30 years and has played a central role in examining strategic issues around the development of the economy and the pursuit of social justice. The establishment of the office 30 years ago was an innovative development, especially in the Irish context. Even in the international context, it was a step forward. The council has produced a number of important strategic reports which have been highly rated. It has also made an important and valuable contribution, particularly since 1987, when it was effectively charged with drawing up the framework for the various national agreements.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle will recall that 1987 was a very difficult time economically. The involvement of the NESC in the first of the series of national agreements that year was a great step forward and also a step into the unknown. It is difficult for us today to comprehend the serious economic crisis of the mid-1980s which forced the 1987 programme for national recovery. As we know it was a consensus between the trade unions, farming bodies, business organisations and the Government that focused almost exclusively on ensuring there would be an economic recovery. Many of the experts at the time who focused on the problems and possible solutions argued that the NESC and the Government was setting itself an impossible agenda. Fortunately, it has turned out to be very successful and the consensus and partnership achieved then has been built on in several other agreements.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach had a particular responsibility in that area at that time when, as a Minister, he expended enormous amounts of energy and made a tremendous commitment to the establishment of partnership and to ensuring that what was needed to facilitate national economic recovery and resurgence was done. That the NESC had been in place for some time prior to this provided a useful framework which helped to create the consensus and political will to deliver from a very difficult situation.</P>
      <P>The subsequent agreements have accommodated a wider economic and social agenda, including unemployment, inequality and social inclusion as well as the central consideration of economic policy. The last strategy document which was produced set the agenda for the most recent talks on social partnership. The NESC has also carried out an important role in national affairs to the benefit of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the National Economic and Social Forum in 1993 broadened the social <Col N="852" /> partnership process and sought to achieve a consensus across a broad base on major social and economic issues. I recall at the time several commentators saying that the forum was either unnecessary or a duplication in terms of the remit of the council. The forum has managed to set its own agenda and area of responsibility and particularly over the last five years, it has focused on evaluating the implementation of policies mainly in the areas of equality and social inclusion and has done so with a great deal of gusto. It has produced many reports and in general the focus has been on the delivery of service and the perception of consumers about the quality of that service.</P>
    <P>The most recent of the bodies is the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, which was set up in 2001 to support and drive change in the workplace. It is the least well-known partly because it is the newest but also I believe because its role is less clearly understood, although it is important for Ireland in the future. It is charged with helping public and private ventures to respond to change, to improve net and national competitiveness, to ensure better public services, higher living standards and a better quality of life. In a rapidly changing environment this slightly different focus has been useful. Recently I looked back at a 1992 NESC report on the association between economic growth and employment growth in Ireland. It is interesting to see the focus in that report as opposed to some of the more recent ones. At that stage we were probably beginning to believe as a nation that the difficulties of the mid-1980s had been successfully addressed, at least to some extent, and that report examined the links between output growth and employment growth at individual establishment level. It quoted quite liberally from a report by Keating and Keane on the period from 1979 to 1985 which found that most firms which increased output also increased employment, although some firms managed to fairly dramatically increase output with fewer people employed.</P>
    <P>The jobless growth was pronounced among Irish firms and in the low-tech sectors in manufacturing, and far less so in the area of the overseas dominated high-tech sectors. That will have been in direct contrast with what many people believed because it was commonly thought at the time that many of the IDA supported firms which came in from abroad, and in many instances received considerable grant aid, would have worked for a while then disappeared. On the contrary, this report found that many of these newer firms, particularly those in the high-tech sector, with a strong international connection, were the ones which managed to increase employment and simultaneously, in most cases, to increase output. We need to recall that was an era of almost mass unemployment and mass emigration and the council at the time focused on the difficulties and particularly on finding solutions to them. That <Col N="853" /> was one of the reports which had a substantial impact on subsequent public policy, one that almost anybody who approached it in a fair-minded fashion would consider to be positive.</P>
    <P>I looked then at report No. 104 of 1999, entitled Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice to find that the emphasis has changed dramatically and it reaches several conclusions on poverty. The report lays less emphasis on mass unemployment though it does draw attention to the fact that a reduction in poverty levels is closely associated with an increase in employment levels. The Government's policy of trying to ensure that the conditions are right for the creation and maintenance of high numbers in employment is important. One point proved in several of these reports, and elsewhere, is that high rates of taxation on employment are among the factors most detrimental to employment. One of the great achievements over the last five or six years is the consistent improvement in expenditure in services in all the main areas while the Government has managed simultaneously to keep down the burden of taxation on the individual worker. That is one of the key factors in progressing our economy and nation. I hope that we will not see in the coming years a change in that policy to a high rate of taxation on employment because it would be detrimental.</P>
    <P>The NESC produced two reports in late 2002, No. 110, Achieving Quality Outcomes: The Management of Public Expenditure, which was timely and influential, and No. 109, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise. When that report was delivered I had a quick look through it, and like many of my colleagues in the House, I wished that I had somebody who would be in a position to go through it, evaluate it and give me a précis of its main findings and impact.</P>
    <P>Just now I heard a committee division bell which I presume is for the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which coincidentally is considering the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill and the kind of resources that should be made available to Members of the House. Some of us, including the Acting Chairman, have worked in that area over the last four or five years. Anyone who has looked at the experience of other parliaments has to be aware that the kind of support that is available for Members of this House is simply not good enough. A great deal of work could be done, and a valuable contribution made to debate in the House, if we had access to the kind of support that would make us top quality representatives of the people but that is another issue. The bell reminded me that that was the case.</P>
    <P>Report No. 109 looks carefully at issues such as multi-annual budgeting, the fairly frothy area of accountability for results and the introduction of an evaluation culture. Many people would say <Col N="854" /> that is the kind of thing we can take for granted and surely we have been doing that all along? To some extent we have but not in the focused and professional way that we should have been doing it, particularly in the public sector. Private sector firms by and large have been forced to embrace a new culture of evaluation and accountability because of competition but in the public sector it is much more difficult to set out criteria and to evaluate in a reasonable and fair manner. That was one of the areas on which report No. 109 concentrated. It is an interesting document which makes many recommendations and looks in considerable detail at our experience over many years and where we should be advancing.</P>
    <P>The other report looked at strategies for ensuring that investment takes place and at the delivery of quality infrastructure, planning and regulations. Sometimes the experience of many of us in the House is that the delivery of quality infrastructure is quite frequently undermined, especially by the level of regulation and the quite bizarre planning requirements in certain regards. While the Planning Act 2001 has improved the position somewhat, we must face up to the fact that there are constraints in the system which work against the provision of quality public infrastructure and certainly make the opportunities for investment much more difficult than necessary for many in the private sector, without in any way improving the quality of the outcome. I have no difficulty whatsoever with planning and regulation, provided that its effect is positive and that it is not operated in such a bureaucratic manner that everyone loses patience and occasions arise when the potential investor walks away or is driven off. That is one of the areas examined in that report, although perhaps not in the detail or with the focus one might wish. However, we must face up to it as we move forward.</P>
    <P>The functions of the council are outlined in sections 9 to 11 of the Bill. I was very pleased to see that the council will be required to report to the Taoiseach on all strategic matters. There is a co-ordinating role regarding the work of the various Departments, sometimes where there is an overlapping responsibility and sometimes where there are quite divergent or even conflicting ones. The council, working on the experience of the three constituent bodies and on the broad range of interests represented across them, will be hugely important to the economic growth of the country as we move forward.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Breen, referred to issues arising from the broad area covered by the Bill regarding our constituency in Clare and, in general terms, across Government policy. Perhaps he was not aware of the substantial drop in the inflation rate for last month, which was announced today. It illustrates the success of the Government's strategy in this area. We also continue to enjoy the highest growth rates in our own <Col N="855" /> band and are clearly beginning to see success in addressing the economic downturn. It is very difficult in a small, open economy to contend and deal with all the negative factors which exist, particularly in the huge international economies, more particularly when we are so dependent on a very high level of exports. However, I believe the Government's strategy is addressing the various issues as far as that is possible in an open economy.</P>
    <P>My colleague mentioned regional policy, which in many respects is quite closely bound up with what one would see as the role of the council. The area has not really been explored very specifically, except in so far as it is done in the national spatial strategy to which there are very positive aspects. There are many things with which one could disagree if one really wanted to, but no one could reasonably argue against the overall general strategy.</P>
    <P>However, concerns are emerging that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is charged as the lead Department, does not have the influence to ensure that other Departments follow policies accommodating the aspirations and practical requirements of the national spatial strategy. Deputy Breen referred to the proposed changes arising from the EU taking over various responsibilities regarding Shannon Airport. First, we must all accept and face up to the fact that changes will occur and we must do so in the context of rulings from the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the outcome of various EU treaties. However, we also have a responsibility to seek to manage that change and an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ed Walsh of the University of Limerick wrote a very interesting and inspiring article in last Saturday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he referred to a western technopolis encompassing the area of Galway, Limerick and Cork as a counterbalance to Dublin; he argued the case very cogently in a very brief article. That is the kind of direction we must take. In doing so, we must manage whatever changes in regulation we may make to ensure that the activities of the Department of Transport, for example, do not undermine the aspirations or will of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this instance.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a commitment to the strategy, but there is a need for consideration of the impact of various policy changes regarding its delivery. One of the areas where there has been considerable success right across the country has been the decentralisation of Government offices, and a further programme is expected. County Clare has offices in Ennis and Shannon, and there are others not far away in adjoining counties &ndash; Nenagh in Tipperary and in Limerick. They have played an important role in <Col N="856" /> spreading the State's involvement, infrastructure, jobs and economic advantages to peripheral regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I am sure many Deputies have taken the same approach as I propose to and broadened discussion of its provisions. My colleagues have drawn out some of the problems in the detail of the structure of the NESC, particularly the lack of any environmental input into its considerations, for example, input from NGOs or environmental groups, an issue we feel is a major failing in a Government which is avowedly seeking to combine environmental protection with economic and social development.</P>
      <P>The criticism made by my colleague, Deputy Boyle, that this Bill is a rationalisation of the NESC structures, is correct. Given that he was a member of the board for four years, I am quite happy to allow him his say on that. Before entering the Chamber, I said to him that when I examine the NESC, its role and the broad analysis it is able to take, I cannot understand what he is doing in this House, since he would be much better off back in his job there where he had a far more interesting time and an interesting view of everything. As Deputy Killeen said, sometimes Deputies find it slightly difficult to take reports coming from the NESC, such is the wisdom and breadth of experience and knowledge therein. I wondered whether it was not a demotion for Deputy Boyle when he was elected and had to leave it behind.</P>
      <P>In examining the history of the three-yearly reports in which the NESC has been engaged over a 20 year period, I almost see it as a mirror image of my adult and working life. The first report in 1986 was entitled A Strategy for Development. The titles and broad content of each report since then have mirrored what has happened in Irish society and the NESC had a very positive and profound influence in that development. I very much welcome the concept and existence of such a body. I remember how, prior to 1986, in the really grim years of the early 1980s, its role was filled by a plethora of various economists who happened to have the ear of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance at the time. They seemed to walk across from the UCD campus at Belfield into RTE and pontificate about what was really wrong with the country, which continued deeper into the mire, despite what those economic wizards had told us. The NESC, in the broader analysis that it has brought to our economic and social issues, has been very successful and welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reviewing those 20 years of development, I date the incredible growth of the Irish economy to a particular day and time &ndash; the day the Dublin millennium milk bottle landed on my breakfast table in front of my packet of cornflakes. The <Col N="857" /> country changed around that time. I do not know if it was the millennium, or the &ldquo;aluminium&rdquo; as we called it, the football team doing well in Gelsenkirchen or the wheel of fortune turning for our economic circumstances. There was finally an end to that grim, desperate period of the mid-1980s, when the only question was whether anyone would be left here.</P>
    <P>Suddenly my consciousness and the collective consciousness turned &ndash; there was a way forward and hope that we could develop jobs for Ireland. It is important to recognise that that sense of collective consciousness in a nation does have an effect and helps to steer the country's direction. It took a while for that to lead through to direct jobs &ndash; as Deputy Killeen said, there was jobless growth from the early to mid-1990s &ndash; but the foundations were being formed then. Many of my friends and acquaintances went through the same experience &ndash; they left Ireland in the mid-1980s with a good education and came back in the late 1980s to start up small businesses. Looking around in my business life it is amazing to see the number of people who followed that experience. They returned to Ireland in the late 1980s and set up small businesses which, ten or 12 years on, are now substantial and doing well.</P>
    <P>Our economic success is difficult to analyse but the NESC helped to direct that and to steer our path as a nation. That is why it is apt to debate the structures of the NESC and its latest three-yearly report, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise. That report comes to the conclusion that, in the collective consciousness, most people intuitively believe that things have gone wrong and are off the rails. The gears of the wheels that keep an economy motoring, which were turning in the same direction in the 1990s, have now ground together. Page 41 of the NESC report states that Ireland's current economic situation can be understood by noting that several of the vulnerabilities listed have arrived together &ndash; we have lost competitiveness, our exchange rate changes are going to make our lack of competitiveness all the more apparent and there are significant unresolved internal issues, particularly regarding land, housing and settlement. The report goes on to point out the sharp deterioration in the public finances and the insufficient delivery of many public services, the expensive and slow progress in infrastructural developments and the growing pressure on the environment from several sources.</P>
    <P>That is neither my view as a member of the Green Party nor that of the Opposition. It is the view of the NESC and it is correct. People know that and that is why there is concern among the public. The Taoiseach did well in 1988. I do not know if he was responsible for the millennium milk bottles but he milked the praise and adulation as Lord Mayor. Listening to the Taoiseach as a new Deputy reminds me of the mid-1980s <Col N="858" /> when it was great fun to listen in to Radio Moscow for the statistics of the Russian Government. Everything was bright and rosy in the Russian economy &ndash; tractor production numbers were up 50,000 and house construction figures were up 50%. In reality, the structure beneath that propaganda was cracking. Week in, week out I hear the Taoiseach respond to questions here by saying all is well with the world, with Garda numbers increasing 60% in the last six years, health spending increasing by 120% and so on. He is right and all those figures are true. However, what he is neither admitting nor addressing is the fact that the gears of the economy, the wheels that keep us working together positively, have got stuck and are blocked.</P>
    <P>In many ways it is the Government which removed the oil and broke that process with its pro-cyclical policy, as pointed out by the NESC said. The 1999 NESC report, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice, highlighted the issue of current expenditure. It stated that over the three years to 2002 the real increase in public expenditure &ndash; current expenditure &ndash; should, at a maximum, correspond to the real growth rate of GNP. That was sound economic advice provided by the NESC but it was ignored by the Government, which decided to go on a spending jamboree for the two years coming up the election. Instead of having spending growth of 7%, 8% or even 10%, which given our phenomenal growth we might have managed, the Government pumped it up by 20%, which blew the gasket in our economy. We are all going to pay the price for that.</P>
    <P>That is not the only issue. I would not blame everything on the Government. There is also an international downturn and the inevitability that we would run into difficulties given the growth we had. However, the Government should not shirk the blame &ndash; it should accept some of the responsibility for our present problems and stop parroting out statistics about how everything is going well, how spending has increased and how everything is fine. It is not fine. The boom is over and we need to start changing our tactics for a different world.</P>
    <P>There is a subtle process involved in doing so. We should adopt an agenda of green, environmental economics. I know Deputies opposite and the Minister of State are great for hoots of laughter anytime someone mentions green economics.</P>

      <P>We have choices to make to move us on from our current situation and to free up the economy from its present poor state. At least Deputy Harney is honest when she comes out with a different model. She says we can go towards Berlin or Boston and she clearly plants her flag on the Boston model. That is not necessarily the best way to develop the economy; sole reliance on the market system to solve our problems is clearly not working. It was partly responsible for some of the difficulties we have. When we look at where to go it is important to provide alternatives and that is what the Opposition should be doing. Deputy Killeen made a valid point when he said it can be difficult for the man in the street &ndash; or a Deputy &ndash; to grasp fully all the details of these national economic reports. It is the role of politicians to distil those details down and to communicate alternatives. We should give ownership of reports like this to the general public so we can start working collectively and positively again. Some Opposition proposals are the right way forward and will lead to a better balance between our economy, our environment and our society.</P>
      <P>Last week the Government asked the Opposition for suggestions as to what it would do differently, rather than just criticising the current impasse. Our policies fit in with the vision currently espoused by the NESC. One relates to the need for an energy tax; the Government has talked about this for five years without introducing it. I agree with Deputy Killeen and most other speakers that we should not go back towards high taxation of labour. It did not work and once one takes over 50% of someone's pay packet there is a serious disincentive to enterprise and labour. We do not want that.</P>

      <Col N="860" /> The introduction of an energy tax allows a broadening of the tax base which is not as regressive as the VAT system or other direct taxes but which also has positive environmental effects. The sooner we grasp that nettle and move in that direction, the better for the long-term development of the economy.</P>
    <P>We have also said &ndash; again it goes against the thinking of most other parties in the House &ndash; that we can afford a slightly higher corporation tax rate combined with tax breaks for companies engaged in research and development because what is clearly coming out of the report from NESC and others is that it is those high value added research-based businesses which will benefit our economy over the next 15 to 20 years. We cannot rely on being an assembly or a processing location for multinational companies because we are too expensive to be effective in that function. There are cheaper countries to the east which can do this with much lower wage rates, with better, or certainly equal, infrastructure and with the same low corporation tax, so we will not compete at that level. While that policy has been successful over the last 20 or 30 years, it is time we moved on and recognised we need to do something different. It is perfectly valid on that basis and if we are going to move towards a higher value business model and a higher value research-based one, that we should target our corporation tax towards that by saying one will have a slightly higher corporation tax rate, although still lower than the one we suggest, but slightly higher than the rate after last year's budget. We should match it with research and development grants to try to encourage that type of economic development. That would be a positive step forward and one which would fit into the current NESC vision.</P>
    <P>The other main areas concern infrastructure and spending. When things are going wrong and when the spending we have made has not brought results, we need to go back to the basics. If I have a machine which is broken, I tend to try to break it down to its constituent parts and to go back to the basics. We need to change the basic fundamentals of what we are doing. In that regard, our spending priorities in the main spending areas should go back to the basic services we provide, including the primary health care and primary education systems, to make sure they are working properly and work up from there. In the long run, it is an investment which will pay off best for our society. That is what we espoused last week.</P>
    <P>In regard to other infrastructural spending, we have a vision as to what our economy needs over the next 20 years which is different from that which the Government parties and many of the Opposition parties seem to have. We do not believe building motorways, which can provide capacity for 60,000 passenger vehicles per day when there will only ever be a projected demand of 10,000 or 15,000 passenger vehicles per day, <Col N="861" /> makes economic sense. We believe that in the 21st century, we will move ideas, digital information and high quality, low volume and high priced products. For that we do not need motorways. We need to be able to move people around effectively and we need cities and urban and rural areas which work, so that we can encourage investment into high-quality centres with good education, a good telecommunications infrastructure, good homes, good living conditions and good entertainment and all the other services which make up an attractive city or town. We do not need to spend all our money on massive motorways servicing yesterday's industries rather than tomorrow's, which is effectively what we are doing at the moment.</P>
    <P>I have criticisms of the NESC and the way it works. I criticise the selective and still narrow voices heard within the NESC. They come through when reading the latest reports on whatever area one cares to mention, whether child care or others. Often what one sees is a compromise being reached. Where one member of the NESC has a particularly strong view in an area, it tends to come through strongly.</P>
    <P>In many of the other ancillary areas, I do not believe it is providing a balanced view of what and how Irish society should develop. That is the role of the politicians. We need to be careful we do not abdicate that role. I have a fear that the Government, in its slavish devotion to the partnership process, has ignored this House and the wisdom which comes from 166 people giving their assessment of the collective wisdom. If, over the last five or six years, the Government had not only listened to IBEC or ICTU, which tend to be the dominant forces within the NESC, or certainly on the partnership side, and had listened a little more to politicians and people on the street, it might have heard a message which would have saved us from many of the economic and investment mistakes and would have prevented a lot of money being wasted over the last five years.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as the NESC are useful and the partnership process has served us well in many ways. However, exclusive use of it as the Government's sounding board, which, effectively, it is, to get a sense of what the wrong thing to do is, is not giving the Government the right answer. I listened to the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin, on the radio last Saturday morning and she made a point which perhaps captured the situation. In regard to Government spending on health and other areas over the last two or three years, she said the Government did what it was told &ndash; it threw money at the problem. However, the money was wasted because it was not targeted in the right direction. While it is laudable that the money was spent, it was badly spent and the Government must learn a lesson from that and we must reappraise where we are going collec<Col N="862" /> tively as a people. If we do that, we will have a successful economic future which will be based on green enterprise and technologies which are the technologies of the 21st century. That is where we should be concentrating our economic, social and environmental efforts. I hope the Government will recognise that by putting a much greater environmental slant into the evolving NESC committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Bill is welcome in so far as it will place the National Economic and Social Development Office on a statutory footing. It will comprise three bodies &ndash; the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Form and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. This, in itself, will provide some element of accountability to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives us the opportunity to examine the question of social partnership. We are now in our sixth social partnership. The names of the six programmes over the last 16 years indicate some of the key concerns of the time and they included words such as &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;, &ldquo;progress&rdquo;, &ldquo;work&rdquo;, &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;, &ldquo;partnership&rdquo;, &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo;, &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo;. The notion of fairness came into focus more strongly in recent years but there is a big question mark over the contribution social partnership has made to a just society.</P>
      <P>One of the great failures of the social partnership agreements is the failure of the social partners to force the Government to spread development into the regions. Disadvantage is rampant in the more deprived regions. In a study carried out by UCC, the region from which I come, Duhallow, was identified as one of the most disadvantaged regions in the country, second only to the Inishowen Peninsula in County Donegal, yet Duhallow is in the eastern and southern region and does not have the advantages areas in the BMW region have. The Government had indicated it would try to identify areas in the southern and eastern region as blackspots which would get special priority for consideration in line with the incentives being given to the BMW region. What is worrying is that in the IDA report published recently, the chief executive clearly indicated that he finds it difficult and the IDA will continue to find it difficult to encourage industry into the peripheral regions. I have believed for a long time that the IDA and, to a certain extent, Enterprise Ireland do not have the ability or the enthusiasm to spread industry into the region.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a relatively small country and most of the industry we attract is from the United States. Anywhere in Ireland would be considered close to the main population centres in a United States context, so it is hard to understand the IDA's reasoning and its failure to locate proper and good industries in the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" />We are all aware that farming is in decline and that industry is not being established. Young people are leaving rural areas in droves. It seems that the social partners, like the farming organisations and community groups, do not receive the hearing and attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>Even though decentralisation has continually been promised, absolutely no progress has been made in the areas most in need. Task forces have been set up in various areas where jobs have been lost and have achieved very few results.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest disasters of recent times was the failure of the Government to provide jobs in Macroom. We have repeatedly heard the commitments of the Taoiseach and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, made one week prior to the general election, guaranteeing that there would be new industry for the town. However, despite our best efforts, no progress has been made.</P>
    <P>The stronger organisations in the social partnership, such as the unions and businesses, seem to have all the clout. However, there is no doubt that most observers believe that social partnership laid the basis for the economic boom of the past five years. The 1980s were a disaster for the economy and various groups with vested interests in improving it, mainly the employers and trade unions, felt there must be a better way. Out of this social partnership emerged a consensus that there should be a trade-off between reasonable wage demands and job creation. This was facilitated by the promise of income tax cuts. On balance, the system has worked well. The economy and country as a whole benefited and jobs were created.</P>
    <P>However, as in any deal struck, the strongest tended to be the big winners. Those with good jobs did well, the public service did reasonably well and, generally speaking, business prospered. The problem arose among the weaker sections of our community, which included low-paid, unskilled workers, social welfare recipients, the unemployed and people who had the weakest case at the negotiating table. This was exacerbated by the fact that for the past six years we have had by far the most right wing Government the country has ever seen.</P>
    <P>Everything was done to promote business, keep costs down and increase the labour force by encouraging women back in to work. Some would say that Government policies forced women back into the workplace. The failure of Government to control house prices forced both partners in relationships to work in order to be able to afford a mortgage.</P>
    <P>The national wealth created by social partnerships was evident in budget surplus after budget surplus over the past five years. Had the Government had the good sense to restructure local <Col N="864" /> government and the health services, as well as address properly the needs of the disadvantaged, the process of social partnership would have been a great success. Week after week, we hear that the programmes that helped the weakest in our society are being cut the most. There were drastic cuts in the community employment schemes last year, which affected communities working for young people and the handicapped. The health services are in total disarray and there is no funding for the special educational needs of the disadvantaged. Basic needs, such as home help and essential repairs for the elderly and the disabled person's grant, have all disappeared.</P>
    <P>The findings are clear. The unemployed and low-income groups did not benefit to any extent compared to employers and those in strong employment. CORI cites a study that shows the gap between the top and bottom 20% of households widening over the past eight years. We had and still have a high proportion of low-paid workers, relative to other OECD countries, which has increased from 18% in 1987 to 21% in 1994. Ireland has made some progress in the areas of poverty and general standards of living but it has not reduced the inequalities that have always existed or improved its position in comparison to other western countries.</P>
    <P>How do we really evaluate the real economic advantages of social partnership? D'Art and Turner presented a set of economic indicators that show a continual and rapid growth in the Irish economy since 1987. Real national incomes increased by 54% between 1987 and 1996, compared to an increase of 7% between 1980 and 1987. Unemployment levels reduced from 17.5% in 1987 to 6.2% in 1999. The workforce increased by 41% between 1987 and 1998 and gross average earnings increased by 17%. Looking at these figures alone, there is no doubt that there has been a remarkable improvement in the economy. However, the same report makes it clear that the increase in national wealth is not reflected in an easing of the economic burden for many people.</P>
    <P>Social partnership still involves pronounced inequalities, no change in the status quo and no redistribution of industrial surplus in favour of profits over wages, inflation and increased house prices, the latter being fuelled by redistribution of wealth in favour of the already well off. Social partnership did well in contributing to national wealth and, had there been a socially minded Government for the past six years, the most deserving people and services would have benefited. However, we have a long way to go before we create a just society and I fear we will never do so under a right-wing Government such as that which we now have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the important National Economic and Social Development Office Bill 2002, particularly given <Col N="865" /> that we are at a crossroads in terms of our economic and social development. We seem to be taking the wrong road on strategies to develop our economy, society and the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the contributions of other Deputies and learned much about rural and economic disadvantage; many people seem to focus on urban disadvantage. Ireland is predicted to be the most expensive country in the euro zone by the year's end. One need only consider the rate of inflation. Our ESB bills have increased by &euro;72 and motor tax by 12%. An extra charge of &euro;69.50 has been imposed in respect of ATM and laser cards, &euro;40 has been added to our gas bills and there has been an approved increase of 18% in VHI premia. This is the reality and I hope this debate will generate new ideas to deal with it.</P>
      <P>We need measures to curb consumer price increases. People do not mind paying reasonable prices for quality services. However, they are sick to the teeth of being ripped off each day while the fat cats seem to be laughing all the way to the bank. We need consumer rights and, above all, fairness in prices.</P>
      <P>We must face the reality that we have a major crisis in the area of training and development, and we need new resources for community initiatives. There are fewer places on community employment schemes, budget cuts in FÁS training programmes, the great RAPID programme seems to be under threat and the back-to-work allowance is restricted. The new national economic and social development office will have to take a radical and creative look at these issues and come up with a detailed response based on helping the most needy.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is as follows: To make provision for the establishment of a body to be known as the national economic and social development office comprising three bodies to be known as the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance and such other bodies as the Taoiseach may, by order, establish and to define their functions; to dissolve the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance; and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with the establishment of other bodies within the office and the powers which the Taoiseach has in this regard. We seem to have consensus on this section but we also need decisive leadership. The Taoiseach needs to organise the Cabinet quickly and to set a clear direction on social and economic issues. We need to develop radical strategies to do something about economic and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill sets out the function of the office regarding the role on advising the Taoiseach on strategic matters relevant to economic <Col N="866" /> and social development in the State and how it shall perform these functions. Here we are basically talking about job creation. We need to tap into and see, understand and target resources at the areas of most need. I talk particularly of areas in my own constituency that need investment. Parts of Coolock in Dublin North-Central urgently need investment and new job creation policies.</P>
    <P>As regards strategic matters and social development in the State, the Government should not only listen to the different partners but also pay particular attention to the disability sector? It should hear it and listen to its radical and new ideas, and implement its proposals. For example, let us listen to groups like NAMHI which should be part of this national economic and social development debate. We should listen to its demands for the publication of a rights-based disability Bill. We should agree funding to meet the shortfalls in intellectual disability services this year. We should prioritise funding for disability services with multi-annual budgeting and we should support its demand for the publication of the national intellectual disability database reports immediately. Finally, we should also agree to eliminate waiting lists for services over the next three years.</P>
    <P>These are issues which should be linked to this debate. When looking for funding we should not be afraid to consider serious options. Yesterday I put down a question to the Minister for Finance asking how much revenue would be collected in one year if 50 cent was put on a packet of cigarettes. His answer was &euro;130 million. Yesterday we had protests, and more today, from the disability sector which is seeking a budget in the region of &euro;35 million. We could obtain revenue of &euro;130 million by putting 50 cent on a packet of cigarettes. This kind of idea should be looked at and, in the interest of people who need services, we should not run away from making tough decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 sets out the composition of the centre and the bodies who can nominate the ordinary members of the centre. Let us have more trade union people, more women and a strong community sector involvement. Many people working in the community sector have progressive and creative ideas in regard to social and economic development. As Deputy Eamon Ryan commented earlier, the Government seems only to listen to major groups like IBEC and to exclude other groups. We should listen to all the groups and particularly people on the ground.</P>
    <P>Section 17 sets out the conditions of membership of the various bodies including term of office, designation of chairperson, expenses and reasons a member of a body should be disqualified from being such a member. We need accountability and transparency. Therefore, this is an important section because the question of <Col N="867" /> expenses, etc., must come before taxpayers. This section also states that, in so far as is practicable, the Taoiseach shall ensure an equitable balance between men and women in the composition of a body.</P>
    <P>Section 18 states that a body shall hold as many meetings as may be necessary for the performance of its functions. I add a word of caution. This should not end up as another talking shop where we have meeting after meeting and talks about talks. We need efficiency and new ideas to develop those which will come from the council.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is an opportunity to develop and show we are serious about the equality issue. I have concerns about the phrase &rdquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;. The Taoiseach must be decisive and show leadership on this issue. Equality between men and women is no longer an aspiration but a reality and we need to be proactive on this issue.</P>
    <P>Section 20 outlines the right of the bodies to establish committees and to advise them regarding the performance of any of their functions. Section 22 relates to a prohibition on the disclosure of information save as otherwise provided by law. This states that a person shall not, without the consent of the relevant body, disclose any confidential information obtained by him or her while performing, or as a result of having performed, duties as a member of the body. I stress the importance of confidentiality and respect which are essential to this section. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we must have the quality of professionalism. We need good quality public services but must also have professionalism at all times in dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>Section 23 relates to the appointment of an officer to be known as the chief officer of the office, and the roles and the duties which this person shall carry out. This is an important position and we need the right calibre of person for it. We have many talented people in the country with the ability to carry out the functions regarding section 23.</P>
    <P>Section 25 refers to the appointment of office staff. The office may, in consultation with the bodies concerned, appoint such a number of persons to be members of the staff of the office as it may determine with the consent of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. Again I stress the need to be cautious as the record of the Minister of Finance seems at times to stop our economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Section 27 states that the office, at the request of a body, may from time to time engage consultants and advisers as it may consider necessary for the performance of its functions. We should not get carried away by the words &ldquo;advisers&rdquo; and &ldquo;consultants&rdquo;. Many people now seem to feel that we must have a consultant and adviser. It is essential that we use the talents we have here which do not necessarily have to come at a high <Col N="868" /> price. Consultancy seems to be the new buzzword regarding economic and social development but let us not get carried away on the issue. Let us have common sense but at the same time let us target quality people and bring them into the public service.</P>
    <P>Section 32 outlines the fact that the office should prepare and submit to the Taoiseach for approval, a strategic plan not later than six months after the establishment day of the office and every three years from the submission date of the first statement. The Taoiseach shall, as soon as is practicable after a strategic plan under this section has been approved by him or her, cause a copy of the plan to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. I welcome this section which shows respect for democracy and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 33 relates to the requirement of the office to make a report to the Taoiseach at the end of each financial year on its activities during the year and the Taoiseach shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Each report shall contain information on the activities of the other bodies in the office. The office shall also furnish to the Taoiseach such information regarding income and expenditure in such a form as he or she may from time to time require.</P>
    <P>Section 34 allows that the Taoiseach may dissolve the council, the forum or the centre or any body established under section 7, after consultation with the office and any Minister of the Government who has representation on the body. It is important that the Taoiseach discusses these decisions with the relevant Ministers because in regard to social and economic development, it is important that we have the best people, the people directly involved and the Minister directly concerned. This is covered in section 31.</P>
    <P>Section 41 refers to the transfer of staff and sets out that every person who, on the day immediately before the establishment day, is a member of the staff of a dissolved body shall, on that day, be transferred to and become a member of the staff of the office and in particular, be appointed to serve in the body where previously assigned, unless otherwise agreed. We must have respect for staff and ensure that the right people are put in the right place.</P>
    <P>We need to examine carefully the issue of social partnership because we have taken our eye off the ball in regard to some parts of the community and voluntary sector. There has been much talk about social inclusion but the reality for many has been social exclusion. Despite the fact that there was a major recent debate on disadvantage, there are still many disadvantaged pupils in the inner cities and other parts of the country who feel totally excluded. It is up to us to ensure they get all necessary support. The Government should take such views on board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" />While we are a great nation for talking &ndash; an Irish gift &ndash; we must return to the idea of doing and being actively involved, particularly in regard to the debate on disadvantage. I have seen recent cases of wonderful breakfast clubs in very disadvantaged areas on the north side of Dublin. However, due to problems relating to the threatened community employment schemes, the good quality people looking after and feeding the children concerned are to be moved out of the projects on 30 June, which will ruin the flow of the service. I urge the Government to consider such situations when discussing social and economic development.</P>
    <P>Wonderful programmes such as Early Start, Giving Children an Even Break and others are ongoing in our primary schools. If we intend to continue the economic development of the country, we must develop such programmes. We must also address the massive level of drop-outs at second level. Young people, many very talented, are dropping out and are not being allowed to develop their full potential and make a contribution to our society. I wish to praise many of those who work in this area, particularly resource teachers who work with children at risk and in disadvantaged areas. As I mentioned during a recent Adjournment debate, we should pay such people well and look after them because they are performing a magnificent public service. This must be taken on board in the planning of our economy and society.</P>
    <P>Overall, we must face up to these realities because some in this society appear to be less equal than others. It really sticks in my gut when I hear the phrase &ldquo;it's the economy, stupid&rdquo;, because most of the major political parties in this House have gone down that road. We seem to get carried away with that American phrase. It is not the economy, stupid; it is society, stupid &ndash; it is people. That is what running a country is about and is the way forward in this debate. When people refer to Ireland, they are not talking about an economy but a society. When one talks about social partnership, it is more than a pay deal or Senator Joe O'Toole's agreement, as many people would feel. It must include economic and social development for the most disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    <P>In our discussion on the Bill, we have taken our eye off the ball in regard to poverty and a more detailed analysis must be carried out of the disability factor. The one thing that all people with disabilities in Ireland have in common is the considerable risk that they will experience a high level of poverty. For example, 54.4% of all households headed by an ill or disabled person are living at or below the 60% poverty line. The national rate of unemployment is 4.6%, yet it is estimated that at least 70% of people with a disability are unemployed, an unacceptable situa<Col N="870" /> tion. The extra costs of having a disability are met by people with disabilities themselves.</P>
    <P>Poverty and disability remain linked in Ireland. Tackling this will involve improving the income supports available to people with disabilities. The disability allowance is currently &euro;124.80 per week, while the average industrial wage is &euro;524.92 per week. To make matters more difficult for people with disabilities, inflation was 5% in the first quarter of this year, although I welcome today's figures recording a drop in inflation.</P>
    <P>I call for the disability allowance to become 50% of the average national industrial wage. As a first step towards this goal, disability allowance should be brought into line with the contributory old age pension. Budget 2003 increased the risk of people with disabilities living in poverty. It resulted in a &euro;10 increase to the contributory old age pension and just &euro;6 extra to the disability allowance. As with budget 2002, disability allowance has slipped further away from the old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Government anticipates the annual inflation rate for 2003 to be 4.8%. This will consume &euro;5.70 of the &euro;6 increase, leaving just 30 cent to the person dependent upon disability allowance. However, this 30 cent will be easily consumed by the 1% increase in VAT which will result in an increase in electricity, oil and gas costs. There is no evidence that the budget was either disability or poverty proofed. Budget 2003 strengthened the relationship between disability and poverty.</P>
    <P>When discussing this Bill, we should reflect on the use of our resources. If there is a downturn in the economy, as appears to be the case, we must target our resources to the most needy in our society. The debate on this legislation gives us the opportunity to present radical new ideas to look after the weaker sections of Irish society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill, with which I am quite disappointed. It is a technical Bill, the only purpose of which seems to be the setting up on a statutory basis of three agencies already <i>in situ.</i> The Bill contains nothing new, no vision and no Government view for the future. The Taoiseach's speech on the Bill did not inspire me in any way because there was nothing new in it. The Bill is, however, full of warnings of dire consequences. If the Government does not mend its ways, although the Taoiseach did not say this, we are heading for the rocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated that &ldquo;On the domestic front, economic growth has slowed this year&rdquo;, a fact of which we are aware. Unfortunately, he did not take any responsibility for this, although many commentators would say that the Government's actions have led to many of the difficulties in which we find ourselves. The Taoiseach said that if we do not take action, the consequences <Col N="871" /> are evident in the context of our economic past, most notably the early to mid-1980s. While I agree that action must be taken, I do not see any action being taken except, as the previous speaker said, to impact upon and hurt the weakest in society by cutbacks, as happened in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities protested outside this Parliament today &ndash; people in wheelchairs, people whose legs have been amputated and who have had strokes. Due to Government action and inaction, such people will lose many of the essential services and supports to which they had access. No Minister has yet come forward to say why the Government is cutting the community employment schemes and removing people who are providing a vital service.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said that the issue of competitiveness is absolutely basic and that unless we are competitive, the economy will not thrive. That is self-evident. However, while I am thankful that inflation is reducing slightly, it has in large part been caused by Government action. It would be useful if some Government spokesperson admitted that in order that we could proceed from there. Instead, Ministers are hiding their heads in the sand and pretending that the situation has nothing to do with them and that they are totally innocent. They say that the current situation came about unknown to them, because of what is happening in the US, Europe and elsewhere, and that they are not the cause of it.</P>
    <P>The Government and its predecessor have been in power of six years, therefore, it must take responsibility for the difficulties we have. The Taoiseach goes on to outline the history of the various bodies which have been in existence and addresses the different sections of the Bill. However, there is no vision, nothing new and nothing to inspire people. I call on the Government to take note of that, because people are waiting for real leadership and it is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The three bodies which are to be amalgamated under this Bill, although they will remain as sub-bodies, will have to submit reports to the Oireachtas and may have to come before committees and report to the Taoiseach. However, some Government backbenchers have said they have no real input into this. All of which leads one to sometimes wonder what this Parliament is for. We have discussion and debate but no input. The general debate has centred more and more around the economy, partnership and competitiveness, all of which are important. However, the focus is not sufficiently wide and does not look far enough into the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent establishment of the forum on the workplace of the future by the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, which will commence in the autumn in <Col N="872" /> order to facilitate national discussion with international contributions on how workplaces can best adapt to competitive pressures, improve service delivery and respond to employees' changing needs and preferences. This is important development. However, it does not go far enough because it focuses solely on the workplace. We must broaden it out to take in all of society, as opposed to the workplace alone.</P>
    <P>We must look at the demographics of our population and see what Ireland will be like in 20 years' time and what will be the challenges. No one can realistically say what they will be, but the Finnish Parliament has established a committee for the future. I suggest to the Minister of State, in her role as Government Chief Whip, to consider establishing such a committee, comprising Members of this House and the Seanad. The committee could engage with the National Council for Partnership and Performance and its constituent bodies and invite submissions from experts nationally and internationally. It could have a broad remit and submit a special report on the future to the Dáil, under the Taoiseach's authority, once or twice a term. We are still not looking far enough or wide enough.</P>
    <P>Many contributions to this debate have dwelled on what has happened, with both sides defending their records or attacking those of others. They have also focused on what is happening now and what may happen in the short-term. However, we are not looking far enough ahead and are facing huge changes. We have an ageing population and the numbers in this cohort are increasing because, thankfully, people are living longer. However, this will create huge difficulties for us. A debate has started in some countries about whether people should be given the option of working longer if they wish. Sometimes, when people are asked to remove themselves from the workforce at 65 years, they do not want to do so. It is a wrench and they would prefer to ease themselves out in a graduated manner.</P>
    <P>Looking after older people will be a huge challenge for our society. It is something we must address and we should be talking about it now. If, for instance, we had examined our traffic problems properly 15 or 20 years ago, we would have been able to plan properly for now, but we did not &ndash; it is all short-term thinking. Even now, it seems there is the potential for a major problem at the Red Cow roundabout. We are not even looking that far ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister for State has a great personal interest and expertise in the information society, which has the potential to change the way we work, act and interact and is doing so already. The Government plans to increase the information society initiative and have national broadband access. There are many other developments which we cannot yet imagine which will require change. However, we could have a major digital <Col N="873" /> divide between those who can use information technology and those who cannot. We must examine this issue because, if we are not careful, we could create a new poor. Information and intelligence, in the sense of knowledge versus competence, will be extremely important.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to examine the initiatives of the Finnish Government. Perhaps, while this Bill is before the House, she might have a discussion with the Taoiseach and set about establishing an Oireachtas committee which would have a broad remit. It would not consider legislation, but would act as a think tank. There would be a political input into the deliberations of many esteemed bodies and agencies, one of which would be that proposed by this Bill. It would not be sufficient for this group to interact with the Oireachtas once a year, just by coming in for a cosy chat. We need to do more than that. During the passage of many Bills, I have stated that there is a danger that the House could become almost redundant &ndash; a mere rubber stamp for legislation.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties with the social partnership model, some of which the Fine Gael Party leader, Deputy Kenny, highlighted in his speech. The model has been advantageous, but we must examine it to see if there are better ways and see if it has outlived its usefulness.</P>
    <P>We need to involve younger people even more in the work of the national economic and social development office. I caution against the office becoming remote. We receive numerous reports, many of which we do not have time to read, analyse or assess. I ask that the reports be made as concise as possible and that long-winded verbiage is cut out. Let us get to the meat of it, the nitty-gritty and the basic points.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for State outline in detail what the three constituent parts &ndash; the council, forum and centre &ndash; will actually do? The Bill is vague about their functions and I would like to see them spelled out in far greater detail &ndash; perhaps even in the Bill itself &ndash; without being too restrictive. Perhaps the Minister of State will give us an overview of the duties of these three bodies and how they will operate.</P>
    <P>More young people should be involved in the board of this body. There could be an age quota, similar to a gender quota. There are, however, arguments for and against quotas. People should be appointed to boards because they are competent more than anything else. We should, however, involve young people because we are planning for their future and they have a vision for it that we do not have.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Government's lack of provision of funding for the implementation of the Youth Work Act 2000. The Minister of State was concerned about this but the Act has been starved of funds and, as a result, many people in the youth work sector are becoming disillusioned. <Col N="874" /> In Australia, great value is placed on the input young people can make to policy and there should be a formal avenue here whereby young people can make an input into the National Economic and Social Development Office. Older people should also be involved.</P>
    <P>There is more to society than just the economy. We must recognise that we are dealing with people. The Government concentrates on economics and spends too much time looking at statistics and figures. Before the election it promised too much money to get re-elected and now it is cutting back. We were told there would be no cuts but now we find the opposite is true and the Government knew that at the time. The weakest are suffering as a result.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the National Economic and Social Development Office should be a good thing. The people who are already in it have been working hard but I would like to see their remit widened and a parliamentary committee established to support them in their work. That would bring the office into the political arena so it can be discussed and it would help us to look further into the future to see what society will need in 20 years' time. It has been done successfully in Finland and we should consider doing the same here.</P>
    <P>I look forward to seeing the amendments that will be made to the Bill. It is good that this debate is taking place and that so many Deputies are interested in contributing to it. This office will have a major impact on social development and it is only right to give the Bill proper consideration. It will be influential but we need political input into it. There should be greater oversight by and interaction with the political sphere. The partnership model has excluded the political arena from the debate. Many of the decisions are made behind closed doors and this House has no role. Parliaments are established to debate issues in public so that the public can have an input. When policies are discussed behind closed doors, the public is excluded and democracy is at risk.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach should look at reform of this House and how it conducts its business. The Ceann Comhairle hints at this everyday and says that if Members bring forward proposals, he will implement them. I believe that he feels that our procedures are archaic and out of date. We need to change the way we do business. Before the last election a package of reforms was agreed and it should be discussed to see how we can improve the operation of the House. If this House becomes irrelevant, fewer people will vote.</P>

Caithfidh sé gníomh a dhéanamh ar na fadhbanna má tá aon réiteach le fáil orthu.</P>
      <P>The problem with this Bill is that it is organised around what is called partnership. Partnership is a fraud from start to finish and has been a fraud since 1987 when it was first institutionalised. Partnership is a misuse of the English language just like those going to war in different circumstances misused the English language by covering up their crimes with fancy words. Partnership is not partnership at all. The figures I received from the Central Statistics Office, to which I alluded previously, show clearly the fraud that partnership is because it is nothing more than an arrangement to hold wages and salaries to a very restricted level of increase but imposes no restrictions whatsoever on rent interest, profit and speculative gain. Therefore is it any wonder that in the cold light of day we find that in 1987 the amount of the gross national product spent on wages and salaries, in other words going to the working class, was 59% and profits and rents accounted for 41%. Some 14 years later in 1981, the amount going to the workers had fallen to 46% while the amount going to the capitalists and the rack-renters had risen to 54%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under cover of partnership there was a huge shift of wealth from the working people to the <Col N="877" /> corporate sector, the finance sector and speculators. Therefore this elaborate Bill which will bring together three organisations within this national office covers up the reality. While it is true that the National Economic and Social Forum, which is being dissolved in this Bill but presumably will take on new life in the new arrangement, has done some useful studies on the economic and social realities for working people and poor people, unfortunately when its recommendations are somewhat radical the Government decides to ignore them and carry on with its usual policies.</P>
    <P>When it came to one of the running sores in society, that of the accommodation crisis, which is considered a basic human right, and the measures proposed in reports emanating from the forum, for example, to tackle the price of building land to cut across speculation, the Government did not lift a finger. During the six years in which it has been in office the price of a home in Dublin has trebled and quadrupled in some cases. The question that comes to mind is whether the organisations being set up under the ambit of the National Economic and Social Development Office will be merely window-dressing affairs in order that the Government can give the illusion of partnership while continuing the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats policy where the wealth continues to shift from the workers to the minority who controls the corporate sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the matter of the near disaster which occurred at Mulhuddart, Dublin, a couple of days ago. Barrels fell from a lorry and discharged dangerous amounts of nitric acid into the atmosphere. Luckily, there appear to have been very limited casualties, but the accident happened close to a school and a community centre and in the vicinity of many thousands of houses. The spill was also close to the River Tolka which means there could have been an environmental disaster. The local authority and emergency services dealt with the spill quickly and I thank them for their hard work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight, I call on Fingal County Council and, more specifically, on the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to review as a matter of urgency the traffic arrangements on Church Road, Mulhuddart. Can the Minister state clearly if there is any enforcement of safety regulations relating to the transport of dangerous chemicals? What happened this week was, in many ways, an <Col N="878" /> accident waiting to happen. A similar incident occurred within the last month on one of the approaches to the M50. Over recent years, many chemical companies have opened in the industrial estates around Dublin 15 which are located beside many thousands of homes. While the planning and safety aspects of the plant installations are carefully regulated, it appears that no attention is being paid by enforcement authorities to the transportation of chemicals. The transportation of dangerous chemicals must be regulated carefully to prevent accidents such as the one under discussion. My understanding is that regulations exist which may well need to be updated, but there appears to be no sign of enforcement.</P>
    <P>Residents in the area have complained for many years of heavy lorries using this particular road. In recent years, several thousand new homes have been built in the area at Castlecurragh, Tyrellstown and elsewhere. The area has also seen the development of substantial industrial estates, including Damastown, where there are a number of chemical companies. Also located nearby is the IBM campus.</P>
    <P>An inquiry by the Minister for Transport is required to discover how such dangerous chemicals were being carried in a large residential area in what was effectively an open-sided lorry with curtains on both sides. The council has been talking for the last ten years about introducing traffic calming measures on the narrow country road on which the accident happened. It has also proposed closing the road to lorries and providing alternative routes. In ten years very little has happened. The road's development is ongoing, but there is no replacement route yet available. This is typical of much infrastructural development in Dublin 15. While the houses and the industrial estates have come, the infrastructure of roads, public transport and schools has been slow to develop.</P>
    <P>The lorry in this case seems to have been travelling to a local chemical plant, but in many instances lorries use Mulhuddart and Church Road, in particular, as a rat-run to avoid the M50 toll bridge. In other cases lorries are using back roads from Finglas to run more quickly across to Lucan and the west. The accident has raised serious questions about the management of lorries in the greater Dublin area. Is there a protocol regarding lorry movements in Dublin other than the three tonne restriction signs on smaller roads? As industrial estates and housing developments are so often side by side as a result of current planning and development, small roads are being utilised by inappropriate vehicles. A serious review of the matter is called for. There appears to be no protocol or agreement among local authorities and the Department in relation to these important issues.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, the damage and casualties from <Col N="879" /> this incident appear to have been limited. However, I ask the Minister to look at the issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to raise with Deputy Burton this important matter. Once it was appropriate to inspect the area without interruption to the emergency personnel coping with the spillage of nitric acid in Mulhuddart, I examined the site in some detail. I was quite horrified by what I established from the incident. The truck, which was still <i>in situ</i> and still had four barrels of nitric acid on board, had only canvas sides and the barrels were not fastened to the body of the vehicle. Furthermore, the plastic barrels of nitric acid were sitting on wooden pallets which allowed them to shift easily if the truck negotiated a roundabout and tilted as a result. This was an incident waiting to happen.</P>
      <P>As the truck was carrying nitric acid, it was obliged by law to display the chemical's code prominently on the back of the vehicle to allow emergency services to identify immediately what they were dealing with. From what I could see, no such code was displayed and the code which was displayed indicated that the truck was transporting a multimix of chemicals which is a further violation. I thank the emergency services who did a good job. This was a serious incident, but it could have been much worse. Quite a number of people were taken to hospital for observation, but, happily, no one was admitted. That could have been different if school had been out at the time and hundreds of children were crossing at that point on their way home. The acid ran down the hill in the direction of the Tolka River and if it had been raining, a stream of surface water would have carried it in and created a drastic scenario. Is this common practice on roads in Dublin 15 and elsewhere? Can the Minister outline the regulations available to the authorities to protect communities and the travelling public on public roads in this regard? Can the Minister outline the steps, if any, taken on a routine basis to ensure that trucks carrying chemicals or dangerous materials are complying with regulations and are not putting lives at risk?</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of industry in this area. The truck owner had an address in Robin Hood Industrial Estate in south-west Dublin but the delivery was going to a local facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ten years since elected councillors secured a three tonne weight limit on traffic on Mulhuddart bridge, although on this occasion the truck did not go over the bridge. The authorities have refused to implement the limit. The first excuse was that the M50 was not open. When it was open they still refused to implement it. This entirely inappropriate heavy traffic, therefore, continues to use roads that were built for horses and carts. <Col N="880" /> Further measures must be taken to ensure this is stopped.</P>
    <P>These materials need to be transported on roads, whether it is on larger public roads or, in some cases, on by-roads when they are the only route into an industrial estate. However, we need assurances that the working class community in Dublin 15 and similar communities throughout the country are protected from cowboy operators who act in such a way that incidents such as yesterday's occur, resulting in serious risk to people's lives and health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday, 10 June 2003 at approximately 9.15 a.m., an incident took place in Mulhuddart involving a Scania 40 foot curtain sided vehicle which lost a number of 205 litre drums of nitric acid on approach to a roundabout at Church Road, Mulhuddart. It appears that four of the drums ruptured on impact with the ground, resulting in a loss of approximately half of the contents of each drum. The Tánaiste wishes to express the concern of the Government at the seriousness of this incident and the potential for injury and loss of life. Thankfully, the situation was not worse and the Tánaiste wishes a speedy recovery to those who were injured.</P>
      <P>The initial response to the incident came from the fire services and the Garda Síochána. I understand that the first fire tender was on the scene at 9.20 a.m. and the gardaí were on the scene at 9.27 a.m. The Health and Safety Authority was first made aware of the incident at 10.15 a.m. The authority confirmed the incident details with the gardaí to initiate its investigation into the incident in accordance with the relevant provisions of the main legislation concerned. It should be noted that responsibilities attach to a number of other statutory bodies, including the gardaí, the fire services and the relevant local authority, which were involved both in responding to this incident and in its aftermath. The role of the Health and Safety Authority represents only one element of any general emergency response to an incident such as this.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste does not have ministerial responsibility for those other statutory bodies and she is not in a position to comment on the actions undertaken by these bodies or on their specific role in relation to this incident. However, the authority is liaising with the Garda Síochána and the fire services. The relevant safety legislation is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act 1998 and the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transport of dangerous goods by road is a highly regulated activity. The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 2001, SI 492 of 2001, made under the Carriage of Danger<Col N="881" /> ous Goods by Road Act 1998, apply to the carriage, both in bulk and in packages, of dangerous goods by road, including the loading and unloading of the dangerous goods in regard to their carriage. They give effect to the United Nations convention, referred to as the ADR international agreement, on the transport of dangerous goods by road and relevant EU directives and set out a comprehensive framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by road. The regulations are currently being updated to give effect to the 2003 version of the ADR agreement.</P>
    <P>The regulations impose duties on the consignor and on the carrier of the dangerous goods and on the driver of the vehicle carrying the goods. They contain requirements for the vehicles, tanks, tank containers, receptacles and packages containing the dangerous goods during their carriage. They require that the drivers and others involved in the carriage of the dangerous goods by road, including their loading and unloading, be adequately trained and, in the case of drivers, hold certificates of such training. They also contain provisions on an EC harmonised approach to the road checks aspect of their enforcement.</P>
    <P>In general, the duties of consignors and carriers include that goods must be stowed and secured in a manner which precludes any loss of contents, packaging must be labelled in accordance with ADR requirements, written instructions must be provided to the driver and the driver must understand these. The duties of the driver include not driving unless trained; safeguarding the goods in transport; and ensuring the safe operation of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is undertaking a detailed investigation into the circumstances of the incident. The focus of the investigation is to determine whether the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 2001 were complied with in this case. Deputies will understand that the Tánaiste cannot comment further on the case or speculate on possible causes or factors pending the outcome of that investigation and any possible action that may be necessary thereafter.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús báire mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Cheann Chomhairle as cead a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a árdú anocht. My original motion on the Adjournment dealt with the health and safety aspects of school furniture <i>vis-à-vis</i> back problems caused by bad chair design as well as the problem in my constituency where Swords Educate Together national school has had to operate to date with furniture handed down from other schools throughout the country. The Department did not provide any furniture for the school, thereby leaving 60 children with the prospect of having no <Col N="882" /> school furniture in September. However, since tabling the motion I received a call from the Department of Education and Science to say that the furniture needs of the school have now been sanctioned. I welcome this and hope the commitment will be acted upon quickly.</P>
      <P>However, another question must be addressed. Why do almost all schools have chairs which experts in the Alexander technique for posture and back pain condemn as the cause of back pain? One in two adults in Ireland and the UK has back problems. The early symptoms occur in childhood during the primary school years. I understand the problems with the ISO 140, which are based on a UK standard, are the cause. In this case, it is permitted for schools to have seats where the rake, which is the part on which the child sits, slopes back so the child is forced away from the books on the table and must lean forward. The Department of Education and Science needs to establish a standard whereby the rake will not slope back.</P>
      <P>Remedial action can be taken with many chairs. A block of wood can be put beneath the back legs of the chair or a wedge shaped cushion can be used to level the chair. This problem causes more than just back pain. It also eventually causes respiratory problems, can contribute to coronary problems and is a major factor in days lost at work as a result of backache throughout adult life. It is interesting to look at what happened in Japan. Until the 1980s schoolchildren sat on cushions and the level of back problems experienced was half that in the West. Since then, however, the Japanese have westernised and now use chairs. The prevalence of the back pain problem has increased to 50%, affecting one in every two children, according to research I have carried out.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to ensure that this issue, which I raised with the Minister for Education and Science in September 2002, is dealt with. I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter and also mentioned the problem of heavy schoolbags. The Department has established a working group to deal with the schoolbags issue. The Minister's reply did not mention school furniture and simply discussed the weight of schoolbags. From a health point of view, there is clearly an oversight or blind spot in the Department about this matter. I am anxious to ensure that the Minister will at least agree to a meeting with an expert in back pain, posture and the Alexander technique. The Department must set down a clear standard whereby children will get the type of school furniture that will not damage their backs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting was held with the Department on this matter but the Department is effectively passing the buck to the boards of management. That is not good enough. This Government is responsible for doing what is within its control to promote the health and preventative health care <Col N="883" /> of people, and it has control over the standards set down for school furniture and should determine the standard.</P>
    <P>My correspondent, who is an expert on the Alexander technique, informed me that the Minister has written to him and put him in touch with the planning and building unit of the Department. He had a meeting with the Department. He took his son, who suffers from back pain on account of this problem, and his school chair into the meeting. The Department agreed that the chair was a wrong design, even though it was within the specifications allowed by the Department, is on the approved list and so on. However, the Department informed him that although it would recommend certain chairs, many schools buy chairs that are not recommended by the Department and that it has no authority to tell any school what chairs to buy.</P>
    <P>After nearly a year of correspondence with the Minister he feels he is back to square one, with his son still complaining of worsening back problems caused directly by his school chair, which even the Department of Education and Science would advise against. He would greatly appreciate any help in setting up a meeting between himself and an official of the Department or the Minister, who has the authority to sort out this issue as soon as possible. This matter is going to cost the country into the future and it can be resolved. It is not a difficult problem but it requires the Department to act.</P>

I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position in regard to the allocation of funding under the schools capital programme, which includes a provision for furniture. The Deputy will appreciate that health and safety issues are, in the first instance, matters for the boards of management of each school, and this includes ensuring that school furniture complies with the appropriate standards.</P>
      <P>The 2003 capital programme which the Minister for Education and Science published earlier this year provides full details regarding individual projects and the information may be obtained from the Department's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects has also been published for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million &ndash; four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary levels. In addition, over 400 schools will <Col N="884" /> benefit in some way from the capital programme and all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works. The Department of Education and Science will continue to assess individual applications for grant aid towards the purchase of furniture in light of the funds available and having regard to the demands and the priority to be afforded to individual applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister for accepting this matter.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's boys' national school, Athy, has 206 pupils from second to sixth class. The board of management has a number of major problems at present, both structural and educational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is a need for urgent repairs to the basic facilities in the school that would permit the staff and pupils to have their basic needs addressed. At present an endless list of problems <Col N="885" /> exists that make this school unacceptable, to all intents and purposes, as a proper place of education. These items include the need for door replacement, electrical work, roof repairs, refurbishment of toilets, replacement of windows, window blinds and so on. A number of the toilets do not work and the blinds are such that they cannot be operated. The list is endless in this regard and all of this must be addressed as a matter or urgency.</P>
    <P>From an education point of view, the school does not have the same entitlement in regard to status as its fellow primary school in the town, scoil Mhichil Naofa or, indeed, St. Brigid's post-primary school. I would be very grateful for a breakdown of the entitlements at present afforded to scoil Mhichil Naofa in regard to special teaching staff, funding and support and for the same information on St. Brigid's post-primary school.</P>
    <P>I would also be grateful for the Minister of State's comments in relation to the discrepancies <i>vis-à-vis</i> the three schools. What criteria has the Department of Education and Science regarding such matters in other locations where there is a similar pattern to Athy? Have all those schools equal opportunities regarding teaching staff, facilities and so on or is Athy unique in that one primary school and one secondary school have such facilities while a third school, the boys' primary school, is way down the list in terms of such facilities?</P>
    <P>While one welcomes the facilities that scoil Mhichil Naofa and St. Brigid's have attained, I understand they are seeking further support mechanisms regarding teacher facilities and so on and for improvements to school infrastructure. I fully support their applications, just as I supported previous applications for other facilities.</P>
    <P>Athy was designated RAPID status in the past year. However, there has been no progress in regard to assisting this school in obtaining parity with its sister schools in the town despite the fact that it involves the same catchment area, pupils and so on. This is discrimination by the Department. It is totally unacceptable and must be addressed by the Minister as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>There has been a proposal to align St. Patrick's national school and scoil Mhichil Naofa. However, there is no possibility of this occurring due to the catch-22 situation faced by the board of management of St. Patrick's, whereby the basic facilities needed to provide for a co-educational situation for boys and girls, such as proper toilets and so on, are not available in the school. Due to the serious nature of the present position and the health problems this creates for the pupils and staff of the school, the problem in regard to the furniture must be addressed irrespective of the alignment proposal.</P>
    <P>This situation can be resolved, given the determination of the staff, the board of management <Col N="886" /> and the parents' council of the school. However, the Minister must play his part and provide the funding to refurbish the school and address the serious discrimination that exists between the schools by providing St. Patrick's with the necessary teaching and support staff to allow everyone to play a part in providing proper educational facilities at the school.</P>

I thank the Deputy for raising this matter since it affords me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position regarding the application received in the Department of Education and Science's planning and building unit for refurbishment and remedial works at St. Patrick's national school in Athy, County Kildare, and also the school's application for inclusion in the new disadvantaged programme.</P>
      <P>The school in question caters for boys only and is one of three primary schools serving the needs of Athy. The other schools are scoil Mhichil Naofa, which caters for co-education from junior infants to first class and girls only from second to sixth class, and Athy model school, which caters for the Church of Ireland community.</P>
      <P>An application to upgrade and refurbish facilities at St. Patrick's national school has been received in the Department. A similar application has been received from the school management authorities of scoil Mhichil Naofa. Both applications are under consideration in the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science. This process involves the consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends in the area and the overall accommodation requirements of the centre. As part of this process the possibility of the realignment of St. Patrick's and scoil Mhichil Naofa is being explored. It is envisaged that this realignment would take the form of junior and senior co-educational schools.</P>
      <P>A meeting between the boards of management and trustee representatives of both schools and officials of the planning section of the Department was held in Tullamore on 20 May to discuss the proposed realignment. It was agreed that the boards of management of the two schools would meet to discuss the matter further and any matters for clarification or decisions reached would be conveyed to the Department of Education and Science. Pending the outcome of these discussions, the Department is unable to further progress the individual applications for capital grant aid at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the status of St. Patrick's school and disadvantage, the position, as the Deputy may be aware, is that Giving Children and Even Break was launched in 2001 to tackle educational <Col N="887" /> disadvantage at primary level. Schools participating in Giving Children and Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre in March and April of 2000 at the request of the Department of Education and Science. All of the schools identified as having pupils enrolled with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
    <P>Giving Children an Even Break has both an urban and rural dimension, as previous research has shown that educational disadvantage manifests itself differently in urban and rural settings. Scoil Phádraig Naofa is included in the urban dimension and is benefiting from the allocation of supplementary grant aid towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned over the three year period. The school has been allocated a total of &euro;3,205.61 for the 2002-03 school year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" />Schools categorised as urban in Giving Children an Even Break with the highest concentration of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are being supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement reduced pupil-teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and 27:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth class. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>Representations from schools regarding the outcome of the survey carried out in 2000 from schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, were referred by the Department of Education and Science to the Educational Research Centre for consideration. Following this process, the school authorities were informed in October 2002 that they did not qualify for any increase in the existing level of support provided under Giving Children an Even Break. The Department has received a further submission but, unfortunately, the appeals process is now complete. However, the points raised in the school's new submission will be considered in the context of any future disadvantage programmes in the country.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 13 June 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics for the first quarter of 2003 released by the CSO today show that Ireland has more or less held its own with a slight decrease in overall visitor numbers of 0.3% compared with the same period last year. Foreign revenue earnings from tourism increased by almost 10%.</P>
      <P>In such adverse market conditions, these figures represent a good performance by Irish tourism and are evidence that we are maintaining our position in a volatile marketplace. Despite the obvious difficulties, there appears to have been a good performance from the US, German, French and Spanish markets in particular. The British market, which has experienced a marked decrease in all outbound traffic this year, has shown some softening in visitor numbers to Ireland &ndash; although market reports suggest that Ireland may be gaining market share.</P>
      <P>It would be unwise, given the volatility of the international tourism market, to make any predictions for the year as a whole on the basis of figures for the first quarter. The pattern of very short booking times, which became evident over the past few years, is continuing. However, it is clear that 2003 is proving to be yet another testing year for Irish tourism. The Iraqi war, the spread of SARS and a continuing sluggishness in the economies of our main source markets have all combined to produce a difficult international marketing environment.</P>
      <P>While no specific study has been undertaken into the impact of the Iraqi war on tourism numbers, the tourism agencies, working in conjunction with the industry, have been monitoring the market situation very closely over recent months. Based on their assessment, both the anticipation of the conflict and the onset of war resulted in a marked softening in the level of advance bookings over the two months in question which may be difficult to recover over the remaining months of the year.</P>
      <P>However, with the ending of the Iraqi conflict and an upturn in consumer confidence in some key markets, particularly the US, there is some cause for optimism going forward. The appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and sterling over recent times is also a cause for concern for the tourism sector. While this is unlikely to impact on the cost of holiday packages to Ireland this year, US and British tourists to Ireland will experience a noticeable deterioration in their spending power when they arrive. The key challenge for the industry will be to ensure that overseas visitors continue to get the best possible value for their money on the ground, relative to other eurozone countries. The appreciation of the euro does, of course, impact on all eurozone countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" />With an unprecedented level of Exchequer resources available for tourism marketing this year, Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland are implementing a strong and sustained campaign of marketing activities aimed at capitalising on the upturn in consumer confidence in the wake of the Iraqi conflict. The marketing programmes for Britain, continental Europe and the US have all been cranked up over the last number of weeks in order to ensure that Ireland remains very much to the fore in the minds of those people who may be finalising their holidays plans for the summer and autumn. For my part, I have been actively supporting the marketing and promotion effort in the field with visits to Germany, Britain and France earlier this year and an upcoming week long visit to the east and west coasts of the US at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>With strong indications that business is still there to be won, the tourism agencies remain quietly optimistic and are as yet unwilling to review the target growth rate of 5% in overseas visitor numbers to Ireland. With such adverse conditions prevailing in the international marketplace, the achievement of this target would be remarkable and a strong endorsement of the resilience of the Irish tourism product. With the improvement in air access this year, a more flexible approach to the deployment of marketing funds and the maintenance of an active presence in key markets for the balance of the year, Ireland should be well placed to benefit from the anticipated upturn in the international market over the remainder of the year. As long as the sector maintains competitiveness, Irish tourism can continue to win good tourism business this year.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs administers funding for the development of the offshore islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under my Department's national lottery-funded sports capital programme, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. It is open to organisations on offshore islands to apply for funding under the programme if they have suitable projects. The 2003 programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 25 April. In excess of 1,300 applications were received before the <Col N="892" /> closing date, none of which were from organisations located on off-shore islands. All applications under the programme are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>
    <P>My Department also administers the local authority swimming pool programme and the closing date for receipt of applications under the current programme was July 2000. No applications were received under the local authority swimming pool programme in respect of offshore islands.</P>
    <P>The creation of local partnerships as envisaged by Government and the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was incorporated by the Irish Sports Council in its statement of strategy, 2000-02. This sets out the pathway which will be followed by the council in the creation of such partnerships as a means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council, following the receipt of proposals from local bodies approved and funded the establishment of eight partnerships in May 2001 and a further four were established in early 2002. These are located in Clare, Donegal, Fingal, Kildare, Laois, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary North, Cork, Limerick, Meath and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Offshore islands can avail of the supports from the local sports partnerships established in their counties. The Sports Council has carried out a review of the existing partnerships. This review is now being examined in my Department and the question of approving additional partnerships will be addressed as part of that examination.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Fáilte Ireland, formerly CERT, recently launched &ldquo;The Green Agenda &ndash; The Challenge for Irish Tourism &amp; Hospitality&rdquo;, a major study on the increased importance of environmental issues for the Irish tourism industry and their practical implications for the individual firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of the environment is at the heart of Ireland's attraction as a tourist destination and the objective of securing an environmentally sustainable tourism sector is clearly articulated in the strategy statement for my Department, published recently. Achievement of this objective is being pursued through the tourism marketing and prod<Col N="893" /> uct development policies agreed with, and implemented by, the tourism agencies. Both Tourism Ireland Limited and Fáilte Ireland regard spatially balanced tourism as a key component of their marketing strategies, with an appropriate emphasis on both seasonal and geographical spread of business.</P>
    <P>This concept is reflected in Fáilte Ireland's tourism product development scheme where the overall objective is to develop the tourism product in an environmental and sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the Border midland and western region's share of national overseas tourism revenue. This will be achieved by concentrating support on a limited number of new visitor attractions, on marketable clusters of existing day visitor attractions that have yet to achieve their full tourism potential, on a series of special interest activities to meet identified niche markets and on specific tourism and the environment initiatives in the more established tourism areas.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that there are considerable benefits to be gained for both the individual enterprise and the industry as a whole in implementing best practice environmental management. Such benefits include a decrease in costs, the reduction of waste, the opening up of potential new markets, and the benefits for individual enterprises associated with having a socially responsible attitude to the environment.</P>
    <P>The challenge for the Irish tourism and hospitality industry now is to implement sustainable tourism initiatives at local and at national level while at the same time maintaining overall competitiveness. In this it will have the full support of Fáilte Ireland who will be seeking to redress the major barriers to the greening of Irish tourism through the implementation of initiatives identified under the recent study.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department works with a wide range of other Departments and agencies through various mechanisms in the formulation and implementation of policies and initiatives, <Col N="894" /> which impact on young people. For example, my Department was represented at very senior level on the interdepartmental committee which shaped the national children's strategy and is also represented on a number of working groups established by the Department of Health and Children in relation to the complementary role of sport and physical activity in areas such as cardiovascular health and the national children's play strategy.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, one of the bodies under the aegis of my Department, the Irish Sports Council, has identified young people as an important target group in which levels of sports participation should be increased. One important development in 2000 was the launch of the code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland which was disseminated to all sports clubs in the country. The principles contained in the code, namely, fair play, enjoyment and a commitment to maintaining a child-focus, are the keystones of the council's future work in relation to sport for young people. In the Sports Council's new strategy for 2003-05 sport for life, one of the key areas highlighted is sport for young people. The main objective in this regard is to get more young people to participate in sport at school and in their local community, to ensure that children have an enjoyable introduction to sport, that they see sport as part of their daily lives and get an opportunity to enhance their skills. The council will work in partnership with the Department of Education and Science and the network of local sports partnerships to increase participation in sport.</P>
      <P>In relation to the arts, co-ordination and liaison mechanisms are established as the need arises. For example, an interdepartmental committee on public art chaired by my Department and including representatives of the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Office of Public Works is currently working to produce guidelines in this important area. The aim is to introduce people of all ages to the professional arts by providing exposure to the creative process in public buildings.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, one of the stated objectives of the Arts Council, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is to broaden and enrich participation in the arts and it is committed to assisting artists to work with communities, with young people and with schools.</P>
      <P>The Government and I fully acknowledge that the creation of an environment in which there is wide-ranging participation in sporting activities and access to the arts and our cultural heritage, can exercise a positive influence on the physical and mental well being of young people in our society and I believe that there is satisfactory interdepartmental co-operation to achieve this objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>As and from 28 May 2003, Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited were dissolved and replaced by the National Tourism Development Authority, to be know operationally as Fáilte Ireland. The legislation to provide for the establishment of the new National Tourism Development Authority, the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, was signed into law by Uachtarán na hÉireann on 13 April 2003. On 21 May 2003, I announced the membership of the authority and signed an order designating 28 May 2003 as its establishment day. Under the terms of the legislation, dissolution of Bord Fáilte and CERT was an automatic consequence of the establishment of the authority.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to have the opportunity to address the first meeting of the authority, which was held in Dublin Castle, on its establishment day. In my address, I made a number of points. Given that we must continually update the nature and quality of our tourism product to meet evolving consumer demands, I asked the authority to bring an enhanced strategic focus to its product development functions. I conveyed to the authority the view expressed by several Deputies, which I share, that the authority should consider working in a more intensive way with tourism operators, particularly SMEs, to help them achieve what efficiencies they can and also to organise themselves to best exploit the opportunities available to them.</P>
      <P>The joint Bord Fáilte Éireann-CERT Group, which laid the groundwork for the merger earlier last year, recommended that the authority have a strong environmental focus which was well integrated with its product development function. I support that recommendation. There is a need for balance, common sense and mutuality of interests to be established in debates on tourism and the environment, particularly on sensitive issues. I expressed the hope that the authority will be a force to facilitate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism policy review group has recently issued its interim report. I asked the authority to pursue some key issues from that report which it could drive forward straight away. Tourism does not exist in isolation. I told the authority that I considered it a key part of its remit to make authoritative inputs to help both myself and my <Col N="896" /> Department to influence wider policy areas of critical importance to tourism.</P>
    <P>Corporate governance is assuming major importance in the public sector and I asked the authority to implement the new framework for corporate governance which was formulated earlier this year. The authority will now commence work under its chief executive, Shaun Quinn, on the drawing up of corporate and operational plans to guide its activities over the coming years.</P>
    <P>In relation to staffing, the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003 made provision for all Bord Fáilte and CERT staff to transfer automatically to Fáilte Ireland on establishment day. Section 35 of the Act provides for the transfer of the existing staff of Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited to the new authority on terms and conditions no less favourable than those to which they were subject immediately beforehand. This provision is a powerful guarantee, which delivers a very high level of security to those involved and reflects a promise which I made to union representatives when I met them late last year.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ongoing discussions between management and staff representatives, the agreed facilitator adjourned talks on 23 May without agreement on all issues. I am glad to report that talks are due to resume again this afternoon, under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House on 28 May last, a dedicated national conference centre would be a desirable addition to our international conference infrastructure. Deputies will appreciate that a project of this scale, complexity and cost required very detailed and careful examination with the result that consultations with other Departments have only very recently been completed. I am currently finalising my submission to Cabinet to reflect the outcome of those consultations and I expect that a Government decision on the project will be taken in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Major international specialist events can present significant marketing opportunities for a variety of commercial interests. Over many years, Bord Fáilte took advantage of the opportunities provided by several major international sporting events &ndash; international golfing events being a classic example &ndash; to market Ireland as both a general tourism destination and also as a sports tourism destination, as well as attracting visitors to Ireland in their own right.</P>
      <P>Many major international sporting events will not just be funded by gate receipts but by a variety of commercial income streams. These will arise from leasing retail-catering space, marketing stands, merchandising deals, sale of advertising, hospitality etc. To be held at all, many major sporting events will have to be able to put forward a credible package of marketing opportunities and be able sell these to serious commercial players.</P>
      <P>This is a very specialised area and, in order to exploit some of the opportunities which it presents and to have an efficient, streamlined and transparent system for Bord Fáilte's participation in such events, the international sports tourism initiative was launched by the Government in 2000. Following the recent dissolution of Bord Fáilte, responsibility for implementation of the scheme has been taken over by the new National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland.</P>
      <P>Although it has a ring-fenced allocation under Fáilte Ireland's budget, the Initiative is not a traditional grant scheme. Essentially, it is a framework which governs Fáilte Ireland's participation in commercial relationships with event organisers. Fáilte Ireland is paying for a set of benefits which the event organisers guarantee to provide. If the events do not deliver the benefits promised, a certain portion of the payment may be withheld and the prospects for future marketing investments by Fáilte Ireland diminished.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative there has been investment in the staging of 46 international sporting events over the period 2000-02. On 21 March last, I announced a list of events which have been approved in principle, subject to normal contractual negotiations, for investment under the Initiative so far this year. The total amount of funding allocated to the Initiative in 2003 is &euro;5.43 million. A review of the benefits accruing from the investments under the Initiative is currently being conducted by Bord Fáilte and I intend to have my own Department formally review it in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of marketing exposure, the House might note that television coverage of last year's <Col N="898" /> American Express World Golf Championships was broadcast to over 140 countries worldwide reaching a television audience of several hundreds of millions. The Irish Open was broadcast to 300 million viewers on five continents in 2002 and is expected to receive similar exposure this year.</P>
    <P>In the golfing world, the ultimate marketing opportunity is the Ryder Cup which is one of the top ten world class sporting events in the world. Media coverage of the event reaches around 700 million homes in 167 countries and with 24 television stations carrying live broadcasts. The House will be aware that Ireland will be host to the Ryder Cup in 2006. It is expected that there will be over 1,500 accredited media representatives in Ireland during the tournament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The WTO was established in 1975 to replace the International Union of Official Travel Organisations, whose membership comprised the national tourism organisations of more that 80 countries, including Ireland. The WTO expects to become a specialised agency of the UN after a General Assembly vote this autumn. It is currently engaged in a membership drive seeking to attract new members and to persuade those, who have ceased to be members, to re-join.</P>
      <P>Ireland has never been a member of the WTO. I note that a number of other EU countries, such as UK, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden, are not included in the current list of members. I understand that USA and Australia are also not members.</P>
      <P>For most tourism administrations, the most useful aspect of WTO activity has been its role in compiling international tourism statistics. Fáilte Ireland has long co-operated with the WTO in this area and, as a result of supplying statistics to the organisation, receives full access to WTO statistical information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Irish membership of the WTO has been considered on a number of occasions since 1975. The consistent opinion has been that the potential benefits to Irish tourism were limited and would not justify the costs involved. Both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland have access to WTO reports and have indicated Irish membership of the WTO would not result in any improvement in information access. Neither do they view funding for membership of the WTO as a priority. Information received from WTO <Col N="899" /> suggests an estimated annual cost of Irish membership in the order of &euro;140,000 to &euro;150,000. It is not clear if additional calls for funding support could arise in the future and what implications the absorption of the WTO into the UN system could have.</P>
    <P>Since the WTO was established in 1975, the scale and performance of the Irish tourism industry has changed beyond measure and I doubt that membership of the WTO would have added significantly to that performance. In summary, while there is a cost to WTO membership, there is limited tangible benefits. I do not, therefore, propose to change Irelands long-standing policy of non-membership.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of correspondence from the Irish Hotels Federation to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment which outlines the difficulties being experienced by many of its members in obtaining work permits. The issues of work permits for non-European economic area, EEA, nationals and work permit restrictions in respect of reception staff and barpersons in the hotel tourism and catering sector for the period April to June, are, of course, the responsibility of my colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the 2002 tourism business and employment survey carried out by Fáilte Ireland, formerly CERT, the number of people at work in the Irish hotel sector was maintained at 54,000 and the numbers employed in guesthouses, restaurants and licensed premises remained stable overall during 2002. The number of job vacancies <Col N="900" /> fell, although not significantly in the case of hotels.</P>
    <P>During 2002, Fáilte Ireland trained almost 12,000 people for the hospitality and tourism industry, of whom 3,700 were new entrants. With a projected demand for some 25,000 new industry entrants annually in the medium term, Fáilte Ireland is continuing to invest substantially in marketing initiatives to enhance the tourism industrys position as a first-choice career. Another part of the authority's strategy is to focus on helping enterprises to help themselves, with a particular emphasis on improving human resource management and encouraging best practice. In order to support employers of non-nationals, currently constituting some 30% of the tourism and hospitality workforce, Fáilte Ireland has developed an induction pack. Initially produced in French, Italian and Spanish, it covers customer care and operational hygiene as well as advice on living and working in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The recently published interim report of the tourism policy review group outlines in chapter 8, entitled People in Tourism, what needs to be done to improve the employment status of the tourism industry and to enhance the appeal of tourism as a provider of good quality employment in Ireland. The group recognises that primary responsibility for recruitment, induction, training and development, and staff retention lies with the industry itself and points to considerable scope for development in this area. It acknowledges the State's role in encouraging best practice, benchmarking training and education arrangements in Ireland with those of other countries with which Ireland competes for visitors, the development of course content and the setting of standards of performance and of attainment. Finally, it believes that, in the current economic circumstances, the employment of a significant number of non-nationals in the Irish tourism industry is both desirable and inevitable, bringing with it responsibilities and needs on all sides.</P>
    <P>I have asked Fáilte Ireland to consider the contents of the interim report and to identify a number of key recommendations that it might pursue with immediate effect. I have also initiated arrangements to put in place appropriate bilateral structures with ministerial colleagues and their Departments to pursue issues of mutual interest which impact on the future development of tourism.</P>

      <P>Under the national lottery-funded sports capital programme administered by my Department, funding is allocated to projects directly linked to the provision of sports and recreational facilities at local, regional and national levels. While the majority of the funding allocated under the programme goes to voluntary and community groups, it is also open to local authorities to submit applications for funding. For example, under the 2002 programme grants to the value of over &euro;9.2 million were allocated to 29 projects, either directly to local authorities or to projects where the local authority was working in partnership with a sports club or a community organisation.</P>
      <P>It has been a conscious objective of policy, particularly in the past two years, to support a number of multi-sport centres under the management and control of local authorities. Of course, such projects must, like all others, comply with the terms and conditions of the sports capital programme.</P>
      <P>Examples of multi-sport centre projects allocated funding under the sports capital programme in recent years include those for Finglas, Ballymun and Ringsend in Dublin. They also include Waterford city, Navan, Carlow, Letterkenny, Ennis, Athlone, Ballina and Portlaoise. Of these, the Athlone sports centre, which includes a swimming pool, has been completed and is open to the public, while those for Ballymun, Finglas, Letterkenny and Portlaoise, apart from receiving funding through the sports capital programme, plan to include swimming pools as part of their overall sports complexes and have applied for funding under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, to that end.</P>
      <P>The 2003 sports capital programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 25 April. In excess of 1,300 applications were received before the closing date and, of these, 28 have been classified as being municipal multi-sport projects, of which ten involve swimming pools &ndash; either pools already funded or those which have applications being processed under the current local authority swimming pool programme.</P>
      <P>All applications under the 2003 sports capital programme are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abridged Estimates for 2003 provide &euro;9 million for expenditure this year under the local authority swimming pool programme. When compared with &euro;3.9 million expended under the programme in 2002, the 2003 allocation rep<Col N="902" /> resents a 130% increase on the previous years expenditure. Expenditure to the end of May amounted to &euro;3.264 million.</P>
    <P>Since June 2002, I have approved grant aid of &euro;11.5 million for four swimming pool projects, two replacement pools and two refurbishments. These projects are located in Finglas, Dublin, Tralee Aquadome and Tralee Regional Sports and Leisure Centre, Kerry, and Grove Island, Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Government intends, as it committed to do in the Agreed Programme for Government, to put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of sports facilities throughout the country. The first step in this process has commenced with a review of the existing sports capital programme under the Department's expenditure review programme which is due to be completed by this summer. The purpose of this review is to establish what has been achieved under this programme over recent years with a view to identifying gaps in the existing provision and procedures and setting priorities for the future. A similar review will be undertaken on the local authority swimming pool programme and the results of both will feed into the overall strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities.</P>

      <Quest>the number of applications received for grants under the 2003 sports capital programme by the closing date of 25 April 2003; when a decision will be made on the allocation of the grants; the criteria that will be used to decide on applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national levels throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2003 sports capital programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 25 April. A total of 1,330 applications were received before the closing date and these are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme, a copy of which is issued to prospective applicants with application forms. I am also forwarding a copy of this document to the Deputy for her information. These criteria have been developed to help assess applications so that those offering greatest community benefit are supported. The criteria can be summarised as follows: the extent to which projects increase active participation and result in improved standards of sport &ndash; high priority is given to projects which <Col N="903" /> are essential or integral to sports participation and to projects in disadvantaged areas; the financial viability of the project &ndash; higher rating is given to projects with a significant local contribution and those which demonstrate that the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds and an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools, the local authority and the national governing bodies in order to prioritise proposed improvements and facilities.</P>
    <P>Applications under the programme are received from organisations for local, regional and national facilities. Each year, a number of major municipal, regional and national projects are allocated funding in accordance with the programme's criteria, following consultations with the Irish Sports Council, other government departments and the relevant national governing bodies of sport and local authorities, as appropriate, in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>All applications are treated on their merits and highest priority is afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas, the aim being to increase participation. High priority projects include those essential or integral to sports participation or performance, e.g., pitch development, floodlighting, dressing rooms and showers.</P>
    <P>Following the assessment process, each application receives a score, which decides its order of priority within its own county. Recommendations, based on conclusions from this process and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution, are made to me, and I make the final decision on projects and grants to be allocated under the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the 2003 programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      <P>The persons named submitted an application under the 2002 special beef premium scheme in respect of eight animals. An 80% advance payment of &euro;1,200 has issued to the persons named. Eighteen animals were found to be eligible under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme. Eight of these animals were heifers under 30 months at the time of slaughter and therefore are eligible for the national envelope top-up. An 80% advance has issued for both the slaughter premium and national envelope top-up. An application under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme for 21 animals was received on 26 June 2002. Payment of the 80% advance entitlement, amounting to &euro;3765.62, issued on 23 <Col N="906" /> December 2002 and the application has been processed for the 20% balancing payment.</P>
      <P>Under new control arrangements introduced by the EU with effect from 1 January 2002, all bovine premia scheme applications must be processed at producer level rather than individual scheme application level. In this connection, the eligibility for slaughter premium of four additional animals slaughtered by the persons named could not be established in relation to the movement/registration details on the Department's cattle movement monitoring system. The persons named have been informed that these animals will now be excluded for slaughter premium payment purposes. The persons named have also been informed of the right to have this decision appealed. The 20% balancing payments in respect of the eligible animals under special beef premium scheme, suckler cow scheme and the slaughter premium scheme will issue over the next few days.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the administration of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme, that they have no record of an application by the person concerned for admission to the scheme. It is a fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme that the applicant meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. It is regretted that the Revenue <Col N="907" /> Commissioners are unable to consider an application for the relief without the issue of a valid primary medical certificate.</P>
    <P>Further information in regard to the scheme can be obtained from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, disabled drivers section, Coolshannagh, Monaghan, phone (047) 82800, who will be glad to be of assistance.</P>

A number of international human rights organisations are investigating these allegations at present, and my Department is monitoring their efforts. I would expect the authorities of countries involved in military action in Iraq to investigate allegations that human rights abuses were committed by members of their forces. In fact, details of such allegations have emerged in a number of cases precisely because the allegations had become a matter of official investigation.</P>
      <P>It is not for the Government to pass judgment on the standard of media reporting. On the contrary, the Government believes that democracy is best served by independent and open media.</P>

    <P>Gaelscoil Portlaoise was established with provisional recognition in September 1998 to cater for the demand in the area for primary education through the medium of Irish. The school was <Col N="910" /> granted permanent recognition by my Department in September 2000. The gaelscoil is currently housed in temporary accommodation in the Prison Officers Club, Portlaoise. My Department grant-aids 95% of the rental costs on these premises.</P>
    <P>The securing of interim accommodation, pending the availability of resources from my Department to provide permanent accommodation for the school, remains the responsibility of the patron body. I am aware that the gaelscoil is seeking alternative accommodation for September 2003. The school authorities have submitted a proposal which would involve the rental of an undeveloped site on the Mountrath Road and the placing of temporary accommodation thereon, as a solution to its impending accommodation problems.</P>
    <P>There are significant costs attached to this proposal in terms of site development, annual leasing of site and temporary portacabins and the financial implications will be carefully examined before a final decision is made. Officials from the planning and building unit of my Department are currently examining this proposal and are in regular communication with the school authorities in the matter. The most recent details on costings received are being analysed in the planning section in consultation with my Department's technical advisers. The school authorities will be advised of the Department's decision on the proposal as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The proposed large-scale building project for Clarecastle school is listed in section 7 of the 2003 school building programme, which I published on my Department's website at www.education.ie. This proposed project is at an early stage of architectural planning and has been assigned a band 2 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</P>
      <P>Projects listed in sections 6 and 7, primary, are not being authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning for the time being. The timing of when projects listed in these sections can progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the band rating.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Last April, having given careful consideration to the matter, I decided that the National Centre for the Visually Impaired should not proceed, having regard to the low and declining pupil numbers in the schools for the visually impaired and the development costs, estimated to be in excess of &euro;30 million.</P>
      <P>However, my Department is willing to explore with the school authorities concerned how aspects of the proposed centre could be developed, in the context of available resources.</P>
      <P>Generally, children with visual impairment may be catered for in special schools or in integrated settings. Special schools catering for children with visual impairment operate at a special reduced pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and are supported by the special needs assistant service. These children are also entitled to avail of the special school transport service, which includes an escort service.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy is, where possible and appropriate, to integrate children with special needs into local mainstream schools where they are supported by the resource teacher service and-or the special needs assistant service. Support is also provided by the visiting teacher service, which includes specialists in the education of children with visual impairment. These children also attract funding for the purchase of specialised equipment necessary to assist them in their education.</P>

      <Quest> the reason the rule for the limited scheme for the licensing of fishing vessels in the Irish inshore fleet were changed totally; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that people who have their boats have discovered that the new scheme for the licensing of traditional pot fishing boats in the Irish inshore fleet will be of no use to them.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last December, the EU Commission agreed to increase Ireland's fleet capacity limits to provide for the licensing and registration of previously unregulated inshore fishing boats. Approval of a scheme was strictly on the basis that it would not lead to an increase in fishing effort in the existing polyvalent segment of the Irish fleet now or in the future. The scheme was approved by the Commission on the basis that the vessels involved targeted lobster, crab, crayfish and shrimp and would not target quota species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few months detailed consultations were undertaken with fishing organisations and interested parties. As a first step a discussion document was prepared setting out a possible approach. This document was circulated to all recognised organisations operating within the inshore sector and comments, observations and suggestions were invited. The sea fishing boat licensing review group, on which there is representation from the inshore sector, also discussed the document. In addition, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, organised regional information meetings to discuss the proposals. While some representatives considered that the scheme should cover all inshore vessels, there were strong representations that the scheme must be strictly limited to vessels using pots. As the terms agreed with the Commission required that the scheme did not include vessels targeting quota species and as gillnets are primarily used for the targeting of quota stocks, such as cod and pollock, it would have been difficult to include this type of gear within the scope of the scheme. It was decided, <Col N="914" /> taking all positions into consideration, to confine the scheme to vessels using pots.</P>
    <P>An analysis by BIM of the current unlicensed and unregistered inshore vessels indicates that the vast majority of them target stocks such as lobster, crab, shrimp using pots. I am satisfied, therefore, that the current scheme is satisfactory, taking account of the terms of the EU approval and the overall views of the inshore sector.</P>

      <Quest> the position regarding a scheme which was announced in March 2002, namely the limited scheme for the licensing of fishing vessels in the Irish inshore fleet which allowed for the licensing of fishing vessels which were not registered or licensed; the number of applications which were received for it; the number approved; the number of applicants who received funding; and the amount of funding which was approved.</Quest>

      <P>Under the scheme which was announced in March, 1322 applications were received. The scheme involved the provision of replacement capacity on the phased basis. On the basis of strong representations made at that time, it was decided not to proceed with the scheme in that form. The approval of the EU Commission was sought for the waiving of the replacement capacity requirement.</P>
      <P>In December 2002, I secured the agreement of the Commission for an increase in Ireland's capacity limits, subject to strict conditions, which enables me to waive the requirement for replacement capacity. On this basis, I announced a new scheme in the last few weeks for the licensing of traditional pot fishing boats in the inshore fleet. The closing date for the scheme is 18 June 2003.</P>
      <P>All applicants who applied under the March 2002 scheme have been issued with a copy of the terms of the revised scheme, including an application form. There was no funding attached to the former scheme and none is envisaged for the new scheme.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,903 grants have been allocated under the programme in the five year period 1998-2002, of which 744 had not drawn a payment as at 31 March 2003. A total of 150 grants were allocated to County Kildare in 1998-2002, of which 38 had not drawn down a payment as at 31 March 2003.</P>
      <P>Under the guidelines, terms and conditions of the sport capital programme, a &ldquo;sunset clause&rdquo; provision exists for a grant to be withdrawn if within 15 months of the date of allocation the grantee is unable to satisfy the Department that it is in the process of drawing down the grant. It is the intention in my Department's follow-up contacts with grantees to ensure that they comply in full with the requirements of the sport capital programme in relation to the timely drawdown of grants awarded.</P>
      <P>Under the current local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, the closing date for receipt of applications was July 2000. Up until 1998, the programme was administered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government at which stage it was transferred to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, now Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of a new pool subject, in either case, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>
      <P>The local authority in Kildare has applied for funding towards the replacement of swimming pools in Athy and Naas. The preliminary reports have been approved and the contract documents for both projects are under consideration.</P>

The National Museum is responsible for the care and protection of Ireland's portable heritage, which comprises a vast number and variety of objects. As a collecting agency with responsibility for preservation and conservation as well as display, the museum will never be able to, and has no desire to, place all its collection on display at any one time.</P>
      <P>The National Museum has an ongoing policy of exhibition development at each of its four sites to facilitate greater access and interpretation of its collections. In furtherance of this policy it places the most significant and relevant objects on display to the public in a context that adds to their understanding of the material.</P>
      <P>The National Museum has an ongoing and successful practice of facilitating loans to county museums and other venues that meet the necessarily stringent requirements of curatorship, security, safety environmental control, display, public access and insurance.</P>

To date, a number of substantial loans have been made by the National Museum to designated county museums and other museums.</P>

      <P>The provision of playground facilities is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authorities, operating under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. My Department liaises with local authorities in the provision of multi-purpose sports facilities being provided for the use and benefit of all members and all groups in their communities. Under the 2002 sports capital programme grants totalling over &euro;9.2 million were allocated to some 29 projects of this nature and the Government has also committed over &euro;57 million towards the provision and upgrading of local authority swimming pools, which are very important in providing sport and leisure opportunities for all members of the community, including children.</P>

      <P>Government funding for the arts is, in the main, channelled through the Arts Council, a State body operating under the aegis of my Department but independent in the context of individual funding decisions. The Arts Bill 2002 currently under consideration by the Oireachtas will, when enacted, recognise that there is now a Minister with responsibility for the arts who has a specific role in the development of arts policy. The Bill will, for the first time, give legislative protection to the &ldquo;arms length&rdquo; principle, which is the basis for the Arts Council's independence in disbursing its funds. My Department also gives financial assistance towards the capital costs of arts and culture facilities. For example, the ACCESS scheme, which is scheduled to run from 2001 to 2004, will make available &euro;45.71 million to 44 projects on a broad geographic basis and will greatly increase general public access to arts facilities and enhance participation in arts activities.</P>

      <P>The overall Department objective is to encourage a vibrant and active sports sector, especially in areas of disadvantage, with increased participation, good quality, sustainable facilities <Col N="918" /> and opportunities for people to play an active role in sport. Within this policy context the talents, potential and needs of the competitive and the elite are also cherished and supported in their pursuit of excellence and success in top sport. The Departmental strategy for sport guides the Irish Sport Council's actions in its promotion and development of sport as outlined in its statement of strategy for 2003 to 2005 Sport For Life. Funding for the Irish Sports Council has increased from just over &euro;13 million in 1999 to in excess of &euro;28 million this year. In addition, the Department, in keeping with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government has undertaken to develop a new strategy for the provision of sports facilities in Ireland and carry out an audit of existing sports facilities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My Department's programme has been enormously beneficial to clubs, sports organisations and community groups in every village, parish and town throughout the country. When the Government came into office in 1997 funding for sport stood at only &euro;17,000,000. Since 1998 on the sports capital side alone my Department has allocated &euro;213,000,000 to over 2,900 projects around the country. On top of this we have also committed over &euro;57,000,000 towards the provision and upgrading of local authority swimming pools, which are so important to the provision of sports and leisure opportunities for all members of the community.</P>
      <P>The new 50 metre swimming pool at the University of Limerick and the National Aquatic Centre at Abbotstown are key facilities in the context of our high performance strategy for elite competitions as well as for clubs, learners and fun swimmers. My Department also, under the terms of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 continues to fund the development of both the sports of horse and greyhound racing.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of a new pool subject, in either case, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. Following the submission and approval of <Col N="919" /> an initial feasibility study, there are four stages in a swimming pool project. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation. The application submitted by Cobh Town Council for a new swimming pool is currently under evaluation at tender stage. On the advice of the technical advisors in the Office of Public Works, my Department has sought details in relation to the pool operator so as to be satisfied that all operator requirements are incorporated in the tender documentation prior to approval. On receipt of this information, the proposal will be considered further. In the case of Youghal, I approved the contracts documents submitted by Youghal Town Council for a new swimming pool in March last. It is now open to <Col N="920" /> the Council to seek tenders for the proposed works.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a recent <Col N="922" /> decision by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, to prepare protocols in relation to the referral of patients from other health board areas for elective services in hospitals in the eastern region.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have pursued a policy of regional self-sufficiency is relation to the provision of hospitals services in order to ensure that patients are in a better position to access services locally. The benefits of this policy are evident through a series of major infrastructural developments in hospitals around the country which has resulted in the availability of more services and new specialties on a regional basis. However, for reasons of complexity, a number of specialised services are concentrated in the eastern region. The ERHA has acknowledged that the referral of patients from outside the region to avail of tertiary and super-regional services in the eastern region remains appropriate given the range and specialised nature of the services provided.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the ERHA intends to have discussions with the health boards and the acute providers in the region in relation to the development of referral protocols.</P>

    <P>I have asked my Department to consider ways of accelerating and streamlining procedures for the delivery of major infrastructure projects in the transport area. The focus is on developing a package of measures which will shorten the approval period for such projects and also reduce costs. Measures under consideration include the degree to which public consultation is appropriate and issues connected with compensation for land being compulsorily acquired. However, as proposals are being formulated and the details have yet to be worked out, it is not possible for me to give any further information at present on what new procedures or arrangements may be required. The preparation of a critical infrastructure Bill is included in the Government legis<Col N="928" /> lation programme.

Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the gardaí in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings. Since 1 June 2003, penalty points are applicable to those convicted of driving without insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to speeding offences, the system operates in such a way that the offer of paying a fixed charge is always provided and a person has 56 days within which to pay the charge. The 56 day period comprises an initial 28 day period within which an &euro;80 fixed charge can be paid, followed by a further 28 day period within which a fixed charge of &euro;120 can be paid. If the person opts not to pay, the case is taken to court. These periods are built into the system and ensure that every opportunity is afforded to the person to pay the fixed charge and avoid a court hearing. There is therefore an inevitable and intrinsic time lapse between the issue of the notices, the payment of the fixed charge and the notification of the <Col N="929" /> endorsement of penalty points. The fact that, at present, the processing of notices by the gardaí is operated on a manual basis is a further contributory factor to those time lapses. The timing of the issue of fixed charge notices is a matter for the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002 contains a number of provisions to ensure the effective application of penalty points on the licence record of an individual. Section 5 of the Act provides that where penalty points are to be endorsed in a record, a notification of that endorsement must be issued to the licence holder involved. The notice sets out in particular the basis for the endorsement of the points. Section 7 of the Act provides that, save in very limited and quite specific instances, the operative date for penalty points is 28 days from the date of the notice issued under Section 5. The application of penalty points from the date of the alleged commission of an offence would not be appropriate in that the points would apply from a date that would precede either the payment of a fixed charge or the determination of guilt by a court.</P>

      <P>I have had enquiries made in this matter and I am informed that the Garda authorities are satisfied that this case was the subject of a full and proper investigation which resulted in a person being charged on the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions and subsequently dealt with by the courts.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the courts are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law. I have no function in relation to verdicts of the courts, nor is it open to me to intervene in court proceedings of this kind. I have been informed that the defendant in this case was acquitted on all charges by the jury who returned a verdict of not guilty.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that local gardaí have met the parents of the person named in the question on a number of occasions before, during and after the trial to explain the various legal procedures involved in the case and to assist them generally in any way they can to come to terms with their son's death. Officials of my Department have also met the parents to explain the legal issues involved. </P>

      <P>Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended in 1986 and 2001, provides that a non-national is entitled to lodge such a declaration following three years of marriage to an Irish citizen who is Irish other than by naturalisation, post-nuptial citizenship or honorary citizenship.</P>

      <P>The current national development plan, NDP, provides for a total investment of approximately &euro;30 billion in the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000-2006. Of the total planned investment, approximately &euro;17.5 billion is for measures coming within the remit of my Department, including local authority and social housing, water and waste water services, non-national roads, waste management, urban and village development, habitat protection and conservation, and heritage conservation.</P>
      <P>The national development plan is essentially an indicative framework document which sets out investment priorities across a range of major programmes over the 2000-2006 period. It does not, in general, attempt to describe the individual projects to be undertaken over this period.</P>
      <P>The economic and social infrastructure operational programme and the two regional operational programmes, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library, give further details about the measures implemented by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Such details include the manner in which the measures support economic activity, foster balanced regional development and promote social inclusion. I refer also to the reply to Questions Nos. 318 and 319 of 1 April 2003 in which progress under these measures is outlined further.</P>
      <P>In relation to completion dates, the achievement of targets under the national development plan depends on Ireland maintaining its strong competitive position and economic growth. The Government is committed to providing the investment in public infrastructure that underpins competitiveness, as envisaged in the national development plan, and we will continue to prioritise such investment over the remainder of the plan period.</P>

      <P>The corporate services division in my Department has responsibility for all staff in the environment, heritage and local government functional areas. The Dúchas brand has been discontinued under new operational arrangements approved by Government last April. The total staffing complement involved in human resource matters is 78.</P>
      <P>Dúchas did not have its own separate internal auditors. Internal audit was carried out by the internal audit section of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and since mid-2002 it has devolved to the EU-internal audit section of my Department. This section comprises six persons drawn from general Civil Service grades. These persons have been appointed on the basis of the best available competencies for the work involved, supplemented by appropriate training and development.</P>

      <P>On 16 April 2003, I announced that as part of the changes in the distribution of heritage responsibilities within the governmental system, the Dúchas brand was being discontinued. At the same time, my Department has been retitled the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I am now addressing how best the heritage remit of my Department can be accommodated within a redefined corporate image for my Department. It is not possible, however, at this stage to quantify the costs likely to be involved. In so far as some built heritage elements of Dúchas will now become the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, the task of repositioning its image to reflect its new functions is a matter for that office.</P>

      <P>In order to ascertain the most appropriate mortar mixes for use at Kells, various lime mortar mixes have been tested. The appropriate mortar mixes in relation to the building and repointing works at this site have now been established. Works began on this site in November 2002. The wages bill on the site since the start of the year is &euro;57,965.28. The first phase consisted of the setting up of a sub-depot, including the construction of a storage block and bays for storage of aggregate, the provision of vehicular access to the works area, the repointing of the masonry chancel wall, Priors Tower and south wall, along with fencing barriers, gateposts and other site safety works.</P>

      <P>Three subcontractors were engaged on the renovation of Gartan Lodge, Glenveigh National Park. These contract works related to (a) repairs to the plumbing system at a cost of &euro;11,883.33, (b) electrical works at a cost of &euro;2,056.98 and (c) supply and fitting of electrical insulation system at a cost &euro;1,328.15. I regret that due to an administrative error the use of external contractors in respect of the works at (b) and (c) was not adverted to in the reply to Question No. 426 of 13 May 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten members of departmental staff, including the building maintenance foreman, were involved at various stages in the works carried out at Gartan Lodge which were completed in April 2001. It is not possible to supply detailed data in relation to labour costs as workers were moved out to other jobs from time to time during the course of the refurbishment works. Specific <Col N="944" /> records are not available which would enable my Department to provide a project-specific total for person hours. Subsequent to the works at Gartan Lodge, a revised procedure for the estimation and approval of individual projects, as well as better cost controls, have been introduced.</P>
    <P>The works initially proposed by regional management envisaged minor repairs to the plumbing and heating systems to allow the occupant move into the gate lodge without delay as the accommodation was urgently required and no plans, specifications, schedules or budgets were developed at that stage. Quotations which were required were made available to the building maintenance foreman. The project was carried out under the overall responsibility of the relevant regional manager of my Department's national parks and wildlife section.</P>

      <P>The type of pay slip referred to is one that is used throughout most Government Departments. It gives full details of employee's pay, allowances, overtime earnings and deductions. In response to representations from the trade unions concerned, additional information has now been incorporated which gives a breakdown of overtime earnings at different rates. However, for technical reasons it is not possible to record on the payslip the hours actually worked at standard time, or at different rates of overtime. Any employee encountering difficulty is free to seek clarification from their local pay office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years a number of measures have been introduced to protect the pension rights of those who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives and to make qualification for a pension easier for those with broken or interrupted insurance records. The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 and allows for periods of up to 20 years, spent out of the work force caring for children up to 12 years of age or sick relatives to be disregarded when a person's contribution record is being averaged for pension purposes. To benefit from the homemaker's scheme, a person must have worked and paid PRSI or do so in the future at class A, E, H and-or S. A person in receipt of child benefit and providing children up to 12 years of age with full-time care, or in receipt of carer's allowance-carer's benefit, will automatically be registered as a homemaker and this information will be noted on his-her insurance record. A person who is not in receipt of any of the above payments and who at any time from 6 April 1994 onwards, is caring for a child or adult as specified above, must register as a homemaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" />The homemaker's scheme is at present being reviewed as part of an overall review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions, the first phase of which was published in August 2000. Changes to the homemaker's scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of the phase 2 report which I expect to publish in the coming months. In the Agreed Programme for Government and in Sustaining Progress, the Government has committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age (non-contributory) pension. This process had commenced in budget 2000 and a number of special increases have been granted since then. The rate of the qualified allowance on the contributory pension now stands at &euro;121.50 per week which is about 84% of the maximum rate of non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Over the past 15 years, the relationship between the old age (contributory) pension qualified adult allowance and the personal rate has varied considerably from some 67% to the current 77%. Further increases in the qualified adult allowance rate will be considered in a budgetary context. New applicants for retirement and old age (contributory) pensions can now apply to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to their spouse or partner. This facility has been available since October 2002 and it will as resources permit, be extended gradually to all pensioners. More flexibility has also been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) pension scheme, including a reduction in the average number of contributions required for a minimum pension to ten, the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for those with mixed rate insurance records and the special pension for those with pre-1953 insurance contributions These measures are of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after children, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide fully for their own heating needs. A fuel allowance payment of &euro;9 per week is paid to eligible households while an additional &euro;3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to &euro;12.90 per week. The fuel allowances represent a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. They are not intended to meet the full cost. In addition many households also qualify for electricity and gas allow<Col N="947" /> ances. Improvements have been made to the fuel allowance scheme in recent budgets. The means test has been eased and the duration of payment has been increased from 26 to 29 weeks. The significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have also improved the income position for people dependent on the social welfare system. Primary payment rates are payable for the full 52 weeks of the year and increases in these rates benefit a wider range of recipients. The question of further changes in the fuel allowance scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

The Pensions Board is a statutory body which is financed by fees payable by occupational pension schemes. While I have overall responsibility for the board, it is not a matter for my Department to approve the details of the board's conduct of its business. It is appropriate that the board would review its operations from time to time and I have full confidence in the board and its management to conduct its business in a professional and effective way. I have discussed this issue with the chief executive of the Pensions Board.</P>
