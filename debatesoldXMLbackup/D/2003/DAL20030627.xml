    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sole objective of our health policy is to provide every person with access to high quality services. Services have expanded significantly and there are more people receiving care and support services than ever before. I have addressed this House before in relation to the investments and gains made in the health system over the past five to six years. Notwithstanding these gains, I have often referred to the need to couple investment with reform. The purpose of today's debate is to outline the Government's planned reform programme for the health service. The programme will be an essential tool in achieving the improvements in health care which we want and which the public deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the reform agenda is a central theme in the health strategy and does not exist outside or separate to our strategic vision for the health system. At the time we published the strategy, we said that structural reform would have to follow. There were complaints that the system was disjointed. Very often patients and clients had to respond to the way services were organised, rather than services <Col N="2" />being organised to respond to their needs. It was acknowledged that we needed to be certain the structures in place were fit to meet our new goals and objectives. Under action 114 of the national health strategy, I commissioned Prospectus Strategy Consultants to complete an audit of structures and functions in the health system. The central objective of the project was to examine whether the structures in place were the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future needs in the context of the principles, goals and objectives of the health strategy. Also included in the terms of reference was the need to assess the adequacy of governance, integration and responsiveness to identified consumer need.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance established a commission on financial management and controls in the health service. The commission, chaired by Professor Niamh Brennan, focused on financial accountability and management issues, but also identified the need for structural reform to support improvements. It is interesting to note that the reports have, independently of each other, reached similar conclusions about the system and have made comparable recommendations. These reports provided the background against which <Col N="3" />the Government made its decisions in relation to the health service reform programme.</P>
    <P>Health board structures are over 30 years old and the wider health system has seen the addition of a large range of specialist agencies during that period, often to give focus to and protect particular policy developments. The result is that there are now 58 agencies operating in the public health system which is, obviously, unsustainable. This multiplicity has resulted in a complex and fragmented system which has itself become an obstacle to achieving improvements. Both reports have emphasised the need to introduce rationalisation, standardisation and a much improved co-ordination to overcome this fragmentation and to give me, as Minister, a realistic span of control over the agencies for which I am responsible. Both reports also reiterated the need to clarify roles between the Department and the delivery system. They also draw attention to the tensions between local representation and decision making <i>vis-à-vis</i> national policy objectives. In a system as complex and as broad in scope as ours, there must be clarity about roles and accountability. The Brennan report focused in depth in this area and made specific recommendations which have also been endorsed in the reform programme.</P>
    <P>Issues were raised in relation to the way in which things get done in the system. The need to enhance needs assessment and service planning was recognised. If we are serious about putting people at the centre of care, we must begin with an assessment of needs which informs us about how to plan our services. In turn, once we have declared and agreed service plans, we must link them with funding and measure activity and outcomes. The Government has taken these reports on board and agrees with their analysis of current problems. There have been improvements in all these areas in the past, but these have represented part solutions which are, by their nature, limited. The Government has recognised that it is time to devise a comprehensive and integrated solution.</P>
    <P>The principles underlying the reforms are a new national focus on service delivery and executive management of the health services, a reduction in fragmentation within the system, clearer accountability, improved budgetary and service planning and, most importantly, improved patient care. There will be a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies to reduce fragmentation which will entail the amalgamation or abolition of over 30 agencies. This process will include the abolition of the existing health board and health authority structures. A health services executive will be established as the first body ever to be charged with managing the health service as a single national entity. The executive is to be organised on the basis of three core divisions which will include a national hospitals office, a primary, community and continuing care directorate and a national shared services centre. The <Col N="4" />executive will have its own board and chief executive officer and the board will report directly to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The primary, community and continuing care directorate will be made up of four regional health offices of the health services executive at regional level. At local level, existing community care structures will be strengthened to support the maximum local delivery of services and to provide an integrated framework for the development of the primary care model. The Department of Health and Children will be restructured to ensure improved policy development and oversight. There will be a clear separation between the executive and non-executive functions of the Department. Key to its role will be holding the health services executive to account for its performance.</P>
    <P>The health information and quality authority as set out in the health strategy will be established as a key independent agency in the new structure. A new governance framework will be developed. The purpose of this governance framework is to ensure that there are common professional parameters across the system designed to deliver accountability, standardisation and value for money. All remaining boards and any new boards established, for example, the board of the health services executive, will be subject to audit against the new governance standard. Supporting processes such as service planning, management reporting, etc. will also be modernised to bring them in line with recognised international best practice.</P>
    <P>These reforms are essential to the advancement of the national health strategy. Without them, the health services will not be able to respond adequately to their strategic objectives. The new structures will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management. It will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system. In the area of primary, community and continuing care, services will continue to be delivered through community care structures but they will be strengthened and will operate within a fundamentally realigned national management structure. This will be a proper framework within which all primary, community and continuing care services can be integrated.</P>
    <P>On acute hospital services, the reforms clear the way for a reorientation of the hospital sector around national priorities, high quality, best outcomes and better value for money underpinning the commitments made in the health strategy. It will provide a unitary approach to the delivery of hospital services and support the even and consistent introduction of consultant delivered services in Ireland. The health information and quality authority will ensure that quality of care is promoted throughout the system by developing a framework of quality standards and promoting the strategic development of information, communications and health technologies within <Col N="5" />the system. This strengthening of information systems and quality standards will support the evaluation of policy efficacy and system performance.</P>
    <P>In the area of accountability, the programme will ensure maximum clarity between roles, clearer lines of accountability and best practice governance. In regard to efficiency and value for money, it also provides for the development of shared services, where economies of scale can lead to resources being freed up for front-line services, improved standardisation and a pooling of expertise and best practice. The delivery of some actions in the strategy will be linked to investment and this will continue to be true. However, the reform programme will ensure that the system can absorb additional investment effectively and will help to demonstrate to the taxpayer and my colleagues in Government that any additional money invested will be well spent in delivering an improved service to patients and clients. The new structures must have a positive impact on the delivery of the Government's health strategy. That is its central premise.</P>
    <P>The issue of democratic accountability in the new structure has been raised. As a first step, the most important voice to be heard in planning the delivery of services is that of the patients, clients and their families. Arising from the health strategy, progress has already been made on developing and enhancing the opportunities for such input. Regional co-ordinating committees, consumer panels and advocacy services are all being developed as feedback mechanisms. There has been some misunderstanding of the term &ldquo;consumer panels&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The objective of consumer panels is to ensure that people who have used services or are current users of services have a genuine influence in the shaping of services locally, in community care areas or at regional level. We have made a good start on that in recent years. It is essential that the people at the coal face in terms of bearing the brunt of particular disease conditions or other issues, have a say in shaping services at local level and that they are involved with the professionals, administrators and decision makers in the health offices of the 32 community care areas and in the new regional health offices. The system will benefit from that type of advocacy. That was the origin of the concept in the health strategy and there are good examples of it happening in the mental health area, in terms of the development of the network and peer advocacy which we launched early last year, in the regional co-ordinating committees in the disability sector and on a number of other specific disease fronts.</P>
    <P>With regard to political representation, it was the view of Prospectus, which was endorsed by the Government, that as we have an Exchequer funded health service with centrally determined resourcing decisions, Oireachtas Members should have a responsibility to ensure there is a match between funding of services and national priorities. It is important that public representatives have an opportunity to articulate their views on <Col N="6" />issues at regional and local level. I intend to place an obligation on the HSE and its regional offices to appraise and inform local representatives and the public generally on service plans and developments regionally and locally. However, it should be noted that the emphasis must be on ensuring that democratic input at regional level is focused on the delivery of national priorities. In addition, the roles of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Cabinet subcommittee on the health strategy will be increasingly important in ensuring adequate reflection of the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health system. I have agreed to bring more detailed proposals to Government on the representation arrangements over the coming months.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the implications for acute hospital service delivery. I draw Members' attention to this issue because it is another strand of reform which will be put to Government shortly, the report of the task force on medical staffing. The principles emerging are centred on high quality and optimal outcome. International evidence consistently demonstrates that clinical outcomes for patients are improved when they are treated by multi-disciplinary specialist teams operating in units where there are high volumes of activity and access to diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, it is neither practicable nor realistic to suggest that we can provide this within immediate reach of everyone's home. We need to face up to these issues. As a society, we need to achieve consensus about the reality of achieving high quality safe care in a country of this size and population.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to achieve Oireachtas consensus on this issue going forward, on a cross-party basis. These issues have dogged successive Governments. For the ultimate benefit of the patient and in the interest of developing the right solution for all concerned, we should&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and accept that different political parties have different policies and ideas on the health system. However, on key issues such as patient outcomes, better survival rates and how we construct services around that, there is an opportunity for the Oireachtas, leaving party political considerations aside, to do the right thing. I have in mind a genuine interaction on a cross-party basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Managing the change programme will be challenging. I will not understate the enormity of the task ahead. Change will depend on the people working in the system. In that context, the reports do not criticise the people in the system but the system itself. In fact, they emphasise our human resources as a key strength. The first step in implementing the new structures is an extensive programme of communication and dialogue with key stakeholders. I have already started on that process. I have met five health <Col N="7" />boards so far and am due to meet the sixth today. We are endeavouring to bring the message to the staff and to answer their questions as quickly as possible following the announcement of the Government decision. The preparations for the consultation phase of the communications process within the health service are well advanced and the first sessions will commence on 9 July. The office of health management is organising that.</P>
    <P>As an immediate priority, I will set about establishing structures to drive the implementation as soon as possible. This will include a national steering committee which will oversee and audit progress and a project office to plan and advance the programme. One of their first tasks will be to prepare a detailed project plan setting out a timetable for the various elements of the reform programme, including identification of those actions that can be tackled early. The Government has also agreed to the establishment of an interim board of the health services executive as well as an interim national hospitals office. I intend to put these structures in place in the autumn to take early action on the advancement of the reorganisation of the hospital sector on the basis of the type of principles that it is understood will emerge from the Hanly report to be published shortly. In addition, I hope to make an early start on the internal restructuring of the Department itself. This debate today is the commencement of the debate in the House.</P>
    <P>I am determined to move forward as quickly as possible with implementation. The decisions made will reinforce and build on the efforts to date in creating a more innovative and participative working culture in the health services, focused on continual improvement in service quality. This programme is about providing a framework for developing services and maximising the impact of these services on the patient and clients who rely on them. I look forward to the debate that has just started. It will, no doubt, continue into the autumn both inside and outside the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his presentation and the opportunity to begin the debate on these health proposals. My greatest criticism is not just of the Minister but of the Government for waiting until its seventh year in government to even consider talking about reform of the health service. Major investment is required for the reforms already announced, the structural changes which are proposed to achieve efficiencies. It will also be needed if the Hanly proposals, which are to come, for regional centres of excellence are to be pursued in any meaningful way, yet we are talking about these reforms when the existing service is falling apart. Unlike factory production, a health service cannot be turned off when processes are being changed. Costly parallel systems will have to be kept in place, possibly over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" />Reforms of this kind could have been introduced quite painlessly during the boom years and it is now difficult to see how they can be introduced at all. It is unforgiveable that it never occurred to any member of this Government, and it has been an extraordinarily well and expensively advised Government, that one simply could not increase spending in any organisation by over 125% and ask it to accept 25,000 additional employees without reform. That was impossible for any organisation and it is unbelievable that it did not occur to this Government until its seventh year in office. That is why people are understandably cynical about the motivation behind talk of reform.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I welcome the reforms, as does Fine Gael, and we accept the need for a more centralised administration and for a clear chain of command through the health service, which was lacking. We contend, however, that these proposals do not go far enough. They are changes to the administrative structure of an existing system of health care delivery when an entire systems change is needed. This kind of so-called reform mirrors what many of us have seen over the years in the so-called reform of local authority structures. In that instance, instead of looking at the functions or funding of local government the structures were repeatedly reformed and the result was a deterioration in the governance of local government and an increased irrelevance of its structure.</P>
    <P>It is likely that this will happen in the health service unless it is accompanied by a complete systems change. Changing administrative structures may produce temporary savings but eventually all the inefficiencies inherent in an entirely State provided service, particularly one that is now proposed to be highly centralised, will re-emerge, no matter how hardworking, conscientious or professional the administrative staff may be.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that we must move to a system of managed competition where private sector providers compete with one another on price and quality and so produce the best deal for the patient. There is no reason for the Government or the State to be involved in running hospitals or in the direct provision of the myriad health services. It is not necessary for services which are publicly funded to be also publicly provided and while this is accepted across all State services extraordinarily we do not apply the same principle to health, which is the most expensive service. The State's role should be to articulate values; to set, monitor and enforce standards both in delivery of care and in the standards of the professionals involved in giving that care; to plan the health service and to purchase health care insurance cover for the population from a variety of competing health insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies would in turn purchase these services on our behalf from competing hospitals and other health care providers. If I have caused some ripples in the insurance world <Col N="9" />by my anxiety about the introduction of risk equalisation it is because I believe that the future of the health service depends absolutely on a thriving insurance market for health care. The level of entitlement could be similar to that which we already enjoy except that people might be able to access it. The difference is that money will come only if the patient is treated so there is an incentive for hospitals, doctors and consultants to treat patients. Under the current system the incentive is to treat the minimum number of patients because every additional patient is regarded as a drain on the resources of hospitals.</P>
    <P>In an insurance-procured, competitively provided health service the patient has choice, of doctor and hospital. The patient is no longer forced to wait for rationed services and while those who can afford it can top up their insurance cover if they wish there is equality of access for treatment and that is the key improvement that is required in our health service now. There is a total absence of incentive and all the criticisms that we have heard of hospitals and consultants boil down to the absence of incentive to treat patients. It is far more efficient for hospitals to close their wards. What kind of business would do a similar thing when faced with difficulties? Would a hotel close its rooms when it was faced with financial difficulties?</P>
    <P>The challenge for the future is to provide the best possible quality of health care at the lowest possible cost, even though, and particularly perhaps because we know, health care will become increasingly expensive regardless of who is paying for it or who is providing the service. Fine Gael wants to capture the benefits of the market for consumers and the one major benefit that the market has is its inbuilt and inherent incentives for efficiency and innovation, and the use of technology which can operate automatically to control costs and to ensure quality is maintained.</P>
    <P>The latest Government proposal, announced last week, will have no immediate effect on the crisis in the health service and in many ways it has the potential to make things worse. I have already alluded to the fact that when the Secretary General talked about these reforms he said that they would be the priority agenda of the Department for the next 18 months. This means in effect that all the Department and the health boards, the senior personnel, the human and financial resources and all expertise will focus on the abolition of health boards while the health service is falling apart.</P>
    <P>That does not have to be the sole concern when there are 500 beds closed in hospitals and people are queueing for every service, not just for hospitals, and there is not a single extra cent to meet any of these additional demands. It is like calling the fire brigade when one's house is on fire only to be told that the fire cannot be put out until one has improved one's safety arrangements. That is what we are saying to patients now. Capacity is the real, immediate and widely acknowledged problem in the health service: too <Col N="10" />few beds, too few consultants, nurses, therapists, medical cards and not a single proposal at this stage to meet any of those needs.</P>
    <P>It is difficult not to be cynical, to avoid the conclusion that this announcement and the hype that led up to it is little more than a device to distract attention from the real problem. The Government may hope that publication will somehow have the same distraction value as the health strategy had, but people are understandably cynical. They welcomed the health strategy two years ago but nothing was delivered and they are now watching every movement as a result of these announcements and will be extremely judgmental so the Minister better deliver on every one of these promises.</P>
    <P>It will add insult to injury if they are being dressed up as a considered response but with no real intention to deliver on them. My cynicism grows when it seems that it will take at least until after the next general election to abolish the health boards and centralise the organisation of hospital and other services. This may well provide a better service eventually and at a lower cost than is currently the case, but this is still far from certain. Why is it that less than four years ago it was considered that the best thing that could be done for the health service was to abolish the Eastern Health Board and produce three additional health boards? Small was going to be beautiful. We were going to have a flexible, responsive service locally. Now, fewer than four years later, the exact opposite is true. Big is beautiful again, and we are not abolishing that, having spent over &euro;100 million in those few years to change the service. If these new proposals are the correct way for us to proceed, it was a complete waste of money.</P>
    <P>I have three major reservations about the report, the first being that it is difficult to see the efficiencies being achieved through the central management and control of all hospitals from a Dublin office. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on value for money in the health service identified two major problems. The first was lack of capacity, and I have spoken about that. There are no proposals to address those problems. The second is the complete absence of accessible and usable information in the health service on the basis of which sound decisions can be made regarding health, finance, management or investment. There are no proposals and no money to address that problem. Unless we have basic information about numbers of patients and employees, and numbers on waiting lists, we cannot organise the system from the centre. Whatever chance one has of doing it at health board level, there is no possibility of achieving efficiencies from a remote office in Dublin and trying to manage a hospital in Donegal or Kerry.</P>
    <P>My other worry about the proposals is that, if one has a centrally administered hospital agency and locally delivered community service, the structure might be anathema to a seamless health <Col N="11" />service locally. Every aspect of the health strategy referred to the integration of services where local budgets would be considered as one and there would be no competition between community services and the hospital, with the latter trying to push patients back into the former and <i>vice versa.</i> It was to operate as one, coherent, holistic service. I cannot see how that is to happen with central administration, and that will have to be examined very carefully. If the Minister is serious about the strategy and all the promises for primary care, how is that going to fit into the new administration? It seems that primary and community care and preventative medicine are the aspects, if he is really looking for value for money, on which he should be concentrating. He should keep people healthy and out of hospital rather than trying to deal with the problem after it has deteriorated.</P>
    <P>One of the reports talked about at great length is the Brennan report on how GPs might be budget holders. That is fine in a system where one has groups of GPs who are well resourced. If there are single GPs operating on their own, I do not know how that will work or how they can be budget holders. How does one enforce it? Who pays if a GP does not control his or her budget? As far as I can see, under that sort of system, in the absence of service, the only person who pays is the patient. All those aspects of the service seem to have been glossed over as if they were not relevant. I would also like to mention the issue of democratically-elected councillors being on health boards. We heard on every news bulletin for about ten days before the final announcement how those wonderful reports regarding reforms were going to be fought tooth and nail by local councillors. There was not a whimper from any of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard that before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we moved onto the consultants and whomever the next target was. It was a case of giving out about anyone apart from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did we hear that before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of those councillors gave years of service and knew the health service and its local problems better than anyone. There is not even a pretence of accountability in the new proposals. The Minister's talk about consumer panels is all very laudable, and I am sure that they have a great advocacy role. However, it is not democratic accountability, and there is no point in dressing it up and pretending so, for that is simply not the case. Consumers represent themselves and no one else. They are certainly not accountable to the rest of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever structures the Minister sets up, some mechanism must be found to ensure that there is accountability and that patients are protected. By <Col N="12" />definition, they are vulnerable people. The commonly touted accusation that local politicians stymied progress on reforms locally because of parochial interests is nonsense. The health service does not need local politicians to stymie reform, for it is awash with all sorts of professionals with territorial and sectoral self-interests. They are all well represented by unions and highly articulate. They are far more likely to oppose reforms which threaten their interests, and they always assume that those are synonymous with the interests of the patient. However, their interests are narrow, and quite often the local politician is the only person looking out for the common good. The protection which they gave to the health service should not be underestimated or discarded lightly.</P>
    <P>I have left myself short of time, but if I were to say one last thing it would be that the question mark hanging over the reforms is their cost. I have spoken about the absence of an IT service, and unless the Minister invests in IT, I can see no possibility of achieving any efficiencies from centralised control. When the Hanly report comes out, we will really see the extent of the problem in achieving the kinds of reforms now needed. It was reprehensible of this Government not to introduce these fundamental changes when money was available. It is estimated that if we get rid of some of our acute hospitals, taking the number down to about 12 regional hospitals &ndash; which I understand is roughly what is recommended &ndash; we will lose 2,000 acute beds. They will have to be replaced in the regional hospitals as well as making up for the 3,000 beds which were due. Where will the money for that come from, and how long will it take for the reforms to be introduced?</P>
    <P>I have a horrible feeling that my successors and those of the Minister will still be discussing this in 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>At his recent press conference to launch the two reports, the Minister for Health and Children stated his intention to introduce a new health Act. Much of the defence of his approach is based on the premise that, as it is 30 years old, the Health Act is out of date. The Labour Party believes that there is a great need for health care reform and new legislation to underpin it. We have argued &ndash; and will continue to argue &ndash; for reforms that deliver excellence, fairness and value for money through an integrated system of care which universal insurance can create, and a major shift towards primary care and health promotion. However, that is not what is on offer from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flawed as it is, the Health Act 1970 was about changing the health service, at least in part to meet the needs of patients. On the evidence so far, the new Bill being proposed will not deliver even limited or incremental reform. Essentially, it will be about swapping one bureaucracy for another, possibly more streamlined but definitely less accountable. The central issues in the health <Col N="13" />service of capacity and access are completely and shamefully ignored. That said, I am not even convinced, on its record so far, that this Government has the stomach to deliver all the administrative changes that it proposes. The public has a right to ask why it is being short-changed. At a time when so much is wrong with the health service and so much promised by the Government, why are the big questions being left unanswered?</P>
    <P>There are three pillars to health care reform: capacity and funding; access and fairness; and administrative value for money. However, in these reports, and particularly in the Government's published plan, no solution is offered to the capacity and funding issue and there is no reconciliation of the gross inequities in the health service that are crying out for redress. Worse, the Government is shifting the focus from the reality of people's experience of the health service towards systemic and structural concerns which are primarily of internal interest to those who run the health service. The complicated changes proposed will absorb massive amounts of energy and attention on the part of the Department of Health and Children, the health boards and all the agencies affected. The process will take years to complete and will demand as yet unspecified amounts of money.</P>
    <P>Already the Minister for Finance is on record as saying that no additional money has been provided for this year, although the setting up of an interim health service executive and hospitals office is promised for early autumn. The details of these bodies should be debated in the House prior to their establishment. Can the Minister promise today that they will be debated? When replying, the Minister should outline the cost of his implementation plans and the timeframe for implementation. Interestingly, the Government is silent on whether this exercise will save money. At the launch, the Minister for Health and Children promised that his plan threatens no one. If this is true, how can the Government describe it as a major rationalisation programme?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has argued for some time now that a health services authority should be established. We look forward to its role being developed and the important issue of information technology being handled and resourced. We welcome also the establishment of a new hospitals agency. Separating the acute hospitals sector from community and primary services makes sense. We are gravely concerned at the democratic deficit in the Government's model of reform and today's fudge by the Minister is unconvincing. We have argued for an extension of public involvement in a national health forum to create a sense of ownership of the health services and build badly needed consensus about priorities and change among all stakeholders, including patients, but the Government's approach is diametrically opposed to this view. The Government has even rejected the advice of the Brennan report it commissioned, which was <Col N="14" />to preserve local democracy in any new regional configuration.</P>

      <P>Niamh Brennan has made the point that this issue was the subject of deliberation by the commission and that it concluded that nobody, other than public representatives, had the necessary understanding of local needs, but the Government plan is to kill off local democracy. Abolishing health boards will not stifle dissent, but is likely to make communities feel even less empowered about decisions being made on their behalf. Such alienation is fertile ground for the growth of the hospital candidates of which Fianna Fáil is so afraid.</P>
      <P>It is salutary to consider the New Zealand experience which uncannily mirrors our own. In a country of similar population there were, at the beginning of the 1990s, 14 health boards. In 1993, four regional health authorities with no elected input were introduced. In 1996, a single transitional health authority with no elected members replaced the regional authorities. In 2000, a new structure was introduced based on district health boards, of which there are 21, which have directly elected members. Are we looking to a future where the 32 community care areas retained by the Minister in his plans will have to be given a democratic mandate as has happened in New Zealand?</P>
      <P>A principle, which we support and which should be applied in these proposals, is that of direct elections to give local communities a mandate in the delivery of local community services in any new structures, whatever their number. At national level we want to see democratic accountability built into the new structures. We will judge our support or otherwise for change accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the reconfiguration of hospital services, our view is that the patient should be at the heart of any changes, not the needs of consultants or administrators. A statutorily based health care guarantee which allows for access in reasonable time and within reasonable distance is an important measure that will provide access regardless of whether one lives in Dingle or Dublin. Such a basis for the reconfiguration of hospitals will reassure patients and would also require that issues of transport and the accessibility of regional centres of excellence would be addressed. There is no indication that the Government is even considering such a provision. We understand the requirement in many specialities for a critical mass of patients. It is unacceptable, for example, that general consultants with only a handful of cancer patients each year carry out major breast cancer operations which should be done at specialist centres. There is no requirement for all tertiary centres to be located in Dublin or Cork. In America, the Mayo Clinic is located in a small town with a population of only 50,000. We should be able to locate at least some of our major tertiary medical centres <Col N="15" />outside the metropolitan base. We should be conscious also in striving for centralisation that there is evidence that over-large hospitals carry their own inefficiencies and that smaller hospitals can play an essential role in health care delivery.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that the Government's plan will not open, or reopen, a single hospital. It will not provide one extra medical card. It will not provide a single residential place for someone with intellectual disability. The serious catch-up in capacity building is not addressed in these proposals and we need to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, state publicly a commitment to resourcing the health service to eliminate the suspicion that the real agenda of these reforms is to cut health spending.</P>
    <P>Public confidence is already at rock bottom as a result of the Government's appalling track record on mismanagement of the health service. There is despair at all the promises made and broken, the targets set and over-shot, the stealth charges and the plethora of cutbacks. I will give just one example. More than 1,000 children are still waiting more than six months for treatment today even though the health strategy promised that no child would be waiting that length of time by the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>In her excellent book, <i>Unhealthy State,</i> Maev-Ann Wren makes the point better than I can:</P>
    <P>The state of healthcare is a metaphor for the condition of this society. . . Directionless during the boom, Irish society is at risk of rediscovering its former fatalism, of accepting passively that the boat will remain beached until the tide turns; that children must remain awaiting tonsillectomies, old people awaiting the drug therapy that could alleviate their arthritis, the intellectually disabled awaiting the community care. . . Since an election fought on the promise of massive investment in health, there has been a concerted effort to throw dust in the eyes of the public and imply that wasteful spending is the central problem in the health service. This has been part of a political agenda to distract from the service's investment needs and defend the low-tax regime achieved during the boom. . . To every speaker who talks about value for money, the response should be &ldquo;what about access?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What about access? The Health Act 1970 established the general medical services scheme to replace the old and grossly inequitable dispensary system. For the first time, it offered the poor equity of access and treatment at general practitioner level. The GP contract specified there could be no differentiation between public and private patients. It was a good, progressive reform that brought about practical improvement for patients. It is the kind of reform, if applied to our hospital service, that would make a tangible, transforming difference to public patients today. Such a change should be central in the new Health Act and should be central to the Govern<Col N="16" />ment's position on the re-negotiation of the consultants' common contract. There should be no discrimination. Yet, as the Brennan report shows in the hard-hitting analysis of the over 70s scheme, the Government's handling in that instance was totally inept, extremely costly and grossly inequitable.</P>
    <P>While Brennan proposes one solution in relation to the common contract, we still have no idea what the Government proposes. Does it intend to tinker around with the present system and just get some flexibility in hours from the consultants or will it go the Brennan route and risk the danger of institutionalising the two-tier system and deepening the difference of care between public and private patients? At present at hospital level, there is no legal definition between private and public patients. All patients are entitled to hospital care. Insured patients choose private care but can just as easily choose when it suits to become public patients. It is an inherently unstable system and the Government must be aware that ill-thought out shifts in policy could end up overloading the public system to an unbearable degree.</P>
    <P>The task should be cast differently. How can we provide a fully integrated system of hospital care which treats people solely on the basis of need? Providing the same incentive to hospital and consultant for all patients, regardless of their income, rewards productivity rather than penalising it. It also eliminates the incentive to favour the treatment of private over public patients. Extending insurance on a universal basis is the obvious mechanism to reach that objective. There are other mechanisms also. However, any such discussion is academic when the Government is so far off the mark it has no policy at all regarding the delivery of fairness of access.</P>
    <P>I have only touched on a few of the many significant issues in these reports and in this plan. I wish there was more time. This is no way to debate health care reform. The time and format of the debate &ndash; three hours on a Friday with no dialogue by way of questions to the Minister &ndash; confirm yet again just how defensively this Government operates and how much it depends on public relations instead of parliamentary engagement. Even this minimalist debate was endangered by the possible delay in the publication of the Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly reports until after the Dáil had safely risen for its summer break.</P>
    <P>Fortunately the Government was shamed into publishing two of these reports but we are still waiting for the Hanly report even though the genesis of the medical manpower proposals extend back to the long ago days of Deputy Cowen and his time in Angola. Will the proposals increase capacity within the health service? Will they provide additional funding? Will they improve quality of care and eliminate hospital waiting lists by 2004, as was promised by the Taoiseach and the Minister? Will they re-open the hundreds of hospital beds closed as a result of cutbacks? Will <Col N="17" />they provide more medical cards for poor people? Prior to the election, 200,000 more medical cards were promised but not one of these has been provided. The answer to all these questions is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As we speak, 25 beds are closed in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, directly affecting the health of seriously-ill children. The Mater Hospital is setting out to ensure it can care for people in its car park. The proposals do not deal with the essential issues of our health service. The crisis was not faced by Government and its response now is inadequate. While it is dealing with the specific issue of administrative reform which is set out in this plan, it does not deal with the issues of capacity and access.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will share my time with Sinn Féin and Independent Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Government's latest health strategy represents yet another triumph of spin over substance. It seeks to blame the wrong people for the problem in the health service. It will result in no cost saving measures and less accountability. It fails to tackle the real problem in our hospitals &ndash; capacity.</P>
      <P>This is a superficial Government only concerned with appearances. The latest health strategy is just another cheap makeover. The promises of the last health strategy have now faded away like a fake tan. Prior to the launch of this strategy the masters of spin were busy again. The build up was perfect. We had a judicious leak &ndash; the Government was going to scrap the health boards and face down the local politicians. This was perfect. People do not really like politicians so it worked. The implication was as clear as it was ridiculous &ndash; local politicians on health boards were somehow responsible for the health crisis.</P>
      <P>On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; some poor unfortunate from a health board was asked, &ldquo;What do politicians know about health? Why not leave it to the experts?&rdquo; I could ask what does the Minister for Health and Children know about health and how is he qualified to talk about it. How is any Minister qualified to talk about his or her particular subject? The argument is false. To blame the health boards for the health crisis is wide of the mark and yet the Government's version succeeded until we read the reports. The Brennan report does not recommend the scrapping of the health boards and neither Prospectus nor Brennan show how the move would result in significant savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A parliamentary reply to one of my questions this week revealed that the proposed reforms could cost money. The reports show that there is no black hole. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has admitted that there will be no redundancies as a consequence. How will this save money? It will not. However, it does mean that the Minister for Health and Children can now go back to the Minister for Finance, like a spendthrift son to his rich daddy, and say, &ldquo;Dad, I am a changed character. I have reformed. Now <Col N="18" />please give me the money because I need it.&rdquo; I have to break it to the Minister that he is not going to get the money because there is an ideological split in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>This Minister has stated publicly that he believes taxes should be raised in order to provide money for the health service. I agree. However, when this suggestion was put to Deputy Harney at the press conference she was not for it at all. The Minister knows that the Minister for Finance manages to be more of a progressive democrat than the Progressive Democrats themselves on economic matters. He will have none of this suggestion either.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear. The real problem in our health service is capacity. We are still trying to deal with the loss of 6,000 beds since the 1980s while the 3,000 beds promised in the health strategy are slow to materialise.</P>
    <P>This reform package may not address the real problems but it means the Minister does not have to take the rap. He can wash his hands and evade his responsibilities. If I ask about bed shortages he can say, &ldquo;Sorry Deputy, that is a matter for the Health Service Executive.&rdquo; We can imagine the letters we will get back from the Ceann Comhairle's office saying our question is out of order and has been disallowed.</P>
    <P>The new strategy means less accountability at local and national level. It does not properly confront one of the main problems, namely, the power base of the consultants. We may have to wait another day for that. To her credit, Professor Brennan has performed a valuable service in revealing to the public how privileged the position of the consultants is and how lucrative their contracts can be.</P>
    <P>Our health service will be reformed but will it be to the benefit of patients? It is unlikely. We need reform which is genuinely patient focused and for that we need greater investment. This package will ensure the continuation of a two-tiered health system for a two-tiered society created by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>Albert Schweitzer once said, &ldquo;Happiness is good health and a bad memory.&rdquo; If that is so, I can only conclude that the Irish electorate is unhappy. We have a terrible health service but the people's memory is improving. Next time they will not forget. They will remember who created the mess and will realise that the only way to improve the health service is to get rid of this discredited Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of one family in my constituency and how the health services impact on it. The father of the family has recently received devastating news about his health. He has prostate cancer. This news was followed shortly by a notice from the health board saying that the family's medical card cover was being cut off as, following a review, it was determined it had exceeded the income limit. There are three young children in the <Col N="19" />family, two infants and a primary school pupil. For this family the unfairness and inequality of access to our health service is a cruel reality. This is the human face of the issues we are addressing in this debate. The success or failure of health service delivery is measured by how it assists this family and hundreds of thousands of people like it. The sad reality is that the system is failing them.</P>
      <P>It is a tragedy and a scandal that health care in this State is delivered by means of a fundamentally flawed two-tier public private system. The Government's health strategy opted to retain this system. The two reports we are addressing do not challenge it either, although they do expose some of the unfairness and inefficiency of the two-tier system. There is now a vicious cycle in the system. Waiting lists and bed closures in the public system have meant that more and more people who can afford it &ndash; and some who cannot &ndash; have opted for private health insurance and care. The public system suffers as a result. Health apartheid divides our society on income lines. The contribution to the common good which those on higher incomes could make is lost to the public system. As the Brennan report again exposes, many hospital consultants profitably straddle the two systems and it is public patients who lose out. The two-tier system is inherently inefficient and no amount of better financial management or administrative restructuring can change that reality.</P>
      <P>The vision and political will to reform that fundamentally unequal and inefficient system is absent from the Government. The two reports we are discussing, Brennan and Prospectus, were commissioned by two Departments, Finance and Health and Children, respectively, under two Ministers who have differed publicly on the question of health. One report focuses on financial management, the other on administrative structures. The Government's so-called reform programme published with them is an attempt to marry their conclusions and tie them in with the health strategy.</P>
      <P>However, when one returns to the health strategy, one finds that one of its key policy objectives and targets was for all additional beds to be designated solely for public patients. Instead of additional beds we are seeing bed closures &ndash; over 500 this year. At the same time, public money is going to buy treatment in beds in the private system under the Progressive Democrats' cherished treatment purchase fund. This is a classic example of the piecemeal and contradictory approach of this and previous Governments. Another example of the piecemeal approach was the extension of the medical card to all people over 70 years old, regardless of income. Why was the principle of universal access applied to these citizens and not to others who are equally deserving? Was it because a greater proportion of them vote? This was supposed to cost &euro;19 million but ended up costing &euro;55 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" />Administrative inefficiency meant that the numbers involved and the costs were significantly underestimated. More fundamental, however, was the political decision to introduce this measure. It had nothing to do with equity or real health delivery. If it is right that a wealthy retired professional with a hefty pension and a portfolio of shares and property can benefit from the medical card, regardless of income, then it is right that the hard-pressed young family I cited at the start of my contribution should also benefit.</P>
    <P>The Government is embarking on administrative change rather than real reform. The most important recommendation of the Brennan report is that all new public consultant appointments be on the basis of a commitment to work exclusively in the public sector. However, the Government has chosen not to include that essential reform in its package of measures. We are urged to wait on the Hanly report, but I suspect that the powerful consultants lobby has been at work and unless the Government champions this proposal, it will be shredded in negotiations with Mr. Finbarr Fitzpatrick and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The administrative changes will mean less democratic accountability. Few will lament the passing of the existing health boards, but where will the democratic input be? There is a reference in the Prospectus report to Oireachtas representation at the level of the four regional health offices but there is no detail and the Minister would not indicate, in his response to my question on Tuesday, what the composition of the Health Services Executive will be.</P>
    <P>These reports come at a time of escalating Government cuts. As beds are closed, as queues lengthen, as services for people with disabilities diminish and as people just above the income limit struggle to pay for GP visits, the Government will wave these reports at us and make more promises of a world-class health service &ndash; but not yet. It is not good enough and we will not stand for it. Sinn Féin will continue to campaign for a truly reformed health service which cherishes all of our people equally. If the Minister embarks on that course, he will have our whole-hearted support and co-operation in that endeavour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we need health service reform because most people acknowledge that the health service is in a shambles. We are treating people in car parks, storage areas for dead bodies and on trolleys for days. In drawing up the report, there should have been a greater reliance on people in the health service. If one was drawing up a report on the taxation system, we would not employ medical consultants. It should be likewise with accountants. That is why they have missed the point in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are now three reports with three different sets of recommendations. This is a recipe for confusion. The large number of reports should have been collated. We should have gone forward with a definitive plan for the health service. Com<Col N="21" />ing on the back of 120 other reports in the past few years, the public should be forgiven for their cynicism in not believing there will be a bright new future for the health service.</P>
    <P>The reports identify two sets of villains who are responsible for all the ills in the health service, namely, the health board representatives and consultants. It is wrong to tar all consultants with the one brush because a substantial number of them do a good job. However, there is a small group which has a major power base, of which it will not let go, and it will have to be addressed. They are largely based in regional centres of excellence, in which we propose to carry out a great deal of treatment.</P>
    <P>Some 97% of health board budgets are predetermined, therefore, the influence in financial terms of health board representatives is negligible. Local representatives represent local views and ensure that people receive a degree of openness, transparency and accountability. Certain basic services should be provided at local hospitals on a seven day a week, 24 hours a day basis. If someone arrives at the hospital with an asthma attack or a heart attack, if a woman arrives in labour or if someone is haemorrhaging badly, hospitals should be able to cope with these situations. They should be able to stabilise such cases, treat them and send them to regional centres of excellence. It is worth noting that the earlier the medical intervention, the better the outcome. People have no difficulty with travelling for major operations and accept that we cannot have all sorts of specialist units in every hospital.</P>
    <P>Our regional centres of excellence are operating at emergency levels at present. They have 100% bed occupancy and cannot cope with the number of patients they have. If we persist with the plan to close 22 accident and emergency departments, it will have a disastrous effect on the elective work in these major hospitals. We will have regular cancellations of operating lists.</P>
    <P>The accident and emergency unit in Monaghan General Hospital was closed which in turn overloaded the accident and emergency department at Cavan General Hospital, with the result that those people were put in beds which had been reserved for elective surgery. This situation will develop nationally if this practice continues. Another result of the closure of Monaghan's accident and emergency department is that there are ongoing industrial relations problems in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, simply because nurses cannot get to attend patients with head injuries for a period of two hours.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that every minor injury, from a broken finger to a broken toe, is channelled through a regional centre of excellence. It is uncalled for and will lead to a clogging up of the system. The regional centres of excellence should be allowed to get on with their specialty work. Giving them work which can be adequately handled at local hospital level is the wrong step.</P>
    <P>While these reports recommend a hub and spoke system within the health service, the <Col N="22" />national spatial strategy recommends hub and gateway towns. However, we now have a situation where one Department states that a hub town should have a hospital and another department is taking the hospital away. There is a breakdown in communications in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate because this marks the beginning of the largest ever reform of the health services in Ireland, which aims to put patients first. The reforms before us put patients before politicians, boards, structures and bureaucracy. They will assert the public interest before the many vested interests involved and will bring a rational and affordable basis for quality health services to the whole population. Summer 2003 will be seen as an historic time in Irish health policy. It is the time when the scale of our reforms matches the scale of our investment in health services, when the focus moves to action and implementation and away from argument and analysis. This is the beginning of a reform process that will continue for some years. It will require energy and commitment from Government. I assure the House that this will be sustained over the coming years. I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for his courage, vision, determination and energy in driving this process forward. It will require a willingness to embrace change from everybody involved in the health services. People should not be looking over their shoulders at past positions or what other groups are doing, but should look forward to real improvement for patients and the public. The process will require reasoned and informed debate in the House and elsewhere, not the point-scoring and rhetoric that leaves the public weary and dispirited about our capacity as elected representatives to drive real reform for the benefit of patients.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to record our appreciation for a job well done by the 12 members of the Brennan Commission, who made their expertise available in the public interest, and the authors of the Prospectus report. These reports form a solid basis for major aspects of the Government's reform programme. The forthcoming Hanly report on medical staffing and hospital services will complement these two reports. It will form a third pillar for reform of the health services nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to review the actions the Government has decided to take on foot of these reports, as the Minister, Deputy Martin, has ably done so already. I wish to address an aspect of the analysis of the Government's reform policy that has been offered to the public since we published our reports. The public has been offered an analysis that the Government's health reform plans are all very well but the so-called funding issue has not been solved. This analysis would have us believe that health is substantially under-funded in Ireland and that there is need to raise <Col N="23" />taxes to provide funds for health spending. It argues that we must increase the proportion of national income spent on health to keep up with European Union standards. This view ignores the facts, all of which lead to the conclusion that the issue of health funding has been addressed.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy and our tax policies have allowed us to provide an additional &euro;5 billion in funding since in 1997. In this challenging year, the state of the economy and our tax policies have enabled us to provide an additional &euro;800 million for health services, an increase of 10%. If we had asked in June 1997 whether increasing health spending by &euro;5 billion would solve the health funding issue, the answer would have been an incredulous and resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; from all the analysts. If we had asked how we would find an extra &euro;5 billion, the answer from some would have been the same as that offered today &ndash; raise taxes, increase the health levy and PRSI contributions. The last thing the advocates of higher taxes would have talked about would have been strong economic growth, low taxes and full employment. However, this is where the new resources have come from to increase spending on our health policy. The health funding issue is about the health of our economy. It is about reaching our economic potential by removing the barriers to growth and maintaining full employment with low taxes.</P>
    <P>To put it in an international perspective, this week the OECD released its annual health figures that showed that between 1990 and 2001, Irish spending on health per person grew at an annual rate of 6.7% per annum. That is the second highest rate among all OECD countries and double the OECD average. It is 13 times the level of growth and spending on health in Finland. It is more than three times the growth rate of Sweden and twice that of Germany and the US. We are catching up internationally in health spending even though many OECD countries have older populations and more expensive health care systems. Our health spending as a proportion of national income is now at an OECD average of 8.4% and is higher than Finland, Spain and Britain. We now spend &euro;2,300 on health care for every person in the State, more than is spent in France and greater than the EU average. Indeed, the French Government recently described increases in health spending in 2001 and 2002 as particularly steep. It was talking about 4% compared to our spend of 8.4% per annum.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in the world can policy on health spending be divorced form the state of the economy. All our increases have been possible due to our successful economy. Going forward, that success will depend on maintaining low taxes on work and enterprise and opening up more areas to competition. This brings to mind that famous Clinton slogan, &ldquo;It is the economy, stupid.&rdquo; The funding issue is now the economy. We can and will maintain continued increases in health spend<Col N="24" />ing if we generate the resources from real economic activity. The Government is committed to prioritising resources for health. If we reach our growth potential of 5% in real terms &ndash; higher than most countries &ndash; we can expect to maintain the ability to fund some of the highest increases in health spending in the world. However, if we give up on economic growth, take it for granted or stifle it with new taxes, we will simply shoot ourselves in the foot and cause a real health funding crisis, as happened during the 1980s.</P>
    <P>The focus of health policy now is reform rather than funding. Some of the Opposition parties and spokespersons now recognise this. We know how to raise resources and prioritise resources. It is now about how we utilise them. We must better manage the resources we generate and measure the results in every area. As in other areas of public services, we must focus on outcomes, not ownerships. We must align incentives that influence people with the outcome we and the public want. We have to be more flexible and creative in applying new resources or savings to new services.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to press on with the reforms which commenced last week. They are aimed at achieving well-managed, sustainable quality health services on a national basis. We are determined that the reforms will make a visible difference to patients and users of our health services. We are also determined to ensure that scarce, valuable public resources are used efficiently to deliver the health services people want and need.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the OECD analysis on health I wish to raise. It states:</P>
    <P>The increase in public and private spending on pharmaceuticals has been one of the main drivers of rising health expenditure in many OECD countries in recent years, reflecting the introduction of new and more expensive drugs. Pharmaceutical spending rose by more than 70%, in real terms, between 1990 and 2001 in Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Sweden and the US. Pharmaceuticals now account for more than 10% of total health spending in nearly all OECD countries, and over 20% of health spending in France and Italy.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, for example, the cost of the drugs payment scheme has doubled since it started from &euro;140 million in 2000 to a budgeted &euro;280 million in 2003. In the GMS, the cost of drugs, medicines, appliances and pharmacists' fees is budgeted to be &euro;660 million this year.</P>
    <P>There is a vital public interest in controlling costs in the use of drugs. That is why I favour the payment for generic drugs where they are available. The Government has accepted this recommendation from the Brennan Commission. Pharmacists are an integral element of the health care delivery system. They see it is in the public interest to control drugs and pharmacy costs. The forthcoming report from Deloitte &amp; Touche on the GMS will also inform the Government's <Col N="25" />approach on controlling costs, alongside the analysis and recommendations from the Brennan Commission.</P>
    <P>Health reform is at the heart of public service reform. It touches everyone in the State, as it involves 40% of our public servants. Many of these excellent public servants are de-motivated by the comments from some politicians who should be better informed. It is of great importance for our future well-being as a society. It is a central task of Government to lead and implement reforms. The Government is committed to achieving fundamental reform in its lifetime and it is prepared to be judged by the House and the public on this task.</P>

    <P>I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Martin, does the best he can and I have said so on many occasions, but that is not to say it is good enough. I have a grave suspicion that the new health strategy has more to do with a Government that is bloated, inefficient, out of favour with the people and in dire need of a public relations success, <Col N="26" />because that means everything to it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The health issue affects every family in the land and the perception, even on the part of those who are not sick, is that if the Government has a chance of doing what it did prior to the previous general election, they will have a huge problem if they become sick. This is what the opinion polls show. As far as the Government is concerned, the perception is wrong.</P>
      <P>Regarding the health strategy, I am as long a Member of the House as many on the Government side, and I was taken in by it. When I heard waiting lists would be abolished in two years, I could not see at the time how it could be done, but I thought the resources would be made available to do it. Little did I think that two years later and a year after the general election, 29,000 people would still be on the waiting list and that it would be longer than ever. The Government knew what was happening 18 months ago. It knew the general election was coming up and that hospital waiting lists would be a huge problem at the polls. As a response, it produced this waiting lists target. I do not know if the Minister believed at the time it would work, but it was a failure. Now we have this health reform plan.</P>
      <P>There have been leaks in the media in recent months that there would be a revolution in the health service and that the villains of the piece and the cause of all the trouble, local politicians on health boards, would be dispensed with.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must show that the reform will work this time and will do so at local level. When he canvasses in the local elections in a year's time and the general election in three or four years time, this health reform will be a huge issue, and rightly so. If the changes were made for the right reasons, there may be some hope the reform might work, but the foundation is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three reports, two of which have been published. Is it not ironic that as we come to the end of this session, we have not seen the Hanly report? It was possible to abolish health boards before that report was laid before the Houses. The reason given that it has not been published yet is that some of the stakeholders have not signed off on it. Is it not remarkable that it was possible to bring forward the other two <Col N="27" />reports? The Minister's timing has been impeccable. I do not think I will be too far wrong when I say that the Hanly report is likely to be published during the August bank holiday weekend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be released when the Dáil is not in session. Health boards have no clout and it makes little difference what they say in the Hanly report about what is happening in the health service because they know they will be disbanded. This has been cleverly done, publishing these two reports first. I compliment those involved who put a great deal of effort into them and much expertise is evident. However, we should have had the Hanly report today to let us see the precise delivery of the health service and if there is a need for centres of excellence, something with which most agree and with which there would be no great trouble.</P>
      <P>However, we have seen in the national spatial strategy how huge areas of the country will be left without railways, decentralisation and so on. This was underpinned by the outcome yesterday of the agriculture negotiations in Brussels. If the Hanly report shows and the Government accepts that there will be huge areas of the country where people will not be able to avail of the health services to which they are entitled for reasons of time and distance, there will be uproar. Large centres of population will be seen to have won out again and people in areas of lower density of population will either have to travel too far or wait too long to obtain health care which means they will be second class citizens.</P>
      <P>I will say the following now because I will not have the opportunity to do so in the House when the Hanly report is published. I am sure the Minister remembers when he gave an undertaking to me and a deputation from the health board in Ballinasloe prior to the previous general election that the community hospital in Tuam would be built. That was one of his general election promises.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that and the Taoiseach came to Tuam two days later and gave the same guarantee. There is no getting away from that. I want to hold both of them to that guarantee to the people prior to the previous general election that Tuam and the surrounding areas would have their hospital. In so far as the Hanly report is concerned, in the case of a hospital such as Portiuncula in Ballinasloe&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>The Minister did invest in Portiuncula hospital but he was not the first to do <Col N="28" />that. The Government of which I was a member years before put money into it. I want the Minister to state that as far as the Hanley report is concerned, because of its position neither the hospital's maternity or accident and emergency unit will be closed or services downgraded. That is the bottom line.</P>
      <P>Will the people I mentioned to the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, get a better service as a result of these reforms and what will the Hanley report do for those parts of the country that are not as populous as Dublin? Those are the crucial tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;a politician seemingly more interested in mileage payments than in the health services. Localism and gombeenism will not serve the people of the State or deliver the health services they deserve and are paying for.</P>
      <P>The health services have received huge injections of current and capital funding in the past six years and, to be fair to the previous Government, there were significant increases while it was in office. By 1997, however, we were delivering just &euro;3.4 billion into the health services and by 2003 this figure had risen to in excess of &euro;8.6 billion, an increase of 150% in current funding.</P>
      <P>The figures are the same on the capital side. In 1997 we pumped &euro;138 million into capital services and this has increased to &euro;514 million. We all know the statistics, we have heard them often enough. The health services' current and capital expenditure has increased over the past six years by well in excess of 160%. As a percentage of GNP it has grown dramatically and as the Minister of State pointed out earlier, it has increased far in excess of the equivalent figures elsewhere in the OECD countries.</P>
      <P>The rate of increase has been dramatic and we all know, if we are being truthful with ourselves, that it has not been matched by a similar level of improvement in health services. By no objective standard has the increase in funding been paralleled by improvements in the delivery of services. That is what we should be debating, not scoring political points.</P>

      <P>The fundamental question arises as to how a service which has seen such lavish increases in public funds should at the same time be the cause of so many complaints. The public has a right to complain &ndash; the health services in this State consume a vast amount of revenue but an equivalent level of service is not delivered. From the volume of complaints about the health services, the answer is evident &ndash; we have not been receiving value for money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not difficult to establish that there are problems. Like most Members, I am inundated with complaints about aspects of the health service. A regular complaint is that to get a service one must be sick between 9.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on week days. A GMS patient looking for a GP outside those hours will be unable to get one, and Deputy Olivia Mitchell, who has been on a health board for a long time, knows that as well as I do. She knows that when a person in the greater Dublin area looks for a GP outside office hours, he or she must wait endlessly for an on-call service to come out which will not even deliver a third rate service. A stranger who knows nothing about, and has no access to, the person's health records and knows nothing of his or her circumstances will visit and, invariably, tell the person to take an aspirin and see his GP on Monday. If it is really serious, an ambulance will be called and the person sent to the local accident and emergency ward. Both Deputy Olivia Mitchell and Deputy Durkan know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies have been on health boards with me and both of them have complained about it. The situation has grown worse and now consumes even more resources. All of us on health boards are responsible for allowing that situation to get out of hand. In the GMS a group of service providers have been unilaterally allowed to curtail their hours and service and have been permitted to determine what they will do, when they will do it and the manner in which they will do it. No service providers in the private sector or elsewhere in the State sector would be allowed to operate like that. We should be honest, that is an area where a significant problem exists.</P>
      <P>We should look at the other end of the medical spectrum &ndash; consultant provision. The reality is that consultants consume a vast amount of resources and do not deliver, although I accept Fine Gael has a difficulty taking them on.</P>

      <P>The most fundamental change of all will have to take place in the management of services. Again if we were honest, we would <Col N="30" />accept that the management of the services is wrong.</P>
      <P>I compliment Professor Brennan and her group, they have done a phenomenal job. I also compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who has shown the courage to bring this forward. It is better than the sneering, classic Fine Gael response that we get together to try to solve the problem. Having listened to the tripe from the Opposition and the characteristic responses from Deputy Durkan, we have no reason to expect anything positive from Members on the other side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the health service reform programme outlined last week by the Government. It provides the framework to deal with the very real but too often overlooked health service needs of the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of debate about the protection of services in rural areas. We often see demonstrations from local hospital action committees outside the gates of Leinster House and there are Members who were elected on the basis of very specific local health needs. Deputies will remember signs such as &ldquo;No Cavan trolleys for Monaghan patients&rdquo;, and some TDs lost their seats because of local health demands &ndash; one Fine Gael member in particular comes to mind. This has not been the case in Dublin, where there is no tradition of electing representatives on the basis of local health demands.</P>
      <P>This is not because people have fewer health needs or no attachment to the traditional hospitals, it is because people accept that to improve a service, the manner in which it is delivered often has to be changed.</P>
      <P>In my constituency in the past 20 years, a number of hospitals have been amalgamated, moved or closed completely. The services once provided by Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, the Meath Hospital, the Adelaide Hospital and Harcourt Street Children's Hospital are now not to be found in the same areas. I am glad to see that the Sir Patrick Dun's premises is now used for long-stay patients and the Meath Hospital is rolling out new health services to the local community.</P>
      <P>We do, however, have an attachment in Dublin to the hospitals. I have a great attachment to Harcourt Street Children's Hospital, where one of my children was very ill and was treated very well. My wife and I were very sad to see it closed but, hopefully, as a result of those closures and amalgamations we will get a better service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I was in charge of planning the services, I would probably have sought a different configuration and some of the now abandoned sights could still make a contribution to local health services. The change, however, has been made and I fully accept the professionalism of those who say that the new configuration of services is <Col N="31" />improving standards and achieving positive outcomes for patients.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there is a major problem whereby Dublin hospitals are asked to take an unreasonably large burden of cases from the regions. The waiting list figures show that Dublin people must wait longer for elective hospital treatments than people elsewhere. This is not because the treatments are only available in Dublin, it is because patients are being referred to Dublin for treatment even when their local hospitals have the capacity to treat them. Unfortunately, an absurd situation exists where people are joining waiting lists in Dublin when these lists are either shorter or non-existent in their local hospital. I do not regard the planning of hospital services as a threat to regional services; it should have the opposite effect. There are too many services which are only available in Dublin. If the principle of having regional centres of excellence is developed, that will automatically mean the availability of a greater range and quality of service outside Dublin. The national planning of hospital services should also mean that we could have proper enforcement of the principle that where a treatment is available locally, it should be used locally. Without requiring any major developments or expansion in bed or doctor numbers, this will both increase the number of treatments and begin to address the serious capacity issues in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is not just in the area of hospital waiting lists that Dublin has needs which have to be addressed. In nearly every other area of care service, needs arise because of the nature of a densely-developed and socially-mixed city. The accident and emergency departments of the major Dublin hospitals are consistently under pressure and see an incredible range of cases every day. When one sees the Dublin accident and emergency departments in action, especially at weekends, one can understand why measures to relieve that pressure should be a national priority. We cannot just talk about the number of people who present at accident and emergency units because of drink or drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. Unfortunately, unlike many other speakers, I will not be complimentary because the series of reports before us are nothing more than a well-concocted plan to deflect public attention from the total mess that has been made of the health services by the current Administration and its predecessors. Over the past six years, every time something appeared to go wrong there was a quick application of a financial bandage to the system. We have now arrived at a situation where the Minister, the Minister of State and their predecessors are attempting to placate the consultants, the GPs and the administrators but they have forgotten about the consumers. Massive amounts of money are being pumped into a system in order to produce something, but nothing has appeared. We have had less value for money on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>Before the last general election, and this is what it is all about, everything was calculated to tide the Government over the threshold of the general election. That was the golden goose that had to be cooked in the public arena and when the Government got over the general election, everything would be rosy. It had a health strategy &ndash; a ten-year plan. That was only a year and a half ago. Where is that now, and all the money that went with it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's great-grandchildren will never see it. In the meantime, the election took place. What do we have now? We have two reports today, and there is another report. Various administrators have been brought to the media training services to assist them in codding the rest of us on what is contained in the <Col N="33" />plan. The ten-year plan means nothing and it will never see the light of day. Announcements as to what will happen are now leaked beforehand but when the Ministers are toasting their toes in Roaring Water Bay during the holiday period, that is when something will happen. The House will not be sitting then but that is when the real action will be taken. That is when we will know what is contained in the plans before us and the plan we have not yet seen. Has anybody asked whether the plan we have not yet seen conflicts with some of the other information available to us? That will be really embarrassing for the Minister. What will we do then?</P>
      <P>Like a number of other Members of the House, I spent a long time as a member of a health board. We saw the changes taking place where an attempt was being made to give a perception of delivery. Nothing was happening, yet it was costing more and more money. The greatest laugh of all, however, was about two and a half or three years ago when there were enormous changes in administration and a significant influx of personnel, but where were the personnel going? They were all going into administration.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board, as it was then called, there was a chief executive, a community care programme manager, a special hospital services programme manager and a general hospital services programme manager. That was a small number of people but there was direct access to the top of the service by way of a telephone call at any time. There were no answering machines then or people telling customers their calls were being logged and somebody would call them back in ten days' time. There was none of that then. There was a direct, hands-on approach to the services.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department then got together and decided this was an area to invest in heavily in the run up to the general election. They thought it would look good and that the consumers, the consultants and the GPs would be very impressed with it but nobody cares about the patients. What rights have they under the patients charter, which was often talked about?</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board, where there was one programme manager that was multiplied by something like seven and the board was broken up into three divisions.</P>

The Members opposite have been in <Col N="34" />power for most of the past 20 years yet the Minister says it was the Opposition's idea. It is a pity they do not take up more of the Opposition's ideas from time to time.</P>
      <P>What happened then was that an internal wrangle began to develop among the administrators, which exists to this day. The changes in administration that were made caused friction within the service and resulted in a delay in delivery. There was a perceptible diminution in the delivery of services from the moment the new administrative structures were set up, virtually on the same day.</P>
      <P>I have been living with the same services the Minister has been living with and as I said to him previously, he is a nice guy. The Minister and the Minister of State are very nice fellows and I hate being nasty to them but they are absolutely useless. They do not know how to take the service by the scruff of the neck&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know but they tend to interrupt and upset me from time to time. I am serious about this issue. I cannot believe the Minister could preside over the kind of debacle we have seen over the past few years and not put up his hands and say he is sorry. He keeps telling us that the Minister for Finance is giving him wheelbarrows full of money every five minutes, but he is losing it. I am not surprised the Minister is losing it and if the performance over the next five years is anything like that of the past five or six years, God help this country.</P>
      <P>All we have now, in the last week before the Dáil goes into recess, is a number of reports that have been publicised. One has not been publicised but has been profusely leaked. Those reports are the fig leaf that will protect the Government and its backbenchers over the seasonal break. When the House reconvenes in September or whenever, all the nitty-gritty that we have been unable to see at this stage will have emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing that I have seen so far gives me any indication that anybody knows or cares about how the services will be delivered to the general public. We know the position as far as consultants are concerned. We will have a consultant based service in the future and the nasty, dirty politicians who were poking their noses into local health committees and health boards will be <Col N="35" />removed from the process. This is real reform with punch, oomph and meaning. The screws will really be put on then. There will be no uproar or backlash from politicians because they will have been removed from the health service. The Minister will be able to say that as the service is now consultant based, we will have to blame consultants rather than the Minister in future.</P>

      <P>I am sick listening to Ministers inform the House they have no function in certain matters. That is incorrect, Ministers are directly responsible. The reason the country has gone the way it has is that Ministers state at every opportunity they have no function regarding matters which have been raised. They have a function, however, when there is good news and are quick to tell the House how good they are and how many goodies they are delivering.</P>
      <P>I hate to personalise this issue, but I do not know what the Minister can do to apologise to the public for making such an awful mess of the health service. The longer he remains in office pursuing his current policy, the worse the situation will become. He can consult all the consultants as he likes, commission as many reports as he likes, employ as many spin doctors and PR consultants he can think of or talk to his backbenchers and provide them with all the necessary information on how to withstand the hail of fire which will be directed at them, but it will not help. He needs to take a simple course of action, namely, scrutinise a segment of the service and find out how other countries manage to deliver a service while we cannot.</P>
      <P>It is symbolic of the edifice created by the Minister that when wards have been closed across the country and throughout Dublin and the possibility of treating patients in the car park of a hospital is being contemplated, we are sending patients abroad under the treatment purchase scheme to countries and jurisdictions which are providing the services we are failing to provide here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been a member of a health board for the past 15 years, I acknowledge the great work health boards have done for 30 years in providing health services. Significant advances have taken place and the number of patients treated has doubled over this period. I accept that modernisation of the health service is <Col N="36" />necessary and I welcome the reforms proposed by the Minister. I particularly welcome the reduction in the number of health agencies by almost half. While the proposal to appoint a single national agency to control all our hospitals is welcome, we must make sure small hospitals in remote areas are looked after.</P>
      <P>I accept that centres of excellence cannot be provided in every corner of the country and should be regionally based. We want to modernise the structure of the health service to bring about better quality patient care for everyone. Interest groups have been mentioned frequently and it has been suggested that true reform is not possible. This is wrong. Surely we can agree on one overall point, namely, that only one interest, that of patients, should be considered when planning and delivering health services.</P>
      <P>The objective of reform has been to deliver the maximum benefit to the maximum number of people. The health strategy sets out detailed service objectives for every area of the system. These are based on international best practice and on the idea that every person, irrespective of where he or she lives, should have fair access to high quality care. The reform programme sets out the structures required to deliver these service objectives, and we must press ahead and implement them.</P>
      <P>Our system has to be more flexible and capable of delivering high quality service which is open to all where it is needed. Services must be planned on the basis of evidence which shows how to maximise successful outcomes for patients. Where work practices hinder the achievement of these objectives, they should change. These points should be agreed by everybody before negotiations begin.</P>
      <P>The health system is now our largest employer. It is a dynamic sector which has expanded significantly in terms of funding and the quality of care provided. The fact that 180,000 more cases are being dealt with than six years ago is testament to this. We must push forward to develop services and all groups must acknowledge their part in the process of change.</P>
      <P>The Government has committed itself to a health service which continues to reward its professionals well. In many areas, Irish health professionals are the best paid in Europe. There is also a commitment to continued investment in improving services, For example, investment in new buildings and refurbishment of facilities is at a historical high.</P>
      <P>The public has strongly supported the prioritisation of investment in health. We have reached the stage where the equivalent of every euro raised in income tax is invested in health services. In return, it is proper that the public demands that we work to ensure maximum returns from this investment. I strongly support the policy that where funds are involved, the interest of the public patient must come first. I look forward to a better health service in the future and wish the Minister well in his proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the attempt to reform the health services and congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their efforts in this regard, not as a member of the same party, but as a health board member of 20 years standing who has observed the difficulties of delivering services in the regions. While many things are being blamed for the ills of services, as a long-standing member of a health board, I have experienced major difficulties in trying to achieve agreement on the ground on supporting and locating new services. I welcome, therefore, the proposal in the reform to establish a national hospitals office. I do so from experience in observing a health board struggle to secure services for a region and obtain agreement on their location.</P>
      <P>I recognise the difficulties in Dublin hospitals, particularly with regard to waiting lists. Over the years, large numbers of people have left my region, the Midland Health Board area, to obtain services in Dublin because agreement could not be reached on the provision of such services in the region. I refer specifically to the national cancer strategy, which I watched unfold following its introduction by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan. I wished it well and supported it at health board level. For five years the service on offer could not be taken up because we could not achieve agreement among the three acute hospitals in the region. Such difficulties have led to the problems we are experiencing in the health service. On the one hand, funding is made available for services, while on the other years are allowed to elapse before it is drawn down and patients, unfortunately, suffer as a result.</P>
      <P>When the Midland Health Board finally reached agreement on the location of services under the national cancer strategy, a High Court case was taken challenging its decision. Subsequently, I proposed at health board level that rather than await further offers from the Department to provide services, members of the board should go away for a brainstorming day and, with the help of politicians and consultants, establish the role of the health board, define the needs of the local area and seek agreement on action to be taken in the event of such proposal being made by the Department. We did not succeed in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have cited one health board region, but I have seen this happen throughout the country. The Minister's reform plans in this regard are correct. We should not continue down the road we have been taking for years, whereby, for example, a fully funded service is offered, no agreement is reached on its location and no action is taken for five years, as happened in my health board region. Central Government is not to blame. The reality is that counties will naturally fly their county flag and unfortunately local politicians will have to support it. I supported my sister county, Offaly, when the national cancer strategy was introduced, a decision which was not well received in my home county. For years I found <Col N="38" />myself finding fighting a battle to ensure the service was secured, yet the public could not accept it by way of delivering a service. In that regard, I welcome this.</P>
    <P>I welcome most of what is contained in the national hospitals office proposal and see it as the way forward. I also recognise that the aims can be summed up as providing better patient care and better value. The idea of making the management of the health service more structured so that it can provide a better service for the patient and the community is a simple one and well overdue. I say this as a health board member of 20 years standing.</P>
    <P>These reforms come on the back of the national health strategy, the most comprehensive and ambitious health strategy ever produced in this State. The follow-on from this must be the health service reforms. In order to implement the health strategy, a number of changes have to be made to the overall structure of the health services and this is where the health services reform programme comes in. The current structures have been in place for 30 years. I have been a member of a health board for 20 years and while I have seen great changes in the commercial and banking worlds, I have seen no change whatsoever in the delivery of health services. The time has come for change. This is not a cop-out as has been suggested; it is a recognition of the significant demand from the public and, more importantly, the need for the Department to deliver the service throughout the regions rather than having them centrally based.</P>
    <P>The core of the health service reform programme is the modernisation of health structures so that it can deal with demands placed on the system now and in the future. We need to put in place a system that will be able to cope with any changes or challenges future decades may throw up. I welcome the main element of the reform programme, namely, the major rationalisation of existing health agencies, including the abolition of the health boards, to reduce fragmentation. While local politicians, as members of boards, may now feel that the heat is on them, it is fair to recognise that the boards are being dismantled in their entirety and not as a cop-out to blame them. It is a recognition that the boards have gone past their sell-by date.</P>
    <P>In my region and others, I have seen that boards can never agree. While I asked that the consultants come together to map out a strategy for my board, they could not agree on this. Politicians on the board provided local involvement, yet when it came to medical strategies we involved consultants but we could never get agreement from them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the national hospitals office. I want to get away from the day where services are decided upon by the level of political support in a particular county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no other issue that has engaged the minds of the public in recent times <Col N="39" />as much as that of the shambles in the health service. It is the common currency of every local meeting I attend, of public discussions and many individuals that attend my advice clinics. The immediate problem is that of waiting lists and it is now a matter of waiting to get on the waiting list. They do not see any light at the end of the tunnel; it seems that someone might only deal with their problem somewhere in the dim and distant future.</P>
      <P>My constituency of Dublin South-Central is the location for Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. The local people are, or rather were, proud of this facility even though the hospital serves the country as well as the locality. The pride in this hospital has changed, not because of the staff or those providing the facility, rather it is because of the lack of supports and services that are available to the hospital to deliver an adequate service. It is extraordinary that 25 beds have recently been closed. The Minister is well aware of this as it has been raised on a number occasions. A local public meeting was held on this issue this week. The immediate concern is that the procedures that might otherwise have been engaged in are now being postponed again. It is reckoned that 2,000 procedures will not be carried out there this year on account of the closure of these beds.</P>
      <P>There are other concerns apart from the closure of beds and this is highlighted by the establishment of a parent's group of children attending the hospital, or who have attended it in the past. While the group is loud in its praise for the staff and the services provided in the hospital, there are major concerns about the lack of equipment and the failure to update facilities in the hospital. The report the group commissioned is damning of the circumstances that exist.</P>
      <P>There is something grossly inequitable in having a system whereby patients may be eligible to go outside the State for treatment while hospital beds are being closed. The procedures are not particularly sophisticated or elaborate, the system is simply not able to provide them here. It is extraordinary that funding is available to allow individuals to avail of the patient treatment fund while the facility is not available locally. Many of those that come to my advice clinics do not want to avail of the service. They want to be treated at home and the elderly especially are nervous of going abroad. While some people accept and avail of this facility, it is far from the optimum for them and they are not comfortable with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brennan report makes a number of recommendations, including the rationalisation of the existing health agencies. I have one simple question for the Minister, should the changes implemented. When I table a parliamentary question to the Minister, will I actually get a reply within a reasonable period? I appreciate the way the current system operates in that the Minister replies to my question, the reply invariably lets me know that it is not his direct responsibility and the query has been passed to the health board. I <Col N="40" />regret to say that weeks usually pass before I get a reply. There may be questions of bureaucracy and a lack of facilities. It is unacceptable that one should have to wait two or three weeks for a reply. The replies I receive are often evasive and inconclusive and leave me in a position where I cannot provide any reasonable information to the person that came to me in the first place. I should add that I am not, and never have been, a member of any health board. I recognise the need for reform in this area and would like to see it happening sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>In the House earlier this week I raised the issue of two young autistic adults awaiting places with the Irish Society for Autism to be funded by the health board. This has dragged on for months and there has been no response from the board. This is unacceptable. I hope the Minister will engage in this issue and seek a substantial reply on behalf of those parents. The streamlining of the health board system has to kick in sooner rather than later. It is unacceptable that bureaucracy or anything else should hold up the system to this extent.</P>
    <P>When it was announced that the medical card scheme would be extended to everyone over 70 it seemed like an attractive idea. I thought it was a good idea and, having looked at the figures, it seemed as though it would work. The glitches have now shown up in the system. At the time, the estimate was 39,000 eligible patients, but this grew to 77,000 with an associated increased cost of &euro;36 million. The principle of making medical cards available to elderly people has to be lauded. However, it is inequitable that people over 70 that can comfortably afford to pay for a medical service are given medical cards while young families that are a little above the income limit are refused them. Some of them are now afraid to go to a doctor as they cannot afford to pay. Invariably, parents of young children find they suffer as they feel it is more important that the children be treated. If one has to make two visits to a doctor in a month the cost can range from &euro;80 to &euro;90 depending on one's area of residence.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the explanation as to why it is not a question of funding but reform. It did not take two or three reports to establish that. Anybody on the street would have been able to observe that that reform was the fundamental issue. Reform entails grasping the nettle and dealing with the issues highlighted in the reports. It must be asked why it has taken so long to discover that the problem is not only one of funding &ndash; the availability or lack of which has been much debated &ndash; but the need for fundamental reform, which must be addressed sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The question of dealing with consultants has been referred to by a number of speakers. The issue was well analysed in the Brennan report and I subscribe to its findings in this regard. It is for the Minister to grasp the nettle. It is no longer sufficient to pass the buck and prescribe what other Members must do. He has been provided with the detail of what needs to be done. It is a <Col N="41" />matter of having the will to implement recommendations and decisions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to accident and emergency units. It is a salutary lesson to visit St. James's Hospital in my constituency late on a Friday or Saturday evening and observe the stress to which members of staff are exposed. They work very well under severe pressure. There must be a radical reform of accident and emergency units, including the way emergencies are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Eoin Ryan's remarks on the possible application of the RAPID programme to addressing some of the problems with the health care systems. The programme was meant to be available in my constituency, but there has been an unfortunate lack of implementation of funding for all areas, not only in health.</P>

      <P>In the past, employment and economic failure dominated political discussion, but over the past five years health has become the No. 1 public issue. That is as it should be because no public service is more important. Developing a modern health system is the goal we should all share. That is why I welcome this debate and the health service reform programme. It is an intelligent and comprehensive blueprint for the development of the health system. The two reports which are being used as the basis for the programme make an unanswerable case for change. If we want to have the kind of service set out in the health strategy, we must implement the recommended reforms. No vested interest should be allowed to stand in the way.</P>
      <P>We all know where problems are to be found in the health system. While the need for improvement is obvious, the way of achieving it is never simple. Many people in this House and outside believe a magic wand can be applied by the Minister and the Minister for Finance to cure all the nation's ills. Unfortunately, this approach undermines the implementation of real solutions.</P>
      <P>More than in any other area of public activity, the answers to problems in the health service are always complex and require action across a wide range of fronts and over a sustained period. Those who sit on the sidelines and call for instant solutions help nobody. The need for rational debate is huge, but, too often, this is the last thing that happens. A sense of perspective regarding achievements and challenges is missing. Every international study on our system says it provides good care for large numbers of people and is on a par with other developed nations in terms of overall quality. While the health service has problems, nobody outside the country considers it to be a Third World service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with everything else, there is no point in looking to the Opposition for a real contribution <Col N="42" />to the formulation of health policy. Day after day we hear the empty rhetoric and crocodile tears of those whose only interest is to try to exploit often tragic situations.</P>

Realising that they might have to defend their policies, party members have backed off and contented themselves with praising their vision and commitment.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael's policy is, as usual, whatever it thinks the public wants to hear on a given day. Many Deputies enjoyed the tenure of Deputy Olivia Mitchell's front bench predecessors, where the policy on universal health insurance seemed to change every week. The party ended up fighting the last general election on a platform of radical change accompanied with a commitment to retain everything.</P>
      <P>That kind of thing is to be expected from opportunistic parties, but, unfortunately, much of the media coverage has been little better. It is increasingly clear that various elements of the media see health as providing a rich supply of human interest stories rather than an area on which they should provide balanced coverage.</P>

      <P>The reality is dramatically different. The fact, disputed by no objective sources, is that over the past six years, every element of the system has seen real increases in funding and care. The 180,000 extra cases being dealt with in the hospitals this year are real people receiving real treatment from real staff. It is amazing that no sense of this can be found in the coverage of hospital issues. It does not fit the storeyline, so it is ignored. A similar situation applies to disability care service, community, psychiatric and palliative care services, out of hours GP care and so on.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly, many people do not receive the quality of care they require when they need it, but it appears that a new, unattainable standard has been established when covering health issues, which is that until everything is done, nothing is done.</P>
      <P>We have an improving health system although it is not good enough. It has structural and, in many cases, funding problems. However, progress is being made in addressing these issues. Unless this perspective is allowed in the coverage of the system, we will never be able to hold a credible public debate on health policy. There are many aspects to this approach that must change. For example, last week, when the Minister was interviewed about the reform programme on &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo;, it was suggested that nothing had been done to reduce waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for refusing to be deflected from his commitment to development and reform. His approach will stand the test of time and I hope he is not deterred in his determination to sort out the service, which we all want to see being done.</P>

      <P>Even a cursory look at the first two volumes of the health reform trilogy bear witness to the obvious failures in the health service. In many instances it has been guilty of serving its own systems rather than patients. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, has indicated that reform will put patients before politicians, boards, structures and bureaucracy. This provides us with the opportunity to look forward to reform in this area.</P>
      <P>All the participants and providers of health care bear some responsibility and share in the blame for the failures of the health service. They must be prepared to make the changes outlined in the reports and which the Government is determined to implement. They are obviously necessary.</P>
      <P>I wish the Department well in implementing change. It will be a challenge. The two published reports are an indication of the Government's determination to prioritise health care and implement change. It will not occur overnight &ndash; indeed, it will be a number of years before real differences are apparent. However, that is no reason not to have the courage to start making change and to have faith that the public will respond when services have improved. Nobody should be exempt from these changes. People are nervous of them and they are already the cause of conflict in the public arena.</P>

I have every faith in the Government and I offer <Col N="44" />my congratulations to the Minister for his courage in taking this on. It is an admirable quality in any politician, but it is necessary in a politician who is determined to bring about change and in a Government which is going to drive that change. The Government will see that the people get the health care they deserve.</P>

      <P>We have received the three reports which were anticipated. They are not the only reports this Department and this Minister have brought forward and I suspect they will not be the last. There seems to be a relentless logic in the production of reports and strategy documents from the Minister to the extent that I think we will eventually see a report entitled the &ldquo;report of the commission on health report commissions&rdquo;. One can only evaluate the evaluators at this stage. Nothing really changes in terms of public concern at the condition of the health services and the use of resources. Even the Government's response to the two reports which have been released seems to indicate that it is not adopting a clinician's approach to the health services. It is still a case of dealing with symptoms rather than trying to treat the disease. No one has confidence that the measures which have been suggested will significantly improve the delivery of services for the public.</P>
      <P>There are proposals to welcome in both reports and the Minister can be assured of some level of support on this side of the House in respect of some of them. There is a logic on economy of scale grounds to have a national authority to oversee some elements of the health service, but certainly not all. Capital grounds and the need to deliver specialised services on a national basis mean such an authority is necessary, but to move to total centralisation of the health service is to go in the wrong direction. There are areas of health service reform which require a greater degree of decentralisation. A single national authority cannot properly deliver a community care programme which is still largely based on resorting to voluntary organisations and local knowledge in the delivery of services. If the Minister can explain how that can be done, I would like to hear him do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance has come to the House to join the debate. He has tended to play the role of the ghost of Hamlet's father today. Very often the problems which have arisen in the health service have been the result of an accountant's approach which does not recognise changing demographics or acknowledge that health conditions can vary at any particular time. The approach has been to measure by cheque book. That is not to say we should not seek a better result from the money which is being spent, but it must be noted that in European <Col N="45" />terms we spend less <i>per capita</i> than many other states. Spending is still lower in terms of social protection expenditure than in any other European country, but the Government chooses to boast about providing the lowest tax rate in the EU. It would be preferable to boast about having the best quality public services. As long as the Government indulges in that sort of double think, we will see report after report into the health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a plan for bureaucratic change to be carried out at the expense of accountability. Where will be the democratic input and accountability? More importantly, these proposals fail to challenge our most fundamental problem which is the two-tier public private system. The proposals being made do not include the core Brennan recommendation that all consultants in the public sector should work exclusively in that sector.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children is notorious, as Deputy Boyle has said, for producing reports and strategies, but they are rarely implemented. Even if they are, provisions are quickly superseded by something else. In this instance we are presented with two reports at the same time, one from the Department of Finance and one from the Department of Health and Children. Will the next one be from the Bank of Ireland, the Central Bank or some other such institution? It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is being used as a mudguard by right-wingers in Cabinet who wish to destroy the health service. They seem to be trying to &ldquo;Americanise&rdquo; it and Boston is winning out.</P>
      <P>We are told the national hospitals office the Government proposes to establish will provide a strong single approach to the delivery of hospital services. Under the supposedly decentralised system we have in place at the moment, we see the closure of essential services in Louth and Monaghan. These proposals will undoubtedly give us more of the same. To help Deputies to appreciate the madness of what has occurred, I inform the House that Louth County Hospital had an excellent paediatric unit, a fine maternity unit and a first class gynaecology unit, all of which are now closed. The services involved are denied to the people of the region. The accident and emergency unit is now under threat and ludicrously, if a car accident occurred outside the hospital's gate, the victims would be brought 25 miles away to a hospital in Drogheda. We are supposed to be seeing centres of excellence at work, but I have seen no evidence of it. Perhaps this can be got right in future, but where there were fine hospitals, people are now enjoying services which are much worse than they were 30 or even 40 years ago. How does that constitute improving the health service and how does it constitute looking after one of the core facilities people need in the regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" />I ask the Minister for Health and Children to have another word with the Minister for Finance in an attempt to overcome the obstacles we face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to statements on the audit of health structures report and the commission on health funding &ndash; Brennan &ndash; report. However, I object strongly to the short time given to this important debate, particularly as a member of the Independent health alliance which was elected on a health and disability platform. It is unacceptable and totally undemocratic.</P>
      <P>In the short time I have I wish to make some very important points. We all know that our health service is in need of urgent reform and change. I welcome the recommendation in the Brennan report that the executive is to manage the health service as a unitary national service and I welcome the sections which call on consultants to work exclusively in the public sector. We must root out inequality in our health service and the patient must always come first. I accept those proposals as progressive ideas. While I do not agree with every aspect of the proposals, there are concrete ideas in the reports. We must be vigilant in the interests of patients and taxpayers. The establishment of a national hospitals office to run all publicly-funded hospitals represents a progressive step and I welcome the proposal. However, I sound a note of warning. The Government must listen to the people on the front lines of the health services.</P>
      <P>These proposals will not be worth the paper they are printed on if we do not invest in our services. Successive Governments have failed to provide the necessary infrastructure to support the health system. We have an opportunity to prioritise public spending to eradicate all health waiting lists. Reforms without investment are useless. We must face up to the word &ldquo;tax&rdquo;. If we want a quality health service, we will have to raise more taxes to fund it. We cannot have it both ways. The so-called black hole syndrome in Government circles must be challenged. We must have more efficiency and quality output, but we must also invest because if we do not, we are deceiving ourselves. It is a shame that this Government is running away from that reality. With investment, waiting lists could be eradicated within three years. Investment, efficiency and accountability would transform our health service. Those in government who seem to be obsessed with the low tax disease should take a look around them in the real world and recognise the waiting lists and the trauma. Most people would not mind paying a little extra if they were guaranteed the delivery of a top quality health service. Now is the opportunity to provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's comments this morning with regard to cross-party support on the health issue. I am open to many of the proposals he outlined, provided funding and investment are part of the package. I call for a little more respect <Col N="47" />from the Minister for Finance and other Deputies. His attitude and the attitudes of the other main parties, particularly on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night, have left much to be desired. The major parties have a great deal of baggage in terms of the Independent Deputies whom the people elected on the health platform. If the Minister is serious about consulting people and respecting those with direct experience of the downside of the Department, he has a duty to respect that mandate and democratic view. Then we can all move forward and do something practical about the health services. The key words in this debate were in the Minister's contribution, &ldquo;investment with reform&rdquo;. That is the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The demands on the health service are enormous and growing. Almost one million people were treated in our acute hospitals in 2002. That is equivalent to one quarter of the entire population of this country, in just one year. In addition, there were approximately two million consultations in out-patient departments and more than 15 million consultations in general practice.</P>
      <P>Equally, the amount of public funds we invest in the health service is enormous and growing. In 2003, we allocated over &euro;9.1 billion for health services. This is more than two and a half times greater than the &euro;3.6 billion spent in 1997. Over that same six year period, spending on health has risen from 19% of total Government expenditure to 24%. Health expenditure as a proportion of GNP has risen from 6.2% in 1997 to 8.3% this year. To put this level of investment in perspective, almost every cent of the total income tax receipts for this year, &euro;9.3 billion, will be spent on health services. In 1997, income tax receipts totalled &euro;6.6 billion and just over half of this was spent on health.</P>
      <P>These statistics clearly show that we have delivered, and are delivering, the funds necessary to develop quality health services. Now we need to ensure that the system is organised in a way which allows us to get the maximum value from this investment. The Brennan commission, which I set up, concluded that &ldquo;there is scope. . . to provide better services to those who require health care and to provide better value for the substantial investment in health services.&rdquo; This is what the reform programme is about. Make no mistake, this is about services. The point of the reform is to ensure that the investment we are already making in the system delivers improved services for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key features of the reformed structure as decided by Government are now well known and I do not need to describe them in detail again. However, I wish to emphasise the outcome that we can expect from the reform programme &ndash; a simpler, clearer, more accountable and responsive health system. This will be achieved in the <Col N="48" />first instance by establishing a clear chain of command, developing service plans to set out in detail what will be done for the total, not just incremental, resources provided and reorganising acute hospital services as a matter of urgency. Further elements of the reform process will be put in place when the Government has considered the report of the national task force on medical staffing, otherwise known as the Hanly report, the Deloitte &amp; Touche review of the general medical services and a national health information strategy.</P>
    <P>The reformed organisational structure will put in place a more rational and clearly accountable system. This will be achieved by, first, reducing the number of agencies involved in delivering health care and integrating their functions within the new system, a reduction of 32 agencies in total. Second, we are putting in place a structure where the responsibilities and powers of the various players are more clearly identified. The Department of Health and Children will be responsible for formulating policies and advising the Minister on service priorities. This will be done in light of available resources following the usual Estimates process involving my Department. It will also be tasked with forming its own independent assessment of the health services executive's performance and advising the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>The health services executive will be responsible for delivery of services within its assigned budget, based on a national service plan outlining the quantity and quality of services to be provided. This national service plan will be subject to formal approval by the Minister. The new health information and quality authority will support the Department of Health and Children by assessing whether health services are managed and delivered to ensure the best possible outcomes within the resources available.</P>
    <P>This is a clear and sensible chain of command for the health services. Health policies and priorities are determined as part of the political and governmental process and professional managers are tasked with their efficient and cost effective delivery and must account to the Minister for Health and Children. Ultimately, the Minister and the Government are accountable to the Oireachtas and the electorate.</P>
    <P>In line with the Brennan and Prospectus recommendations, we have decided to set up a national management structure. At regional level, rather than reduce the number and powers of health boards, the Government decided to make a clean break with existing structures. This is not about blaming health boards for the failings of the system, it is simply that the health board structure has been in place for over 30 years having evolved from local government's role in health services. It does not suit the requirements of a modern society. However, I wish to make it clear that democratic accountability will be maintained. The Oireachtas, the Government; and the Minister for Health and Children will have key <Col N="49" />roles in this regard. The board of the HSE will be directly accountable to the Minister for Health and Children. The chief executive officer of the HSE will, as Accounting Officer, be accountable to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that some of those working within the system feel some uncertainty as to the future shape of the organisation within which they work. However, the Brennan report states that the people who work in our health service &ldquo;deserve no less than the opportunity to work in a system which will support them in doing what they wish to do: offer the highest quality service to the public.&rdquo; This is the aim of the reform programme, a well managed and organised system supporting its staff in delivering the best possible care to patients. This is in the interests of everyone &ndash; staff, patients and taxpayers and will, I believe, be supported by everyone. In fact, this programme has already been anticipated in the new national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. All parties have accepted the need for reform of the health services in order to protect their long-term sustainability. All have agreed that the substantial resources being invested in the health service need to be used efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the impact on staff of this reform programme. I wish to make it clear that, with the reduction in the number of agencies and the general streamlining in management structures, I expect some jobs will no longer be needed in the new system. However, this does not have to mean redundancies. I expect that changes will largely be absorbed by natural wastage and redeployment. The bottom line is to free up the maximum level of resources in order that these can be put into the improved delivery of front-line services. In this, we have the support of the social partners. This will be one of the benchmarks for delivering better value for the money being invested in health and improved services for patients.</P>
    <P>The role and work practices of hospital consultants have also been the subject of much discussion over the past week or so. This reflects the central role which consultants occupy within the hospital system. The reality is that, by and large, it is consultants and other senior clinicians who decide on and direct patient treatments and thus, directly or indirectly, determine how money is spent within the system. This gives rise to two inescapable conclusions. First, such clinicians must be closely involved with management when resources are being allocated and managed. Second, senior clinicians must be willing to accept responsibility for the resources they consume or cause to be consumed. The consultant's common contract must support these needs. We have already signalled that we intend to begin negotiations with consultants on their contract without delay. We will bring the various recommendations from the Brennan report as well as the emerging issues from the Hanly report to the table for those negotiations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" />I wish to emphasise again that these reforms are about improved service, not only by ensuring that the system delivers better, more responsive, service and value for money, but also that it can be clearly seen to do so. There can be no doubt that this substantial reform programme can yield significant benefits for our people, both as patients and taxpayers, over the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to comment on the most recent efforts by the Minister and the Government to tackle the most pressing issue in Ireland today. While all efforts to make the necessary improvements are welcome, the publication of the most recent reports should not be seen as providing the answers to the most critical issues in the health service. Members on this side of the House will welcome and support real reform. This Government has failed to introduce real reform. The latest in a series of 120 reports prepared by the Minister may provide the illusion of action for the public but there is no genuine action to tackle real and immediate problems. These issues include bed and staff shortages and the pressing need for radiotherapy services in the south-east. The Brennan report highlights the need for effective spending and only this week I pointed to an example of questionable expenditure by the South-Eastern Health Board in County Wexford. The board is spending a significant amount of money renting office space in Enniscorthy when nearby there is a hospital full of free offices. I cannot understand how a health board or anyone could justify paying thousands of euro every year while a mile or less down the road there is free office space. I call on the Minister to make sure this does not happen. It is happening all over the country as I know from speaking to some of my colleagues in Fine Gael. Health boards are paying significant amounts of money while in hospitals there are wards closed which they could be using and saving money.</P>
      <P>Two years ago the public was treated to a similar glossy launch of the health strategy as we saw last week for the Brennan and Prospectus reports, but the Government has since quietly shelved the strategy and underlying problems remain today. The plan to remove public representatives from health boards to create new structures for four regional offices has an adverse effect on the provision of health care in small rural communities and especially in my own constituency where councillors make sure that the health boards are doing their job properly. The Minister is afraid to have councillors on health boards in case they criticise. Councillors should be left on health boards because they are there to see what is happening and to make sure everything is being carried out. The health needs and concerns of people in smaller rural communities such as Wexford must be articulated. All we have heard about so far is the closing of boards and the removal of democratically-elected members who give a voice to the concerns of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" />I am concerned that the Hanly report may be published while this Dáil is in recess. We should debate the report in this House and I hope the Minister will not publish it when the Dáil is in recess. It should be debated here and all Members should have an opportunity to air concerns. The Hanly report may have serious repercussions for hospitals such as my own in Wexford and it is ironic that it will emerge while we cannot scrutinise it.</P>
    <P>Since I won the nomination to stand for Fine Gael in July 2001, two of my constituents have died while waiting for heart bypass operations. How can any public representative go back to a family and say he or she could not get the person into hospital and that is the way it is, even if the person dies? That is very sad. One man had a five year old child. How do I go back to his widow and say that if her husband had had a bypass he could be with us today? In another case a lady of 75 years of age was waiting for a cataract operation. Her appointment was fixed for October 2002, it was cancelled and she was told to come back in December, in January and then in February. Finally she had the operation near the end of April. This is happening in every hospital, in every health board area. It is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I have to laugh at Deputy Carey who said that there are no problems in the health service. He must not hold any clinics or listen to any grievances from people because when I talk to my colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party and every other party, it is the same. When I go to my clinics on a Saturday morning, Friday evening and on Monday, I can guarantee that I will have three or four people at each of those clinics making representations because they are waiting for something from the health system, whether an operation, help for someone with a disability or whatever. Some say the health service is a leaking bucket, and we are throwing more money into it. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said that over that six-year period spending on the health services has risen from 19% of total Government expenditure to 24% now. Can the Minister for Health and Children, or Deputy McCreevy, say that the health system has improved in the past five or six years? I have seen no improvement in the health system in that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey talked about the policies of all the other parties in this House. Fianna Fáil was going to end waiting lists, the Progressive Democrats were going to be the watchdog. I do not know what they are looking at because they are not watching the health system. Maybe it is best that Deputy Tim O'Malley has left the House because what this Government has done is ludicrous. It has not improved the health system one bit. What I see in my county, and it is probably the same in other counties, is that people are being let out of hospital within three or four days of admission. Some of the hospitals are like a conveyor belt, the patient goes in and out and fends for himself or herself after that. District nurses <Col N="52" />are under severe pressure in rural communities trying to see all their patients and maybe in a week or two the patients come back into hospital which holds up the system.</P>
    <P>Our geriatric hospitals show that we are not looking after our elderly. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough. The Government does not realise how lucky it is because there are good people looking after their grandmothers or parents or whoever, while the carer's allowance is gone and the medical card system is a joke. I would not like to be in the Minister's position, which is a tough one. This Government has failed. It is a joke to issue reports when the Dáil is in recess and cannot scrutinise them.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the handling of the health system over recent years. We will support real reforms that will matter to the people. The more money that is thrown into the system, the worse it gets. People will recognise this when they get a proper health care system.</P>

My staff and I are available to pursue that option as well because despite what is being said there is no agenda here to avoid debating this in the House. The timing is a function of when the reports are concluded and decisions are taken. The Hanly report was not ready to go with these three reports and even if it was, it is arguable that it needs space for a genuine informed debate by all concerned.</P>

      <P>All of the partners were involved in the process. There was a steering committee involving the different partners in health and for the Hanly report to come as an agreed report from all the partners, which is a significant thing to happen, people have to sign off which they did in the last few days. We have to prepare a memorandum and go to Government. They had not signed off prior to this and waiting for them <Col N="53" />would have delayed publication of the Government's decisions on Prospectus and Brennan. There was no point in doing that. Four weeks ago Opposition Members accused me of delaying this, saying I was afraid to come forward with the Prospectus and Brennan reports&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which was a somewhat ridiculous assertion. When I produced it, I was accused of other things, and there was no logical consistency from the Opposition in its comments about the publication of the reports, the timing of the announcement and Hanly.</P>
      <P>Regarding wider issues in the health service pertaining to eligibility, health improvements and so on, I reject the Opposition's point. There are other strands as a result of publication of the national health strategy, not least a complete review of the eligibility issues concerning the Health Act 1970. The reforms that we published last week are to do with structural reforms, which were clearly signalled &ndash; they are an aspect of the health strategy. Action 144 of the health strategy said that there should be an audit of all health structures, and that has now taken place. The work has come to fruition and we have published that important pillar of the overall health strategy. However, it is only a pillar or segment. The remainder is to do with services, eligibility, infrastructural development and other reforms across the sector, including such things as information systems. The reforms are just one segment of that, and it is wrong to say that we are trying to divert people's attention from other issues. It was well signalled at the time and we have now delivered on it through publication of the reforms. We have a significant agenda ahead of us regarding implementation of the reform programme and the change in structures.</P>
      <P>There have been very frank contributions, and I praise many of them, not least that of Deputy John Moloney, who gave a very honest and frank account of how he saw the difficulties with the existing structure. As he said, there was money and the offer of the service, but it took years to reach agreement on its delivery in a given region. Deputy Olivia Mitchell smiled when I said that, but I thought it an honest account from someone who has sat on health boards and has been at the coalface for the past few years, being able to see at first hand the difficulties that have arisen.</P>
      <P>An argument has been made about democratic accountability and representation. The reforms were never about taking public representatives out of the equation. The argument that all the Minister was concerned about was removing a few public representatives from health boards is totally facile, simplistic and superficial. If it had been as simple as that, it would have been done long ago.</P>

      <P>It gave the false impression that they had won. I know full well that, at local level, it is not only politicians who can wind things up, start the ball rolling or create balls for others to throw. As the medical profession will accept, it is entirely capable of creating agendas locally, just like any other sector of society. At no stage did I ever intend to undermine public representatives or anything of the sort. From what has been said today, it seems that every party agrees with a national hospitals office. The Labour Party said that it welcomes the establishment of a health service authority, which is what is proposed here. It welcomes the establishment of a national hospitals office, which is in the health strategy and which Prospectus has endorsed, although it put it in the context of the Health Service Executive. If one accepts that, one automatically takes between 40% and 50% of the budget and activities away from the existing health board structure. That in itself is cause for a fundamental rethink.</P>
      <P>The other issue concerns the 58 agencies in the health service. Deputy Durkan said that every Minister had claimed not to be in charge. The reality is that the Oireachtas took decisions to devolve statutory authority from the Executive and itself regarding the management and delivery of health services. It affected not just health boards but the appointment of consultants, for example. I will not say that all Deputies in the House have moaned, but there have been complaints about how long it takes to get a consultant appointed. The reason is that different statutory bodies have a role to play in the planning and configuration of services and the determination of what goes where. Then there is the whole application process to get the human resources to meet all those demands, and three or four different bodies can be involved in all that. Then one is into a system which the Prospectus and Brennan reports have said is not manageable or sustainable, particularly when one matches it against the objectives of the health strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we have started the reform programme. We asked whether the structures were adequate to implement the objectives and goals of the health strategy, particularly with its emphasis on the new model to bring primary care centre stage through multidisciplinary units and so on. That is the genuine motivation behind the structural reform programme. We did not start out saying that we should remove a few councillors, <Col N="55" />reduce the number of wards and patch something together. That was not the agenda. We said to the Prospectus steering group members that they should think outside the box, look at matters as if they were in a greenfield situation and decide how they would go about organising the health service for the next 30 years.</P>

      <P>Structural reform was a separate issue to be dealt with in the context of the strategy, and that is what we did.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We must prioritise access and so forth. Equally, the consultants' contract negotiations have many more factors than simply one or two. It is a slow process, but the idea was to achieve a shared vision, moving forward to a consultant-delivered service as opposed to the consultant-led one that we have had for donkey's years, so that we have senior clinical decision-makers in the key specialities around the clock and that when someone comes in at 12 a.m., he or she will not be totally dependent on trainee doctors. That is as much about equity as anything else, but it has never featured in the equity debate surrounding health, which has been far too superficial.</P>
      <P>The other issue is insurance-based systems, the debate on which I welcome, but it has a hopelessly narrow focus on hospitals, as if they were the be-all and end-all of health care and the health system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fifth ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation will take place in Cancun, Mexico, in September 2003. Its main task will be to take stock of the state of play in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations and, where possible, to provide political impetus towards achieving progress in the negotiations. It is an important and timely meeting.</P>
      <P>This round of WTO negotiations, entitled the Doha Development Agenda, was launched at the fourth ministerial conference held in Qatar in November 200, is scheduled to conclude not later than 1 January 2005. This is an ambitious target given the breadth and complexity of the issues being negotiated.</P>
      <P>Progress during the past year and a half in Geneva has been slow and a number of the deadlines set for the various phases of the negotiations have not been met. It is difficult at this stage to point to any real achievements so far and it is, therefore, particularly important that the Cancun meeting provides an impetus to get the talks moving positively. The time left for reaching agreement is very short.</P>
      <P>Ireland participates in these negotiations as a member of the European Union delegation. The European Commission negotiates on behalf of the EU on the basis of positions agreed in advance between the member states. As negotiations proceed, there is virtually continuous co-ordination between the Commission and the member states across the whole range of issues under discussion. In this way, member states are made aware of developments and also have the opportunity to advise the Commission of their attitude on the various issues.</P>
      <P>Ireland's priority in these negotiations has been, and is, to see the process of trade liberalisation continue in a fair and balanced way and to support the strengthening of the World Trade Organisation in its provision of a stable and consistent framework for the regulation of world trade. Central to our approach, and that of the European Union, is a commitment to respond positively in the negotiations to the concerns and ambitions of the developing world. This is an essential part of the Doha agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a country with a small domestic economy, Ireland relies greatly for its economic development on a liberal global trading environment. Opening up trade with other countries stimulates Irish economic growth and higher living standards as a result of the impact on productivity of more efficient specialisation, economies of scale, increased competition and the spread of technologies and investment. Customers benefit from a wider choice of goods and services and the lower prices that go with competition. Businesses benefit through the development of new markets and new sources of supply. This has been Ireland's experience in the context of EU membership and <Col N="58" />previous rounds of trade liberalisation negotiations.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, Ireland supports the maintenance of a strong rules-based multilateral trading system. It is very much in our interest that the World Trade Organisation, which reflects the interests of both developed and developing countries, remains the primary arbiter and rule making body in international trade issues. Without the WTO regulating the system with enforceable rules, the interests of large countries would dominate those of smaller countries. Countries seeking better overseas market access would pursue regional or bilateral trading arrangements and the whole system would become increasingly complex and lacking in predictability.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out in a number of recent reports, the operation of the WTO, and the GATT before it, has had a subtle but profound effect on Irish industrial development during the past three decades. It has regulated and progressively liberalised trade relations between Ireland and nearly all countries outside the EU, including the United States and most of Latin America and Asia. This has been a key factor in Ireland's economic transformation. Since the 1970s total Irish trade has increased from over &euro;1.5 billion, equal to more than 80% of GDP, to over &euro;200 billion, more than 180% of GDP, at the beginning of this century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be circulated as soon as it is available. We will get it checked out for the Deputy. There are now few businesses in Ireland of any significant size that do not trade in goods and services with foreign customers and suppliers. We are a trading nation and our economy is trade driven to a greater extent than most other countries. Our exports as a percentage of GDP are among the highest in the world and underpin much of the country's economic development.</P>
      <P>The past two years for exporters have not been easy. The economic pick-up expected last year was much slower than previously hoped. Since mid-2001, when the extraordinary growth of the previous years began to recede as the US and other economies slowed down, exporters have faced an environment in which competition grew even more intense. This sluggish growth was reflected in global trade flows. The WTO estimates that the value of global trade fell by 4.5% in 2001 and by a further 4% in the first half of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish exporters have been working in an extremely difficult economic environment. Exports grew by 2% during the first nine months <Col N="59" />of last year, according to the latest CSO statistics. This is a long way from the exceptional performances of previous years but, in the context of the prevailing global trading environment, is nevertheless a positive outcome. This performance was excellent given that it occurred in one of the most difficult years for international trade since the 1930s.</P>
    <P>Statistics can distort and we are well aware that our export statistics hide a completely different experience among the different industrial and service sectors. However, the figures suggest that Ireland's share of global trade is continuing to increase despite the extremely competitive international environment. I hope Irish exporters will be in a good position to take advantage of any economic upturn that might occur. The cycle may not be moving as quickly as we would wish, and it seems unlikely that export growth will return to the astonishing level of 2000 over the next couple of years, but with sound management we can continue to grow our exports and increase our share of global trade.</P>
    <P>The exceptional pattern of export growth during the past 15 years was the main stimulus for our overall economic growth, our improved living standards, enterprise development, job creation and attractiveness for foreign investors. Most of the diverse activities of our economy are primarily focused on the global marketplace where most of our customers operate. During four decades, Ireland has been transformed from a producer of agricultural commodities to an export-led economy supplying world-class products, components and services. Transformation of the economy was a result of many factors including substantial inward investment inflows, a social partnership approach to economic development and an emphasis on education and technological innovation.</P>
    <P>Despite the global uncertainty, it is very important that there be no weakening in the strength or momentum of international efforts to liberalise trade and to open markets. This is the surest way by which the world economy can return to the path of growth. We are working hard with our partners in the EU and beyond to ensure a successful outcome to the Doha round.</P>
    <P>Total trade in goods between Ireland and non-EU countries measures about &euro;50 billion annually. Much of this comprises electronics exports to Asia, America and the Middle East as well as pharmaceutical exports to a wide variety of countries. The continuing process of WTO trade liberalisation facilitates all of this trade. There are still barriers to trade, tariff and non-tariff barriers. These have been significantly reduced in successive trade rounds. In so far as tariffs are concerned, there has been a reduction from an average of 38% on the establishment of the GATT in 1947 to an average of 4% today. Non-tariff barriers, such as unfair licensing regimes, costly labelling requirements or complex certification techniques have also been addressed and multi<Col N="60" />lateral rules have been put in place to eliminate many of these barriers.</P>
    <P>Much more remains to be done in this area and Irish merchandise exports continue to face import barriers in many non-EU markets. Elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers would yield significant savings in administrative costs for companies as the various schemes and procedures associated with them would also be eliminated. This whole area of market access for non-agricultural industrial goods is of high priority for us in the current round of negotiations and it is an area where results can be achieved which will be of benefit to all WTO member countries. In particular, we would like to see a renewed, and strong, commitment to identify and remove unjustified non-tariff barriers and place the whole issue of trade facilitation on a much higher priority level within the WTO.</P>
    <P>Trade facilitation is the simplification and harmonisation of international trade procedures. Businesses all over the world, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, face significant administrative and procedural barriers and costs in moving goods across borders. The existence of this sort of red tape is probably one of the greatest deterrents to smaller Irish companies becoming active in non-EU markets. Unless one is shipping large quantities of goods on a regular basis, the administrative burdens are sometimes too high to make exporting worthwhile. It would, therefore, be of considerable benefit generally if these barriers could be identified clearly and reduced. We are keen to see the beginning of negotiations on binding multilateral rules on trade facilitation in this WTO round.</P>
    <P>This round is entitled the Doha Development Agenda. The declaration that was agreed at Doha committed all WTO members to ensure that the needs of developing countries are reflected in all areas of the WTO's work. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for development, Deputy Tom Kitt, will speak more fully later on the development aspects of these negotiations. I would like, at this stage, to emphasise that there has to be a successful pro-development outcome to the Cancun meeting and to the Doha Development Agenda as a whole. The EU, including Ireland, believes strongly that we have to integrate LDCs into the world trading system and we are convinced that this will bring significant gains for them and be beneficial for economic development and poverty eradication.</P>
    <P>Market access is an important element in encouraging integration of developing countries into the world economy. The EU has offered ambitious market openings for developing countries in goods as well as services, while avoiding the risk of going for total liberalisation with which most developing countries could not cope at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being imposed upon them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The everything but arms initiative, which provides duty and quota free access to the EU market for all products exported by the least developed countries, is evidence of the EU's approach in this regard and we have strongly encouraged other developed countries to follow the EU's example and grant similar free access to the LDCs.</P>
      <P>This initiative is just one of the mechanisms by which the EU gives preferential access to the exports of developing countries. There is an extensive range of EU agreements, regional and bilateral, whereby developing countries' exports are encouraged. As a result, EU imports from developing countries grow at an average rate of 12% and now account for 4% of total EU imports, representing &euro;420 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>In line with the Doha declaration, all the proposals the EU has made in these negotiations have included important benefits for developing countries. This is the case in regard to agriculture, non-agricultural goods and services in all the proposals on new multilateral rules and in regard to technology transfer, trade related technical assistance and capacity building.</P>
      <P>Some concern has been expressed in certain quarters at the EU proposals that negotiations be launched in new areas such as the trade related aspects of investment and competition. The EU is convinced that regulating areas such as these will be of benefit generally and will lead to significant economic development benefits for developing countries.</P>
      <P>Another issue of major importance to Ireland under the current negotiations is the conclusion of satisfactory agreements in the areas of agriculture and services. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, will address the agriculture question later. It is obvious to all concerned that the way those discussions develop will have a significant influence on the outcome of the negotiations as a whole. The result of the mid-term review discussions this week will clearly reinforce the position of the EU in the WTO negotiations and will oblige other countries to match the far-reaching EU approach.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, on his magnificent achievement in the CAP mid-term review negotiations. It was a remarkable result, not only in so far as the future of Irish farming is concerned, but also in the effect it will have on the WTO negotiations. It changes the whole picture in regard to Cancun and makes the prospect of agreement there more possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the negotiations on liberalisation of trade in services to be potentially the most important element of the Doha agenda. Within the European Union, services account for nearly 70% of employment. In Ireland it is a significant 65%. We have huge economic interest in continued liberalisation in this area. WTO rules on trade in services are still in their infancy, having been put in place in 1995, and barriers to trade in <Col N="62" />services are much more prevalent than for industrial goods. The EU has adopted an ambitious and liberal approach in requesting service sector liberalisation from other WTO members in non-public service sectors. Broadly speaking, the requests cover a wide range of sectors, including construction and related engineering services, distribution services, energy services, environmental services, financial and telecommunications services and other business sectors.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports this ambitious approach. New commitments by all WTO members in these service areas would help open up foreign markets for Irish and other EU service suppliers and would expand services employment in Ireland. Consumers would also benefit from the increased level of competition in the provision of professional and other types of services in the domestic Irish market.</P>
    <P>While we have pursued an offensive economic approach in the services negotiations, at the same time we have recognised the imperative that, in this area, developing countries must be enabled to integrate themselves more effectively into the world economy according to economic models of their own choosing. EU proposals have been and are designed to achieve this balanced result.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate that a successful conclusion to the Doha development round of trade negotiations is of significant importance to Ireland. The prospects for the upcoming Cancun meeting are uncertain. Much depends on the outcome of preparatory work under way in Geneva and elsewhere over the coming weeks. Strenuous efforts are being made. Over last weekend in Egypt, for example, trade Ministers from some of the most influential trading countries in the world, including the EU and the US, had further discussions on the WTO issues. It seems that progress was made on some of the difficult issues still outstanding. However, it is obvious that major problems remain to be resolved. Real efforts will have to be made if progress is to be achieved in Cancun. We strongly support the European Commission in these efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Hogan, will deal with general issues on the World Trade Organisation talks in Cancun but I will concentrate on one important aspect, the effects of their outcome on developing countries.</P>
      <P>This debate takes place against a background of one frightening statistic &ndash; 1.2 billion people are living on less than $1 dollar per day. These 1.2 billion people must eke out an existence on less than the price of a newspaper. These people are living, or should we say dying, on less money than is provided for the average cow in the European Union. We should be mortified by that fact. We should be angered by it and should be moved to action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The developing world has pricked the collective conscience of many world leaders. It has stirred ordinary people into extraordinary action and has shamed many an oil executive. It has <Col N="63" />moved the majority of our citizens to tears and many of them to make a charitable donation. Inside this House we can do much more. We have been entrusted with power &ndash; the power to change. Fine Gael calls on the Government to play its part and make a difference to the people of the developing world by going some way to meeting the demands of the NGOs who work in the poorest regions of the world. They know how important a level trading pitch is to improving standards for the poorest of the poor.</P>
    <P>The debate is also framed against the background of Ireland's evolution from economic basket case to being one of the richest countries in the world. Of course, Ireland was never really that poor. The history of the State since independence has never been marred by hunger or starvation, although our less recent history has. This unique viewpoint &ndash; from Great Famine to Celtic tiger &ndash; should give Ireland a uniquely compassionate view among our partners in the EU and the developed world in general.</P>
    <P>It is a great shame that we discuss these issues of life and death against the background of dither and delay on the part of the WTO. An inability to reach agreement in the key areas of TRIPs, access to medicines implementation and special and differential treatment, is an indictment of the world trade process and I implore everyone involved to ensure that progress towards a truly fair trade mechanism is made at far speedier a rate than the current one.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the parts of the debate on world trade against the background of the failure to meet the Doha declaration deadline of 31 March, which had been adopted to speed up progress towards the negotiated reduction in trade distorting supports. It is difficult to understand how an issue as vital as the lives of human beings fails to spur nations to action. It is a failure of democracy when people die because agreement cannot be reached and, as human beings, we must do better.</P>
    <P>My time to discuss the various complex issues to be spoken of at Cancun is limited, so I will address some of the points that Fine Gael has identified as critical to the development agenda. In doing so, I will draw to the attention of the House the calls made by various bodies with an interest and a knowledge on this issue. Their views must be borne in mind as the Ministers of State prepare to leave for Cancun in September. Trócaire has pointed to the declaration of the African Union, whose trade ministers met in Mauritius earlier this month to decry the lack of progress and missed deadlines in the areas of key interest to developing countries and the inappropriate timing of agreeing to open negotiations on new issues when so much needs to be done in the areas that are already on the table.</P>
    <P>In its declaration, the African Union stated that it reaffirmed the need for a coherent, holistic approach at the multilateral level on issues of trade, debt and finance. The AU also stressed the <Col N="64" />need to operationalise WTO provisions that relate to the transfer of technology and considers these issues to be of significant developmental importance to the African continent. The problems facing the African continent are huge. Malnutrition, war and stagnant economies have too often been written off as &ldquo;one of those things&rdquo;. It is time we woke up to the reality that it is the developed world, through a trade system that encompasses the concept of social justice &ndash; a concept with which Fine Gael is very familiar &ndash; that can kick-start the process that will end those problems. It is in our hands.</P>
    <P>As a step towards this, Fine Gael would like to make it clear that we believe observer status should be granted to the African Union at the WTO. There is real concern that the poorest countries in the world have been unable to represent themselves to their full potential and have nowhere near the diplomatic and negotiating strength of the developed nations. Trócaire has specifically expressed its worry about the lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the negotiating process. It is perhaps natural that every government, every country and trading bloc seeks to get the best deal for itself. However, it is wholly unnatural that the negotiating process should be skewed in any way. I urge the Government to raise this issue at whatever level it can so that developing African countries get the deal they deserve.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed in many quarters that the WTO remit is in danger of becoming overloaded and an even heavier workload is likely to lead to further missed deadlines and further disappointment. For our part, Fine Gael urges the Government to do all it can to ensure that no overloading occurs and that the agenda with which the WTO deals is workable, and one which all participants can effectively deal, regardless of wealth or size.</P>
    <P>I also thank the Trade Matters umbrella body for its sterling work in this area and I would like to deal with some of the points it has raised. Trade Matters points out that the UN development programme believes that the last round of international trade negotiations has left the 49 poorest countries $600 million per annum worse off. That figure of $600 million less per annum means the difference between life and death. Any similar result this time round would be an utter calamity and an indictment of the entire process. Behind that figure of $600 million are mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, farmers and craftsmen, elderly men and new-born babies, who have been relegated to the dustbin of the world trade order. We cannot allow that to happen again.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, we debated the rights of workers on fixed-term contracts. Today, we debate the lives of those whose only fixed term is one of grinding poverty and a total lack of dignity in their everyday existences. The Trade Matters group has called on this Government to publish an annual report outlining the positions Ireland supported <Col N="65" />at EU and international level, with specific reference to their coherence with Ireland's commitment to global poverty reduction, gender equality and sustainable development as set out in the Ireland Aid review, adopted in March 2002. I reiterate that call and confirm that a Fine Gael-led Government will do exactly that.</P>
    <P>It is almost inexplicable that, in 2003, no mechanism exists for the Government to be properly accountable to the people and the Dáil in the decisions it makes at that level on this issue. It also calls for meaningful Oireachtas accountability through dedicated time for debate and questions, and that such time should be allocated prior to and after the WTO meetings. This would also seem to be both common sense and the democratic thing to do in order to bring some degree of scrutiny and accountability to the issue and adhere to the request for such questions to be allowed on the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>It is simply not possible to go through the many injustices being inflicted on poorest countries of the World. However, I will outline Fine Gael's view of the WTO negotiating process. All too often, this debate has been characterised as a battle between Irish farmers and African farmers, between European businesses and businesses in the developing world. For our part, we reject that false dichotomy. There is nothing inconsistent with affording the poorest people in the world justice and trade rights while wishing to preserve an indigenous economy at home. What matters is how those two issues are achieved simultaneously. It is of vital importance that it is done, and is seen to be done, fairly, transparently and with due regard to the rights of everyone. Fine Gael is, to say the least, uncomfortable with the leaks reported in the media last March concerning worldwide privatisation and deregulation of public energy and water utilities. Any changes in these areas must be made in the context of a strong negotiating position for the developing countries, and a sense and belief in social justice and worldwide solidarity. If such a sense does not permeate through the negotiating process, the lives of even more people shall be at risk.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael calls on the Government to bring greater accountability to this House on its decisions at the WTO. We call for a greater negotiating position for the poorest of the poor and for an ounce of fairness, an ounce of compassion and an ounce of humanity to be injected into a process that has in the past hurt the poor and retains the capacity to do so. Such compassion, humanity and fairness can be shown by the Government here and now by agreeing to reverse the shameful cut in overseas development aid, a cut that was implemented by the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, while he spoke in Johannesburg on that subject. Needless to say, reference to this cut cannot be found in any Fianna Fáil manifesto. So too can compassion, humanity and fairness be shown by the developed world to a project of debt reduction to be implemented in tandem with democratic reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" />It is the view of the Fine Gael Party that evolving democratic structures are vital to the future of the poorest countries. One would be hard pressed to find a peaceful democratic state with a famine on its hands. It is the job of the Irish Government to go out and bat for Ireland, but it is the job of all of us to protect the vulnerable and make the world a better place to live in. I wish the Government well in its efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Murphy in expressing our gratitude to the Fair Trade group, Oxfam, Trócaire and all the many different organisations which have not only appeared before the committees of this House and contacted us, but who are also involved in the very important work of political education in this country, which I am sure will be deeply discomfiting to the Government.</P>
      <P>I have the benefit of having the speech of the lead Minister of State to represent us at Cancun, and I am grateful for the last two pages which refer to the matters to be discussed in Doha.</P>
      <P>This is a disgraceful way of preparing for a conference as serious as the Cancun event. We have had little opportunity of discussing the different approaches of various Departments and the issues which will lie at the heart of the consultations in Cancun, or its atmosphere. In 15 minutes all I can do is pose questions and ask the Ministers of State as they arrive to answer them.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Kitt, if the common Government position of Ireland going to Cancun was proofed against the commitment Ireland has made in relation to the world millennium development goals. I suggest to him that he is ill served by the speech given by the lead representative of the Government. We all are. Where is the evidence for the assumption that a neo-liberal model of the economy imposed internationally is in the best interests of the people whom we have just heard described by the previous speaker, Deputy Murphy? Where is the evidence that it even existed historically? It is very interesting that the countries which stand behind this model of opening markets and pressing on unabated into countries with little capacity for adaptation, countries struggling to develop and evolve their own development strategies, are countries that have themselves arrived at their current positions through several different models.</P>
      <P>Except for those who want to abuse economics, we have to acknowledge in the history of European economic development that we have had three decades of Keynesianism, different forms of State intervention, with two decades of wild turbo-driven capitalism. The Government is simply saying to the developing world that it is not entitled to its economic options, as we were. That is why many people call what is happening a new form of colonisation, of imperialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that this has something in common with the recent war in Iraq. Just as the ideol<Col N="67" />ogy for that war was created by a small unelected elite who wanted to invent the concept of a new American century, in exactly the same way a very small group of trade economists invented the Washington consensus more than 20 years ago. The danger to the world is that these ideological creations of the Washington consensus, of militarism and indeed now also of cultural domination in relation to mass media combinations, mergers and monopolies, come together to create a situation in which world diversity, be it in terms of cultural expression, the right to have an economic model of development, or to construct one's own services patiently over a period of time, are all threatened by the same bully.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that so far we have heard nothing about genetically modified organisms &ndash; the Ceann Comhairle will remember those. The Taoiseach would recall them if he was here because it was on such matters he was lobbied by Monsanto on St. Patrick's Day a few years ago in preparation for a European Commission meeting which had a very happy outcome for the multinational involved.</P>
    <P>I want answers to some very specific questions. Where does Ireland stand in relation to GMOs? Where does Ireland stand in relation to establishing a hierarchy of responsibility in the world millennium goals? Is poverty reduction the major aim? It could be followed by development goals, gender equality, sustainable development, fair trade and institutional adjustment. Will the Minister who leads off in Cancun be speaking about that agenda and about how compassionate Ireland, which is moved to tears regularly about famine and destruction, has now decided to put that agenda ahead of everything else?</P>
    <P>There was a curious similarity between the speech of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, and that delivered to the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Forfás was quoted, but I do not have the time to go into detail on that. This latter document was consulted widely among the intellectual branch of the business community in Ireland, distributed no doubt by IBEC and others to mass meetings around the country.</P>
    <P>I do not recall being invited to any of those meetings, but I will give an example of the document's strategy. In relation to the audio-visual sector, an area for which I once held ministerial responsibility, its proposals are little less than disgraceful. There is nothing in the document's proposals that would stop the provision of audio-visual services taking over a country. Cultural identity is referred to only in a footnote. The document is only about trade in services, not about their regulation. The idea in effect put forward is that when the multinationals arrive, one can fall back on regulation, but they will say the services have to be accepted one way or another.</P>
    <P>There are secondary pressures on these countries. The Minister for State with responsibility <Col N="68" />for overseas development, Deputy Kitt, has just returned from Uganda, a country where life expectancy has fallen from 47 years to 43 years. That country has reduced its tariffs by 50% to attract foreign direct investment. Through the IMF and the World Bank, there are people already doing what the WTO wants to do. At the same time as expansion of production is taking place in Uganda, the country is earning less.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the matters on which we must get answers. We will, for example, have to face some realities. As the representatives of the Government head off to Cancun, Deputy Murphy wishes them well. I too wish them well, and a conversion on the way. The reality is that every year, as a result of the existing club to which our representatives will offer their enthusiastic support, namely, the little band known as the European Union, the cost to the developing world is $134 billion. That is more than twice the total annual aid going to the developing world. When we speak about our commitment to aid, let us get real, as they say on the street.</P>
    <P>In relation to debt, $128 million per day is transferred from south to north on the debt side. At the same time, if the debt payments could be reduced for Africa and 1% added to the combined education and health budgets, it would save the lives of 11,000 children daily. Except among those people who seek not to have accountability from their economics, there is no such thing as being able to deal with trade issues separate from issues of aid, which is now 30% down on what it was in 1990. One cannot separate issues of trade from those of aid and debt.</P>
    <P>Where is there evidence in the Government's preparation of the commitment to the elimination of world poverty as a goal? Let us remember the aim to which the saints of the world signed up in Johannesburg, namely, reducing world poverty to a mere 900 million people by 2015. How ambitious. What is really being passed off on us is the notion that somehow we can have this type of neo-liberal turbo capitalism which people refuse to explain or debate in this House in which we have few opportunities for debate. That is why many people like me who do not have an opportunity to debate the matter in this Chamber must seek a partnership in the streets to oppose the type of economics that is shamelessly visiting such destruction on the world.</P>

      <P>Would it not be interesting in the course of this debate to hear suggestions that we would have accountability in that for which we have responsibility? Will we have brought before us in this Chamber the proceedings of the 133 committee to which the transnational corporations have such unfettered access? Are we as parliamentarians somehow a lesser species than them? The transnational corporations have discussed with that committee issues of genetic <Col N="69" />modification which we have not discussed in this House.</P>
      <P>I have heard this description about the Irish miracle into which we emerged from the dark ages after the Famine and how it has been so successful that we cannot keep it to ourselves. Foreign direct investment falls on us from the skies so we cannot do anything that would upset transnational corporations as we try to capture them and, with their representatives, we try to help make something of the developing world. It is a shameful and pathetic view of the history of economics.</P>
      <P>Will the Government save the World Trade Organisation or will it speak about fair trade? They are different issues and projects. There has been an increase in the past 13 years in international trade to about 25% of total output. I would support a rules based international order of trade provided it was fair. This is the issue. Developing countries have reduced their tariffs since 1995 by about 50% on average.</P>
      <P>At the same time in the OECD countries, tariffs directed against the exports of such countries are on average about four times those imposed on domestic producers and related countries. &ldquo;Put that in your pipe and smoke it&rdquo; they would say. The Government should not try to con us by suggesting that benevolence is breaking out. The annual cost, as I have pointed out, is &euro;134 billion.</P>
      <P>Regarding the internal effects of this much-vaunted neo-liberal model, it is worth bearing in mind that in the United States in 1950, the wage of a chief executive was 40 times that of the average worker. Today it is 731 times that. It is also worth bearing in mind the speculative nature of capital. There are 64 tax shelters in our world which transact $5 trillion in deposits. Put another way, each day of speculation equals 70 days of trade.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance refuses to speak in Washington on the debt policy published by the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation. In addition, the Minister for Finance has told me in the House that he is not in favour of the Tobin tax. Now the merry band comprising the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for goodness, expansion and the neo-liberal vision of the world, with the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in tow, are off to Cancun.</P>
      <P>Had we wanted to retain rural Ireland and small farmers, the Government would long ago have addressed the issue of income in rural areas and would not have linked it to price and slavishly placed us in a model of producing food at artificial prices that was then dumped on the developing world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Government asking the developing world to accept additional powers for the World Trade Organisation when it should not have them given that it has not shown competence or intention where it should regarding the Singapore <Col N="70" />issues? Why should its powers be extended into services? Why should the Government representing Ireland and through the European Union sign up to a demand that, for example, Brazilians must agree to sell their land to foreign companies? The Government is doing that. When did the Government seek a mandate from the House to grant the four new powers being sought by the World Trade Organisation? It did not do so and has no mandate. Its representatives will go to Cancun armed only with this gibberish that passes as economics. The Minister for Finance, who prides himself on being the most right wing in the European Union and who is surrounded by a cabal from another party which suggests it dreamed up the neo-liberal model&mdash;</P>

      <P>The official intellectual of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in a newspaper article on 4 April last in which he quoted Lord Palmerston &ndash; imagine that from a member of the republican party &ndash; said:</P>
      <P>A more radical doctrine, particularly associated with Michael D. Higgins, has emerged . . . He seems to think that, in foreign policy, we should act with total disregard for our self-interest.</P>
      <P>I did not. I said that we should not act solely from that. He goes on:</P>
      <P>. . .  and keep our eyes fixed unwaveringly on the greater good of mankind. According to this doctrine foreign policy falls into two categories [and he goes on]. If we turn our back on our friends and allies and take the lonely and hitherto road towards a Nirvana where no state's foreign affairs are conducted other than in accordance with the dictates of morality, will we find that it is a mirage when we get there?</P>
      <P>That is the philosopher of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I hope a fair trade regime emerges, that development issues prevail and that the hypocrisy of saying something has been done for HIV-AIDS is exposed when nothing has been agreed in this respect regarding those countries without a capacity to produce. I also hope the Government members come home humbled, that they go to the European Union and spread the humility and that they take out their textbooks and begin reading about humanity rather than repeating gibberish from discredited elites in the same way they repeated the gibberish from a discredited elite that brought us to war.</P>

      <P>It is not just non-governmental organisations to which we should listen in the debate, although they have been very good at informing it. Hundreds of thousands of people are marching throughout the world, in Seattle and Genoa, for example, and we should listen to what they say. We should not be distracted by the scenes of violence on television and on which there is a tendency to concentrate, and should listen instead to the clear message being given and about which these people are protesting peacefully.</P>
      <P>There is a rage at the unfairness in world trade, that one third of the world can live in fantastic wealth while two thirds live in various degrading levels of crippling poverty, that the world institutions that are supposed to protect everyone, the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO, are part of the problem, and that the Washington consensus they espouse is part of the trading problem that brings about so much of the poverty the world is in.</P>
      <P>I am an advocate of trade and believe in the potential of free enterprise to free people from poverty, but I only want to trade where it is equitable, sustainable and fair. What has occurred in the World Trade Organisation in recent years is not fair. It is an issue of justice and I hope the Government takes justice into account in its consideration of how to behave in regard to the WTO. We hold ourselves up as being the just. The European Union is great at espousing that it is the one institution in the world concerned about environment, social and other issues, but the reality is that our Government and institutions which represent us at EU level are not on the side of the just when it comes to the WTO trade negotiations.</P>
      <P>We are like the conquistadores who went before us, who sailed from Europe under a cross and marched behind one, and were blind to the devastation they left behind them. We are equally blind to the devastation that our trade policies, the policies we insist upon and enforce, create. We are blind to the fact that the free trade system is our new faith, it is the new cross. It is now our faith that economic growth and market liberalisation solve our problems. That is the new cross which so many western Governments, particularly our own, march behind.</P>
      <P>We are blind to the fact that this faith denies the need for labour and social rights to go hand in hand with the free trade rights we insist on imposing. We met a young trade union representative from the textile industry in Bangladesh and asked why the labour rights they have could not be enforced. She told us the ILO had no teeth and none of the powers that the employers have in their trade negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" />In terms of environmental rights, the blind faith we have in free trade includes a need for environmental rights. No less a person than the deputy head of the WTO, Roderick Abbot, in Dublin recently at a presentation to IBEC, made the point that the multilateral environmental agreements in reality had very little effect and were of no major consequence in terms of the WTO negotiations. Environmental sustainable rights are not equal to the economic rights certain countries demand.</P>
    <P>If we are to see the Doha round of talks as the development round, how can the Government go to Cancun as part of the EU delegation and insist that services such as postal, news agency services and all the other services that are a common part of the civil society in a state must be opened up when the WTO negotiators have failed to deliver the provisions required by Doha in terms of access to health services and special and deferential treatment? How can the Government pursue, with the European Union, an insistence that we broaden the world trade negotiations in those areas when we have not even achieved access to health services as a basic right for those developing countries under the Doha round of negotiations?</P>
    <P>The key issue for the EU and for the Government is the policy we push in Cancun. In talking to the Ministers and looking at official reports, there is no doubt that we are very much on the side of further liberalisation. We are pushing that more than anything else when it comes to the trade negotiations.</P>
    <P>This debate is flawed because it is very difficult in five minutes to make the range of arguments, but the Government should listen and start to take issues of justice into account and not just those of free trade. It should go to Cancun and get away from mouthing the same liberalisation agenda to which the Tánaiste is dedicated.</P>
    <P>There is a comment in the briefing paper that there is a concern that if we do not introduce these new issues, we will take our foot off the pedal of the expansion of roles for the WTO. There are concerns we will have a two-tier WTO and there might be different rules for different countries. That is exactly what we need because we have a two-tier world. One tier has extreme wealth and military power and the other has no capital or military power. As part of that wealthy, militarised part of the world, we cannot impose our will on the other two thirds of the world and not take account of their needs. Their needs are different and should be respected in the WTO negotiations. If we hear that the EU is pushing for further liberalisation of services, the Government and its Ministers will be responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we believed some of the previous speakers and some media reports, the coming WTO talks are crucial, not just to the future of the Irish economy but to the omnipotent force called international financial markets and the cause of so-called free trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" />As an Irish republican, this reminds me of the Irish volunteers who, in the 1780s, used their military strength as a bargaining chip to force the British Government to repeal the repressive corn laws and allow free trade between Ireland and Britain. It was not just our trade that was held to ransom by this and other British economic policies, it was our people who were forced to endure poverty, deprivation, malnutrition, starvation and death.</P>
    <P>Looking at the realities of international financial markets, we can see that other nations and peoples are now enduring the same economic oppression. It is for this reason that the only position this Government should adopt in the negotiations at Cancun is one of moral leadership. We must be a voice for justice and fairness, for redressing the inequalities that our economic policies are imposing on other nations today. This means taking positive steps such as acting on food export subsidies and removing tariffs on goods exported from developing states and making our international companies responsible.</P>
    <P>We swamp international commodity markets with our subsidised food, dumping surpluses which bitter experience in Ireland has taught us will not help farming here. Developing countries try to process, brand and market their food only to find the way blocked by tariffs, quotas and the marketing power of western, internationally branded products. We must not forget that 97% of the world's farmers live in developing states.</P>
    <P>Having driven them from farming and food processing, what will we buy from them? Will we buy their clothing products, filling the world with sweatshops full of children whose impoverished farmer parents cannot afford to have them in school? We never hear of this international labour market, even though it is the reality for hundreds of millions of people daily. We will buy clothes and footwear made cheaply and sold for high prices, profiting not the country of export but the company of export. Just streets away is Dublin's premium shopping precinct, filled with goods made in these sweatshops. Who makes a profit from them?</P>
    <P>A leather football is a simple, everyday product. Who makes it? Almost 75% of hand-stitched footballs are made in Pakistan, often by children. They are pulled out of school to help boost meagre family income and put to work stitching these balls. FIFA has an agreement with the International Labour Organisation to stamp out child labour. Every year 40 million such balls are sold and 1.6 million of them carry the FIFA label. That says a great deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The priority at Cancun must be to ensure that developing countries have the market access and the policy means to ensure that trade contributes to poverty reduction. Trade liberalisation for liberalisation's sake will not achieve development. Ireland's trade policy should reinforce our positive commitments to debt cancellation and overseas aid funding. At <Col N="74" />the moment our trade policy is more likely to undermine those commitments.</P>
      <P>The Ireland Aid review, adopted by the Government, states that efforts should be made to ensure that the positions taken by Ireland in international negotiations on agriculture, trade and the environment are consistent with what Ireland is attempting to do with its aid programme &ndash; to achieve a sustainable reduction in poverty in the developing world. There is, however, little sign of such policy coherence in our approach to the two key issues of agriculture and investment.</P>
      <P>In agriculture, Ireland's record in resisting meaningful change in farm supports has been abysmal. Ireland did not even come out in support of a French proposal for a moratorium on export subsidies to sub-Saharan Africa while the trade negotiations are ongoing, despite the fact that six of the seven Ireland Aid programme countries are in sub-Saharan Africa where it is common for 80% of the population to depend on farming for their income.</P>
      <P>Ireland supports the European Union call to open negotiations on new issues such as investment at Cancun. In a development round the focus should be on issues of concern to developing countries&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most important that the Irish Government supports this position.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to two important development issues, first, that of access to medicines. The Uruguay Round protects corporate patent rights at the expense of public health. The Doha declaration promised to ensure access to medicines and to resolve that issue by the end of 2002. That deadline, along with many others, has been missed. The United States has been intransigent in defending the interests of the pharmaceutical multinationals, and the European Union has acquiesced in this scandal.</P>
      <P>The Forfás report sees Ireland's objectives as maximising the availability of patented drugs in developing countries at affordable prices but says nothing about the right of developing countries with HIV epidemics to import generic drugs. What influence did the pharmaceutical industry and lobby in Ireland have on this Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, special and differential treatment is where developing countries might get the real flexibility to choose the trade policies that will work for them but the rich countries, and the <Col N="75" />European Union in particular, are dragging their feet. What is needed is a framework agreement granting genuine trade policy flexibility to developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government should not support new issues being put on the agenda in the middle of a supposed development round when the promises made to poor countries in Doha have not yet been honoured. Agriculture, medicines and special and development treatment should be the issues on the table in Cancun. Until they are resolved to the benefit of developing countries, nothing else should be negotiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>From Ireland's point of view, agriculture will be a crucially important element in the negotiation of the new WTO round. It will also be crucially important to a successful overall outcome to the negotiations. In the overall negotiation of the new round, agriculture is only one of a number of elements on which it will be difficult to reach a conclusion. Such is its significance, however, that it is most unlikely there will be any agreement on a new round without agreement on the agricultural component.</P>
      <P>The declaration agreed at the WTO ministerial conference in Doha in November 2001 established the mandate for the negotiations on the new round. In agriculture, it provides for comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access, with a view to phasing out all forms of export subsidies, and substantial reductions in trade distorting domestic support. The mandate also provides that special and differential treatment for developing countries will be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations and of the new round. In addition, non-trade concerns which relate to such issues as the additional costs imposed on EU producers by legal requirements to respect environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards that are, in general, higher than those observed in third countries, will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The mandate clearly signals ambitious objectives in the areas of market access, export subsidies and domestic support. However, a qualifying phrase was inserted into the Doha mandate to the effect that the outcome of the negotiations on these three issues should not be prejudged. Ireland and France were responsible for achieving the insertion of this important qualification to the Doha ministerial declaration. Without it, the commitment which WTO member countries were signing up to had the potential for very serious consequences for European and Irish agriculture, particularly in the area of export subsidies.</P>
      <P>There are five elements, therefore, in the Doha agricultural mandate, each of which is important in the context of a balanced final outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the agreement on market access will determine the level of tariff protection which will apply to imports into the EU market. Obviously, <Col N="76" />the lower the tariff protection the greater the likelihood of increased competition for our products on the internal EU market. There are also likely to be benefits for our exporters as tariff protection in our major third country markets will also be reduced.</P>
    <P>Second, in the export area, export subsidies are clearly of major significance to our ability to export to third countries, given that EU prices are in general above, substantially so in some cases, world market prices.</P>
    <P>Third, the nature and volume of domestic support are subject to WTO rules because of the potential of such support to distort trade. The EU's system of direct payments is currently exempt from reduction commitments and is classified in the so-called &ldquo;Blue Box&rdquo; category. Whether that exemption remains is a matter of central importance in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Fourth, any new agreement must take account of the need to better integrate developing countries into the world's trading system. The EU is already a major contributor to the economies of developing countries. It is the largest importer by far of agricultural products from developing countries. The Everything But Arms initiative recently undertaken by the EU permits the import of all goods, except arms, duty and quota free, into the EU. The EU is prepared to make further concessions to developing countries in the negotiation of the next round.</P>
    <P>Fifth, in respect of non-trade concerns, the objective is to ensure that third country producers, who do not incur the level of costs of EU producers in observing various production standards, do not place EU producers at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Doha ministerial declaration laid down two important deadlines for the negotiation of the new round. First, modalities, or the overall framework or rules on which a new agreement will be based, were due to be agreed by the end of March 2003. Second, the negotiations on the new round are due to conclude before the beginning of 2005.</P>
    <P>The Commission negotiates in the WTO on behalf of the European Union on the basis of a mandate agreed by the Council of Ministers. The current mandate, which Ireland has supported in full, is based on the Agenda 2000 agreement.</P>
    <P>When the EU's position on modalities was being prepared, the Minister was concerned about the impact of the EU proposals on market access. At the point when this issue was being agreed in the EU Council of Ministers, Ireland, therefore, entered a declaration in the minutes of the meeting to the effect that our agreement to the modalities position paper was on the basis that minimal tariff reductions would apply under the new round to sensitive products such as beef and butter. The Commission also made a declaration in the minutes to the effect that it would submit the detailed proposals on market access to the Council for agreement, remain vigilant in the negotiations in relation to products which are <Col N="77" />exposed to international competition and take particular account of sensitive products.</P>
    <P>In the event, the end of March 2003 deadline for agreement on modalities was missed. The proposals put forward by the chairman of the WTO committee on agriculture, in which the negotiations on agriculture are proceeding in Geneva, failed to secure widespread support among the WTO member countries. The talks on modalities are now effectively stalled.</P>
    <P>The agreement on the mid-term review which was reached by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg in the early hours of yesterday morning has the potential to make a significant contribution to the WTO negotiations. The scope for decoupling direct payments, thereby rendering them secure from attempts in the WTO to reduce them, will allow the EU to concentrate its negotiating efforts on the other important elements of the negotiations. Not only, therefore, has the mid-term review agreement the capacity to protect direct payments, it has strengthened the EU's hand in the other areas of negotiation in agriculture by allowing it to concentrate on them.</P>
    <P>The agreement on the mid-term review has, therefore, opened up the prospect for agreement on modalities at the WTO ministerial conference in Cancun in September next. Agreement on this important phase of the negotiations will improve the prospects for concluding an agreement on a new round by the beginning of 2005, as envisaged in the Doha ministerial declaration.</P>
    <P>The WTO is a major force for good in the world. It is not, as many believe, an unaccountable body forcing free trade on member countries. It is the creation of its member countries and it is the member countries, represented at ministerial level, which decide the rules governing trade between them. The WTO, and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is one of the institutions, like the IMF and the World Bank, set up after the Second World War to lay the basis for peaceful co-existence, trade and prosperity. Without internationally accepted rules governing world trade, countries would be free to impose barriers to imports at will and even to stop imports altogether. International trade would be subject to arbitrary and unpredictable action. The dramatic expansion of world trade over the last 60 years or so is a testimony to the benefit of rules-based trade.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a country which is heavily dependent on trade &ndash; our exports and imports combined amount to 116% of GNP &ndash; has a particular interest in rules-based trade. The Irish agricultural sector is also heavily dependent on rules-based trade. For example, we must export 90% of our beef and 80% of our dairy products. The new WTO round is not, therefore, something to be feared. On the contrary, we have a direct and major interest in a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Due to its importance, the Minister for Agriculture and Food will attend the next ministerial conference in Cancun. At this stage we have <Col N="78" />three major objectives in the agricultural area. First, we will be determined to ensure that there will be no concession or imposition on the EU that will require further reform or adjustment of the Common Agricultural Policy. The mid-term review represents, in our view, the final negotiating position of the EU in the round and the Minister will not be prepared to agree to further liberalisation measures which would require further adjustment to the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Second, as I have pointed out already, there are five strands to the Doha mandate. We will seek a balanced agreement across all five strands. Finally, while agriculture is only one of the elements which will contribute to overall agreement on a new round, we are determined that agriculture will be negotiated in its own right and will not be sacrificed to provide the basis for an overall agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The world's trading partners are concerned that the Doha agreement has run into difficulties, which have been attributed to the failure of the European Union to move on its agricultural policy. There is a perception, largely true, that the EU's generous Common Agricultural Policy is a form of protectionism. It is important to note that, despite its rhetoric, America subsidises its agricultural sector. Last year, it subsidised its farm bill to the tune of &euro;40 billion, a substantial sum. President Bush has given a commitment to make changes if there is movement on the Common Agricultural Policy. Japan subsidises its agriculture sector to a greater extent than the European Union.</P>
      <P>As I stated yesterday, the ultimate beneficiaries of food subsidies are consumers. They benefit because farmers cannot produce food at no cost. I feel sorry for some sections of the farming industry because they face difficult times.</P>
      <P>In April, Stuart Harbinson, the chairman of the agricultural talks, stated the necessary compromises remained elusive for any movement on the Doha deal. We now have a reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which will have to be tweaked in some respects at local level. Yesterday, the Minister gave the House a commitment that there would be no further changes to the Common Agricultural Policy and no further ground would be given on the Doha deal. In addition, the Minister of State said he was determined to ensure that there will be no concession or imposition on the EU that will require further reform or adjustment of the Common Agricultural Policy. I hope we can hold to these commitments. The European Union has already offered to cut tariffs by 36%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception abroad that reducing tariffs and the recent moves to change the Common Agricultural Policy will assist poorer countries. <Col N="79" />While I wish this were the case, it appears unlikely. For example, the dairy sector has been most affected by recent changes. Aside from the difficulties these will cause Irish farmers, most of the poorer countries are not major exporters of dairy products. The main beneficiaries of the changes will be developed countries such as Australia and New Zealand with low cost bases, low labour costs and excellent efficiencies in their industries. The perception that poorer countries will develop in this area is not necessarily true.</P>
    <P>As decoupled payments in the European Union are non-trade distorting, they will not impact on the forthcoming talks. Imports into the EU will definitely rise. Former Commission President, Jacques Delors, once said he was not willing to sacrifice the French countryside on the altar of free trade. I hope farmers are not being sacrificed for another section of society. While there is a perception that farmers have been subsidised for a long time, this is also true of many other walks of life.</P>
    <P>Some of the newspaper reports this morning focus on consumers. It is important to realise that farmers are also consumers. It has been said there will be cheaper food and I hope this will be the case. There is an onus in this regard on the Government, particularly the Minister who has alluded to inefficiencies in the dairy industry. While I do not wish to make personal criticisms when the Minister is not present, he has probably held the position of Minister for Agriculture and Food longer than any of his predecessors. It is a pity he has failed to take action on the dairy industry before now. It needs to be restructured and the Government should provide it with all possible assistance to do so.</P>
    <P>While expenditure on food has fallen as a percentage of consumer spending, it is not as cheap as it should be. With imports set to increase, it is essential we improve traceability and labelling. We constantly hear about Brazilian beef imports. As this is part of the agreement, I expect such imports will increase. Questions will continue to be raised about production methods and traceability in Brazil. Commissioner Byrne and the Minister will tell us &ndash; I have no evidence to the contrary &ndash; that irrespective of how Brazilian beef is produced for the home market, the methods used in the production for export are exactly the same as those in place here.</P>
    <P>It is important that people know from where the food they eat comes. Last week I attended a competition in Dunnes Stores on St. Stephen's Green, where I spent &euro;14.49 on several products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not often agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins, but he is correct on that point. When I checked the Bill for the breakdown of the origin of the products, it showed that goods to the value of just &euro;4 were Irish, while the rest, <Col N="80" />even carrots, were imports. In addition, I had deliberately tried to buy Irish. The label &ldquo;Packed in Ireland&rdquo; deceives consumers and is nothing more than a mechanism to fool people.</P>
      <P>One of my concerns about the perception that Brazil, Argentina and other poorer countries will benefit from being able to export beef is that American ranchers are buying land in Brazil and Argentina. I have nothing against America &ndash; there are also Irish people who have farms in Brazil, Argentina, New Zealand and elsewhere &ndash; but this trend shows that increased imports to the European Union of beef from these countries may not help their peoples. The issue is not, therefore, as simple as it may appear. While I am generally in favour of free trade, we must protect poorer societies.</P>
      <P>We need to consider farmers' inputs. A copy of an Ordnance Survey Ireland map now costs some &euro;40 or &euro;50. This is only one example. In terms of labour costs, we cannot have it every way. Economists writing in today's newspapers are congratulating consumers.</P>
      <P>I recall that politicians were lobbied hard when dental legislation was being introduced. I am not sure Deputy Michael D. Higgins was a Member of the House at the time. The Bill contained a minor section obliging the Irish Dental Association to release technicians to allow them to make false teeth for whomever needed them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the world trade talks in Cancun and how they could affect realities on the ground in nations across the world, including Ireland. One of the primary criticisms the public has of large global organisations such as the World Trade Organisation, is the apparent lack of democracy in the important decisions they take. People generally feel detached from the process of decision making in world bodies. The discussion by the House on the WTO at least allows ordinary public representatives to make an input on behalf of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement reached on the reform of the CAP provides a good case study of how many people view the role of supranational bodies such as the WTO. The desire of the WTO to free up trade and provide a quality of access, especially to developing nations, is almost universally accepted as a worthy idea. What concerns the public is the impact such global agreements can have at local level for business and families in Ireland. Mr. Fischler described yesterday's agreement as &ldquo;trade friendly&rdquo;. The negotiations at the WTO, which have been freed up by this new CAP <Col N="81" />deal, must be consumer friendly, and farmer friendly.</P>
    <P>One of the primary criticisms of the new deal and the CAP agreement is that the interests of Irish farmers have been sacrificed to make way for agreement at the WTO talks to increase the amount of food being imported into the EU. It is the responsibility of bodies such as the EU and WTO to ensure their methods and motives are clearly communicated to citizens affected by these policies. It has been well reported in the media that farm trade is the main stumbling block at the latest WTO talks and that the EU has come under fierce criticism for its agricultural policies.</P>
    <P>Despite the pressure and criticisms levelled at the EU, it is the responsibility of the Ministers concerned to reassure our people that their needs and interests are adequately communicated and fought for. For example, the worries of consumers about the quality and safety of food products are important aspects of agreements made by the WTO. While I welcome the opening of our markets in a fair and equitable way to developing nations in an attempt to allow them to better their finances and the conditions of their population, the safety of consumers must not be compromised in any way. In this regard, I commend the role of Commissioner David Byrne in his efforts to ensure the rights and health of consumers is paramount.</P>
    <P>In case there is too great an emphasis placed on the needs of groups and individuals in Ireland, I shall now refer to the developing nations for whom the WTO can, and must, provide a positive impact. It is estimated that by tackling the perceived protectionism in agriculture and industrial goods and services, world incomes could increase by $400 billion, or 1.4%, per year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. Like other Deputies, I wish I had more time in which to do so. My colleagues, Deputies Aylward and Michael Ahern, have outlined their strategic view of these issues. We are working together and I associate myself fully with their comments. I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, on the successful completion of the difficult round of negotiations on the reform of the CAP. Indeed, I look forward to being with them in Ireland's delegation in Cancun. At that meeting, I will join development Ministers and Ministers from developing countries to ensure that development issues and the voices of developing countries are fully represented, heard and listened to at that meeting. This will be my third opportunity to input into this phase of the WTO ministerial process as I already had the privilege of representing Ireland at the Seattle negotiations in 1999 and again at the Doha meeting in November 2001, which launched the Doha <Col N="82" />Development Agenda. That the new WTO round is called the Doha Development Agenda underlines the rich world's acceptance that addressing the concerns of its developing partners was a precondition for getting the negotiations started, just as it will be if they are to be brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>The World Trade Organisation is the major intergovernmental regulator of international trade. While its rules may in the past have been more influenced by developed economies, the weight of the developing world in the WTO is increasing. Developing countries are now the majority at the WTO and exercise in their own right, when working together, a significant negotiating block, so much so that at Doha it was accepted that the overall success of the negotiations depended on a satisfactory outcome to their development component. Ireland has an important role to play in the WTO negotiations, at EU and global levels, to help ensure a just and equitable outcome for all countries, but especially for the least developed countries, LDCs, many of which lack the resources to fully articulate and advance their national interests in this process. It would make no sense if Ireland, while being generous in its contributions to development co-operation and placing sharp focus on poverty reduction, failed to follow this strategy to its logical conclusion by ensuring that global trade is an equally effective tool in the fight against poverty in developing countries. Consequently, I strongly believe that developing countries must be supported towards their fullest participation on an equal and fair basis in the global market if the millennium development goal of combating poverty is to be achieved by its target date.</P>
      <P>Ireland, with its EU partners, has implemented a number of specific measures to further develop trade with developing countries. The new Cotonou partnership agreement between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, states, which entered into force on 1 April 2003, provides for economic partnership agreements between the EU and the ACP states which are intended to evolve into free trade areas between the regions by 2008.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These economic partnership agreements are thus seeking to use trade as a means of fostering regional integration among our developing country partners. Under the everything but arms initiative, agreed by the EU in February 2001, the least developed countries, both within and outside the ACP group, have gained duty and quota free admission to the EU market for all but three products from March 2001. In three sensitive commodity sectors full and free access will be achieved more slowly and on a phased basis &ndash; by 2006 for bananas and by 2009 for rice and sugar. This initiative is a particularly significant breakthrough for the least developed countries as it offers free market access in areas such as agricultural and textile products in which they are most likely to be competitive. I was particularly proud to have been closely involved with other <Col N="83" />EU colleagues in promoting this particular initiative. While we would have liked these measures to have had a more significant impact on the target countries, these are important steps in the right direction that hopefully can be built upon in the current negotiation round.</P>
    <P>The capacity of developing countries to participate in and benefit from international trade will also be hampered where they are affected by conflict, where there are corrupt regimes and where the practices of good governance have not yet taken root. Trade in developed or developing countries will not prosper where the laws governing the rights of investors lack transparency and where high tariff rates are imposed on the importation of investment goods. Unless supply side constraints are addressed improved market access will not lead to a major improvement in the LDCs' share in international trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the responsibilities of investors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the ability of developing countries to use the opportunities afforded by the governance and arbitration structures of the WTO to effectively represent their interests continues to be limited by their relative lack of capacity and resources to undertake trade policy analysis, to access arbitration and compensation procedures and to build effective coalitions of common interest. Capacity building in these areas is a priority for my Department. If trade liberalisation is to generate exports and growth, a strong trade supportive infrastructure is required in developing countries' economies. This capacity building challenge is being addressed on the multilateral front by a process of co-operation known as the integrated framework.</P>
      <P>This groups the six major international agencies involved in the provision of technical assistance to developing countries for trade related purposes. These agencies are the International Monetary Fund, the International Trade Centre, UNDP, World Bank, WTO and UNCTAD. The integrated framework seeks to integrate trade into the poverty reduction strategies of LDCs and to achieve this through the co-ordinated delivery of trade related technical assistance in response to needs identified by the least developed countries themselves. So far more than a dozen LDCs are being assisted through this process. As a signal of my confidence in this important venture, I committed &euro;200,000 to the integrated framework at a meeting of development Ministers from 27 countries, which took place in Copenhagen last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also conscious that increased trade and increased economic growth are necessary but not sufficient conditions for achieving a reduction in poverty. The growth must be pro-poor and its fruits in economic development must be distributed fairly across society and not just benefit particular <Col N="84" />segments of the population. I acknowledge that not all forms of foreign investment in developing countries contribute to poverty reduction. The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, in its important conclusions on trade and development last November, made clear this point. The council stated:</P>
    <P>The Council recognises that trade liberalisation in itself is not sufficient to combat poverty in developing countries. Trade reform must be part of a wider, country-owned poverty reduction strategy for which a combination of sound domestic policies, including good governance and fight against poverty, and of additional external support is needed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I believe that developing countries must have the flexibility to regulate their own economic and non-economic sectors to enable them achieve public policy objectives, such as poverty reduction or the battle against HIV-AIDS. Indeed, the need for this flexibility has already been recognised in the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS, which provides that all WTO members can regulate to guarantee the achievement of public policy objectives.</P>
    <P>I share the widely held concern at any failure to take adequate account of a potentially negative impact of trade liberalisation on reducing poverty in the LDCs. Such a failure would undo much of the work of the partner governments and donor countries in their fight against poverty and the realisation of the millennium development goals. I was impressed with the way Kofi Annan explained the importance of trade capacity building in poor countries when he stated:</P>
    <P>Poor countries must be given a fair chance to export their products, and many of them need financial and technical help &ndash; to build up their infrastructure and capacities &ndash; before they can take advantage of market opportunities. Even when the door is opened, you cannot walk through it without leg muscles.</P>
    <P>To play its part in addressing this problem, Ireland has a fund of &euro;1.5 million for trade capacity building in developing countries. Of this amount, &euro;0.34 million has been pledged to the WTO trust fund, and we have also contributed to the WTO training institute and its internship programme.</P>
    <P>The single largest programme funded by Ireland Aid in the area of trade capacity building is the WTO law advisory centre, which Ireland, together with some other WTO members, set up in 1999. Ireland Aid has pledged &euro;250,000 annually for the first five years of the centre's operation. Recently, the Dáil ratified the agreement establishing AITIC, the Agency for International Trade, Information and Co-operation. Ireland is a founder-member. It is intended specifically to address the problems of those least developed countries which do not have a presence in Geneva.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" />I have also established a task force to advise me on how we can integrate information communication technologies into Ireland Aid's development programme. Part of the wider remit of the task force is to see how the experience and expertise of the Irish private ICT sector can be best harnessed to contribute to our development efforts in this area. The most rapidly growing sector category of products in world trade has been high technology products &ndash; they now account for 25% of global trade. I hope that as well as designing an ICT strategy for Ireland Aid's own programme, the task force will also be able to make recommendations on how this trade potential of the ICT sector can contribute to the poverty reduction efforts of developing countries as well.</P>
    <P>Returning to the WTO negotiations, there are a number of issues of particular concern to developing countries and those who are working toward a more just and equitable global trade system. Ireland, through its participation in the formulation of EU positions on these issues, has sought to give a strong pro-poor perspective to the agenda. On agriculture, in line with the Doha Declaration, the EU is seeking improved market access for all, lower trade distorting subsidies, reductions in all forms of export aid and special and differential treatment for developing countries.</P>
    <P>A key outcome of the Doha meeting was a political declaration on the relationship between the TRIPS agreement, referred to earlier, and public health in developing countries. Acknowledging the serious public health crisis afflicting many developing countries, especially HIV-AIDS, Ministers agreed that public health concerns should override the issue of patent laws and that the rules governing the import by developing countries of patented drugs should be relaxed sufficiently to allow those countries access to cheap medicines to fight diseases such as HIV-AIDS and malaria.</P>
    <P>Within our delegation I strongly supported this EU initiative and it is a matter of considerable regret to me that after all countries at Doha had thus committed themselves to the principle of access to medicines for all, this has still not been implemented, despite a deadline set for this purpose and the best efforts of many delegations to find a satisfactory outcome. A resolution, favourable to developing countries, of the access to medicines issue in the context of the TRIPS agreement has been a consistent EU position from the outset. The TRIPS agreement was meant to resolve this matter, but, sadly, due to opposition from sections of the pharmaceutical industry, the agreement has not been honoured.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I regret we do not have more time to discuss this issue, which is of great concern to me. I welcome the points made and I hope we will be able to present a stronger case in Cancun because there is much work to be done. The WTO is not perfect and is in many ways seen as the preserve of the rich. I listened carefully to Deputy Michael D. Higgins's comments, but he <Col N="86" />should acknowledge the good work that has been done. We are trying to make it a better organisation. The vast majority of its members are from the developing world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I only have three and a half minutes to make my case in this debate. The Minister of State said the developing states make up the majority of the members of the WTO, but does he seriously suggest they have equal status to the developed countries? That would be a nonsense. The WTO is housed in a grandiose premises in Geneva and deals with huge amounts of legislation. Developing countries do not have the wherewithal to provide the necessary lawyers and expertise to deal with it. They cannot compete.</P>
      <P>The WTO favours the transnational companies. We know that more people today are hungry than at any time in our history. The WTO has failed the poverty stricken on the globe and I hope the Minister of State will acknowledge that. There is huge inequality and a lack of accountability and democracy.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the United States, we in Europe see ourselves as the good guys. From my experience attending the world summit on sustainable development, the developing countries do not see it like that. We are equally culpable. We are not the good guys. This can be seen in the stance taken by those who are referred to as anti-globalisation. A more accurate term would be anti-capitalist because globalisation is a fancy new word for capitalism. They say there is a lack of democracy and that they do not want new powers to be given to the WTO. The Green Party supports that. I do not understand how we could have supported Article 133 of the Nice treaty because it reinforces the lack of accountability.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate that when Ireland holds the EU Presidency, he will seek to ensure that the Article 133 committee makes all agendas available to the public and that there will be complete transparency? Next week, Part III of the proposed EU constitution will be debated in the European Parliament. The European Green Party has submitted an amendment which calls for the right of assent of the European Parliament to ensure that at least there will be democratic scrutiny. I ask the Government to support the amendment because we need to democratise this institution. It cannot meet behind closed doors. We as parliamentarians must have some say, and this debate is a good start. The European Parliament must have some input and the right of assent. It is not right that Pascal Lamy can do his own thing and meet other multinational representatives behind closed doors.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 13 of the ministerial declaration at Doha refers to the WTO objectives of creating a fair and open market orientated trading system in which agriculture subsidies and <Col N="87" />trade distorting domestic supports are eliminated. No reasonable person could object to this if it was to mean that the people of the developing countries will benefit. However, unfortunately, past experience indicates they will not. Instead, it would appear that the interests at the centre of the current WTO negotiations are those of the richest developed countries and the multinational corporations. This is as true in agriculture as in any other sector. At least UNESA, the European bosses union, is honest when it demands trade liberalisation but argues for the retention of export subsidies that allows EU agricultural corporations to dump food on the developing world.</P>
      <P>There are too many double standards. While it is fine for the EU and the USA to subsidise heavily their farmers, it is unacceptable for the poorest and most vulnerable states to do the same. This practice can assume obscene proportions. Less than 30,000 US cotton farmers receive more in annual subsidies than the GDP of Burkina Faso. Another glaring contradiction is that state trading organisations in developing countries are being asked to step down while the powers of the giant multinational agri-corporations, such as Cargill, continue to grow. Some of the proposals to be discussed at Cancun would have the effect of increasing the power of such corporations if they were implemented by permitting them to patent seeds and tighten their grip on all aspects of the food system.</P>
      <P>That trade liberalisation is not a universal panacea has, in any event, been proven since the agreement on agriculture which formed part of the Uruguay Round. It was claimed the agreement would benefit developing countries, but their share of world agricultural markets has not grown while their dependency on food imports has. Not only are the multinationals intent on controlling the marketing of food, they wish also to dominate the entire system from seed production up. This is one of the main reasons companies like Monsanto wish to promote genetically modified organisms. The multinationals have already begun to establish a grip on the seed market to the extent that in 1993 three of them controlled 70% of the Asian market. They wish to tighten their grip by having the WTO agree to new measures to cover so-called intellectual property rights which will allow them to establish patents over the seeds needed by farmers in developing countries. This process must be vigorously opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a minimum, a central part of this State's negotiating strategy at the WTO talks should be support for a development box to allow developing countries to protect their fragile food systems. Ireland should seek to protect the rights of farmers to save and exchange seeds while resisting the efforts of multinationals to secure an agreement on patents. The State should oppose patents of life forms and measures to force developing countries to open their public services to competition from multinationals. We should <Col N="88" />seek full inclusion of workers' rights in any World Trade Organisation agreement.</P>

      <P>The interventions of Ministers of State speaking on behalf of the Government regarding Ireland's position in the run-up to the World Trade Organisation's decisive meeting at Cancun, Mexico, would lead the House to believe the organisation was a munificent one dedicated to the well-being of humanity. These interventions represent a self-deluded, deliberate and fanciful flight from the grim reality of the manner in which world trade is rigged by the most powerful governments in the interests of the most powerful transnational corporations they represent. This rigging of trade involves a crushing loss to the billions who suffer poverty, disease and environmental degradation, particularly in the Third World. The Ministers and the WTO make soft noises about the importance of taking poor countries into account, but this is utter hypocrisy since the effect of world trade as conducted is to rob poorer nations of their natural resources and raw materials in a systematic and ruthless fashion. The terms of trade are rigged in such a way as to ensure that primary materials, such as coffee and other crucial products, come to world markets at rock bottom prices while manufactured goods are very expensive.</P>
      <P>The European Union represents a major part of the problem, as does the United States of America. Reference has been made to the dumping of agricultural products which is devastating the economies of small farming communities in southern Africa. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are not neutral agencies, rather they are agents of the main imperialist powers, particularly the United States of America. The invasion of Iraq a few months ago represented a not so subtle threat by that imperialist power which indicated that if its diktats in economic as well as in other matters did not run, military intervention could result. For the last number of decades, the so-called structural reform conditions the World Bank and IMF have placed on Third World countries have caused utter devastation. Such conditions are a weapon to force these countries to open their economies to unfettered entry by multinational corporations. What public services exist are privatised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meetings of the WTO are attended by hundreds of officials from the United States of America and the multinationals who bamboozle and bully their way through negotiations and by a few bewildered representatives from the poorest countries on earth. Under the WTO and the systems it represents there will never be justice or an end to poverty, disease and environmental degradation. The millions marching against globalisation demonstrate this. The goal is super profit for the super wealthy. We must overthrow this system and put the products and means to create them into the hands of working people, small farmers and the poor of the Third World. Only then can we have real planning. To overcome the <Col N="89" />problems, we must dedicate resources to eradicating disease, poverty and war. That is the way to create a just world. The Government has been shamefully inadequate in these discussions.</P>

      <P>Many question the wisdom of free trade, but we must remember where we would be without it while reaffirming our commitment to its tenets. Barriers and tariffs lead to economic depression and protectionism serves only to create no-win scenarios. Free trade cuts the cost of living and raises its standard as we know from our own experience. It has also been the experience of many other countries. Free trade broadens consumer choice, stimulates employment and increases the efficiency of the system. An open approach to trade serves to protect society from the narrow sectional interests which may seek to influence public policy for their own ends.</P>
      <P>The role of the World Trade Organisation in the regulation of trade is vital as it insists on a rules-based rather than a power-based system. Many myths exists to the effect that the WTO is an unaccountable monster, but it is, in reality, an organisation driven by the mutual interests of its members. It is not committed to free trade for its own sake and its talks feature always a commitment to principles of non-discrimination whereby stable, predictable and transparent conditions in which trade can flourish are created. The organisation does not promote commercial interests ahead of sustainable development. Some argue that it destroys jobs and spreads poverty, but all of the available evidence shows that liberalisation since the Second World War has raised billions of people from conditions of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated for the candour and frankness of his statements, especially with regard to the sluggish progress of the talks. It is imperative that the Cancun meeting manifests a drive to get talks moving. Ireland's main concern during these discussions has been to see the development of liberalised free trade in an even-handed and reasonable manner. We are all keen to encourage the underpinning of the World Trade Organisation's maintenance of a steady and regular framework through which to interpret the rules of world trade. Fundamental to our cause is a desire to react helpfully to the development of the world's full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small, open economy, we know a liberal free trade environment is vital to our economic development. More and more enterprises are seeking to expand through foreign trade and it is clear that a highly-skilled and sophisticated workforce has played a part in this process thus far. One of the great advantages of being a small country is a realisation that the world does not <Col N="90" />revolve around us. Ireland has been transformed from a rural, agriculturally-based society to a vibrant, dynamic and technologically-advanced country. Trade can have a tremendous effect on productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, savings and enterprise. It will also encourage a broadening of the scope of technical advice. This is a universal gain from extending the range of commodities available. The beneficial impact of competition on price levels is internationally acknowledged. Business benefits through the extension of the parameters of supply and demand. Ireland knows this better than most. Membership of the European Union since 1973 has provided a massive boost to our living standards.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the dependence of our economy on international trade means it is crucial that the WTO continues in its roles as chief authority and regulator of international trade. A small country such as Ireland needs a strong WTO to ensure that freedom of trade does not simply serve to facilitate the dominance of larger countries. As has often been observed, Ireland's economic accomplishments have been contingent on free trade. As a percentage of GNP exports have more than doubled in real terms. Few nations have such a dependency. Exports are a substantial element of our national economy and are vital if Ireland is to maintain existing standards.</P>
    <P>The changes in the agricultural subsidies in the Fischler proposals should be acceptable at the WTO talks. It should not be necessary to make adjustments to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. The World Trade Organisation is the major intergovernmental regulator of international trade. However, one cannot be proud of the success of that organisation over recent years. When the fifth ministerial conference of the WTO takes place in Mexico next September it will be an opportunity for small countries like Ireland to put the spotlight on how smaller and developing countries have been let down by this organisation. Over the years it has been nothing but a talking shop and the influence it was supposed to exert on world trade to benefit smaller and developing countries has been anything but satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I am glad Ireland will be represented at the conference and I wish the Minister and the Government's delegation every success there. However, if the negotiations which have taken place in the time leading up to the September meeting are any indication of what will happen, it augurs poorly for the conference. No progress has been made in Geneva in anticipation of the conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has succeeded beyond everybody's expectations in turning the economy around in recent years. If it demonstrates one thing, however, it is that the better we do and the more comfortable we become, the less we think of the less fortunate. Ireland had a proud tra<Col N="91" />dition of sending missionaries to developing countries, particularly in Africa. I do not see the same commitment now in our community. If the reaction to the influx of non-nationals over the past four or five years is a barometer of public opinion, it shows there is outright hostility to some of them. People feel they are encroaching on what is rightfully theirs. The Government has to detach itself from the insular attitude of some sectors of our society.</P>
    <P>This country has done well and we should be proud of what we have achieved. However, we have an even more important role to play on the international scene. When our delegation goes to Mexico in September, it will be an opportunity for Ireland to stand up to the bigger players in the world economic sphere, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The Russian Federation has now taken its place in that sphere and has become a bigger player than it was five years ago. Ireland has an opportunity to make its case at the conference.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned that while the world economy has prospered over the past ten years, developing countries have not prospered as well. The political scene in certain African states is difficult and does not do their cause any good, but that should not be used as a stick with which to beat them.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food on successfully negotiating the mid-term review of the CAP. That is something in our armoury. The issue has been resolved for the coming years and we should now use our influence within the European Union and our forthcoming Presidency to not just our own advantage but also that of developing countries which do not have the same position and voice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened in recent days to the distress of various representatives of farming organisations and their fears and concerns for Irish farming and the future of family farming in Ireland. We should also think about the fears of farmers in Africa. It should be borne in mind that there are different farming sectors in Africa. Some are run by multinationals and some by larger farmers, mostly men, but the majority of farmers in Africa are women. These women farm at subsistence level. Unless the WTO has something to offer to the African farming woman, who not only farms but also must get water and collect wood for the fire so they can have some existence, the process is meaningless in terms of making a difference to the poorest people in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" />Irish people are pleased that, in terms of its foreign aid package, Ireland has contributed in a way that has made a significant difference to a number of extremely poor African countries. We are now making a substantial effort to contribute aid and as long as the commitment to the 0.7% target remains part of Government policy and is implemented each year for the rest of the decade, we will continue to make a significant contribution in that area. Rapid progress to good governance, democratic institutions and free elections are another part of the policy mix. We should bear in mind that there are some significant successes in Africa in this regard, particularly in South Africa. Recently, people have experienced a tremendous amount of hope and expectation about developments in Kenya. We must support these developments.</P>
    <P>Overall, the cumulative effects of aid transfers have been disappointing, with shocking levels of poverty evident in almost every part of Africa. Each individual component of the aid programme is worthwhile in itself, notably those devoted to health and education, but after 30 years of Irish aid we need to ask why the accumulated result is so disappointing. I believe Ireland has paid insufficient attention to the third vital pillar of development, trade and support for economic development. The different rounds of trade talks have so far failed to offer the least developed countries the type of trade terms that will act as a genuine stimulus to economic development. We need only glance at our recent history to recognise the value of a good balance of aid transfers with genuine trade opportunities and to see what can be achieved. This is one of the reasons Ireland remains of interest to so many developing countries. Africa has undoubted sources of natural wealth and a capacity to produce adequate and surplus food supplies. Around every corner in Africa there is a plain or a valley which with high-tech agriculture would feed the whole of Africa and possibly the world. Anyone who has spent time in Africa is familiar with that phenomenon. Nonetheless, Africa will remain in the least developed league of poorest nations until the issue of the terms of trade is settled.</P>
    <P>All United Nations development agendas, social programmes and long-term targets will remain pipe dreams until the trade issue is faced and settled, not just by the governments of the wealthiest nations but also by the ruling elites in many poor countries who have been happy to do deals with the European Union and, in particular, with the United States. Many of the current rules and working practices are directly hostile to long-term development, especially the practice of dumping surplus food products, many of them from the United States, which has an immediate and damaging effect on local food producers and the prices they can get for their foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The WTO conference is one opportunity to remedy some of these practices. There has to be a will to change and reform. To date there have been lots of reports, promises and photo oppor<Col N="93" />tunities with pop stars but precious little sustained action on relieving the debt. I hope the calls for action on the trade front that will enable the poorest nations to obtain fair access to global markets will get a more favourable reaction. I do not have any optimism on this front. The current Administration in Washington has shown scant regard for rules of fair play and trade in its own decisions, for example, on steel imports last year. On the wider agenda its approach to the current round of talks seems to be set by the narrow interests of its own global corporations, notably on GM foods.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has to go to this round of talks with a clear grasp of where the different interests of the US and the EU, as well as our interests and those of the poorest countries in the world, lie. We have to identify those different interests very clearly. I fear that Washington will turn a deaf ear to all pleas that do not fit in with the narrow agenda pursued by US global interests. We saw this in operation in the case of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. It is evident in the reaction, as the Minister of State has outlined, of pharmaceutical corporations to the promises to make high-tech and intermediate medicine available at a reasonable cost, using generic brands, to developing countries, particularly for the treatment of AIDS. To say they are dragging their feet is to be very fair. What is happening is a disgrace. It is a pity that so few eminent medical people are prepared to speak out on this in the context of their oath.</P>
    <P>The position on intellectual property rights and the demands for the protection of the interests of investors all come from the view that what is good for the American corporate sector is good in the long run and in the here and now for that poor African farmer. However, American intransigence is no excuse for European foot-dragging. Most EU countries, especially the large member states, have long-standing trade and economic links with their former African colonies. Others, such as Ireland and the Scandinavian nations, have created valuable aid-based links and our foreign and development ministries have first-hand knowledge of the problems within the least developed countries. They know what the problems are and that introducing advanced systems, without consultation or looking at the impact on food supplies and food securities in rural areas, can be fatally damaging to the immediate livelihoods of the people affected by these changes. That knowledge should inform our approach to the WTO talks. Justice in trade is a worthy objective, as important in our foreign policy as the UN aid target.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the US attitude to climate change a few moments ago. Other environmental issues also arise, as do working conditions in industries making goods for export to Europe. Slave labour conditions are prevalent in many countries producing fashionable items for the global market, and any new set of trade rules must find a way to remedy this. The legacy of trade unionism, social<Col N="94" />ism and social democracy in Europe which built proper working conditions for workers in Europe over the last 150 years, is one that we as a country, and Europe as a continent, ought to carry proudly to Cancun. We have nothing to apologise for, particularly to the US or to multinational corporations, in seeking to protect and ensure minimum labour conditions.</P>
    <P>I have heard the esteemed former head of GATT, Peter Sutherland, argue that it is good for 14 year olds to be able to make carpets and go blind in different parts of the world. He also argues that it is a moral hazard to relieve the debts of the poor and give them easy terms of trade because they might go and waste it. Unless we face up to the real needs and do so in a phased way that allows African countries some growth and prosperity, we might as well stay at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>International trade is not working for the world's poor and we should address that imbalance. I agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Nolan. There should be no new powers for the WTO. We should recognise that developing countries lack the capacity to deal with issues already on the table, and stop pressing for extended WTO authority in the intended four areas. There should be reform of agricultural subsidies to end dumping of surpluses in developing countries. We should support the French proposal to not subsidise exports to sub-Saharan Africa while trade negotiations are going on. We should allow developing countries to choose the trade policies that work for them and to ensure that trade rules promote human rights, gender equality and care for the environment in all countries. I support the call to increase the role of the European Parliament in trade policy making. At the very least, the Parliament should be given the power of assent to the signing of international agreements on trade as has already been the case in other areas.</P>
      <P>For years the Irish people have been generous in their support by way of charitable donations to developing countries but times have moved on from there. We live in a different world today. It is no longer enough to merely supply a donation and walk away in the hope that it will set things moving in the proper direction. The world has become far more complex and the issues the developing countries face are more complicated. That is why our support should be more than donations. The forthcoming WTO talks in Cancun are important not only for our peace of mind as a country that for a long time has felt the need to help and support the developing world but as an opportunity for us to help redress the inequality between the developed and the developing world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few simple suggestions that I hope the Minister would consider when engaging in the forthcoming talks, and more importantly use to urge our European partners, through our Minister for Foreign Affairs, to adopt a similar approach. We should do all we can to limit or <Col N="95" />prevent any new powers being granted to the WTO in its dealings with developing countries which has neither the necessary experience nor framework to compete with some of the other interests in this world. It will serve only to make the imbalance greater if we allow that to continue. We must not press for extending the WTO's authority to the intended four areas as that will simply result in the kinds of problems that we should avoid at all costs &ndash; obviously that is what we hope to do. Developing countries should be given the opportunity to implement the trade policies that best suit their needs and will be of greatest benefit to them. However, it is important to make the point that such policies must bring more human rights, gender equality and freedom from persecution, and take note of environmental concerns.</P>
    <P>The issue of increasing the role of the European Parliament in making trade policy should be examined in greater detail. It might help in making the Union's trade policy more transparent and open to debate, as well as more important. The possibility of granting the Parliament power of assent must be seriously examined.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion that I would like to make to the Minister is one that I have mentioned before, but it nonetheless bears repeating. The French have come up with a proposal not to subsidise exports to sub-Saharan African countries while the trade negotiations are in progress. The issue of dumping surpluses in developing countries must be further examined. The situations that I have mentioned are of conflict, and they will require a good deal of further examination. I have great faith and I believe that the Irish team will adopt the approach that will be of greatest benefit.</P>
    <P>I would also like to note the suggestion that there be an annual report to the Oireachtas on Ireland's position on the WTO talks. We must at all times make our position clearer, helping to remove the proverbial mud from the water. I believe that there should be such a scheme in place so that the Government is more likely to receive praise for its efforts. The NGOs would then be able to comment and offer advice on our position. Those are simple issues that can be examined, but I am also heartened by the great deal of work that has been done along the line so far. The EU has a stated objective of building on the progress already achieved with a view to reaching a substantial development package by the time of the Cancun talks to ensure that developing countries' needs are properly addressed throughout the round. I applaud such a position.</P>
    <P>The four areas that will form the progress hoped for in special and differential treatment decisions &ndash; those that apply only to developing countries &ndash; are market access commitments in sectors of interest to developing countries; stronger WTO rules to encourage and promote development; the need to increase the level of aid <Col N="96" />to developing countries; and to help them, more importantly, to trade and integrate not just with the large trade blocks such as the EU and the US but also, more importantly, among themselves. By giving due concern in those areas, the Irish WTO team can play a significant role in shaping the future of the world as a whole and can help the continued exploitation of those countries by those who know how to speak the language of world trade better. The WTO should not be a competitive forum but should do what is best for the world as a whole. I am sure the Minister shares those concerns expressed by my colleagues and I hope that all will be done. I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this matter and I look forward to seeing more progress in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an opportunity for Ireland to make its name in the EU if it has the political will to do so. It is a chance for the Irish Government to stand out and say to our partners in the European Union that we want to see action rather than words on this occasion in the context of the talks in Cancun. One must remember that the Irish economy is one of the wealthiest not only in Europe but in the world. We carry with that, because of the great work carried out over the years by our missionaries and non-governmental organisations, a moral authority within the EU when dealing with the outstanding issues which so badly need to be tackled in the context of this round of talks.</P>
      <P>The Irish economy has come a long way in trade liberalisation, export and employment growth and general wealth per head of population in the past ten or 12 years. Sacrifices were made arising from the debt-ridden economy that we had in the 1980s. We sorted ourselves out, and we did so successfully. If we examine the Irish economy today and compare that with what my colleague, Deputy Murphy, described as the 1.2 billion people living on less than &euro;1 a day in the developing countries, it should certainly strike a chord with Ministers negotiating on our behalf in Europe and as part of the EU delegation. Priority and emphasis must be applied on this occasion far greater than in the past. We are now a member of the European club that should be able to give rather than take. That is why I was very disappointed with the Government's hypocrisy in cutting the overseas development aid budget as a soft place to get the necessary finance to balance its books after the general election when it made that decision last year. It was unnecessary, and it certainly breeds further political cynicism when one considers that the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, to save the Government, could find &euro;12 million on a weekend because some company did not take up money &ndash; that company's name was Global Crossing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To solve a Government problem with school fees, the money could be found, for political reasons. However, ultimately the cut in the overseas development aid budget was seen as an <Col N="97" />extremely soft option and one that the Government understood would not cost too much political support. It will cost support, though, because there is a growing moral and ethical awareness in this country of the need, and obligation, to deal with issues of poverty and starvation in the world. No one understands how one can have a European Union able to create world food surpluses when the next-door continent of Africa has starvation. That means that the political will is necessary. I know that my view is different from that of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, the Minister's colleague, regarding Irish agricultural proposals agreed in Brussels. However, the Minister is well aware of the trepidation of Deputy O'Keeffe regarding agriculture and he is certainly very much aware of his unpredictability on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is another issue that I find hypocritical in the context of our position in the European Union. We have no difficulty in supporting the European Union on the liberalisation of trade, the removal of tariffs and intensive negotiations on free trade and competition across a range of goods and services. However, there is not the same emphasis from the United States when there is a dictator in Africa or starving people. As I said, 1.2 billion people earn less than $1 a day. There is no political will in that jurisdiction to deal with the starving people in Africa or take on a dictatorship there. However, there was one dictator they had no difficulty taking on because there were oil reserves in Iraq. There is certainly a hypocritical trend, and the EU is at the forefront of exposing it. Ireland should take a leading role, by making sure that it is part of the EU negotiations, in ensuring that we deal with human misery. Human as well as financial resources must be dealt with. We must be selfless rather than selfish in helping our fellow human beings. I compliment the non-governmental organisations, which have been doing tremendous work on behalf of Ireland, the citizens of Africa and starving peoples around the world. However, they need support. All those organisations have come together responsibly and put their views to the Oireachtas committee and the Government. However, they are not getting enough help in the context of EU negotiations to put forward the views of those organisations regarding access to food and medicine and the transparency of the talks process. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, is anxious to help and is doing what he can. However, we must ensure our EU partners get the message that collectively we can take on the economies that are stifling progress in dealing with issues of starvation and access to food and medicine once and for all in the developing countries.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how we could have done things differently but we are not helping ourselves in the context of our EU influence when Ministers speak in a Eurosceptic way. Ireland could have been more successful in the Fischler talks, effectively commercial agriculture is on the way out, if there was more commitment from the <Col N="98" />Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who regularly speak in Eurosceptic tones about Europe interfering in the affairs of Ireland. That is not helpful to providing the type of cohesion and influence required. If we expect to make our mark as part of an EU delegation in the World Trade Organisation talks, I would be concerned that the stance of those Ministers who look to Boston rather than Berlin and are not enthusiastic Europeans will damage Ireland's prospects of having a moral and political influence in Europe. I regret that our stance within the EU is eroding the considerable influence built up over the years. The first indication of a difficulty in bringing the people of Ireland with us as enthusiastic Europeans was in the first Nice referendum. This difficulty was contributed to by the Euroscepticism of some of our Ministers. We have to decide whether we are enthusiastic Europeans and whether we will have moral and political authority and build friendships and alliances with the new EU member states in order to get the issues we regard as important on the political agenda for the World Trade Organisation talks. As one of the wealthier countries in the EU we have the opportunity to take a stand both within and outside Europe on these important issues.</P>
    <P>The penalties for breaking rules are a joke. There is no such thing as a penalty for countries which have broken the rules when it comes to World Trade Organisation talks. Countries dump food in developing countries <i>ad nauseam,</i> particularly the US and nothing is done about it. A blind eye is turned to a reasonable suggestion from the French that there should be a tax on the arms industry. This is repudiated immediately by the United States. Europe has to stand up for itself against the United States and other countries in these talks and adopt a prominent and forthright position. It could be led by Ireland with moral authority if we have the political will to do so.</P>

    <P>There are less than 50 working days left before the Cancun meeting and there is a need for more real effort to be put into the negotiations if there is to be a successful outcome. The work is ongoing in Geneva and there will be meetings at official level during July and August in order to prepare reports to be presented to Ministers in Cancun. In addition, EU Ministers are meeting in Italy in early July to hear reports from the EU Trade Commissioner, Pascal Lamy, on the state of play in the negotiations. Mr. Lamy will, I hope, <Col N="99" />be able to give us a well-informed assessment of the prospects for Cancun. I have no doubt further ministerial meetings will be arranged if this is considered necessary. The EU Trade Minister will be in virtually continuous contact during the Cancun meeting.</P>
    <P>Turning to some of the points made by Deputies, I emphasise that central to our approach is the development aspect of these negotiations. A number of Deputies mentioned the danger of overloading the WTO agenda, particularly in regard to the Singapore issues. I appreciate, and the EU appreciates, the constraints faced by many developing countries in trying to deal with the many and varied issues arising in the WTO. The volume of assistance, both financial and technical, provided by the EU to help the large number of developing countries in this regard is substantial. As the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, said, Ireland plays its full part in providing this assistance. Notwithstanding this, the EU considers that the so-called Singapore issues should be added to the negotiating agenda. These issues &ndash; investment, competition, Government procurement and trade facilitation &ndash; are important matters which have a significant influence on global trade and, therefore, should be subject to multilaterally agreed rules.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that the establishment of such rules would be beneficial to the future development of the economies of developing countries, particularly rules regarding trade facilitation and investment. It has already been indicated that the ambition of the EU in these new areas is minimal and also it takes into account the ability of countries to participate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy and others suggested there should be opportunities for the Oireachtas to consider the issues on a regular basis. I am willing to report to the Oireachtas on these negotiations. Departmental officials met with the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business two weeks ago and today's exchange of views also indicates the Government's willingness to discuss these matters in the House as appropriate. I look forward to the opportunity for discussions after the Cancun meeting.</P>

      <Col N="100" />In regard to the Article 133 committee, I have made arrangements for agendas to be published during our Presidency next year. On the question of transparency within the WTO, I will continue to support proposals for making WTO more open and more accessible. I will try to keep all the interested parties informed of developments. I meet regularly with companies, consumers and all NGO interests. The Irish delegation to Cancun will include a number of representatives of the NGOs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory mentioned the French proposal for special efforts for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. This proposal was made by France in the context of the recent G8 summit but no further action was agreed there. Ireland supported the French suggestion when it was raised in the Article 133 committee. We will be positive towards any future discussion on it. Ireland and the EU are fully committed to development and with this in mind the EU submissions and proposed modalities for agricultural market access included a number of proposals specifically aimed at developing countries which were later included in the WTO chairman's own proposals, such as tariff elimination in sectors of particular interest to developing countries, including fish, footwear, clothing and textiles.</P>
    <P>In a general response to the comments of Deputy Michael D. Higgins, I should say that trade rules, even if they are agreed internationally, cannot override the other concerns of society. The important point is to ensure they are compatible. This is a principle to which I fully subscribe.</P>
    <P>The question of the lack of democracy in the WTO has been raised by a number of Deputies. I would point out that in the WTO, decisions are taken by consensus and each member has one vote regardless of economic clout and developing countries are increasingly making their presence felt. The WTO cannot be hijacked by a group of countries or multinational companies.</P>
    <P>We want to see the commitments entered into in Doha regarding developing countries fully delivered on. I hope the outcome of Cancun will facilitate the achievement of these objectives.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 1 July 2003.</P>
