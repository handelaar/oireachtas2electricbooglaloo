      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach a simple and straight question which affects every man, woman and child in the country. What do the Taoiseach and the Government intend to do in the event of the United States invading Iraq without United Nations' backing? Will he support it? Does he intend to break Ireland's long-standing position of supporting the primacy of the United Nations?</P>
      <P>Last night in the House the Minister for Foreign Affairs said quite clearly that Resolution 1441 does not provide automatic authorisation for military action. He said that if we are to preserve the legitimacy of the United Nations, a second resolution is necessary, but this morning we read in the national newspapers that well placed Government sources are now preparing for a fundamental shift in Ireland's foreign policy and that the bottom line is that we will do what the Americans want. What is the position? It is a straight question and it deserves a straight answer.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government. We stand on the brink of war. Everyone in this country and around the world is now consumed with this crisis. It is time to know where the Government stands on this issue. There must be no more shilly-shallying and no more confusing speak. What is the Taoiseach's and the Government's position?</P>

      <P>It is not much more than 12 hours since all those questions were answered in a long debate and in a question and answer session with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the House. I will restate what he said. The Minister said that because of the importance and the primacy of the United Nations and of the Security Council, we would continue to work wholeheartedly with them. On 8 November when we were on the Security Council, we put our heart and soul into trying to get what we believed would lead to a peaceful resolution, that is, Resolution 1441 which received the unanimous agreement of the Security Council. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated last night, it is his view &ndash;<Col N="366" /> he was speaking for the Government &ndash; that we require a second resolution. I hope that will happen but we must wait until work is completed at the end of this week. On Friday, Dr. Blix and Dr. El Baradei will report back to the Security Council on their weekend mission. We will then know with what the Security Council is faced. There is also a European Council meeting next week.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue, as it has traditionally done, to work with the Security Council and the United Nations to try to come to a satisfactory conclusion. We hope a peaceful resolution will be achieved. Perhaps people will say our efforts will be inconsiderable but we were on the Security Council and we have a good track record in humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. Our efforts, whether considerable or not, will be directed at trying to find a peaceful resolution. If that does not happen, it will not be this country's fault but it will be in the hands of others, mainly Saddam Hussein who could resolve this crisis very quickly.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael is opposed to a unilateral invasion of Iraq and believes only multilateral action supported by the United Nations should be considered. The Taoiseach has not answered my question and he has responded by giving us information we already know. If a second resolution is required and if that is what Ireland supports, is there any validity in the quoted claims of well placed Government sources this morning that the bottom line is that Ireland will do what the Americans want?</P>
      <P>On Monday the Taoiseach will attend an EU meeting in Brussels at which Ireland's position will have to be clearly outlined. What is the Taoiseach's and the Government's position? Do he and the Government intend to support the United States in the event of a unilateral invasion of Iraq or do they intend only to support the United Nations and its primacy as this country has always done? Will the Taoiseach give a straight answer to that straight question?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that according to the Department of Education and Science, 5,000 claims for compensation have been made under the redress scheme? Given that the Government assessed a likely expectation of 2,000 claims at a cost of &euro;500 million, if there are now 5,000 claims, the cost will be in excess of at least &euro;1 billion. Does the Taoiseach think it is proportionate that taxpayers should be responsible for &euro;1 billion, or more, and the religious institutions for &euro;27.4 million? Did the Attorney General give approval for land properties assets in trust for a particular purpose being transferred to the State for this purpose? Did the Taoiseach have an audit done of the properties and assets of the religious congregations? Will he confirm that the wider deed of indemnity, which was never advised to this House or debated on any record available of this House, was drafted in the office of Arthur Cox for CORI? Is he saying the <Col N="368" /> office of the Attorney General was involved in the final negotiations and conclusion of the indemnity? If not, is he saying the Attorney General nonetheless approved the wider indemnity for sanction for Cabinet? Were the agreement and deed signed before or after the Government meeting that endorsed it? Will he publish and make available the 150 or so documents held by the Department of Education and Science relating to the deal, even at this late stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best in three minutes. On the question relating to the basis for the figures, it is estimated that it could be in the region of 3,000 to 5,000 cases. We do not know exactly how many people will lodge claims. We anticipate that it will be in the region of 3,000 but it could increase to 5,000. People are talking about higher figures but we do not think that in monetary terms it will reach anything like &euro;1 billion. We still think the original estimate will not be too far out, but it depends on the nature of the large claims. Some of these cases are very serious.</P>
      <P>The indemnity was worked out in February. On 20 February the Minister made a statement. All those involved, including the Departments of Education and Science and Finance, and the Attorney General's office were aware of the terms of the indemnity. As far as Arthur Cox is concerned, the initial draft agreement was proposed by CORI in 2001. It was not accepted at the time. In January 2002, the Minister made the agreement in principle on the amount of the congregations' contribution towards the redress schemes. Officials of the Departments of Finance, Education and Science and the Attorney General's office set out to hammer out the details of the agreement. The Arthur Cox document was used as a starting point but was substantially revised to accommodate the requirements of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have replied to most of the other issues to which the Deputy referred, but he asked me about the money aspects. Agreement was reached that the congregations would contribute &euro;128 million towards the redress scheme. As I said yesterday, there was no exact scientific formula for reaching a figure for the congregations' contribution. However, a number of agreements were made. One was that &euro;41 million would be in cash, of which just over &euro;34 million has been lodged to date. It was intended by CORI that &euro;12.7 million would be placed in an educational trust, but this was not accepted by the Department and a minimum cash amount of &euro;41 million <Col N="369" /> was later agreed. There was &euro;77 million in property transfers.</P>
    <P>The State can refuse to accept any property offered and can seek alternative properties. The property issues are still under discussion with the representatives of CORI, and any shortfall in property must be made up by cash. CORI originally wanted to go back ten years, which the Minister did not accept. Following intensive negotiations, a date in May was agreed, and I apologised on behalf of the Government to those people affected over the years. A sum of &euro;10 million was put forward for counselling. There was a commitment to continue this service for as long as required, even after the &euro;10 million was spent.</P>
    <P>The legal indemnity covers only those cases which could be heard by the redress board but where the victim has opted instead for a court hearing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach was answering 20 questions there, I would not like him to have been doing an examination. He is still engaged in obfuscation. Surely he knows at this stage how many claims are with the Department of Education and Science. Why is the Taoiseach still muttering that it could be between 2,000 and 5,000? Is it not a fact that if 2,000 cost &euro;500 million, 4,000 are likely to cost &euro;1 billion? What is the mystery about that? The Taoiseach obviously had no audit done of the properties or assets. It is obvious that the wider deed of indemnity was not debated in this House or advised to the House and was drafted by Arthur Cox. Is not that a fact? Is the Taoiseach saying to this House that his Ministers knew this wider indemnity covered cases where the claimants had resort to the courts as well as to the redress board? I believe they did not. I also believe the Attorney General was not involved. It is for him to say why he was not involved, because he should have been involved. Is it not the case that for the disgracefully abused victims, who deserve compensation, the Taoiseach did a recklessly negligent deal for the same reason he was recklessly negligent with the public finances because he wanted to win votes coming up to a general election? It was a disgraceful deal for taxpayers.</P>

It is quite clear that if the Government did not act as it did throughout all of this, those who were abused and suffered in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and until the Kennedy report of 1970 which recommended closure of industrial schools, would not have been dealt with. The Government made a decision that we should find a way to fast track these cases and not make each individual in the courts go through the trauma of decades, as CORI and the religious orders wanted. The Government stood up for these people, as no Government had bothered to do for 40 years. The Government is proud of its action.</P>

      <P>There is a small fire burning behind the Taoiseach but I will put it out in a minute. Does the Taoiseach agree that fire tax carries the regime of local and parallel taxation, driven by his Government, to an extreme degree? Does he acknowledge that double taxation, taxation by stealth, has become an intolerable burden on working people under his leadership? Bin taxes are as much as &euro;350 in many local authority areas and are a potential &euro;520 per year in the extreme case of Sligo. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is considering bullyboy legislative tactics to force boycotting households to pay, but that will not work.</P>

      <P>Expenditure relating to the operation of the fire services is a matter for local authorities in the context of the determination of their annual budgets. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no function whatever in the matter. Under the Fire Services Act 1981, a fire authority is entitled to charge users or beneficiaries of a fire service for the services it provides. Each of the 33 fire authorities must decide whether to charge fees for fire services. I understand that many local authorities have charged such fees for many years. Information supplied by fire authorities indicates that most charge for attendance at fires and other emergencies, and such charges vary from authority to authority. Over the years, local authorities have endeavoured to use the charge as a deterrent, to encourage people to take safety measures to prevent chimney fires etc. &ndash; I do not refer to accidental fires. Fire authorities have been advised that while the decision to charge is a matter for them, the imposition of charges should not deter anyone from calling a brigade to a fire, no matter how small, or any other emergency. Charges should be kept under review in light of experience. The position I have outlined has been the case since the enactment of the 1981 Act.</P>

      <P>For the information of Deputy Higgins, the Government's level of capital grants to the fire services increased significantly in recent years. Expenditure on the fire services has been virtually doubled &ndash; over &euro;66 million has been provided. Over 130 new appliances were approved in the past five years, representing almost half of the front-line appliances fleet nationally. It is obvious that the fire service is improving. I reiterate that everybody, regardless of whether they have been paying the fire charge for 20 years, should contact the fire services in the case of an emergency. Local authorities were told to keep this aspect of the matter under review.</P>

      <P>A total of 146 freedom of information requests were processed in my Department in 2002. Of these, 48 were granted, 35 were part granted, nine were transferred to other Departments, 15 were withdrawn, nine were refused, no records were held in respect of 26 cases and four cases are ongoing. All requests received in my Department are processed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and its implementation in my Department is kept under constant review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>How do the numbers outlined by the Taoiseach compare with the previous year? The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste would like to double the period during which Cabinet papers are exempt from public scrutiny, but will this mean that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 will become less transparent? Will the public grow more sceptical about the way in which the Government does its business as a result? Is it not a fact that the public is entitled to this information? No objection was raised by Fianna Fáil when the Bill went through the House. If there is a curtailment or restriction of the present position, people will believe that the Taoiseach and the Government do not want the public to have access to information about decisions that were made and papers that were presented to the Government at the start of its term in office in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department dealt with 146 freedom of information requests in 2002, 279 in 2001, 187 in 2000, 207 in 1999 and 82 in 1998. In reply to Deputy Kenny's second question, it was agreed that a high level group would conduct a review of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Most of the changes it will recommend will be of a practical nature. A decision has yet to be made on the five year issue. I have outlined my own view on this. Deputy Mitchell asked me this question last year. Five years was the period put into the original Act but, in effect, this is almost the same as the 30 year rule because if all Cabinet and related papers are left out, the process is not being moved from five to ten, 15 or 20 years but from 30 years to five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it clear last year that I thought moving what was effectively available from 30 years to five was incorrect because five years is too short a time. However, this must be looked at in the context of all other matters with which the high level group is concerned. This is with the experience of how the Act has worked and those involved in the high level group have consulted those involved in the Act. That will improve the Act because there are some small issues to be dealt with. I have no problem with issues regarding diaries and expenses but Cabinet papers are <Col N="375" /> different. Perhaps 30 years is too long but five is far too short.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no objection from any member of the Fianna Fáil Party when this Bill went through the House originally. In fact, Deputy McDaid said the Bill drafted in its current form was a fig leaf and did not go far enough. If a change is brought about based either on the Taoiseach's personal wish or on a recommendation from the group, it will lead to public cynicism and scepticism about the workings of the Freedom of Information Act. If the Government is as transparent as it says and does not have difficulties with regard to diaries and cheques &ndash; blank or otherwise &ndash; there should not be anything to hide.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach happy with the workings of the Freedom of Information Act in terms of its integrity? I say this because Deputy Jim O'Keeffe sought under the Act information relevant to appointments made on prison visiting committees. He was subsequently surprised to receive a telephone call from a journalist working with an English tabloid about representations the Deputy had made during his party's period in Government. Such information could only have come through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or some element therein where the information lay. Is the Taoiseach happy that the Freedom of Information Act is being implemented with integrity and that there are no shenanigans or looseness in the way it is operated by the officers given that responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said many times, the Act is rigorous. It was agreed that there would be a review after five years and that ways of improving and streamlining it would be looked at. It is fairly rigorous in its application and there is no doubt about that. Those who exercise it are totally independent in their functions and provide for internal reviews and subsequent appeals to the Information Commissioner. No Minister has any role in this regard and all follow the Act.</P>
      <P>I thought at the time that the Act was primarily for members of the public to access information about themselves and that turns out to be about 30% of the business involved. I have no difficulty with that but I have some difficulty with the way the information is used. For example, when information is given out about Deputies who were on Council of Europe or committee business &ndash; which is arduous work although some people want to cynically say it is just travel &ndash; all the figures are added in and calculated as salary. That is an abuse of the information and I feel bad about it because although I am not a backbencher currently, I may be at some time in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information can be abused; that is one example but there are others. The information provided under this process should be used properly and not distorted. I have a major problem with that because it creates huge difficulties for <Col N="376" /> people. I do not condone anyone providing information other than in the proper way and if anybody is guilty of that, it is a serious breach. Information should be dealt with independently and not in any other way. However, by and large, we are now into this position.</P>
    <P>On the 30 year rule, for all kinds of reasons it would be wrong to change the timescale with regard to Cabinet papers to five years. Perhaps 30 years is too long with regard to the historical aspect but if full Cabinet papers are given out under this in the same way, it would create a lot of problems. It might be good fun for some people but I do not think it was ever intended by the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Taoiseach's reply that he will amend the legislation to prevent misrepresentation of the expenses of Members? It is about two weeks since it was reported that the legislation would be brought to Cabinet. Does it propose the excision to which Deputy Kenny referred with regard to Cabinet papers after five years? This Bill is accepted as a model in South Africa and around the world. Why is it considered necessary to make such a dramatic change to something that had the assent of all parties in the House at the time?</P>
      <P>The high level group is reported as recommending additional restrictions. Can the Taoiseach give the House an idea of what those additional restrictions are? Apparently, I have done the Taoiseach an injustice although I do not often do that. However, I did him an injustice by saying that he told me last week the Bill would be published. When I read the record, it did not quite say that. Would it not be an irony if a report on the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, on which Members are supposed to make decisions, is not made available to them? Will the report of the high level group be made available to Members in the normal way?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. It is still the position. I think we should wait. The high level group went through the Act and got the views of those who worked with it. Many of the issues are technical and involve situations where people think things could be done in a different way. It is not correct, as Deputy Rabbitte well knows, that Cabinet information is given out after five years in other countries; it may be up to 40 years in some countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, that is the same as the historical position on records. One could get any record if the period was reduced to five years. That is too short although I accept that 30 years is too long. I have little involvement with the 30 year papers but they are organised in my Department each <Col N="377" /> year. To do that for five year papers would be wrong and I will give an example with regard to that. Later today, I am dealing with Northern Ireland matters and the Good Friday Agreement which was negotiated five years ago. If the papers were available about the same issues being negotiated today, there would be major difficulties. It is not possible to reduce the period to five years when one is dealing with the same people, process and issues.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing that the period should be 30 years. The Act came in and I did not take issue with it at the time but five years is too short. On all other matters, no matter how inconvenient, such as how many telephone calls I made or what restaurant I went to, if I had lunch with somebody, or how much petrol my car uses-&mdash;</P>

      <P>Information on Northern Ireland should be covered, but it can be refused on good grounds if it is a sensitive matter.

If there are no intolerable problems why is it recommended that access to information should become more expensive and that the grounds for refusal be increased?

      <P>The case to which I referred could amount to a serious breach. Will the Taoiseach confirm that he will investigate the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ascertain if the argument made has validity?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider that matter. There is no distinction regarding the status of those making inquiries. Requests are dealt with by designated civil servants and they treat all cases separately. In my case, I receive a quarterly list of requests that have been dealt with. I am not involved and I believe the same procedures apply in other Departments. The organisation and management section of the Department of Finance circulated guidelines on this to Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for my visit to the United States has not yet been finalised. However, I expect to depart for Washington on Wednesday, 12 March. In the course of my visit, I expect to <Col N="380" /> address the World Bank as part of its lecture series. Arrangements for other possible meetings and engagements have not yet been finalised and will not be finalised until closer to the time.</P>
    <P>I intend to meet the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board in the course of my visit. My Department liaises with the board through our embassy in Washington, particularly in putting arrangements in place for meetings during my visits to the United States. I have not been in contact with President Bush's office in recent months. However, I hope to meet him in the course of my visit to Washington. I expect that our discussions will focus on the Northern Ireland peace process as well as a number of current international issues, including the war on terrorism.</P>
    <P>I met Ambassador Richard Haass on Tuesday, 4 February when we discussed matters mainly relating to Northern Ireland and the prospects for making progress over the coming weeks. I expressed my appreciation to Ambassador Haass for his continued involvement in the process and I also expressed my sympathy and the sympathy of the Government and the Irish people on the loss of the <i>Columbia </i>and the tragic deaths of the seven astronauts on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach and the Cabinet given consideration to the growing opposition among European members of NATO to a war on Iraq, which may or may not have United Nations approval? Has he considered the effect this may have on pressure for a stronger European Union security and foreign policy?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach arranged for a presentation to the Cabinet of the possible consequences for the economy if war breaks out in Iraq, with or without a United Nations mandate? Has the Cabinet given consideration to the possible effects in terms of external investment in the country and the difficulties that may arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have held a series of discussions on this issue. The Deputy will be aware that in 2001, worldwide foreign direct investment fell from $1.7 trillion to $700 billion. The drop last year was even greater and while we continue to get a proportionally higher share of this investment, the position at the start of this year has not improved.</P>
      <P>We have also undertaken an analysis of tourism. The experience of 12 years ago indicates that if war takes place, with or without United Nations agreement, it will impact on tourism. In view of this the resources for marketing would have to be looked at. Over the past few months we have provided for contingency arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs asked our embassies across the world to analyse the figures for the last quarter of last year. Practically all countries had very low or negative economic growth and most are predicting similar results for this quarter. Some countries have enormous difficulties. While this is not all related to talk of war <Col N="381" /> or conflict, it does not help because in times of uncertainty investors balk from taking action. That has a serious effect. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have redoubled their efforts and all aspects of the tourism sector have been busy since last September to ward off difficulties. However, the situation is a cause of major concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In four weeks the Taoiseach will present himself on the White House lawn with President Bush. He indicated he hopes to discuss with the President the war on terrorism, but he made no reference to the Iraqi crisis. Is the Taoiseach subscribing to the cynical propaganda, which is being massively and hysterically disseminated by the United States Government and media, that the Saddam Hussein dictatorship was somehow responsible for the atrocities on 11 September 2001 when the world knows that, vile as is his dictatorship, he and al-Qaeda are opposites from many points of view?</P>
      <P>What will be the Taoiseach's position in his discussions with President Bush on a range of options concerning the Iraqi crisis? If at the time of his visit, the United States is engaged in inflicting weapons of mass destruction on the unfortunate people of Iraq with or without United Nations sanction, what steps will he take to mark the huge opposition of the public to such a development?</P>
      <P>What will be the Taoiseach's position if the United States acts unilaterally? He says he supports collective action in the United Nations. If there is a unilateral attack will he boycott the White House or will he go there and tell President Bush that he is immediately withdrawing the facilities he is affording his war machine at Shannon Airport?</P>
      <P>In what other way would the Taoiseach bring the views of the majority of our people to bear in the United States Administration? Does he agree that the best thing to do would be to boycott his visit as a protest against the huge and almost unstoppable drive by the United States and Britain towards an attack on Iraq?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not engage in hypothesis or mere speculation about what might happen. The Deputy should not read into what I said about the war on terrorism that I would justify anything. Perhaps he should read into it that I had hoped that all these matters would be resolved peacefully, that Saddam Hussein would comply with what the inspectors ask of him and that everyone could go home and deal with more pressing issues affecting ordinary people, such as the creation of jobs and security. The Deputy should read no more into it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already answered Deputy Kenny. As things move on we will see what the inspectors have to say. We will see what happens on Friday and Monday and what the response is. Our position, which remains the same, is that we would like to see a peaceful resolution to this problem. <Col N="382" /> We worked hard to achieve this by way of Resolution 1441, as we did on many issues. Nobody worked harder on the Security Council in a two year period than we did to try assist the people of Iraq in respect of the sanctions. We made some progress, not as much as we would have liked, but our diplomats and Minister worked very hard. We will continue to do so. We will have to see how events take shape elsewhere. Our position is well known and I reiterated it when I met Ambassador Haass last week, as did the Minister, Deputy Cowen.</P>

      <P>It relates to the Taoiseach's visit to the President of the United States. This huff would want to be got out of the way before the visit. What does the Taoiseach mean when he says that he was not asked to sign the letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has hinted that he would not approve of every measure that could be considered war on terrorism. Where would he draw the line? Would he, for example, tell the President of the US that he is not prepared to back the use of nuclear weapons, for which the Pentagon has planned, not as retaliation for the use of chemical, biological or other weaponry but to penetrate a bunker? Would he tell the President that this is a bridge too far and that he cannot support the use of weapons of mass destruction in getting rid of mass destruction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach state if the Government is prepared to continue to pay for the overflight charges of US military aircraft for which the Irish <Col N="383" /> Aviation Authority charges? The bill for this is picked up by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Will that continue when the civilian reserve airforce of 47 passenger aeroplanes and 11 cargo aeroplanes hired by the military comes through Shannon as predicted? Will the Government say it is not participating in this aggression and, at the same time, help to fund it? What is the line of the Taoiseach on this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our line is to see what the Security Council will do by way of a second resolution. If there is no resolution we will have to consider the matter, and if there is one we will have to consider it. If there is a war without a resolution we will also have to consider that. We are committed and we follow Kofi Annan. If the Deputy wants to disagree with him, he may do so, but&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not misquote him. He has been very clear and believes that the acts of build-up and the threat of action have been important features in making progress that the Security Council has not been able to make for 12 years because the Iraqi regime has totally ignored all action. He said frequently that he will not consider a war situation until the matter is dealt with in a second resolution. Asking me what I will say on 13 and 14 March, given that there are so many changes from day to day, is irrelevant and we are only wasting the time of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach meets the US President, will he impress on him the importance of dialogue and negotiation in the resolution of conflicts, both in Ireland and globally, not least in the Gulf and the Middle East? Does the Taoiseach agree with the point I tried to make yesterday evening that it is entirely consistent to uphold an independent Irish foreign policy and, at the same time, advance the peace process here in Ireland with the positive involvement of the US Administration where appropriate?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Irish people's welcome for US involvement in our peace process does not entail, as some have tried to suggest, an unquestioning, passive acceptance of the foreign policy position presented by the Bush Administration, very specifically in relation to President Bush's preparations for war on Iraq? Will the Taoiseach impress effectively on President Bush the opposition of the vast majority of the Irish people? It is unquestionable that that majority has consistently demonstrated its opposition to President Bush's amassing of weapons and the modalities of war in the Gulf region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the Taoiseach's having been upset at not having been invited to partici<Col N="384" /> pate in the preparation of a letter and to append his signature to it. Has he read <i>The Irish Times</i> today and noted the letter from the former Consul General in New York and former Irish ambassador to Iraq, Gearóid Ó Clérigh? He states very clearly and unequivocally that Ireland should not participate in any action&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the author of the letter is the former Irish Consul General to New York and the former Irish ambassador to Iraq, it is absolutely relevant to the matter. Will the Taoiseach take on board the former ambassador's views in his preparation for contact with President Bush? The former ambassador to Iraq is speaking unquestionably for the overwhelming body of Irish public opinion in the comments he offers in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw that letter, which was signed. I always take account of people who give their names when they make comments in <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the Taoiseach should write a similar letter himself tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I might do that. We have consistently drawn attention to the risks involved in military action and we will comply with Deputy Ó Caoláin's request that we continue to do so. Last year when discussing the war on terrorism we spoke about the difficulties in the Middle East, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I had spoken at that stage to Yasser Arafat about the suffering of his people, which feeds into this. Once you embark on military action there is loss of life, material destruction and the danger of further destabilising in a volatile region with a deepening of the misunderstanding between the people of Islam and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>It is for those reasons the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has stated time and again that our efforts should be directed at supporting Resolution 1441. He has recorded the logic behind the resolution time and again, but I will do so once more since people keep missing the point. The Government wants to see the present differences between Iraq and the international community resolved peacefully through the United Nations. We want to avoid recourse to unilateral action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November when discussion of this matter began, the Irish representative at the UN worked hard to secure Resolution 1441. We included mechanisms intended to avoid war by seeking to maintain the central role of the Security Council <Col N="385" /> in deciding whether Iraq has met its obligations. The resolution provides that the Security Council will meet to consider the situation if the inspectors report non-compliance, decide what further steps are required to bring about Iraqi compliance and compel Iraq to meet its obligations by giving the authorities a final chance to comply with obligations to divest themselves of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Iraqi leadership has refused for more than a decade to meet UN demands, inflicting further wilful suffering on the people. It is obvious to all that one way or other the Iraqi leadership will no longer be able to evade its disarmament obligations. Saddam Hussein could end this confrontation tomorrow by simply ordering his regime to co-operate fully and proactively with UN inspectors.</P>
    <P>This has been the Irish Government position since the first week of November which is why we worked so hard on and supported Resolution 1441. The position is the same today. If Saddam Hussein complies with the inspectors now rather than in another 12 years and, as Deputy Cowen said last night, agrees to provide them with what they want, the current impasse could be resolved. I hope when the inspectors report on Friday they will have got somewhere and will be in a position to convince the Security Council that the situation is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There have been conflicting reports from the inspectors during the week and it is difficult to know whether sufficient progress has been made in the process. They have said they do not believe the need is for more inspectors, rather it is for greater co-operation from the Iraqi authorities. Iraq is five times larger than the island of Ireland and it is not easy to find the materials which means the real question is the willingness of Saddam Hussein to comply. It is useless to ask hypothetical questions when what is needed to make progress are answers to the practical questions that are being asked internationally. Friday might answer them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach raise with President Bush and his Administration the fatal flaws of the food for oil programme? The sanctions committee refuses to approve the use of certain medical equipment in Iraq on the basis that it might have a dual purpose. Items which are approved are sometimes useless without unapproved equipment. This is very serious for hospitals from a humanitarian perspective. While the response of the Department of Foreign Affairs would be that the Iraqi Government has never ordered medical equipment under the food for oil programme&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are 17 questions. The Deputy should refer specifically to the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of life and death and of the view the Iraqi people have of west<Col N="386" /> erners. It is a matter which the Taoiseach could very usefully raise with the United States Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these matters might be better discussed when the Taoiseach comes back from the USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has let other speakers in. I am never much out of line and I want to raise this and two other points. It is very clear that the Turkish and Syrian economies will collapse completely because they depend on open borders and the black market trade in oil. Is the Taoiseach aware of that? Will he take up the matter in America?</P>
      <P>Is there room for Irish-led, EU-sponsored medical and humanitarian teams to visit Iraqi hospitals to ensure that medicines and equipment are made available for children in particular who are dying at a rate of thousands per month? This would demonstrate to the Iraqi people that western communities and countries are interested in the preservation of human life. There are 8,000 primary schools in Iraq and nothing has been spent on them in 13 years. It is absolutely disgraceful. Given our traditions, the Taoiseach could very usefully promote an Irish-led, EU-sponsored humanitarian programme in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise the issues the Deputy mentioned. We have allocated assistance. Last year we channelled funds through the NGO Trócaire which targeted emergency nutrition at children and mothers. We also provided &euro;467,000 in bilateral humanitarian assistance in the previous period. During our short, two-year tenure on the Security Council we were very active in developing Resolution 1409 which was adopted in May last year. That resolution sought to target sanctions against the Iraqi regime while minimising their impact on the civilian population. We promised during our campaign to sit on the Security Council that we would take an interest in that and we did. The provisions of Resolution 1409 were intended to ensure the continued availability of medical supplies in the most vulnerable sectors of the Iraqi population, including mothers and children, to whom Deputy Kenny rightly points. Iraqi Government requests to purchase foods and medicines under the food for oil programme were given priority under the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny mentioned the difficulty with the goods review list. Requests are referred to the appropriate UN Security Council sanctions committee with the aim of ensuring that humanitarian goods and medicines are made available and that no materials are imported that could be used to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. Resolution 1409 was designed to address the conflicts in this area that had arisen in preceding years, but the most effective way of easing the humanitarian crisis faced by the Iraqi people and avoiding its escalation would be immediate compliance by the <Col N="387" /> Government there with its UN obligations. I am afraid there is no way of getting away from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that his spokesperson is quoted accurately in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning when he says that the Government fears it will have to make its attitude clear? It is ironic that the NATO countries of France, Germany and Belgium are taking a more assertive anti-war position than Ireland, a formal neutral country. Does the Taoiseach accept that it is time he got off the fence and supported the Franco-German stance? Is the Taoiseach influenced by the very strong anti-war position of the Vatican?</P>

      <P>I do not intend to argue with any of my colleagues on the European Council. The Government has stuck faithfully with the United Nations' Security Council, which is what we should do. We should not be taking different views. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, stated last night, one of our colleagues called this week for UN troops to go into Iraq with more inspectors. A few months ago, however, the same colleague was saying the last thing we should do is put UN troops in with the inspectors. Rather than changing with every passing month, we have stuck firmly to the one consistent line which I have put on the record here today. We played an active role in formulating UN Resolution 1441 and that has been acknowledged by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, the United States and others. Our position will remain consistent with that.</P>

    <P>Deputy Rabbitte has been trying to turn things around by saying that it was a spokesman. I do not know who gave that interview last night but, obviously, the effects of the drink were getting too much for them in some pub in the area. <Col N="388" /> However, it does not account for any of the things that were being said here at the same time by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. In my view, what he said in the debate yesterday should have made the headlines this morning, not what somebody said in a local hostelry under the influence of drink.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to draw attention to the archaic language which is used in the Bill and to substitute, as is the practice in many jurisdictions, modern language which would refer to the child as the child of the marriage of the adopters or indeed simply to refer to the parent or parents of the children. I raised this issue with the Minister and it is an important issue of principle that language should be changed to reflect current social circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>

Under that subsection a child who has been adopted in accordance with the Adoption Acts is treated for capital acquisitions tax purposes as if he or she was the natural child of the person or persons who adopted him or her. An adopted child is therefore entitled to the same tax-free threshold as a natural child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time we discussed this we rejected this amendment and I think I offered the Deputy some extra information on the situation which I hope she has received. The amendment relates to section 42 of the Bill. That section deals with benefits arising under section 98 of the Succession Act 1965. Under section 98, a benefit by will of a testator's child or grandchild is, unless there is a contrary provision in the will, preserved from lapse where the beneficiary predeceases the testator. If that beneficiary leaves children or grandchildren who are alive at the time of the testator's death, the benefit takes place as if the <Col N="394" /> beneficiary had died immediately after the testator and the property passes under the beneficiary's will to will or intestacy. The section prevents a double charge to tax in such cases. The person who ultimately takes the benefit is taxed as if he or she received the benefit from the testator.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the reference to the Wills Act 1837 from section 42(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill. Benefits taken under certain wills executed prior to the coming into effect of the Succession Act 1965 are still governed by the 1837 Act. Such benefits might come within the scope of the Consolidation Act. Accordingly, as there is a possibility that the provision of the 1837 Act might still apply in certain cases, the Attorney General's office has advised that the proposed amendment could constitute a change in the law which is not permissible in a Consolidation Bill. Accordingly, I am not accepting this amendment. I accept that in very rare and limited circumstances there is a case in point and the law has to cover such an eventuality. I can furnish the Deputy with details of that instance.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to section 88 of the Bill which deals with the exemption of certain transfers from capital acquisition tax following the dissolution of a marriage. Section 88 (2)(<i>e</i>) refers &ldquo;to an order or other determination to like effect, made on or after 10 February 2000, which is analogous to an order referred to in <Col N="395" /><i>paragraph</i><i>(a), (b), (c)</i> or <i>(d)</i>&rdquo; of that subsection, that is orders made under the Family Law Act 1995 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 of a court under the law of another territory made under or in consequence of the dissolution of a marriage which is recognised as valid in this country. The relevant date is referred to in the original legislation. If the date was deleted, orders made before that relevant date would come within the scope of the exemption. The Attorney General's office has advised that this would constitute a change in the law which is not permissible in a consolidation Bill. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael is happy to see this Bill passed which draws together pieces of the capital acquisitions tax code which have been scattered through various Finance Bills. We have some reservations. Recently the Revenue Commissioners indicated that they believed a root and branch review of this particular capital acquisitions tax code is necessary. It seems strange therefore that we are making such an effort to consolidate a piece of legislation which the Revenue Commissioners regard as in need of overhaul and reform. Notwithstanding that, this consolidation Bill will be of value to practitioners and is worthy of being passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on getting the Bill through. The Labour Party has a fundamental problem with the way the tax code operates at the moment. It is difficult for Members and other people to get detailed information on how taxes impact on particular classes of taxpayers, the sums of money involved, and the incomes, profits and capital assets involved. As well as moving to consolidate tax law here it is necessary to provide for transparency. It is only with clear indication of who pays what taxes and why that we will move to a situation where the general body of taxpayers, particularly PAYE taxpayers, will have confidence in the fair administration of the tax system.</P>

      <P>The Green Party also supports and welcomes the consolidation Bill. We accept the need for consolidation legislation to be put in place. We repeat our reservation that there is a need to go beyond housekeeping legislation in regard to the administration of the tax system. We need to introduce more imaginative Bills in terms of reforming the tax system and we look forward to debates on a wider scale on the issue. We would like to see the Government enter into debate about the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of capital acquisitions tax in the context of the tax system. As already mentioned, we have a <Col N="396" /> tax code that is deficient in measures of success. The next legislation on taxation will be an opportunity to address many of the inequities that continue to exist in our system.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Bill 2002. It removes much of the difficulty of wading through the raft of legislation that existed previously and simplifies the situation in regard to capital gains tax and people's understanding of its application. I hope the Minister of State will indicate in his concluding remarks that the Government will undertake a full and comprehensive review of the taxation system. That is essential.</P>
      <P>Consolidation Bills are only a minor step towards what is required in the area of taxation in this jurisdiction. On Second Stage I put two questions in regard to capital acquisitions which have not been substantively addressed. These regard the specific anomalies in sections 70 and 71 of this Bill. Section 70 states &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, a gift taken by a donee, who is at the date of the gift the spouse of the disponer,&rdquo;  and section 71 states &ldquo; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, an inheritance taken by a successor, who is at the date of the inheritance the spouse of the disponer,&rdquo;. In each case exemptions from tax are involved where the value is not taken into account in computing tax. Both of these point to the acute anomaly in this legislation which draws a differential between what is regarded as a &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; and the reality of cohabiting couples in our society. It is imperative that the necessary amending legislation is introduced to give equal recognition to the rights of cohabiting couples as is already the case applying to those regarded as spouses or those involved in formal marriage situations. That is essential.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's senior colleague in the Department of Finance has not responded to a question I put to him. Where does this legislation sit in regard to European law? There is no doubt that there is a major difficulty with this Consolidation Bill where it continues and maintains discriminatory practice in regard to spouses as against cohabiting couples. It is in conflict with European legislation.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State please refer to that point in his concluding remarks? I am hopeful that he will take on board the points raised by me and other colleagues and that he will signal the Government's early intent to come forward with the necessary amending legislation. I am sure the Minister of State will be an enthusiastic proponent of that.</P>

      <P>There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill to address some of the issues that were raised but cannot be addressed here, such as that raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin.

    <Title>National Tourism Development Authority Bill 2002  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to bring this Bill before the Dáil. The Bill was initiated in the Seanad where we had a useful debate. The Bill's sole purpose is to provide a statutory basis for a new national tourism development authority. When the authority is established, Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT will be dissolved and their functions transferred to the new body. The Bill also provides that certain provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts will be repealed to take account of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is concerned with the establishment of a major tourism development agency. I wish to make it clear at the outset that the Bill is a tightly focused one. It is not about setting new parameters for tourism policy. As the House will be aware, I have launched a comprehensive review of our national tourism policy. The review group, which I appointed to carry out this exercise, has begun its work. It had its inaugural meeting on 28 January last. The review will tackle some of the key issues facing Irish tourism.</P>
      <P>The group's main priorities will include an assessment of the performance and potential of the tourism sector and the identification of the key elements of a strategy, both industry-led and Government-led, for the continued development of tourism in Ireland. While I expect to get the group's final report by summer, I have asked the group to report to me, with initial views, by the end of April, if possible.</P>
      <P>We have embarked on a major review of tourism policy. With this Bill, we are setting up a major new tourism development agency. We have recently set in place a new structure for international tourism marketing. Why are we doing this? Tourism, which is one of our major economic sectors, has reached a critical point in its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish tourism has come a long way over the past 15 years. Tourism generates about &euro;4 billion in foreign earnings and about &euro;1.2 billion from domestic tourism. Recent economic studies suggest that it accounts for about 5% of annual GNP. Tourism supports about one in every 12 jobs in the economy. Over the past two years, Irish tourism has had to face a number of serious chal<Col N="398" /> lenges. In 2001, its pattern of unbroken growth was disrupted. Last year, 2002, was a very challenging year but the projected outcome, with a return to modest growth, is encouraging. We certainly did not experience the doomsday scenario predicted by many commentators.</P>
    <P>As for 2003, it is very early to make predictions particularly given the late booking pattern, which has been an increasing trend in recent years, and the uncertain situation in the Gulf. Nevertheless, I understand that advance bookings are good, with a healthy trend in the US fuelled by Tourism Ireland's kick-start campaign last December. This situation could change significantly were there to be an outbreak of hostilities.</P>
    <P>The crises which we have faced over the past two years have accelerated certain changes which were already happening in the marketplace. They have also thrown into sharper focus some important issues around quality and value for money. The challenges now facing the industry, together with significant institutional changes arising from the Good Friday Agreement, are driving reform of the institutional architecture which the State uses to support tourism development. The Bill before the House is a vital part of that reform package.</P>
    <P>Before we have a general look at the contents of the Bill, it might be useful to look at the current national State agencies which are dedicated to supporting tourism. The three agencies are; Tourism Ireland Limited, Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland Limited is a publicly-owned, limited company established jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, commonly known as NITB. It was incorporated in December 2000. Its board is drawn mainly from its founding agencies, Bord Fáilte and NITB, and the tourism industry North and South. Its purpose is to market the island of Ireland as a tourism destination.</P>
    <P>Tourism was identified as an area of co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement. Tourism Ireland Limited was established as an expression of that co-operation. It has now completed its first 12 months with full operational responsibility for the international marketing of the island of Ireland. In the North, Tourism Ireland falls under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, while here it falls under the aegis of my Department, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland has taken over a number of the functions previously carried out by Bord Fáilte. It is responsible for the international marketing function. That includes responsibility for the ownership and management of tourism brand Ireland, strategic all-island destination marketing in all markets outside the island of Ireland and responsibility for the entire overseas office network. Tourism Ireland also delivers product-regional marketing programmes on behalf of Bord Fáilte and NITB in international markets. Bord Fáilte and NITB retain responsibility in <Col N="399" /> relation to tourism product development. Tourism Ireland's head office is in Dublin. It has a regional office in Coleraine and it has offices in our major overseas markets, Britain, France, Germany and the USA with an overall staff complement of about 150 people.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland has established a number of tourism marketing partnerships in the Republic, the North and key markets. These partnerships, which include representatives of the tourism industry, are a valuable mechanism through which the tourism industry itself can directly influence and give feedback on Tourism Ireland's strategies and marketing plans. Tourism Ireland took over operational responsibility for the international marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourism destination less than three months after September 11. It has been a baptism of fire but the projected outturn for 2002 shows that it has done a good job in helping to maintain a high level of business and, indeed, some modest growth in the face of very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>For Irish people, Bord Fáilte Éireann has, of course, been synonymous with tourism. It has for decades been the State's primary tourism agency. It has 130 employees and its head office is in Dublin. Following the establishment of Tourism Ireland Limited, Bord Fáilte will retain responsibility for product development; marketing of domestic tourism on the island of Ireland; research and strategic planning; niche-specialist product marketing and promotions; regional marketing; implementation of specific initiatives such as the sports tourism initiative; statutory functions for the registration-grading of certain tourist accommodation; co-ordination of activities of the regional tourism authorities; and tourism and the environment.</P>
    <P>These functions mainly relate to providing a range of supports to the tourism industry, including those concerned with building business capability, improving the quality of product which the industry offers and enhancing its competitiveness.</P>
    <P>In 1994, there was a major review of the operations of Bord Fáilte. The outcome of that review was a decision that the primary focus of Bord Fáilte should be on international marketing. Bord Fáilte was re-focused accordingly. The result was a greater efficacy in our international tourism marketing which has paid handsome dividends.</P>
    <P>The 1994 review recommended that matters extraneous to the international marketing function were to receive less attention. However, one consequence of that re-focusing of Bord Fáilte's operations was that a decreasing portion of its staff and resources have been devoted to other areas like, for example, product development and the environment. We need to reverse that trend. We need to focus, once again, on some of those areas in order to help preserve unique elements of the Irish tourism experience. We have shown that we can get the people here but we also need to look again at what happens when they get here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" />Because Bord Fáilte has been the premier tourism agency over the past 50 years, the major element of the Tourist Traffic Acts is concerned, in one way or another, with its functions or those of its predecessors. The Acts do not mention the other main agencies, Tourism Ireland and CERT.</P>
    <P>C.E.R.T. Limited is the State's national tourism training agency. It was established, as a company limited by guarantee in 1963. CERT's head office is in Dublin, it has some 90 employees and has a number of training centres around the country. At present, CERT provides education, recruitment and training services for the tourism industry. As the industry has evolved, CERT has moved in the direction of a wider business development role. It helps to build industry capability by focusing on human resource management and improving cost competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Rapid economic growth and record growth in tourism has created pressure on labour supply for the tourism industry. This has been a major focus for CERT. The focus has been on attracting and retaining school leavers, on adults returning to work and on skills development for workers. These services are delivered through development, provision and design of a range of education and training programmes to meet industry needs.</P>
    <P>As far as industry competitiveness is concerned, the focus has been on enhancing productivity and performance, benchmarked against best international practice. The competitiveness of our tourism product has been the object of much discussion of late. The focus on competitiveness has been heightened by the price transparency associated with the euro. It is important, however, to remember that competitiveness is not just about price. It is about value. We are not a cheap destination but we need to ensure that we deliver value.</P>
    <P>Any enterprise that is experiencing rising costs and pressure on margins has to take a fresh, hard look at how it is doing its business. It has to see how it can make better and more efficient use of its staff and resources. Business consultants tell us that, in areas like labour, energy and purchasing there can be significant scope for greater efficiencies. CERT has developed a range of experience and programmes to help businesses in this regard and I hope the new authority will work even more closely with businesses to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>In addition to the national tourism agencies, we have also a regional tourism structure. Our six regional tourism authorities continue to operate under the aegis of Bord Fáilte while Shannon Development, which is responsible for tourism in the mid-west, is an independent State agency. Once we have bedded down the National Tourism Development Authority, we will then look at the regional issues. The Bill before the House confines itself to national structures.</P>
    <P>Fundamental changes have occurred in the nature of the tourism industry both globally and in Ireland over the past decade and more. In the <Col N="401" /> context of these changes there has, for example, been a growing realisation by the Irish tourism industry that there are other issues which are more important for the industry's future than just visitor numbers.</P>
    <P>Yield, regional and seasonal distribution and access are key issues on one side of the equation. On the other side of the equation, we have the quality, range and competitiveness of the facilities and products that the tourism industry in Ireland offers to its ever more discerning customers. Since assuming responsibility for this portfolio, I have spoken of the need for the industry to maintain its competitive edge. If it does not do so, it will fail to reap the due reward for the massive investment of public and private funds in the sector over the past 12 years, an investment that some economists put at more than &euro;4 billion.</P>
    <P>Another ingredient, key to the successful development of tourism, is the quality and levels of service that the industry has to offer. It makes little sense to invest millions of euros in building facilities, unless the necessary steps are taken to ensure that the quality and level of service is in accordance with what the customer wants and consistent with what that customer has been led to expect.</P>
    <P>If we build high standard physical facilities, we must also deliver appropriately high quality services. If the operational standards do not match the physical quality of facilities, then the market potential of these facilities may not be realised. The future success of Irish tourism is dependent on the industry developing and maintaining quality product and quality service which provides good value for money, supported by effective, consumer-led, marketing programmes and the enhancement of its overall business capability.</P>
    <P>About 15 months ago, the Government decided there was a compelling case for streamlining and integrating the delivery, at national level, of the State's activities in supporting and promoting product marketing and development, human resource development and training in the tourism industry. To that end, it approved the creation of a new authority which would take over the range of functions exercised by CERT and those remaining with Bord Fáilte. The authority will have a clear mandate to take whatever actions are appropriate to help industry in its efforts to enhance the quality of its products and services and to do so in a manner designed to help it hold and increase its market share in well defined market areas.</P>
    <P>It will be essential that the closest possible links, teamwork and working arrangements are put in place and maintained between the new tourism development agency and Tourism Ireland Limited. Tourism Ireland will focus on getting people here. A major focus of the new authority will be on the experience of visitors when they get here. If we are to ensure that our tourism product evolves in line with international consumer demand, there will have to be an effective partnership between the two organisations. <Col N="402" /> There is already a close working relationship between Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited. Exchequer funds flow to Tourism Ireland via Bord Fáilte. These relationships will be maintained and strengthened in the context of establishing the new authority.</P>
    <P>The intention behind this Bill is to put in place a strong and well resourced body with a clear mandate to address some of the key issues facing the tourism industry. It is important, at this juncture, to have a tourism development agency that can work with operators in the tourism sector and offer them a better range of streamlined programmes and services to support their future development. We are creating a new organisation out of two existing organisations which have given good service and developed good skills over the years. While the authority will build on existing skills, I hope it will do more than that. We need a new dynamic in tourism development. We need a vision and a new structure to deliver on that.</P>
    <P>We will not wait until this Bill is passed to start work. Much work has already been done to lay the groundwork for the new organisation. That work will result in the body being able to hit the ground running and to develop rapidly into a highly effective, highly regarded body for the development of tourism here.</P>
    <P>There has been strong support for the principle of integration of CERT and Bord Fáilte. The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the staff trade unions have also given their support. Building on this support, I established an interim board on 4 July of last year, which is charged with the task of ensuring that the new authority can be up and running in time for the 2003 tourism season. It has an independent chairman and includes the chairpersons and some existing members of the board of Bord Fáilte and the council of CERT as well as a representative from my Department. I take this opportunity to thank the interim board for its work to date.</P>
    <P>I will now give a brief summary of some of the main provisions of the Bill. The Bill contains three Parts. Part 1 contains a series of standard provisions regarding title, interpretation, expenses and the laying of orders made by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas. Provision is also made for the repeal of some provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts which relate to the corporate governance of Bord Fáilte. This is necessary because the governance provisions of the Bill will obviously replace the old provisions relating to Bord Fáilte. For clarity, CERT, which is a limited company established at Bord Fáilte's initiative, is not a statutory body. There are, therefore, no provisions in the Tourist Traffic Acts which pertain to the corporate governance of CERT.</P>
    <P>Part 2 constitutes the bulk of the Bill and contains those provisions necessary for the authority to come into existence and to carry out the functions ascribed to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" />Section 6 allows me to set, by order, a day for the establishment of the authority. On that date, the authority will come into being and Bord Fáilte and CERT will cease to exist. Their functions will automatically transfer to the authority. While the official name of the authority is the National Tourism Development Authority, section 7 allows the authority to describe itself as Fáilte Ireland for operational purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the authority's functions. The over-arching function of the authority will be to encourage, promote and support the development of tourist traffic within and to the State and the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services within the State. Within that overall context, the authority will seek to develop the recruitment, training and education and development of persons to be employed in the tourism sector. The authority will engage in research and planning. It may engage in advertising or publicity, or provide advice, consultancy services, training or support, including financial support. The authority will continue to exercise the powers currently exercised by Bord Fáilte relating to the registration and grading of certain types of tourist accommodation. These powers are spelled out in various provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts which will remain in place.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that the Tourist Traffic Acts do not prescribe the particular criteria with which a premises has to comply in order to be registered. The Acts merely set out the functions and powers in relation to registration, grading and listing of accommodation. The actual criteria are set out in regulations made from time to time by Bord Fáilte, with ministerial consent. That process has worked satisfactorily in the past and I propose that it continue under the new authority.</P>
    <P>I also propose to arrange with the Attorney General for the restatement of the remaining provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts under the mechanisms provided by the Statute Law (Restatement) Act. That will create a single source of coherent and easily accessible legislation relating to the registration and grading functions transferring to the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is standard and allows me to confer additional functions on the authority. Section 10 gives the authority power to set up companies and to acquire interests in companies. Section 11 allows the authority, either at my direction or with my consent, to delegate certain of its functions and describes the types of bodies to which functions can be delegated. One body, which is specifically mentioned in that context, is Tourism Ireland Limited to which I have referred. This is the first recognition of Tourism Ireland Limited in the Tourist Traffic Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that the authority may contract out certain of its registration, grading and inspection functions under the Tourist Traffic Acts and Schedule 2 lists the relevant provisions. This will allow for the continuation of the current <Col N="404" /> practice whereby Bord Fáilte contracts out some of its inspection and grading functions to private contractors. Section 13 requires the authority to comply with policy directions. It is a standard provision and is found in legislation governing several agencies.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 to 22 are standard provisions governing membership and meetings of the authority and conflicts of interest and disclosure of information by members or staff of the authority. The authority will consist of a chairman and 12 members. Section 23 allows the authority to establish committees. These will be useful in helping it to better perform its functions.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is a standard provision which puts a cap on the aggregate level of advances which the authority, from moneys provided by the Oireachtas, can make for the purpose of supporting enterprises and projects relating to the development of tourist traffic and the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services. The cap is set at &euro;65 million.</P>
    <P>Section 25 allows the authority to provide financial aid in relation to the carrying out of its functions and to administer EU schemes. Throughout the 1990s, the administration of EU tourism development schemes was a major component of the work of both Bord Fáilte and CERT. Even though their significance has diminished in the current round of Structural Funds, Bord Fáilte is still involved with administering such schemes. It is important, therefore, that we ensure that the authority is empowered to undertake such work. The section gives the generic power to grant financial aid. Detailed criteria governing qualification for such aid will be laid down, as is current practice, in the conditions of various schemes and initiatives.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 contain standard provisions in relation to the submission and auditing of audited accounts and annual reports. Section 29 provides for the application of the Freedom of Information Act to the authority. Section 30 is a standard provision allowing the authority to accept gifts on conditions consistent with its functions. Sections 31 to 33 deal with the position of chief executive.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for the appointment of a chief executive. Under this section, I am empowered to designate a person as first chief executive of the authority upon its establishment. Following the outcome of an open competition, held under the aegis of the interim board of the authority, I recently announced my intention of appointing Mr. Shaun Quinn as the chief executive of the new organisation once it is formally established.</P>
    <P>Section 32 deals with the accountability of the chief executive to the Committee of Public Accounts and reflects the rules governing that committee. Section 34 is a standard provision for the appointment and remuneration of staff.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides for the transfer of the existing staff of Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT to the new authority. Staff will automatically transfer, on the establishment day, on terms and con<Col N="405" /> ditions no less favourable than those to which they were subject immediately beforehand. Any merger will give rise to an understandable anxiety on the part of the staff affected. This provision is a powerful guarantee which delivers a very high level of security to those involved and reflects a promise which I made to union representatives when I met them late last year.</P>
    <P>Section 36 is a standard provision governing superannuation. It protects the rights of existing staff and pensioners of both organisations.</P>
    <P>Part 3 contains standard transitional provisions concerning a range of items, including the dissolution of Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT, the vesting of property and the automatic transfer of the rights and liabilities of the two organisations to the authority.</P>
    <P>Schedules 1 and 2 list provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts 1939 to 1998 that have been repealed, or may be contracted out, as a consequence of the provisions included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill, when enacted, will be to allow us to establish a new National Tourism Development Authority. Wider issues of tourism policy will be considered in the context of the review, which is now under way, and I expect there will be opportunities for members of the Oireachtas to input to that review, if they so wish, and to debate the outcome of the review in due course. The outcome will, of course, shape the policy environment for the authority.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</P>

It will give a certain cohesion to an area that is critical for the future of the tourism industry in Ireland and the merger of Bord Fáilte and CERT will prove very effective. However, I have some reservations. There are employees of both agencies who are concerned about the provisions of the Bill. I shall outline these later. It is right to recognise the work of Bord Fáilte and CERT.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has served this country well. Since its establishment in 1955, it has become synonymous with Ireland and Irish tourism. It is really the brand name for Irish tourism. In America in particular it was a major marketing advantage. It is right to recognise the commitment and dedication of those who worked with Bord Fáilte at various levels over the years, from chief executive to the office workers. They worked in co-operation with the operators of business and together they have created the industry and brought it to its present levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined a number of statistics which I will repeat. The industry now employs about 140,000 people directly, 8% of the total workforce of this country and more than the figure employed in agriculture. Its net foreign earning exchange value is now in excess of &euro;3 billion per year and it generates over 47 cent in taxes for every euro of foreign tourism spent in the coun<Col N="406" /> try. These are just some of the many statistics used to demonstrate the contribution tourism is making to our economy. The tourism industry is largely made up of indigenous enterprises and is deeply rooted in the fabric of Irish economic life, both urban and rural. With the passing of this Bill and Bord Fáilte, its remarkable contribution must be recognised.</P>
    <P>CERT was formed by Bord Fáilte in 1963 and it has made a major contribution to training the foot soldiers who have made such a contribution to the tourism industry. They are the people at the coalface who meet the customers. The chefs, the people serving behind bars, receptionists and the people working in tourism offices are the unsung heroes of our tourism industry. At times they do not get recognition. For a long time they worked for very low wages because prior to the introduction of the minimum wage, the tourism industry was one which could not, in many instances, afford to pay high wages. These people worked in a dedicated fashion to promote the industry, and hotels, bars and restaurants throughout the country became identifiable and made their names through some of these people, whether porters, bar people, receptionists or chefs. Many hotels, restaurants and other tourism enterprises built their reputations on these people. Many of these people were trained by CERT and it is important to recognise that today.</P>
    <P>The area of training and education is critical for the future. Some people, however, are concerned that with the merger of CERT and Bord Fáilte, the area of training and education will, in some way, be denigrated, although that may be an extreme word to use. There is a concern that this important aspect of our tourism industry may not be given sufficient emphasis because the focus has been taken off it. Will the Minister respond to that concern in his reply? I was in New York recently and met a chef from England. Apparently, the UK Government is sending its chefs to America to learn about recent advances in cuisine there. I understand that the Americans sent their chefs to France in the past. Such training is not something we should take for granted. To some extent, I share the concern that the emphasis may be taken off training and education in this new merger.</P>
    <P>CERT had a close bond with schools. When I taught in Tarbert comprehensive school in the early 1980s, CERT was in constant contact with the career guidance teacher. The organisation built up a good partnership with the teacher but this may not be a great mix for schools. Will the Minister respond to that?</P>
    <P>I understand there are some unresolved industrial relations problems in CERT. Some agreements entered into, or promised, have not been delivered. It is only right that whatever problems exist are resolved before the merger. It is important that members of both organisations coming together to face what will be a great challenge do so in a harmonious fashion and without any baggage. I am not aware of any concerns in <Col N="407" /> Bord Fáilte but I am aware of some unresolved industrial relations issues in CERT which need to be resolved. Will the Minister respond to that in his reply?</P>
    <P>The new body will face major challenges. Does it have enough power and is it sufficiently representative &ndash; I suppose that depends on the board the Minister picks &ndash; to meet the challenges we face? Tourism crosses so many Departments and agencies of State and is not confined to one agency. For example, the Department of the Environment and Local Government plays a critical role in tourism. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform also plays a role &ndash; for example, in the area of licensing laws &ndash; as does the Department of Finance. As well as a National Tourism Development Authority, we also need some kind of interdepartmental group comprising civil servants from each of the Departments. There is a need to co-ordinate the various responses which will be critical to the future of the industry. In that context, I will probably table an amendment on Committee Stage proposing such a structure. The Minister's officials might consider that.</P>
    <P>The good thing about such a debate is that it affords us an opportunity to talk about the tourism industry generally. I wish to address some of the concerns in the tourism sector. The first issue relates to competitiveness. When the ITIC report was published in September, the Minister more or less accused the industry of being the reason for the loss of competitiveness, or at least that is how he was reported in the media. In some cases that may be the case but, generally speaking, we have lost our competitiveness as a result of Government actions or, in some cases, maybe inaction. The increase in VAT on most tourism products from 12.5% to 13.5% in recent budget will not be a help. I picked up the Irish Hotels Federation's publication, <i>Insight,</i> and the headline reads, &ldquo;Budget measures will damage tourism&rdquo;. It refers to the increase in VAT and to capital allowances write-offs for hotels from seven years to 25 years and states that will virtually end the development of new hotels in Ireland and will be a major disincentive for existing hotels to upgrade their properties. Whether it is true or not, I understand a new hotel, the Four Seasons, is being built in Milan by Irish investors. From what I hear &ndash; I cannot confirm this &ndash; Irish investors in hotels are looking outside the country. That provision led to the building of new hotels and the refurbishment of others. Both could suffer as a result of that provision.</P>
    <P>Our VAT rate on tourism products is the second highest in the Euro zone, with just Germany higher at 16%. I said in the Dáil previously that our VAT rate is almost double that of our main competitors, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy. The rate in France is approximately 5.5% and in Spain and Portugal it is 7%, which puts Irish products at an immediate disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" />The biggest problem currently facing many enterprises is the cost of insurance. Insurance on tourism enterprises from hotels to bars, restaurants and activity centres, is five to six times the European average. There has been a hike in the past year of between 40% and 200%, and many people are only now becoming re-insured. This will put huge pressure on operators. The only way they will survive is to cut back considerably on staff, which will affect the quality of their product and service, or charge more. Some try to balance between different measures. These people will not be able to survive and make a living for themselves and their families if they continue discount charging. Apart from the increase in VAT, the cost of insurance is currently a huge issue.</P>
    <P>Electricity costs have increased in the past year by approximately 14% and I understand there will be a further increase of 8% this year. This year local authorities increased substantially waste disposal costs. They increased rates by 5% and water charges will also increase. All these impositions affect the competitiveness of the tourism industry. The level of charges on the industry are considerably more than in competing countries. Since 1996 the consumer price index has increased in the region of 22% while in other EU countries it has increased by just 11%. Apart from Greece, our inflation rate is the highest in the whole of the EU.</P>
    <P>I listened recently to someone who is very involved in the tourism industry whom the Minister knows well, Mr. McCarthy of FEXCO. He made the point that Kerry Group, Spectra and FEXCO have created jobs in Kerry, and produced new products in rural areas over the years, but they have not got the services, particularly proper roads. The same could be said of tourism. I will refer shortly to the national spatial strategy. Currently there are some of the worst roads in some of our prime tourism areas. Investment in roads has not followed on from investment in tourism products by private operators. People who have made huge investments have not been rewarded with better roads. The N69 in Kerry, which takes all the traffic off the ferry through North Kerry en route to south and west Kerry, and into Clare, Galway and up the west coast, received approximately &euro;200,000 investment last year. It is one of the worst national secondary roads in the country. People who travel this prime tourist route, which serves the ferry at Tarbert which carries 250,000 cars every summer, are amazed and disgusted. While this is not an issue for the new authority, the state of our roads has a major effect on tourism. This is why some type of inter-agency group should be set up to look at the multiplicity of problems facing the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Another issue that has come up repeatedly is signposting. I have received correspondence about it and the issue has been highlighted in the national media. I welcome the announcement last week that money will be allocated for signposting <Col N="409" /> in three counties, including Kerry. Tourists usually like to travel to scenic areas throughout the west of Ireland, most of which are in remote areas. Very often, however, they cannot reach these areas or, if they do, they get lost. At night time, in particular, people cannot read many of the road signs, which are covered by bushes and are not maintained; some even point in the wrong direction. The signposting on which tourism depends so much, is inadequate. While a start has been made to deal with this, it must be accelerated.</P>
    <P>On the issue of street violence and the licensing laws, which have a major effect on tourism, I saw a number of reports in newspapers, including comments by people who have come to Ireland, that they are very concerned about the level of street violence throughout the country. This will damage the image of Ireland abroad. When the Minister liberalised the licensing laws, there was a great deal of pressure on him, and Members on different sides of the House supported him. However, these laws are not working out. People are horrified at the incidents taking place on the streets and in some of our main tourist towns. We are all aware that it is very dangerous to walk through O'Connell Street or Temple Bar at night. Some of our major tourism centres are becoming very dangerous places to visit, particularly when people spill out of the bars and on to the streets at night. I hope there will be a total review of the licensing laws and that they will revert to where they were previously. The case was made at the time that liberalising the licensing laws would facilitate tourists coming here given that one could drink all night in other countries. Our tourism product should not be about drinking. We must consider seriously the licensing laws because the change in pub closing hours has led to an increase in street violence and other forms of violence. It sends out the wrong message to markets we are trying to capture.</P>
    <P>It is very important to highlight the whole issue of access. Shannon Airport could currently take in the region of 2.5 million extra passengers. It has been proven that 50% of passengers who disembark at Shannon Airport end up in County Kerry, compared to 22% of those who disembark at Dublin Airport. It stands to reason that Kerry will benefit if more people arrive in Shannon.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement made by US Airways before Christmas that it will serve Shannon from May. Similarly, the south-west will benefit from the fact that Aer Lingus intends to restore the Baltimore route that it dropped last year. The numbers seem to be approaching their levels before Aer Lingus abandoned some of its routes. Having said that, Shannon Airport's capacity could cope with many more arrivals. The new operator that is trying to resume some of the services once operated by Aeroflot should be given every encouragement and support. Shannon Airport needs investment and focus and must receive the same support as Dublin Airport. I believe <Col N="410" /> that the Minister for Transport will shortly announce the establishment of an independent board to promote Shannon Airport and I would welcome such a move. It is important that Aer Rianta is involved in such a board, as a board without Aer Rianta would be ineffective and might weaken Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>Those of us from County Kerry are fortunate that Kerry Airport has the third longest runway in the country, but unfortunately it is under-utilised. The length of the runway should provide County Kerry with advantages in the future. Deputy O'Donoghue, as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, should encourage more operators to use the airport and should ensure that more people flow through it. Given that Kerry is so far from Dublin, it is important that we use the advantage we have at Farranfore and encourage more people to come to the county.</P>
    <P>The House discussed the issue of the international conference centre some time ago, when the Minister did not seem to have much of an opinion on it. I recently read in a newspaper that it has become a priority of the Minister, however, and I am glad he is taking an interest in it. Business worth about &euro;50 million is lost every year due to the lack of a conference centre with capacity for between 2,000 and 5,000 people. Great sums of money are being lost all the time because we do not have a suitable facility in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This matter was a major issue when I was Fine Gael's tourism spokesman in the early 1990s. EU money had been allocated and a decision had almost been made, but the project did not proceed. It is time to make a final decision to build a conference centre, perhaps funded by a private public partnership or the National Development Finance Agency. It does not matter whether it is located in Spencer Dock or elsewhere as long as a decision to proceed is taken soon. The conference centre will be a critical part of our tourism infrastructure. Perhaps a case can be made for building a few regional conference centres as well. The National Events Centre in Killarney is often used as a conference centre and could be designated as a regional centre.</P>
    <P>The launch of the national spatial strategy before Christmas was a major event. The strategy contained a number of recommendations in relation to the tourism industry. One of the great things about the industry is that tourism enterprises, such as hotels, cannot be relocated somewhere else. Investment in tourism has permanent benefits for the locality. More so than other industries, tourism can be an important vehicle for developing rural areas, eliminating the disparities between regions and distributing wealth throughout the country. This potential was emphasised in the spatial strategy and I hope the National Tourism Development Authority will be mindful of it. It is natural that the first place to be examined by a new agency will be right outside its doors, but it can lead to problems as most State agencies are located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" />Farming and other indigenous industries have declined, meaning that tourism is increasingly critical for all parts of the country. It is the only hope for many areas. It is important that the NTDA will have a broad focus and that its decisions will take cognisance of the objectives outlined in the national spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>The proposal to develop new tourism centres in areas that do not receive many tourists, comparatively speaking, is a good one. Areas with the potential to develop a critical mass of visitor numbers with a strong overseas component are to be developed, with a focus on new visitor attractions. North Kerry is a good example of a place that could benefit if it were designated as a tourism centre. People think tourism is widespread in County Kerry, but that is not the case as the north of the county is not getting the spin-off that it could get if a greater effort was made. The Minister is aware that a proposal has been made to Bord Fáilte for a cluster development, which would comply with the tourism policy we should be pursuing. I will have an opportunity to refer to various sections of the Bill on Committee Stage and I intend to make certain points then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the National Tourism Development Authority Bill 2002 on behalf of the Labour Party and I thank the Minister for bringing it forward. I am glad the Minister intends to bring the Bill through the House speedily as it has been discussed in the Seanad. It is essential that the Bill is passed by the House as quickly as possible in the interests of tourism development. The interim committee that has been set up is actively pursuing some of the Bill's aims. Members should facilitate the passing of this Bill in light of tourism's importance and the potential employment in the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers have said, Bord Fáilte and CERT deserve to be congratulated for their work over many years. Bord Fáilte did an amazing amount of work to promote tourism in Ireland. CERT has had a major influence with regard to the training of personnel in the tourism industry. In any country, one might run into a person who had received basic training skills from CERT and was proud of that and of the fact that they could represent themselves and Ireland so well abroad and at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new board will have important new functions as set out in section 8, particularly with regard to advertising and publicity. This is a factor that must be developed by the new authority and it is very important in the context of domestic tourism. It has been neglected over the years but will now be addressed by the new committee. The establishment of tourist offices and the publication of lists of registered and unregistered premises involved in the industry is important in advancing tourism to its rightful place as a major component of the national interest and potential development. My main concern in that regard relates to the capping of <Col N="412" /> funding at &euro;65 million. That may not be enough and the Minister should state in his reply how that funding is to be divided and how the Government came up with a figure of &euro;65 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of the tourism industry, major difficulties were created by foot and mouth disease and the events of 11 September. There was also a sense of civic duty and patriotism from Irish people at that time when many changed their plans and decided to holiday in Ireland. That was appreciated by the Government, tourism organisations, hotel owners and others involved. I hope that will be encouraged by the new board through advertising and publicity and that there will be a new drive in this regard.</P>
    <P>There was a debate on agriculture in the House last week. The new board will link with agriculture to develop the agri-tourism business, something of vital importance to ensuring an alternative for members of the agricultural community across the country. I often wonder why we have not developed or publicised our waterways despite the rivers, canals and lakes being potential goldmines for tourism. In England and on the continent, canals and waterways are developed to their full potential whereas we have not done that. I hope the Minister in drawing up the new Bill will realise that this must be addressed and that there should be major initiatives with regard to waterways and the agri-tourism business as part of the overall package and as part of the work of the new board.</P>
    <P>The board will not mean the end of problems for the tourism industry and those involved with the industry know that. There are many problems in the industry and the Minister in recent months has highlighted, as has Deputy Deenihan, the question of its price competitiveness. At a time when there are low price air fares to all parts of the world, it is a major problem to hold people here and to attract people from other countries. As a result of new technology, it is possible to compare prices across the world and, if Ireland is to be high on the list with regard to tourist numbers, competitiveness will be one of the major components required. The Government and those involved in the industry will have to address this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The October report of the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation on the high price levels in Ireland has met with no response from the Government. In a sense, this valuable report contained what many people suspected about Irish tourism which is that the cost of goods and services for tourists has become increasingly expensive in recent years. The introduction of the euro has made it easier for continental tourists to compare prices immediately with those in most EU member states and that may detract from Ireland's attractiveness to tourists from other countries unless competitiveness improves.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note the ranking of Ireland in the EUROSTAT table of most expensive countries in recent years. In 1995, Ireland was <Col N="413" /> the eighth most expensive country in Europe but by 1999 that had jumped to fourth place, and it has remained in the top three or four since that. EUROSTAT has identified a particular concentration of high prices with regard to pubs and restaurants, recreation and culture, and alcohol and tobacco. When one considers that, in 2001, 54% of tourists' expenditure went on accommodation, food and drink, and sightseeing and entertainment, these statistics are amplified. With inflation now running at 5%, the ability to control prices becomes more difficult but should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that high prices in the Irish tourism industry only became an issue since the industry began to experience difficulties in recent years. This is proof that the industry has been taken for granted too often. There is a common assumption that, with agriculture, tourism has a strong base and will continue to supply the Exchequer with a stable and reliable income in the future as it has for many years. It is taken for granted that Ireland is an assured destination for foreign tourists regardless of the cost of getting to or staying here, and despite trends in the international tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Sadly, it has taken the setbacks of recent years to challenge these assumptions. We must look at our attractiveness with regard to tourism and the setting up of this authority will help deal with those responsibilities. The authority will have a major input to turning around a position which has been slipping away on us for the past year or so. A mechanism has now been put in place to turn that around. I hope this authority will link with the various sub-boards and regional tourism boards to ensure that maximum publicity and advertising is utilised to make all parts of Ireland attractive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan gives the impression that County Kerry is the only tourism location in the country with attractions and requiring attention. There is not a county in the country that does not have attractions and all require attention. For example, the horse racing industry in County Kildare attracts a specific type of tourist. However, it is not enough because it only operates at certain times of the year. It is important to blend the horse racing season with other attractions to provide an overall tourism package throughout the year. The Minister has visited Punchestown on many occasions and he is aware that its festival will shortly match the events offered at the Cheltenham festival. It has developed over a number of years. Ireland's potential in a number of areas, especially sport, will continue to ensure that the country is an attractive tourism location.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's recent comments on the development of a national conference centre. It will be a necessary and major part of the tourism infrastructure and will play a vital role in attracting major conferences to this country. I recently attended an IPU conference in Burkina Faso. The conference centre was built to host the conference and I was surprised that it was poss<Col N="414" /> ible to build it on a greenfield site adjacent to the country's main city.</P>
    <P>The arguments for and against the national conference centre, the national stadium and other developments have been too protracted. We must move forward and accept that these projects are to the benefit of the country, especially the tourism industry. A national conference centre would immediately attract international conferences which in themselves ensure many visitors come to the country. Projects such as these also have major spin-offs in terms of their planning and development. I hope we will see advances and that they will not be delayed by bickering. I support the Minister in his drive to secure a national conference centre as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Tourism is of critical importance to the country. In its March 2002 briefing document, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation estimates that tourism is a &euro;4.8 billion industry and that the Exchequer earned over &euro;2 billion from the industry in 2001. Tourism supports approximately 140,000 jobs, or one in every 12. It is vitally important in sustaining regional economies. Investment by the State in tourism marketing yields an extraordinary 50:1 return. As a source of employment the industry is vital to the country. It supports 145,000 full-time jobs, equivalent in 2000 to 8.7% of the total number of those employed. If that number of jobs were vulnerable in any other industry there would be a public outcry.</P>
    <P>We tend to forget the importance of the industry in terms of providing employment opportunities. Hotels provide a source of expertise in terms of management staff, chefs, waiters and so on. In this way they have the potential to become centres of excellence which attract visitors. When hotel guests receive proper service they will tell others, which is an excellent form of advertising for a given area. I have spoken to people who recently visited Cork and stayed in a hotel adjacent to the city. They were delighted with the service and told others. On the strength of that, two other families visited the hotel.</P>
    <P>In 2001, the growth in Exchequer earnings from tourism reached a peak. In the five years to 2001 there was a 55% increase in earnings, reaching a total of &euro;4.845 billion in 2001, or 4.2% of GNP. This is beginning to decline and the Government must take steps to arrest such a downward trend.</P>
    <P>Tourism plays an important role in regional development. It tends to be concentrated in areas that have little else in terms of indigenous industry and agriculture because of the poor quality of the land. Tourism is the factor that makes a difference, as is the case in the west. In view of this we must consider what can be done to maintain a regional distribution of the benefits of tourism and to advance agri-tourism.</P>
    <P>According to the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, 40% of visitors to Dublin also visit at least one other region. In view of this, it is important that the regional tourism boards are interlinked to ensure that other areas and regions <Col N="415" /> are highlighted to visitors to the larger cities. This will help to ensure regional balance in the industry and that the least well off areas in terms of industry and agriculture will secure the maximum benefit from tourism.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take the opportunity provided by this debate to address the concerns of the tourism industry regarding what they consider to be the negative impact of the budget. The Irish Hotels Federation has indicated its disappointment with the reduction in the capital allowance write-off for hotels, from 25 to seven years, and the increase in the lower rate of VAT to 13.5%.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the reason he has abolished the student summer job scheme; and the alternative scheme he intends to introduce to provide income support for less well-off third level students during the summer months.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3842/03]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The student summer job scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well-off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work.</P>
      <P>When the scheme was introduced, unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult to obtain work during the holiday period. In the past five years, however, the take-up has dropped significantly from 13,500 in 1998 to only 4,600 last year. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well-paid summer jobs in recent years.</P>
      <P>In view of above and in light of the financial pressures on my Department, it has been decided to discontinue the student summer job scheme. I have, however, requested the area based partnerships to consider alternative measures to assist students from disadvantaged areas in finding suitable summer employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Although the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, said in 1993, when the student summer job <Col N="416" /> scheme was introduced, that the purpose of the social welfare system is to direct resources at those who are most in need, and in view of the fact that the parents of about 1,800 students who were on the scheme last year were on social welfare, why is he depriving people who come from the most disadvantaged section of our community of the opportunity of benefiting from the scheme? While the Minister for Education and Science is attacking the students' parents and crucifying them by removing the grants for third level education, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is attacking the students from the weakest part of the community and depriving them of the right to work for their community.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is correct in his statistics regarding the take-up of the scheme. On the eastern seaboard, there is certainly a significant drop to single or double digit figures. However, along the southern and western seaboards, Mayo, Donegal, Cork, Galway and Kerry have very significant numbers of students working on the scheme. For instance, Mayo had nearly 600 last year and Donegal had 500. Galway, the county in which the Minister's constituency is located, had 354 and Kerry had almost 500. The fact that these students are working for hundreds of community groups must be considered. Every GAA hall, parish community, social club and school is using these students during the summer for very useful and valid social projects. What the Minister is doing is shameful and unacceptable in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government is to focus resources, as far as possible, on disadvantaged students. I agree with the Deputy in that regard, but we might differ on the issue of how one does that. We feel the student summer job scheme is not appropriate and its popularity has diminished hugely in recent years.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy said regarding the take-up of the scheme. However, take-up has declined hugely on the western seaboard as well. He mentioned Donegal and Galway. The figures pertaining to Donegal have, over four or five years, dropped from just under 1,200 students to just over 500. The figures for Galway and other places have dropped significantly as well. Many students from Dublin, including my own son, go down to Galway to work, drink or whatever for the summer, and therefore the notion that there is no work on the western seaboard is entirely false.</P>
      <P>I agree that the Government's aim is to target resources at those who are most disadvantaged. Resources are being put in, mainly by the Minister for Education and Science, and there is a review being carried out to determine the best way to target people in disadvantaged areas and encourage more of them into third level education.</P>

      <P>I apologise. Why does the Minister disagree with the advice of his Secretary General, who strongly supported the scheme and said it was &ldquo;good value for money&rdquo; and good for communities? Why is he taking it away now? I accept that numbers have dropped, but the drops occurred when the economy was doing extremely well. It is not doing as well now. People can say what they like, but the western seaboard needs jobs, community action and support. By getting rid of the scheme, the Minister is depriving the communities concerned of a very valid and important resource.</P>
      <P>The scheme was introduced to stop students from benefiting from social welfare and getting unemployment assistance. It was a way of giving them an income and making them work for that income, which is socially good and progressive. Research shows clearly that students, particularly those from low income families, are dropping out of third level education, particularly in the UK. Students from low income families are going into debt to stay in college, but the Minister is depriving them of an employment option that was deemed acceptable, useful and proper by all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I have not seen the submission referred to by the Deputy although I am aware of the issue being raised in Scotland. It appears that the circumstances in this jurisdiction are fundamentally different, given the constitutional status of the Irish language as the national language and the first official language. Accordingly, it is not my intention to refer the Official Languages (Equality) Bill to the Equality Authority, as suggested by the Deputy. It is, of course, open to that agency, if it so wishes, to make a submission on the Bill as published. No such submission has been received to date.</P>

I take the point regarding the constitutional position, but that does not remove the obligation on the State to be fair to all minorities in terms of the equality of the languages of its citizens.</P>

      <Quest>the reason after almost two years of the RAPID programme being in existence, funding still has not been allocated to the Dublin City area implementation team to implement the services and programmes that were identified in each RAPID plan; the way he plans to ensure that the programme will be capable of directing the funding required to get these services and programmes established in 2003 in view of the downturn in the economy and budgetary cuts; and his plan for the future of RAPID, specifically his position on the possible amalgamation of the local drug task forces and RAPID area implementation teams.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the RAPID programme is a focused Government initiative which targets the most concentrated areas of disadvantage. The programme calls on Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services. The RAPID programme has two strands, the first of which targets 25 urban areas, while strand II targets 20 provincial towns around the country. It is the role of my Department, supported by Area Development Management Limited, to co-ordinate the programme's implementation. It is a matter for individual Departments to report on progress in relation to implementation of RAPID proposals that fall within their remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each of the areas in question an area implementation team was established to prepare a plan. Plans were approved by the relevant city or county development boards prior to being sent to the national programme co-ordinator at Area Development Management Limited. Proposals from those plans were then forwarded to the relevant Department for consideration. The scale of the proposals in the plans is grand and in many cases the work involved in analysing projects is proving to be intensive. A number of indicative projects contained in the plans have required additional information to enable Departments to clarify the nature, scale and cost of the projects. While progress in implementing the plans has been slower then anticipated, the funding agencies need time to consider the plans to ensure that the correct decisions are made and that funding is available to meet the priorities identified. In the meantime, it is important that the other key element of the RAPID programme &ndash; bringing about greater coherence in the delivery of all <Col N="420" /> social inclusion measures &ndash; is addressed and implemented.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are 14 RAPID areas in Dublin. As regards my Department, 39 proposals from the Dublin RAPID plans fall to be considered under the young peoples' facilities and services fund, the community development programme and funding for local drugs task forces. In the case of proposals relevant to the young people's facilities and services fund, the national assessment committee of the fund, chaired by my Department, is examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups under round II of the fund.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>With regard to services projects, the committee awaits the completion of the external evaluation of the fund before seeking such proposals under round II. The first draft of the evaluator's report was received in mid-January and is being considered by the NAC at present. Proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in light of the overall funding position for 2003. A number of proposals in RAPID plans relate to the community development programme and while there has been no additional allocation of funding in respect of projects to date, Deputies should note that in many cases pre-development work is under way. The full establishment of groups as community development projects in 2003 is subject to available resources, but those in RAPID areas will receive due priority. A number of proposals from RAPID plans are also being pursued through the local drugs task force plans.</P>
    <P>One of my Department's primary objectives is to maximise the impact, coherence and effectiveness of the programmes for which it is responsible. As a first step towards achieving this objective, I will undertake a review of the programmes and activities that fall within the remit of my Department with a view to achieving optimal coherence across the various schemes. I will consult the relevant parties, including the local drugs task forces and the area implementation teams, and all views will be considered in the context of this review. I have an open mind with regard to the possible rationalisation of structures, including RAPID and the local drugs task forces and I am happy to await the outcome of the review. My overriding concern is to ensure that expenditure on such programmes has the most effective positive impact on the communities involved.</P>
    <P>It is important to re-state that the Government remains committed to the RAPID programme and its implementation. The 45 areas selected have been consistently targeted as areas of special need through various Government interventions in recent years and this will continue under the implementation of the different RAPID plans. In this context, Deputies should note that my officials have had a number of bilateral meetings with other relevant Departments in recent <Col N="421" /> months to try to advance the implementation of the programme. I hope to meet my ministerial colleagues in the other Departments in the coming weeks to further advance the plans.</P>

      <P>When RAPID was announced it was welcomed by many, but two years down the road there seems to be a problem. Many community workers have taken much time and effort to prepare their plans, but two years along there is no indication of when money will be forthcoming. If this dithering continues, frustration will increase. How much, if any, front loading of investment under the national development plan has been effected in the strand I areas given that they were the first to see the launch of programmes? If there is to be further dithering and delay in front loading investment, what hope is there for those who are dependent on future RAPID funding?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the method involved is rather complicated and, at times, cumbersome and I applied a different approach when it came to the CLÁR programme which is much more focused. I could describe a large number of major projects which have gone ahead since the initiation of the RAPID programme, but it is more appropriate to determine whether they would have happened anyway or whether front loading and prioritisation were major factors. I am open to discussing that. I am continuing discussions with my colleagues in an attempt to clarify the matter.</P>
      <P>The plans were very thorough and they brought a huge number of issues to the fore, some larger than others. We must discover how to sort out the smallest problems at the lowest level possible, rather than fund everything downwards through a complicated Government system. I am working on this and the Deputy can rest assured that it is my desire to bring much greater focus and clarity to the scheme. I also want the people at whom it is directed to feel a sense of ownership and to feel that it is delivering to their areas.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he will fund the new extended CLÁR areas in view of the decrease in funds available for the existing areas from the Book of Estimates; and if so, when he will bring in other areas along the Border in counties such as Monaghan and Donegal.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreed programme for Government contains a commitment to annual funding for the CLÁR programme and to consideration of additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. Arising from the analysis of the 2002 census, which I commissioned from NUI, Maynooth, the Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these additions on 17 January, 2003. The critical review <Col N="422" /> criterion was maintenance of the 50% overall reduction which involved identifying and including any DEDs with a 50% plus population decline contiguous to or near existing CLÁR areas.</P>
      <P>In the case of Donegal contiguity was taken to include contiguity across narrow inlets due to the extreme remoteness of the area and its unusual geography. Fifteen additional DEDs were included with a corresponding additional 8,570 population. In the case of Monaghan, seven additional DEDs were included with an additional 2,705 population benefiting from the programme. These DEDs meet the criterion of the review in that they are both contiguous to an existing CLÁR area and maintain the average population decline for the revised areas.</P>
      <P>Although the provision for the CLÁR programme is reduced from the 2002 allocation, I expect to be able to complete a comprehensive work programme in 2003. CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources and the 2003 allocation will be sufficient to continue this leverage and sustain an effective programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I am concerned because when the Minister announced the additional programme a major increase in Cavan was included with a small area of Monaghan. I represent the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and I welcome the major addition in Cavan, but there is a very large area of Monaghan along the Border that has experienced a major decrease in population. It includes Knockatallon, a mountain area of north Monaghan, as well as Mullyash. A large part of the Inishowen peninsula in County Donegal has not been included either, although it is a fairly difficult area.</P>
      <P>The Minister's colleague in Cavan went on local radio and said the reason Cavan was included to such an extent was that having visited Cavan and met Fianna Fáil councillors, the Minister agreed to their request to have that area included. The insinuation was that if we had done the same thing in Monaghan we would have had a much greater area of the county included. I know what the Minister's answer will be to that point but I beg him to re-examine the Border areas which are not contiguous to the other areas, as they are in Monaghan. If the Minister ever has the opportunity of visiting the Knockatallon mountain area of north Monaghan and the Mullyash mountain region near Castleblayney, he would understand the point I am making, that there is justification for including those areas on the basis of population trends. The only thing that is keeping them out is the contiguous area. A Border area that has suffered so much over the past 30 years of the troubles should be treated in such a way as to ensure they receive the most favourable entitlements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, I was asked about this matter on the radio station, Northern Sound. I pointed out, for example, that in my constituency there were no <Col N="423" /> additions to the CLÁR programme. Having examined the statistics and consulted the experts there was no justification for such additions and I assure the Deputy, therefore, that this was done on an objective basis. I used the good offices of NUI Maynooth who were very helpful and oversaw the project.</P>
      <P>The reason Cavan increased so much was that, to be honest, we were not as comprehensive and thorough when we did the exercise the first time. We had not developed as good a methodology as we used this time. I do not have the statistics relative to a percentage point but if the Deputy checks the record, the population of the existing CLÁR area in Cavan before readjusting the areas was less than 55%, which was way above the national average required. In Monaghan it was about 51% and still is. When we examined the map of Cavan we discovered there were many population decreases outside the CLÁR area and, staying within the 50% cut-off point, we were able contiguously to add many areas.</P>
      <P>In Monaghan the situation was different. As the Deputy is aware, we added in the 70 DDs that were contiguous to the existing CLÁR areas. If my memory serves me correctly, I think the Deputy has written to me about this and I have arranged for a map to be sent to him. When we had finished the whole process on a national basis &ndash; we had the new CLÁR areas and none of the old CLÁR areas had been knocked out &ndash; I requested a final map to show all the remaining DDs in the country with a population loss of 50% or more. I examined each one of them individually and their surrounding areas, and I found that there was no basis nationally for acting otherwise. The Deputy will see the map with the little blue spots on it. I have the figures and when the Deputy examines them he will see it was as objective an exercise as was possible.</P>

      <P>The requirement is that the strategy statement should be presented to the Minister within six months.

It has been quite a task to pull this together, not just to produce the normal statement but to make sure also that it is a clear statement of strategy which includes the politically driven strategy of the Department. Ultimately, a Department without a politically driven strategy would not be much good &ndash; that is what democracy is all about. I want to make sure that the strategy fully reflects the clearly stated aims of the Government in terms of developing rural areas, the islands, social inclusion, areas of rapid expansion and so on.

      <P>This Department operates a range of grant schemes and community development support programmes. These offer a wide range of supports for local self-help groups, community development and the provision of seed money to enable groups to pilot initiatives to meet new and emerging community needs. Some &euro;30.088 million has been allocated to community and voluntary services within my Department under subhead J for 2003. This includes provision for the community development support programmes. Although the overall provision represents a decrease on the 2002 provision, this allocation will enable my Department to meet its current core commitments to existing projects under the community development support programmes and will not impact negatively on their work.</P>
      <P>It is not envisaged that the reduction in funding will negatively impact on the work carried out by community development projects. However, the allocation may mean that we will not be in a position to progress the expansion of the community development support programme at the same pace as we have done in previous years. Any further expansion in this regard will have to take account of our existing commitments and available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that funding made available to the Department to allocate subsequently to community groups throughout the country comes not from the Exchequer but from the national lottery? The cut in this area of programming represents the most dishonest of the cuts that were introduced as a result of the Book of Estimates. At any time of economic austerity one can point to the fact that money must be brought in so that it can be spent but when a specific allocated fund is cut for purposes that have not been explained and where money is being used elsewhere without proper explanation, this in effect denies many who are dependent on this programme of the real support which they require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No. In relation to community development that whole area is about 7%. In previous years many community development projects were given approval and up to 30 are going through the system and ready for decisions. We will not be able to approve anything like 30 and we will have to make that decision in the coming weeks. We may allocate or approve perhaps half a dozen projects. Any existing ones which cater for community development programmes have nothing to worry about because their funding is protected. The Department is concentrating on real areas of disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>My specific question was that this is funding which came through the national lottery and I ask where the real saving is being made. If the money was specified in a fund for community development purposes I ask why the Government is choosing to spend less of that in the next year and why it is not admitting that it is cheating the communities that have been dependent on these programmes. Why is there a fund that is ringfenced, or not ringfenced in this case? It should be protected despite economic circumstances because it does not depend on Exchequer funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It does. The Deputy may have a point but it is still allocated to the Department of Finance and it allocates the lotto money and that money is obviously going to other programmes. All expenditure whether raised by general taxation or by lotto or other means, is still part of overall Government expenditure and is governed by those confines and restrictions. We are given the allocation by the Department of Finance. That allocation is down a couple of per<Col N="427" /> centage points from last year, but all existing groups will be fully funded.</P>

      <P>Tá &euro;24 mhilliún faoi fho-mhír H2 i mbliana agus níl H3 ann ar chor ar bith. Chomh maith leis sin, cuireadh &euro;16 mhilliún ar fáil anuraidh faoi H2, nuair a bhí a leithéid de rud ann, ach níor chaith an t-údarás ach &euro;14 mhilliún. Tugadh &euro;2 mhilliún ar ais don Roinn agus tugadh ar ais don údarás arís é, &euro;1 milliún do chaiteachas reatha agus &euro;1 milliún le haghaidh foirgintí. Is é an srian a bhí ar chaiteachas ó thaobh deontais an údaráis de anuraidh ná an cumas a bhí air an t-airgead a chaitheamh.

Níl Údarás na Gaeltachta in ann aon tograí nua a chur faoina bhráid do mhí Eanáir ná do mhí Feabhra na bliana seo, toisc nach bhfuil aon airgead aige chun caitheamh ar phostanna nua.

Sin freagra ar cheist a haon.</P>
      <P>Mar fhreagra ar an dara chuid den cheist, tugtar treoir don údarás bliain i ndiaidh bliana nach bhfuil cead aige ceadú in aon bhliain amháin don bhliain dár gcionn níos mó ná 75% de chaiteachas na bliana atá ar fáil. Mar shampla, i gcomhthéacs na bliana seo caite, ní raibh sé de chead ag an údarás ariamh níos mó ná 65% de &euro;16 mhilliún a cheadú. Cheadaigh sé níos mó ná sin ainneoin treoir leanúnach a thug gach uile Rialtas, ag dul i bhfad siar. Bhí ar an údarás, agus ní cheal airgid ach de bharr teacht ar ais ag an treoir a tugtar dó agus gur cheart dó a chomhlíonadh, teacht i líne maidir leis sin agus tá sé á dhéanamh sin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that one of the key objectives underlying the establishment of my Department is the achievement of a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities around the country as they pursue their development.</P>
      <P>In accordance with this objective my Department will seek to improve arrangements in relation to structures, processes and schemes to achieve more effective and efficient support for communities. Proposals in this regard will be developed in consultation with all relevant interests including other public bodies that provide support to communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the 1930s his grandfather promoted the idea of a national community development agency and offered the role to Canon Hayes of Muintir na Tíre who turned down the offer? It says something about the role of community development in public policy that the suggestion has not been taken up in the ensuing 70 years. Is the Minister of State satisfied that many areas relating to the co-ordination of community development are covered by different agencies while some areas are not covered at all? An element of the work is done by the Combat Poverty Agency and by Comhairle but much of the support work that needs to be done on a national level is not being done by any agency. There is logic in looking at the feasibility and promotion of a national community development agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Department is the national co-ordinating agency. Perhaps that is why the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was set up last June. I agree that up to then community development was being done by many agencies who answered to different Departments. They are all under the one Department now and we are trying to pull them together. We do not intend setting up another new agency. We are trying to rationalise and pull together what is there, trying to see where the gaps or overlaps are and trying to give a better service to the community. I accept the Deputy's point but feel he is in effect congratulating the Government on setting up the new Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting departure in Government policy. Is the Minister saying the policy now is that the National Roads Authority should be the responsibility of the Department of Transport, the Environmental Protection Agency should be the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Courts Service should be the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Either we have a standard where independent and autonomous agencies stand alone <Col N="430" /> and operate regardless of which Government is in power or we have the maximum political control through having all these agencies being funded through a Department. The Government cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest that at the end of our examination no agencies will exist but there will only be a Department. The Department is giving direction and is trying to pull groups together and maximise the benefits for the community. It may well be that after this study and consultation we will have a new lead agency. For the moment that is not the intention. We intend consulting widely with the various groups involved to develop a plan to improve the service to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers to the evaluation of the community development programme which was published in May 2002. As stated by the Deputy, this report confirms that the community development programme has contributed significantly to changing circumstances and creating opportunities in some of the most disadvantaged communities in the country. In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to ensuring that available resources are directed to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable communities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a review is being undertaken of the programmes and activities which come within the remit of my Department with a view to achieving optimal coherence across the various schemes and to maximising the effectiveness of the programmes for local communities. Any decisions regarding the future development of the community development programme, including decisions relating to long-term funding, will be taken in the context of this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that the Government, having commissioned a report that tells it that the way money is being spent represents good use of and value for public money, subsequently decides that the bodies dependent on such funding should <Col N="431" /> do with less, as if somehow they are being rewarded for being efficient. This seems to apply more to the community sector than to any other area of policy and we need to challenge the Government strongly on that.</P>
      <P>In regard to the community development projects, does the Minister of State accept that many of them face an uncertain fate? There is no promise of ongoing funding, there is a hand-to-mouth attitude towards funding on a day to day basis and funding is subject to renewal and discussion on what the Government agrees each project will perform. That is no basis on which to run a community development programme. The Government seems to be putting a brake on community development. It wants the projects that are up and running to justify themselves in political rather than community terms and it asks those working in the most disadvantaged areas to fulfil a role they should not. There is a distinct difference between community development and the imposition of a Government policy. It is a philosophical difference which the Department must be made understand. It is the difference between development from the ground up and decisions being imposed from the top down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was about the community development programmes. To make a general comment on that would be to focus on a narrow part of the issue. Community development supports and programmes have developed in a manner that is all over the place. The new Department is trying to pull them together. In my area there are local drugs task forces, area partnerships, community development programmes, Leader groups and so on. The Deputy mentioned Combat Poverty and other agencies. Because many of these agencies and schemes were under different Departments they were all doing a bit of the work. However, their key purpose is to serve the community and not necessarily the people who might work with any particular agency. Now that they are under one Department we are trying to consult with everybody in the field to see how the situation can be rationalised in order to give better support to communities. Many of those involved as community activists for years admit that there are gaps and overlaps and that matters could be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get across to the Minister of State that because there is no Government commitment to ongoing funding of community development projects which have been operating successfully, there is a sense that they are being punished for the type of work they are doing, their community development work or their energising of local communities. This is a problem with people involved in local government in particular. Part of the role of community development projects is to encourage people to take more responsibility for life in their own communities. It means people inform themselves and <Col N="432" /> challenge systems around them, including the political system. By the uncertainty of its spending and funding priorities the Government is sending a bad message. I ask the Minister to address the uncertainty as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 135 or more community development programmes. They are funded on a three year basis and a third of them come up for renewal each year. We have given those whose contracts expired last year between two and 12 months of a roll-over period. During that time we will consult them in regard to their future work plans. The community development programmes did some great work and aspects of their work at local level must be retained. We will try to pull them together and get better use and service to the community from the different groups and structures.</P>
      <P>There is concern that the community development programme might be swallowed up by the area partnerships or some such group. We have to be careful that that does not happen. The community development programme did great work on the ground and it is my intention to make sure it is preserved in any changes that come about.</P>

It sets out the rationale for developing the relationship between the State and the sector and the principles which should underpin this relationship.</P>
      <P>A unique feature of the White Paper was the establishment of an implementation and advisory group, IAG, to oversee implementation of the White Paper's recommendations. This group is co-chaired by senior officials from my Department and from the Department of Health and Children. It consists of six members from the community and voluntary sector and six from the statutory sector. My Department provides the secretariat to the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation and advisory group was established on 20 July 2001 and has met on 16 occasions to date. Much of the detailed work of the group has been carried out by sub-committees formed to examine specific issues and report to the main group. The group has devised a detailed work plan to assist in implementing the recommendations. Matters considered by the group to <Col N="433" /> date include the multiplicity of funding sources through which the sector must operate; the designation of voluntary activity units in relevant Departments; the development of training and supports in the sector and support for federations and networks; accreditation of training in the sector and the establishment of good practice standards in both the community and voluntary sector and the statutory sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the federations and networks scheme, it was considered necessary to re-advertise this scheme because of issues which arose in the course of processing the applications and which it was considered could give rise to legal challenge. This will take place in the coming weeks and all applicants have been advised to that effect.</P>

      </i>With regard to the training and support scheme, last week my Department invited tenders from consultants to assist in expediting the assessment process. All applicants will be advised of the outcome of their application as soon as possible following conclusion of that assessment.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also included a commitment to reform the law on charities and charitable fundraising. In January 2002, consultants were appointed to assist in this process by preparing a review of the literature on Irish charity law and a study of the regulatory environment in other jurisdictions. The work of the consultants has been completed and their report is being examined in my Department. A broad public consultation accompanied by publication of a consultation document is envisaged prior to formulation of legislative proposals. The community and voluntary sector will be consulted through the implementation and advisory group in considering legislative reform. The White Paper provides for a formal review of the workings of the group after three years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State not agree that, in the context of the implementation and advisory group, and particularly in regard to the fiasco with the federations and networks scheme, there needs to be a re-think about some of these issues? People are adjudicating on schemes on which they could potentially have an interest. Should another type of model not be contemplated?</P>
      <P>I am very concerned that so many areas have been transferred to consultants, such as the federations and networks scheme and the training and support scheme. There is already a consultants report in regard to the multiplicity of funders.</P>
      <P>This brings us back to the matter of the strategy statement and what is an enabling Department. Looking at reports to date in regard to the IAG gives one cause for concern. Is the situation being reviewed within the Department?</P>

      <P>While I share the Deputy's concerns in some respects, the White Paper made <Col N="434" /> commitments to the voluntary and community sector. The IAG was an exercise in doing more than consult. Often when one is dealing with the community there is a sense that consultation is rather hollow and more than that is required. The IAG was intended to involve this sector to a greater extent than heretofore. That is why the word &ldquo;implementation&rdquo; was included in the title. While people may have different interpretations of that, what happened proved the point that one cannot really be both a scheme applicant and adjudicator on it also. It is a very fine point.</P>
      <P>We want to work with the community and we are committed to the principles contained in the White Paper in that regard. However, there is always a point when matters are for executive decision. The federations and networks scheme will be re-advertised. We are bringing in a consultant to assist us with the training and supports scheme.</P>

      <P>The bottom line in the Minister of State's reply is that consultants are again being brought in. Can he justify the number of consultancy groups that are being brought in at a time when community employment schemes are being wound down? The schemes would give greater value to these groups than outside consultants that cost thousands of euro.</P>
      <P>In the case of Monaghan County Council, &euro;12 million was paid to consultants for one job and we have still not seen any gravel on the roads or a sod turned. Have we not gone overboard with consultancy groups at a time when CE schemes are being wound down and people at the lower end of the spectrum are not allowed to work?</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns about consultants. On this occasion we are more or less doing it at the behest of the community sector, which wants to see an independent assessment process. The IAG was perceived to be that but now that we are moving away from it we need to replace it with something that can be seen to be an independent process. The consultants are coming in to assess the 540 applications and they will make recommendations to the Department. It is not really a case of a team of consultants on this occasion. Their purpose is to wade through the applications and draw up criteria and make recommendations to us on which ones to choose.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the Waterways Ireland budget for 2003; the projects proposed but omitted for 2003; the impact of proposed cutbacks as outlined in a document (details supplied), in particular the impact on promotion and marketing programmes, the construction of a regional office at Scarriff, and the works proposed at Carrick-on-Shannon and new headquarters for Waterways Ireland.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Waterways Ireland's budget for 2003 is &euro;35.89 million. As a North-South implementation body under the Good Friday Agreement, it is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North. My Department's contribution for 2003 is &euro;30.494 million. This is made up of &euro;19.415 million current, 85% of the total current budget, and &euro;11.079 million for capital, which is funded on a jurisdictional basis. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is contributing &euro;3.426 million current, 15%, and &euro;1.97 million capital, bringing its total to &euro;5.396 million.</P>
      <P>When the document referred to by the Deputy was prepared in early September 2002, the final allocation for Waterways Ireland for 2003 had not been made and my Department was concerned to ensure that an adequate amount would be secured to facilitate the work of Waterways Ireland. In the event, the agreed southern figure of &euro;30.494 million was deemed to be a reasonable outcome.</P>
      <P>At this stage Waterways Ireland is preparing a detailed business plan outlining its full programme of works for 2003 North and South. The body is satisfied that the allocation is adequate to fund a full programme.</P>
      <P>In relation to its promotion and marketing programmes, Waterways Ireland recently underwent a consultation process with various interested parties to facilitate finalisation of its plans. The results of this process will feed into its work on the finalisation of a marketing and promotions strategy. This strategy will form the basis for its marketing and promotions remit over the next three years. Waterways Ireland anticipates that it will become much more active in this area when the strategy is in place.</P>
      <P>The capital allocated for 2003 includes provision for a regional office in Scarriff and a contribution towards a new headquarters building in Enniskillen. Funding for the Carrick-on-Shannon project was not sought for 2003 as this project is at an early stage. A preliminary site survey has been completed and assuming confirmation of the site, design work will be carried out this year with a view to going to tender in 2004.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I have only one question for him. I welcome the commitments he has given. This is one of the most important cross-Border projects, with responsibility for over 1,000 km of waterway. The document to which we referred states that there is no funding for all the things the Minister says will happen. Where did the money come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document to which I referred in my question says that the Department of Finance allocation does not take account of the promotion and marketing programme, the development of the waterways signage and fleet programme, initiatives within the context of developing its remit, the construction of a regional office at Scarriff and the preliminary works on the Carrick-on-Shannon office in 2003. The document <Col N="436" /> says money is not available for those projects. The totality of the budget is exactly what is stated in this document. I welcome the fact that these works are to be done but from where did the money for them come?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Many things will become much clearer when the Revised Estimate is published. This is not because there will be a change in the figures for this year but because the outturn for last year will become apparent. When people put forward Estimates for a future year they look for the maximum amount. Sometimes projects move forward more slowly than anticipated and this has nothing to do with the availability of money. We have put money aside for the Scarriff building and money has been put aside for the building in Enniskillen. There is enough money to meet any likely requirements relating to marketing.</P>
      <P>Some projects take longer to get up and running than expected. For example, there was an underspend last year. It is last year's figures which will look different and not this year's. The underspend occurred because certain things did not happen. Recruitment of personnel was much slower than anticipated, for example. In this context I am happy that I have enough resources to fulfil a comprehensive programme. Some details remain to be worked out by Waterways Ireland but the money is available for the major projects.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to securing the most positive impacts for communities arising from expenditure through programmes under the aegis of my Department. This will be a guiding principle throughout the review process. As the Deputies will know, many of these local and community programmes were established under different Departments years ago, in some cases almost decades ago. It is essential therefore that measures to improve their underlying coherence and effectiveness are well informed and focused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently concluding discussions with a number of ministerial colleagues who have an involvement with similar programmes. I hope to <Col N="437" /> be in a position to initiate a full consultation process with other interested parties, including the social partners and the providers of such programmes, shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;The optimal coherence of the management and co-ordination of programmes&rdquo; is a beautiful phrase. Will the Minister explain what it means and how will we know when we have achieved it? It is important that the language of Government, especially in an important area such as community and rural affairs, is understood by the people with whom we are supposed to be communicating and that they know what we are collectively working towards. When the statement of strategy is achieved by the Minister and his Department perhaps he will be prepared to look at this area of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I used this phrase in September 2002. I have always stood in awe at the ability of my colleague in Galway West, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, to use the most beautiful English in answering questions. It was an art form from which I have learned much over the years.</P>
      <P>We have many schemes in many different areas. I have spent most of my life in community development and I am still involved in it in my spare time. We want to tailor schemes to the people's requirements and this is what people who are involved in community development tell us to do when we go around the country. There are differences between the requirements of different communities, whether rural or urban. Deprived urban communities have totally different requirements from some of the rural communities.</P>
      <P>Schemes originated in different places. For example, there are partnerships which came from the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the CDSPs came from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. One must always question which scheme is best for each community. For example, there are only 3,000 people living on our islands. On Gaeltacht islands there are Gaeltacht co-operatives and on non-Gaeltacht islands there are CDSPs. These are chalk and cheese operations although there is no difference between the islands except that the people speak a different language. I must ask myself which is the optimum model. Maybe the optimum is half way between the two but the question must be answered.</P>
      <P>I must dispel the idea that the Minister of State or I want to do down community development. We want to listen to what we are being told by the community developers and to make the schemes responsive to what they see as the requirements in their daily work. They are not uniform across the country. We want to get away from a uniform prescription by Government as to what CDSPs, Gaeltacht co-operatives or partnerships are about and to devise a more locally flexible model.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister has said. Will he assure us that we are not just getting into a cycle of consultation which will end with the major issues being shoved off in the direction of consultants? There seems to be over-emphasis on the use of consultants. Endless talking might not lead to an improvement in management, co-ordination or anything else, but some consultants might be well off at the end of these exercises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that he is totally wrong. One must decide where consultants should be used and where they should not. The Minister of State mentioned consultants in the context of evaluation of applications received under a scheme. Under the federation and training scheme the idea is to have an arm's length evaluation system for a scheme the shape of which is already decided centrally with the partners. It is reasonable that the successful applicants would be selected by an independent evaluation process. Asking the groups themselves to make their own evaluations would be like asking half the population to mark their own leaving certificate and then to mark those of the other half as well.</P>
      <P>We will use consultants in a targeted and sparing way. Some jobs are better done at arm's length, and I believe it was to this Deputy Boyle alluded earlier. There are other jobs which should be done by the policy maker in consultation with the groups on the ground. These will be done by the policy maker and not at arm's length. This is where we must make the differentiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister describes his Department as an enabling Department. I would like to see more of the machinery of these schemes inside the Department. The networks and federation scheme has been sent out to consultants for processing. Will that happen every time this scheme is advertised or will a process be put in place which cannot allow for accusations of vested interest in the allocation of funds to the federations and networks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the why the scheme is being processed with an arm's length approach. It is a once-off scheme. It will be advertised once and the money will be allocated. That commitment was made in the White Paper. It is not intended to run the scheme again and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had one wish it would be that more of the money was delivered to services on the ground and that we minimised the money spent in transmission. Every area wants to be included in the scheme and will plead disadvantaged. However, we must focus on areas of real disadvantage such as the RAPID areas. If we do not have the courage to do that and insist on giving a gift to &ldquo;everyone in the audience&rdquo; we will do a huge disservice to those in the greatest need of help for self-development. When partnerships began they <Col N="439" /> were focused but they later spread out into various areas.</P>
    <P>If one has a limited amount of money, which is always the case, the more it is spread out the less will be available for the target areas. This is a re-balancing position that will have to be taken into account in moving forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in regard to RAPID. Would it be a good idea if RAPID was solely under the aegis of his or some other Department? Given that the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are also involved it is hard to get a handle on exactly what is going on or to ensure there is clarity and that the money is getting through to the deprived communities. Will the Minister please comment on that?</P>

      <P>I would claim that RAPID III, otherwise known as CLÁR, has been very focused in getting on the ground and there are tangible effects. Clearly we can identify a measure, even if it is done by various Departments and there are co-funding arrangements. How do we ensure that RAPID operates in a way that delivers and is seen to deliver by those to whom it counts, namely, the people living in the area? Certainly from my point of view, it is not any PR exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of delivery, it is vital to use council structures and existing bodies as much as possible rather than outside consultancy groups. It is important to work through groups who know exactly what is needed such as county community structures which are working with the council. The issue is to maximise the amount of money. There is anxiety that is takes so long to actually get the programmes into operation. This is one issue I raised recently. While task force money is not the Minister's area of responsibility, it is often allocated in July and must be spent by November. That is not logical. We should know about it three years in advance. The money should be available early in the year <Col N="440" /> in the form of a co-ordinated programme rather than a slap-dash programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of co-ordination and localisation, many of the RAPID actions in the IAGs should not have come back to central Government. We will have to look at a local structure, be it the CDT or some other structure to kill them at local level and get them done, otherwise talking about localisation or regionalisation is a nonsense. I agree fully with the Deputy on that issue. There is no point in having a system of paralysis by analysis and consultation on an ongoing basis should be proactive. To stop or freeze programmes for a year or two years to allow for a a consultation process is a nonsense. I have always been of the view, whether in rural or urban areas, that anyone of us could write on the back of an envelope issues with which everyone would agree. While looking at the more complex issues we should get on with the simple issues on which everyone is agreed. We have gone from a situation of no consultation to &ndash; if I may mix Irish and English together &ndash; ró-consultation. We need to return to a happy medium. One way to ensure consultation works sensibly is to provide quick and efficient access to the system where there is a need but in the meantime allow those who are taking the action to get on with the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The final point I wish to raise is the effect of insurance on tourism. From the time a person or family arrive in Ireland to the time they leave, the increase in insurance costs will have a major effect on the cost of the visit. I have raised this issue time and again in the House with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment but there does not appear to be any progress on it. I hope the Government will address this problem because it is a major problem for all aspects of Irish life. There is no doubt it has a major effect on the tourism industry. The cost of a visit to Ireland is increased due to increased insurance costs at all levels. When a person gets off the boat or the aeroplane they either hire a taxi or rent a car, the insurance costs for each have gone through the roof. They proceed to their hotel or BB where public liability insurance costs have increased dramatically. If they proceed to a show or entertainment facility, a price increase is built into the cost there because of the increased insurance costs. In replies to me in the House, the Tánaiste stated that 11 September and the collapse of the independent insurance company in England were major factors. I am beginning to get suspicious and there is a need to look again to see what are the main reasons for such a dramatic increase in insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles in the Sunday newspapers over the past two weekends stated that theatre groups have to cut back on their productions due to the increased cost of insurance. This will be reflected in the reasons a person should come to Ireland <Col N="442" />&ndash; live theatre and so on has always been part and parcel of the tourist trade here. Due to the cost of insurance, theatre productions are being cut and as such the theatre attractiveness element of Ireland is diminished. We must look at this issue, otherwise the competitiveness of Irish tourism will have to bear the brunt.</P>
    <P>This is the main issue confronting the tourist industry. Time and again I have raised it here and have put questions to the Tánaiste and yet there has been no response from the Government. We do not appear able to apprehend what is going on or able to do anything about the problems associated with this aspect of Irish life. It is a major problem in this area.</P>
    <P>I said previously that I congratulated the Minister in moving this Bill forward. In moving it forward he must see what the Government can do. I have been told continually that because of EU legislation nothing can be done in this area. If necessary, the Government should go back to the EU to see what can be done because something must be done, otherwise it will have major effects on the tourism industry right across the spectrum from hiring cars to taxis, to hotels and to entertainment. As we saw in the newspapers in recent days, many St. Patrick's Day parades &ndash; which are a focal point for people coming home from abroad &ndash; will be diminished or wiped out completely. Because public liability insurance has become so expensive, many local groups will not be able to hold parades or pageants which have been held for many years. That is a tragedy because they gave local communities a chance to develop and to show their wares. They gave everyone a chance to make sure their area, town, industry, association or sport, was represented. It all comes down to insurance which will be a crippling factor for many public events in the coming years, but particularly this year when local groups will not be able to run events in their areas.</P>
    <P>We all see the merits of this Bill and speakers so far have fully supported the Minister in this regard but he must address the one crucial issue which will allow the tourism industry to develop. Something will have to be done about insurance in the short-term rather than in the long-term.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage when we will raise many points with the Minister on particular sections. I welcome the Bill which will be of major significance and benefit to the tourism industry because it will be effective in encouraging national as well as international tourism. We have been negligent in regard to local tourism over the years thinking that people would automatically be attracted to different areas, functions, etc. Given the competition which has been generated by low cost holidays around the world, we must fight to keep the domestic market strong and vibrant and ensure we have an attractive array of holidays in the off-peak season as we see on Aertel or on whatever medium people use. I hope this Bill will support the relevant organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Finian McGrath, Gogarty and Crowe.</P>
      <P>I am broadly in favour of this Bill which establishes the new tourism agency, Fáilte Ireland, as a cohesive entity to develop strategies for promoting Irish tourism at this early juncture in the new century and the new millennium. At the same time Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited are to be dissolved and their functions will be subsumed by the new authority. Both organisations had an honourable record in the business of tourism over the past half century and their tourism marketing and promotional activities will be performed by the new single body in the future. Bord Fáilte and CERT did excellent work in the tourism sector for many decades and they complemented each other in their roles to the greatest effect and with very considerable benefits accruing to the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>I presume the existing CERT catering and hotel management colleges currently operating under the VEC administration will continue under a new designation but fulfilling basically the same role, that is, the promotion of marketing skills, human resources and training which it has carried out so successfully over the past four decades.</P>
      <P>The other tourism body, Tourism Ireland, set up under the Good Friday Agreement to promote the island of Ireland abroad as a tourism destination has been an unqualified success and the perfect example of cross-Border co-operation which can be mutually beneficial in a changed political atmosphere. It is vital that this concept of friendliness, welcomes, céad míle fáilte and Irish culture and heritage continue to be promoted and stressed by the new body as major attractions and incentives for potential visitors to Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the 11 September tragedy in the United States and the foot and mouth disease outbreak, there was a natural and understandable fall off in the US market for visitors to Ireland. However, the new body will be ideally placed to capitalise and to build on the anticipated swing back in the very buoyant ethnic market in the US. Nevertheless the British market continues to grow from year to year and it has offset to a considerable extent, the fall off in the US and European markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the late 1960s there has been a phenomenal growth in the level of facilities, such as visitor and interpretative centres and tourist trails, which assist in adding meaning and interest to the countryside, forest parks and lakes. My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, Ireland's lake district, contains such treasures as the Shannon-Erne waterway, the equestrian centre in Cavan, Castle Leslie in Glaslough, the Sliabh Beagh tourism centre and the Lough Muckno leisure park, to mention but a few of the unparalleled fishing, sailing and cruising activities in the constituency. The tourism potential of these attractions has not been fully realised because of signposting. We need to up-date and modernise our signposting <Col N="444" /> and we need to look at our infrastructure and roads system.</P>
    <P>One of the first issues to which Fáilte Ireland will be required to direct its collective attention will be the competitiveness of tourism. Since the transition to the euro at the beginning of 2002, the first time a common currency largely existed in Europe since the Roman Empire, our distinct lack of competitiveness became painfully apparent when compared with the experiences of Irish people in other euro zone countries. The assurance of value for money and top quality service in holiday terms will go a long way towards enticing Irish people to holiday at home. Rocketing insurance costs have also contributed in no small way to undermining the tourism industry's competitiveness. I suggest that adjustments in the VAT rate would go a long way towards bringing Ireland into line with its counterparts in the euro zone and making it more attractive as a tourism destination.</P>
    <P>One of the major factors responsible for the continued buoyancy in the UK market has been the deregulation of the airline industry which has led to the rise of low cost carriers, such as Go, Buzz and Easyjet, resulting in enhanced competition.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance that the new tourism authority has the greatest degree of autonomy possible in the performance of its functions. Section 11 provides for the delegation of functions by Fáilte Ireland, at the Minister's direction or with his consent, to another body. This appears to be at variance with the level of autonomy and independence appropriate for the authority in the interests of transparency and accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to address this important legislation. This debate has come at the right time as we now seem to be at the cross-roads in our tourism industry. We need new, radical and creative ideas to develop this industry. We must look at training, human resources and at our marketing skills, our jobs and the use of public finances. We need a thorough examination and debate. We cannot hide our heads in the sand in this rapidly changing global society and rapidly changing economy. Strategic planning and creative ideas will save and develop the tourism industry. The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide the statutory basis for the new authority. On its establishment, Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT will be dissolved and the functions carried out by them will be transferred to the new body, Fáilte Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 8, the primary functions of the authority will be to encourage, promote and support the development of tourism traffic within and to the State. This section is an important part of the overall plan to develop our tourism industry. It is crucial to look at our strengths compared to other European Union countries or foreign <Col N="445" /> markets. Over the past eight or nine years we have seen the down side of the Celtic tiger, where many pubs, restaurants and hotels have lost the personal touch they had 20 years ago. We must save and retain the traditional good manners, personal touch and common courtesy we had. We seem to have lost all that, and if we continue to go down that road we will lose millions of euros and, in the end, we will lose jobs.</P>
    <P>Under section 13, the Minister has the power to give policy directions to the authority. It is up to him to show leadership. He must listen to the people and to the industry. Above all, he must give creative and decisive leadership. We should market the country with emphasis on the way we are. We should use our culture, language, games and all the creative arts and music as the engine room for the tourism industry. Our climate is often criticised and laughed at as a weakness in the tourism industry and the reality is that thousands of Irish families travel abroad each year to get the sun. However, let us turn this around and target very hot countries whose people like to visit a country with plenty of rain and green countryside. People want change. They want variety. I have met people from extremely hot countries who said they really enjoyed their break in Ireland, so let us target these markets and develop the industry.</P>
    <P>An important part of that market must be the Middle East, parts of Africa and the southern region of Europe. This is why it is very important to retain our position as an international peacebroker, with an independent foreign policy, and not allow ourselves to be bullied by major powers. If we are recognised as international peacebrokers our tourism industry will flourish and jobs will roll into the economy. We should also sell, use and develop our expertise to assist poorer countries and the developing world.</P>
    <P>We could focus on disabled people because there are ten million people in Europe with a disability. Why not use that as a market, give Ireland as an example of good practice and get people to visit the country? It is a great opportunity to do so, this being the Year of the Disabled and the fact that we will host the Special Olympic Games. Some ten million people with disabilities throughout Europe would love to visit this country. Let us open it up and develop this industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome sections 27 and 28 relating to audited accounts, the annual returns to the Minister and the fact that they must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. It is essential to use our finances and resources widely and carefully. Many of us have been critical of the way money was spent in the past. I now call for proper use of this taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with the dissolution of Bord Fáilte and CERT Limited. I hope that sections 41 and 42 will not leave open the possibility of job losses. Under sections 40, 41 and 42, we see the standard provisions for the transfer to the authority of the rights and liabilities of the dissolved bodies, including the liabilities for losses occurring before <Col N="446" /> establishment day. It is essential that the new authority starts off fresh, without any baggage or financial problems. This industry cannot be left on the fringes of economic development and job creation. For too long we have ignored the massive labour intensive side of the industry and the great potential to get people out of poverty and up the ladder in society. We have often ignored the creative genius of our poorer sections. For too long the tourism industry and the arts industry have been under the control of the very well off. Talents and new ideas, no matter where they come from, should always be nurtured and developed. The tourism industry needs people who in the long-term, will improve the industry and create more jobs.</P>
    <P>The last part of the Bill deals with financial implications. It is felt there will be no significant budgetary or financial implications in the legislation. I hope this is not penny-pinching. In order to have a quality national tourism development authority, the last thing we need is to curtail finances, investment and development because we now have the potential and ability to make progress in the tourism industry, which will benefit the whole of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening with interest to the debate on the monitor in my office, in the Public Gallery and here. I hope the Minister is listening in his office and will take into consideration our views, just as we have taken his views into consideration. Most of what he said in his speech was a rehash of what he said in the Seanad, so we were able to flag what he would say in advance. I have studied the Bill in some detail, which the Green Party broadly supports. We find nothing wrong with it <i>per se.</i> However, we will not vote for it because there is a much deeper malaise in the implementation of tourism policy. We do not feel the Government has earned enough kudos for the Green Party to give its unqualified support to such Bills. There are many reasons for this.</P>
      <P>The main problem facing the tourism industry is post-Celtic tiger developments. There was talk about the foot and mouth disease crisis and the atrocities of 11 September. However, as we move on post-Celtic tiger, when the economy is getting tighter, we are faced with a challenge whereby if we are to encourage more people to come to our shores, or more quality in terms of what people spend to come to our shores, we must offer a much more competitive product. I hate saying the word &ldquo;product&rdquo; because, while tourism is a product in one sense, it is also selling our people and our sense of place. What is rapidly disappearing is our sense of place and our sense of people. I recently attended a wedding in Crawfordsburn, County Down, and something that immediately impinged on me was the warmth and friendliness of the staff. I noticed also that the workers, from cleaners to restaurant staff, to reception staff to management, all lived and worked in the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very difficult to find in post-Celtic tiger <Col N="447" /> Ireland. Many friendly and warm people, some of the most friendly and warm people who work in the tourism and hospitality industry in Ireland, are foreign. They include people from New Zealand, Australia, America, Algeria, the Middle East and China. They are all very hospitable, have a natural courtesy and they all do their employers a great service. However, one thing seems to be missing, which is the traditional Irish welcome. One will still get it in certain parts of the country but it is diminishing. At a time when there is more competition from other markets and when global stability is under threat, there is a need to be as competitive as possible, not just in regard to pricing but in regard to people. People come to this country to meet welcoming Irish people. They may work with foreigners, but we need more Irish trained people. If CERT is integrated into the new authority, I hope there will be an incentive to ensure more Irish people to work in the tourism and catering hospitality sectors. It is part of what we are. That is what encourages people to come to Ireland. We seem to be losing out in that area.</P>
    <P>We need a more co-ordinated approach to tourism. If the Minister is watching the monitor or listening or reading the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo;, I say to him that our long-term future as a premium tourist destination is being irreparably damaged because of a lack of co-ordination between Departments. I will give some examples. I recently raised the issue of access to land throughout the country. In certain parts of Connacht, the Dingle peninsula, the Gap of Dunloe and other parts of Ireland, locals and tourists are being told to &ldquo;feck off&rdquo; by farmers or land owners. I apologise for using that word. I do not know if it is allowed under Standing Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Deputy did not use words he knows are not allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>To &ldquo;f. . . . off&rdquo;. I apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy not to use such derogatory words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly. I was just quoting directly from a person in County Kerry who told me what a farmer said to him.</P>
      <P>There is a deeper malaise in the farming community, which feels that the Department of Agriculture and Food is not giving it enough concessions to compensate for the fact that agriculture prices have dropped. Farmers wonder why they should allow tourists to come on to their land without some form of payback. I suggest that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism should provide an incentive for farmers to give the public access to their lands, rather than paying them directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I tabled a priority question on the matter earlier this month, however, it was transferred to <Col N="448" /> the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. When I asked whether guesthouses should be renamed &ldquo;family hotels&rdquo;, given that many foreign people do not understand the term &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo;, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said that the matter was not in his remit. If such matters cannot be discussed with the relevant Minister in the Dáil, where can they be discussed? Is the Minister unwilling to take responsibility for all issues related to tourism? Co-ordination is very important.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry faces many problems. Ireland is turning into a filthy country, many people are racist or unfriendly, prices are too high and our distinctive landscapes and seascapes are being destroyed by illegal dumping and bad planning. Signposting is often illogical and our public transport system is inadequate. When people want to visit the countryside, they find too often that access is blocked by landowners, as I have said. Ireland's litter problems are increasing, as is the phenomenon of alcohol related violence. The traditional Irish welcome seems to be rare.</P>
    <P>The guide to Dublin published by the Lonely Planet organisation mentions some of the capital's problems, including early pub closing times. It says that the recent extension of opening hours barely addresses the problem. It refers to the crass commercialisation of Temple Bar and says that late night Dublin is full of rowdy drunks, vomit and dirt. It suggests that public transport schedules tend to be a loose guide rather than a rule and that tourists should use trains as the buses are slow. Dublin's rip-off culture, according to Lonely Planet, extends from bad museums to lousy restaurants. The guide says that racism is a problem, particularly against Africans but also against eastern Europeans. It complains that road works are prevalent. I have given a selection of palatable remarks that are suitable for the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion is a problem in Clifden, a town on the west coast of Connemara that is particularly close to my heart as I have relatives from that area. Some years ago the Government closed the railway line that served Clifden. Although the Green Party and others are promoting the re-opening of the western rail corridor, the Government dismisses the idea. It is another example of a lack of co-ordination. If the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism had any guts he would threaten to resign immediately in response to the fact that other Departments are not helping him to do his job. How can one say &ldquo;Welcome to Ireland&rdquo; when this country is turning into a banana republic? How can one say &ldquo;Come visit us&rdquo; when it is difficult to get anywhere unless one has a car? It is difficult for tourists to know where they are going in the absence of proper signposts.</P>
    <P>The number of visitors to post-Celtic tiger Ireland in the third quarter of 2002 decreased by 2.2% in comparison with the same period of 2001. The fact that the average length of stay decreased by 20% has even more far-reaching con<Col N="449" /> sequences. We need to examine why people coming here for holidays are not staying for as long as they used to. The figures I have mentioned do not relate specifically to visitors from the United States and cannot, therefore, be linked with the post-11 September malaise. The problems associated with price increases have been flagged left, right and centre. If businesses are ripping people off, it is our job to highlight it and to explain to them that they are cutting one hand off with the other. For every &euro;1 earned by a hotel, between 35c and 45c is taken up by wage costs. Some tour operators have seen their premia increase by 200% in the past year. Business costs would be reduced if there were set fees for injuries and personal injury claims.</P>
    <P>One-off housing is destroying the landscapes and seascapes that attract people to Ireland. Those who like such things are interested in the fact that one can see the sea from our mountains &ndash; this is not possible in Germany as one has to choose to travel to the North Sea coast or to the Alps. People from countries like Germany, France, Italy, England and the United States want to walk around Ireland, but access to the land is closed off. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism is on a hiding to nothing if he does not work with his counterparts in the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Transport and Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a concentration on marketing Ireland as a premium destination. Marketing is great, but one can only do a certain amount of it, as political parties have found out to their dismay. There must be something of substance to accompany the marketing. I fear that the substance we had to offer in the past is being diminished. Our unique selling point to tourists as Irish people is being diminished. I strongly urge the Minister to work with the Departments I have mentioned for the sake of the long-term sustainable development of the tourism sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>Most speakers have broadly welcomed this Bill, but I have reservations about some aspects of it. During the Seanad debate on the Bill, Senators Quinn and Henry highlighted issues of concern relating to equal status legislation and argued that funding should be withheld from any business found to be in breach of the Equal Status Act 2000. This issue was raised by Sinn Féin some months ago when it was announced that the Irish Open Golf tournament is to be held at a club that does not allow women to become members. My party called on Bord Fáilte to withhold financial support for the event, as the national tourism agency should not be seen to support any section of the industry that contravenes equality legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is madness that the State, through Bord Fáilte or any new authority, should support any form of discrimination. Organisations looking for funding must adhere to certain basic principles. Equality of access for all is a principle I hold very dearly, whether in terms of access to education, <Col N="450" /> health or golfing facilities. The days of people being denied access because of their class, creed or sexuality should be numbered.</P>
    <P>While the Irish Hotels Federation has made a number of statements regarding inflation and rising costs within the tourism industry, it is clear that cost increases are not being caused by exorbitant wage increases. Sinn Féin, and many trade unions, have pointed this out in the past. The NTDA should have a function with regard to policing wage levels in the industry. I know from my experience that many people employed in the tourism sector earn low wages and work long hours. This has been an issue for unions in the industry for many years. Workers are being exploited by the wealthy property owners who dominate the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>It could be said that we have two tourism industries and that we need two tourism authorities to deal with them. The first industry is that of the property owners, developers and speculators who have grown rich through the efforts of workers in the tourism sector. They have benefited from tax schemes such as the seaside resorts scheme, which enabled them to build scores of holiday homes around the country at a time when the number of people on housing lists continued to grow. We seem better able to build beautiful houses for visitors from overseas than to provide for our own people.</P>
    <P>The second tourism industry is a different environment and is rarely seen in Bord Fáilte advertisements. Many workers are paid with cash in hand, are employed without the vital protection of a trade union and are exploited daily. Many such workers come from overseas and do not benefit from the protection of citizenship, a dubious benefit as it has failed to protect many workers in the past. The immigrant workers to whom I refer are at risk because they are in a strange country where they might not know anyone and where they may encounter language difficulties.</P>
    <P>It should be unacceptable for any business to receive funding or other official support from the national tourist development authority if found guilty of the gross exploitation of workers. Such businesses should be blacklisted and boycotted by the State. A clear message needs to be sent to the exploiters of labour to the effect that we will not and cannot allow them to escape unpunished or with a mere slap on the wrists.</P>
    <P>I must express disappointment about the lack of an all-Ireland dimension in the new authority. It is crucial that we start to plan on an all-Ireland basis so we can make the most of the strength that exists on both sides of the Border. Partition has retarded the economic development of this country. We should make the most of the current opportunities to push forward strategies that integrate the development of tourism throughout the country and market the entire island as a single entity.</P>
    <P>The setting up of Tourism Ireland, the all-Ireland agency established under the Good Fri<Col N="451" /> day Agreement to market Ireland overseas, is the kind of thinking and positive movement of which we need from this Government. Sinn Féin welcomes the setting up of Tourism Ireland as it welcomes every move, however slow, made by the Government to implement the pledges made under the Good Friday Agreement. We look forward to seeing more of these initiatives and there is clearly room under the Agreement for initiatives of this kind. Tourism Ireland is an example of the way the Government should be moving across every Department and I regret that this is lacking in the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that those who are appointed to oversee a strategy for the tourism industry are both representative of all the interests involved and have a clear vision of the future for the sector. We need to cater for domestic holidaymakers as well as those who come from abroad and to ensure that high standards are applied, not only to facilities made available to visitors and guests, but also to those working in the industry, whose skills and hard work are the real assets which underlie the success of Irish tourism.</P>

      <P>The Green Party seems to have lost out in that context judging from the letter in which one of its members objected to the fencing off of every stream in the country and so on. A touch of reality is needed when dealing with tourism as with everything else, and the Green Party needs to understand that. Nonetheless, I welcome its support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the NTDA is welcome particularly in the context of the challenging period the tourism sector is going through, although I am glad it was pointed out that there is still an increase in percentage terms in that area. The <Col N="452" /> importance of tourism to the economy cannot be underestimated as many other speakers have said. In the most recent year for which figures are available, 2001, tourism income accounted for 5.4% of the national income and one in every 12 jobs in the economy is supported by it. It is critically important to recognise that and to try to improve those figures further.</P>
    <P>Tourism can be a highly volatile sector and we have seen how external factors such as foot and mouth disease in the UK and acts of terrorism can have a rapid and dramatic downward effect on visitor numbers. While we cannot entirely insulate the tourism sector against political or economic difficulties, we can do a number of things to ensure that the industry is well placed for the challenges that lie ahead. At its simplest, the job of the new NTDA must be to ensure the job of the tourism sector is to have a quality product, a quality service and effective marketing. That is the base it should start from.</P>
    <P>Areas such as the physical design of hotels, visitor centres and amenities have improved greatly in recent years and the number of hotel beds in three, four and five star hotels in our major cities can now compare very favourably with other destinations with which we compete directly. Most hotels now offer excellent leisure facilities and many of their owners availed of the business expansion scheme to develop these, although that may not have been the exact intention of the Minister at the time he introduced that concession.</P>
    <P>However, the two extremes outlined today shows how difficult is the line that the Government and Ministers must tread. Deputy Deenihan was concerned that some of the concessions were being taken away while Deputy Crowe was worried that concessions given in the past meant that funding was not put into building houses for the homeless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is getting it fairly right most of the time. I am glad Deputy Deenihan came back because, despite the pessimistic outlook this morning, in my own little city by the River Lee there are three current applications for new hotels of major size. Some people have an optimistic view of the future and I take that as a positive sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Excellence in physical design is not sufficient to ensure that tourists leave the country happy with their experience here. I agree with the previous speaker in many respects with regard to that and welcome the establishment of the NTDA, especially the integrated approach it will provide towards training for those working in tourism. Ireland is rightly famous for services delivered in a way that is both friendly and courteous and only by combining our traditional welcome with modern professionalism will the suc<Col N="453" /> cess of recent years be maintained. That will be the NTDA's biggest challenge and the Act is welcome largely because it makes this the NTDA's sole responsibility.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I pay tribute to the work of CERT and recognise its importance with regard to tourism. Anyone who has visited a big or small establishment where food was served in a professional way has seen the results of CERT training. The staff who have had professional training can be recognised; that is something we are proud of and it is important that standard is maintained. The southern regional headquarters for CERT is located at the Cork Institute of Technology and there is a major new facility planned for there which has advanced past the drawing board stage. I hope that massive project will be built quickly as it is important for the tourism industry in the south-west region.</P>
    <P>I cannot discuss the record of CERT without mentioning the head of the organisation in the south, Mr. Jarlath Killilea. Mr. Killilea is a legend in the tourism business and wherever the hotel and food and drink sectors are concerned. He has driven the industry in the south and has had a massive influence on it. I do not know of any other public servant who has contributed more in any area of responsibility and I take this opportunity to compliment and congratulate Mr. Killilea on his work to date, and long may that continue.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I believe tourism will become an even more important element in the future. Our prosperity is linked directly to the tourism industry and we will need to continue to develop it by working together. Deputies Deenihan and Crowe mentioned that tourism impinges on many Departments, including those with responsibility for fisheries, finance, the environment and agriculture in addition to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. Departments can do very positive things but they can also do things which have a negative impact, although that would not be intended at the outset. It is important there is more co-ordination and co-operation as well as an inter-departmental view on tourism.</P>
    <P>At the same time, every resident in the country has a role to play in furthering the benefits of tourism. It has been indicated in surveys that 50% of those surveyed indicated the friendliness of Irish people as a primary reason for deciding to come to Ireland and long may that continue. However, society is changing rapidly and there is a need to ensure that visitors as well as Irish people feel safe and friendly.</P>
    <P>An earlier speaker suggested that the NDTA should consider an orientation course for foreign nationals working in the hospitality tourism sector to ensure the country's reputation for extending a céad míle fáilte is maintained. It is also important for the workers that they be fully trained and given a fair opportunity. Tourists like to find out about the local history and geography of the areas they visit, which they usually get from <Col N="454" /> chatting to locals and staff working in the industry. In view of this, a greater effort at the training of foreign nationals would help. Regrettably, a minority of those working in the industry, more usually Irish nationals, most often disappoint tourists and any assistance that the new agency can provide in this area would be very welcome. A small percentage of any workforce will always be disgruntled in their work and in the tourism industry they can do great damage. Hotel and bar owners can assist by focusing on motivating their staff.</P>
    <P>Jobs in the tourism sector should not be considered seasonal or casual, although there will always be a need for an element of seasonal employment. Employers should strive to provide proper career paths and good remuneration to their employees. This will guarantee their loyalty and dedication to their work. Deputy Crowe rightly said there have been difficulties in the past with the rates of pay on offer and the hours to be worked, although much has been done to address this over the past couple of years, particularly with the introduction of the national minimum wage and improvements in working conditions for part-time workers. As a former Minister for Labour, the Taoiseach was responsible for the bulk of our good employment legislation which has been further improved over the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>The NDTA should encourage employers to look beyond a single tourism season and design a three to five year plan to develop their product with the staff to deliver it. The major hotel chains and others will do that automatically as part of their business plans, but many of the smaller business tend to operate on an annual basis and hope for the best.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Tourism Ireland in January 2002 as part one of the cross-Border implementation bodies represented a significant step towards the implementation of the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. This will provide the wider context in which the NDTA must operate. Those of us where were members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in 1989-90 considered possible areas for co-operation and recognised tourism an obvious one. It is regrettable that the Executive which was to oversee the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in the North has been prevented from functioning for a variety of factors, but it is essential for the success and viability of the Agreement that the implementation bodies continue to operate. I hope the successes of the nine bodies that have been established will help to persuade some detractors that the Agreement will create a more prosperous and caring society. The areas of co-operation covered by the bodies are largely non-contentious and do not impact on the constitutional future of the North. They should not be prevented from functioning by the malcontents who never wanted the Agreement to succeed.</P>
    <P>The spectre of paramilitary violence blighted the country for so long that it did incalculable <Col N="455" /> damage to its image abroad. I understand Deputy Crowe said partition prevented co-operation between North and South. I suggest it was the activities of terrorists and I have no doubt that the separate development of tourism on the island over the years resulted in the loss of significant numbers of potential visitors. Given that society is, I hope, becoming free of subversive activity, it is appropriate that the island of Ireland is finally being marketed abroad by a single agency.</P>
    <P>I have enjoyed many visits to the North, especially as a public representative. In the past I would have been reluctant to consider it as a location for a holiday or a weekend break, but thank God that negative approach is more or less behind us, although it will take many years to change attitudes. Nevertheless, I hope over time many people from the South will consider the County Antrim coast, the Giant's Causeway or Portrush as suitable tourism locations. I welcome our friends from the North who visit County Cork, County Kerry or the southern region. While many have visited Dublin as the capital city, they will be guaranteed a warm welcome in the south of the country. As a pilot project my local authority tried to move the world famous foot bridge from the Giant's Causeway and place it over the River Lee, but unfortunately insurance demands put an end to the initiative.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the PIAB, the purpose of which is to implement the findings of the MIAB, which contained approximately 67 recommendations. It took three years to secure the co-operation of the insurance companies and I hope there will be speedy implementation. The advent of low cost travel has been most welcome. While there are mixed views on the publicity stunts engaged in by Mr. O'Leary &ndash; I am sure he will not mind the mention of his name in the House &ndash; Ryanair and the low-cost travel concept has helped enormously to bring more visitors to the country.</P>
    <P>Cork will be the European city of culture in 2005 when all visitors will be welcomed to the city. Many more facilities for entering the country are required, both by air and sea. I encourage the NDTA to be an advocate of further expansion in the range and frequency of travel outlets for tourists. I was one of those who struggled for a number of years to secure the return of the Cork to Swansea ferry. It is a huge success, although we do not wish to repeat the trauma of its history.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to its enactment. I wish every success to those involved in its implementation. A good start is half the battle and I hope it will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dennehy for sharing his time. The Bill is the first attempt to bring together the different tourism bodies and regulate them in a proper manner. I intend to be parochial in my views, especially in advocating the case for County Donegal. A peninsula-hopping <Col N="456" /> project has been ongoing in the county involving two car ferries, one from Derry to Inishowen and the other from Inishowen to Rathmullen Port. There is also a proposal for a bridge to cross Mulroy Bay, construction of which will, I hope, commence in 2004. Thanks to the Government, one of the ferries is operational and the second ferry will be operative for this season. This is a major development for the county. Traditionally there was little or no tourism in County Donegal because it was too close to the ongoing troubles in Northern Ireland. Many tourists considered Donegal to be part of the Six Counties and it lost out as a result, but today we are more positive in our approach.</P>
      <P>County Donegal is an employment blackspot and has the highest rate of unemployment in the country. Tourism gives the county the potential to overcome this. The ability of people in the county has not been realised. We have more to sell than any other part of the country, such as the Inishowen 100 drive, the Fanad sea drive and the Atlantic drive. In a survey carried out in 1996, Ballymastocker Bay in Portsalon, north Donegal, was voted the second most beautiful beach in the world, but this has hardly been recognised, nor has the fact that the highest cliffs in Europe are in west Donegal.</P>
      <P>Donegal and the Antrim coast have more to sell than any other part of the country and all I want is a bit of help to do so. I would like to see a change of approach although I welcome the Bill. The Bord Fáilte chairman is of the same opinion as myself and feels there should be a cross-Border approach so Donegal can be considered in the same category as Kerry or Clifden. We need incentives for the tourism industry to provide beds.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister or any Member of the House to come to Donegal and I will show them scenery that they have never seen before in Ireland. That invitation is open to everybody. We have scenery that is untapped and undeveloped and which people outside Donegal would die for. I appeal to the Minster to adopt a cross-Border approach because, traditionally, tourists who come here enter the country through Dublin, usually head south and by the time they get anywhere near Donegal, their time is spent. The cross-Border approach would involve liaising with the Northern Ireland authorities to take tours in from Northern Ireland and Britain. Whether they are from Northern Ireland, England, Scotland or Wales does not matter. An all-Ireland approach is necessary and I appeal to the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I make no apology for saying that tourism is extremely important. Agriculture <Col N="457" /> is still the number one industry, but it is difficult to know how long that will last because of the way things are going. I understand tourism is the number two industry.</P>
      <P>I wish to add to the comments made by my colleague from Donegal on the issue of cross-Border involvement. When my party leader, Deputy Kenny, was Minister for Tourism and Trade, he set up a structure which operated on a more or less voluntary basis whereby we advertised and promoted the island of Ireland as a whole. I am glad that the structure has become more permanent under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The issue of promoting tourism on an all-Ireland basis must be followed through by the new authority because we will not get sufficient support in the Border areas without it. In the past, some tourists came to Ireland and travelled from Dublin to Galway and Connemara, and some to Donegal, but the main flow was to the south. If the authority is to be meaningful for the whole country, including the Border region, it must adopt a cross-Border policy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative of bringing tourism and training bodies together and the placing of major emphasis on training. If we do not have properly trained and, I hope, Irish staff, it will give the industry a bad image. In a cross-Border context, most of the youth setting out in their careers go to Northern Ireland for their education, which is welcome.</P>
      <P>North West Tourism has evoked much anger and criticism in my constituency, especially in Monaghan. Some of the people involved with it have pulled out altogether because they do not see its benefits. Deputy Blaney emphasised the quality of the scenery in Donegal. In the context of initiatives concerning Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, it is obvious that more money, expertise and interest is devoted to the areas where the organisations think they will get the best result. That leaves the likes of Cavan and Monaghan behind and this has generated much anger. I hope the new authority will place more emphasis on such areas to make sure there is an even spread.</P>
      <P>Some very important tourism related enterprises have arisen in my constituency, a few of which I will name. The Shannon-Erne waterway has been a huge success. Lough Muckno has tremendous potential and I am glad to see its local golf club will develop an 18 hole golf course in the not too distant future. Castle Leslie received enormous publicity because of a famous wedding recently, which demonstrates the potential that exists there. It is great to see free publicity being given to an area that gets so little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sliabh Beagh centre is a community-built, tourism related centre which encourages cross-Border involvement. Such projects must be encouraged. We have some great hotels, such as the Slieve Russell, the Kilmore, the Nuremore, Glencarn, the Four Seasons, the Hillgrove and Cabra Castle. There is a new hotel where Cavan Crystal was situated in Cavan town. There are <Col N="458" /> also smaller family-run hotels. It is often very difficult for them to survive and get funding. Overall, they have good accommodation available, but in areas such as Cavan-Monaghan, where tourism has not been a huge issue in the past, they still need help. Leader and such programmes are helping to fund them but there is a need for greater luck. Areas on the bottom have the potential but do not have sufficient numbers of tourists at present to justify their receiving grant aid.</P>
    <P>We have other enterprises, such as the museum in Monaghan town, which has a proud record, and there is a newer one in Ballyjamesduff. Other enterprises could be funded and if we do not have development there is little point in promoting them. The Castlesaunderson project will cross many departments. It is for Scouting Ireland and other scouting bodies. It could provide a lot of accommodation and it straddles the Border. If ever there was a truly cross-Border project, it is one. While I welcome the small sum of &euro;90,000 provided by one Ministry in recent times, major funding will be required from the EU and other sources in the coming years up to 2006 if it is to get off the ground. If this is not done, the chance that it will achieve its potential is small.</P>
    <P>The Ulster Canal is another issue. It stretches from the Erne Waterway to Lough Neagh up to the northern coast. It would link all the waterways in Ireland and it is another truly cross-Border project. These are two of the projects which can be justified and undertaken on the basis of probable success. They will encourage people from all political parties North and South to get involved. There is a swimming pool project in Monaghan, but the local authority, of which I am a member, has stated that we need a full indoor leisure complex instead. That could then be used by tourists in wet weather of which we have plenty. The plans are already with Government for both the swimming pool and the more extensive tourist project which could be enjoyed by people for recreation as well as for keeping fit. I encourage the Minister to ensure that grant aid is made available. I understand there is a technicality involved, but I do not want it to be used against us.</P>
    <P>It is said that unless one has 100,000 potential visitors one cannot have a facility of this type. How does one build up visitor numbers? One has to get off the ground somehow and a Border region such as Cavan-Monaghan can liaise with our counterparts in Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh. We do not have the facilities they have and we need to put structures in place. I beg the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to look not simply at the swimming pool project, but at the other project as well. Only 2% of Monaghan's economic activity is in tourism and its income from this source is one of, if not, the lowest in the country. We need development, which is why I emphasise the Ulster Canal, the sports centre and scenic areas like Lough Muckno, because adver<Col N="459" /> tising on its own will not get us the tourists we deserve.</P>
    <P>We have benefited from the availability of low cost flights and direct links with places to which we lost our sons and daughters in the last century. It is great that they can come home at a reasonable and cheap price. When I first went to Birmingham to see my brother the price of the airfare was about £300, whereas we can now fly there for a few euros. While that is beneficial, it will not be meaningful unless we get the infrastructure from airports to the Border region. There has been some progress in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's home town of Carrickmacross, but we need the road to go all the way to Donegal. If the Minister wishes to develop tourism he must be part of a Government that creates an infrastructure of roads, railroads and broadband.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I listened to Deputy Crawford taking us on a tour of the drumlins of Monaghan it struck me that while many areas have things in common, each place has its own requirements. Monaghan and Cavan would not strike one at first glance as being tourist areas, but there are many fine features there which, if marketed properly would prove an advantage. In his speech the Minister said that tourism provides &euro;4 million in foreign earnings and &euro;1.2 million in domestic earning. It is a very important industry to us and one in every 12 jobs is tourism related. He listed competitiveness and quality and service as being vital to the industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in that it seeks to streamline tourism bodies. Trying to establish who is responsible for promoting tourism is very difficult and in Wicklow the former county manager established a county tourism board which has been very effective. However, one has to ask why that was necessary. The traditional céad míle fáilte has been questioned of late and it has been said that it is not as prevalent as it has been in the past. Our increased wealth may, regrettably, have contributed to the rise of a certain arrogance while front-of-house service is provided by non-nationals &ndash; with whom I have no difficulty &ndash; leading to language difficulties which can create the impression of poor service. It is vitally important that Tourism Ireland is still operating since a small territory like ours needs an integrated island policy. The new board mooted in the Bill will be tasked with dealing with the tourists after they get here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourists arriving at Dublin Airport have serious problems getting out of it. I have collected people from the airport several times as I do not live too far away and I have found it very difficult to ascertain how to get on to the M50. A constituent of mine recently travelled half way to Swords before realising they were going the wrong way. It is not that we are short of intellect, it is that the signs cannot be followed. The local authority in Dublin attempted to bring in new signs, but I <Col N="460" /> did not get to see any of them because the Minister for Transport intervened. He was right to do so given what I saw of them in the newspapers. We need to have a standard system of signposting. It is very simple to do.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be overly prescriptive, but while I am on the subject I must ask why we put signs on round poles? We should put them on square or rectangular poles because everywhere in the country signs are being turned around by kids or adults who see no harm in a bit of skulduggery. However, that activity can cause problems, particularly for tourists. We should replace round poles, introduce standard signs, decide if we are using kilometres or miles and correct the information that it is out there. There is nothing more depressing than to see a sign directing one to a town which is ten miles distant and then to drive two miles along only to be told that it is now 14 miles away. We are all familiar with places where that happens.</P>
    <P>I alluded earlier to the céad míle fáilte in terms of which we have regressed. The warmth of the welcome that was there in the past is no longer there to the same extent. Perhaps this is a result of increasing tourism, particularly with home tourists since people have more money to spend on going out. In difficult times the places which provide a warm welcome will be the first to suffer. No matter where one goes, if one gets a nice welcome and experiences politeness and courtesy, one will return.</P>
    <P>I have just come from a meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Food where Dr. Wall is discussing food safety. I relayed the story of my journey back from the Galway races last year during which I stopped to have tea with my kids. I would feel sorry for any member of the public who entered the premises involved, which I will not name here. To pay money for what was served up was nothing short of disgraceful. One was almost ill when leaving. There are many fine restaurants and public houses, but the proliferation of food outlets and the increase in disposable income being spent on eating out has led to the establishment of facilities which leave much to be desired. We have in the region of 300 health officers to cover 38,000 food outlets ranging from the top restaurant to the garage forecourt and it is very difficult to police them. We can only overcome this difficulty if Irish people begin to complain. I include myself in the category of people who talk about their failure to get value for money when they have left the premises. The time to complain is on the premises when it happens because, in fairness to the people providing the service, if they are not told they might not realise they are doing anything wrong.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to my own county of Wicklow and I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is in the Chamber. While I wish the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, all the best with his portfolio, one of the difficulties is that as he comes from a very tourism-based region with <Col N="461" /> many facilities for tourists, he might be inclined to put much of the available largesse within the Kerry county boundary. I would ask him, therefore, to tread carefully and I will be keeping an eye on that.</P>
    <P>County Wicklow is very underdeveloped in respect of tourism. Perhaps for historical reasons, people along the west coast have been much quicker to get into the tourism business than those on the east coast. Wicklow has approximately 5,000 Bord Fáilte registered bed-nights, whereas in Kerry the total is in the region of 17,000, with 12,000 in Killarney alone. Wicklow is on Dublin's doorstep as the first stop-off point for tourists, yet we have less bed-night capacity than Mayo, Donegal or Galway. That is something we will have to develop as a county. I would ask the Minister to dispense with the pre-conceived notion that people in the mid-east region are wealthy and are doing very well. That is not the case because many locations in the mid-east are suffering, relatively speaking. That has been identified in the national spatial strategy which mentioned areas such as north Meath and south west Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Wicklow is currently lumped in with an area which is called midlands-east by Bord Fáilte. I wrote to 20 providers of tourist accommodation as part of a survey, and posed the question, &ldquo;When tourists finish their breakfast and ask &lsquo;where will I go today?', what do you say&rdquo;? None of them said &ldquo;Go to Lanesboro&rdquo; but that is in the same midlands-east area. Wexford, Dublin, Kilkenny &ndash; a very beautiful city &ndash; and Carlow are not in that area. Wicklow is tied in with Longford, Westmeath, north Offaly and Kildare. When it comes to trying to sell Longford and Wicklow as tourist destinations, they are two completely different products. Wicklow should be together with Dublin or, preferably, the south-east.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can have a big input into the provision of tourism facilities. Until quite recently, one could travel from Bray to Carlow &ndash; a 60-mile journey over the Wicklow Gap &ndash; and one would not pass a hotel. Deputy Crawford outlined a number of hotels in County Monaghan but we are very short of them in Wicklow, although one has opened up in Laragh recently.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has reminded me, quite rightly, that there are two hotels there, but one is off the main road while the other is on it. Local authorities must become proactive in providing tourism facilities, given the current shortage. One can have all the beautiful scenery, including the Burren and the Wicklow mountains, but unless visitors have somewhere to sit down for a cup of coffee we will not attract them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the rationalisation of structures at national level provided for under the National Tourism Development Authority Bill 2002. Many speakers have referred to the major departure in December 2000 when Tourism Ireland Limited was established by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourism Board. The new body's remit was the marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourism destination, which was an enormous task. It proved to be very difficult as subsequent events were to demonstrate. It is one of the areas of co-operation which arose from the Good Friday Agreement. Interestingly, while tourism is under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism here, in the North it comes within the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. There are some differences, therefore, between the lead Departments in both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>Tourism Ireland is charged with responsibility for international marketing functions and is also in charge of the Tourism Ireland brand which generated a high level of debate and some disagreement in the early stages. It also deals with marketing outside the island of Ireland, as well as supervising the overseas office network. Strong campaigns have been undertaken in the main markets, particularly in the UK, Germany, France and the United States. Initially, the authority had difficult times due to the foot and mouth scare which, unfortunately, attracted unfavourable publicity all over the world, quite a lot of which was unjustified and unrealistic. Subsequently, the authority's difficulties were exacerbated by the problems suffered by the aviation sector following the events of 11 September 2001. It was a potentially disastrous time for tourism and it is to the new body's credit that it has performed so well in such difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made it clear that the Bill is not about setting new parameters for tourism policy. He pointed out that a comprehensive review of tourism policy is being undertaken and that the body charged with doing so met at the end of last month. The Minister has asked that body to assess the performance and potential of the tourism industry, as well as setting out strategies both for Government-led and industry-led initiatives which will advance tourism. I understand from what the Minister said that an interim report is expected in a couple of months and a final report by the summer. I await that with considerable interest because there is a host of issues that arise peripherally in the context of this Bill, yet are central to the general consideration of tourism policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must acknowledge the progress that has been made since the mid-1980s in the Irish tourism industry. The industry accounts for &euro;4 billion of foreign investment and &euro;1.2 billion in domestic investment. In addition, it accounts for 5% of GNP annually and I was surprised to hear the <Col N="463" /> Minister say that it also accounts for one in 12 jobs in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a new body which will merge Bord Fáilte and CERT. Bord Fáilte has been synonymous with tourism for decades and it has had responsibility for product development, domestic marketing, research, strategic planning and specialist niche products &ndash; an area where Bord Fáilte has been very much to the fore in making tremendous progress. Bord Fáilte has also been responsible for regional marketing in addition to the registration and grading of accommodation, where substantial advances were made some years ago. It also had the job of co-ordinating the regional tourism authority organisations, as well as covering environmental aspects of tourism.</P>
    <P>Following the review in 1994, as part of a policy departure Bord Fáilte concentrated much of its resources and personnel on overseas marketing. Naturally, because of that there was much less emphasis on areas such as product development and the environment. The product development area has received some fillips, particularly from taxation measures, some of which have been very successful. One might argue that it was not as targeted as it might have been for the tourism industry but, nevertheless, it was done with considerable success.</P>
    <P>One of the areas that needs to be addressed urgently by the new body is product development. As previous speakers have pointed out, some areas lack sufficient accommodation and work remains to be done in improving food, drink and entertainment facilities. New visitor facilities are also required, which is a crucial consideration for every region. Counties and smaller geographical areas need to look to their laurels to improve their tourism products by making them user-friendly and attractive.</P>
    <P>The training agency, CERT, was established in 1963 and was charged with providing education, recruitment and training services for the tourism industry. Ten or 15 years ago, CERT was very successful in attracting people into training for the tourism sector. More recently, however, there has been enormous pressure on the labour supply and it has become much more difficult to attract school leavers and retain them in the hospitality industry. Neither has the industry been able to attract the substantial number of adults who are available for work. The task of developing the skills of those currently employed in the tourism industry has been done successfully. There was a concerted attempt to enhance the productivity and performance of those involved and to meet best international practice.</P>
    <P>The competitiveness of the tourism product was a responsibility within the remit of CERT. There is a necessity to face the fact that we have discerning customers and we depend on being able to persuade them to make return visits. This will become a responsibility of the new body.</P>
    <P>General questions to do with yield and regional <Col N="464" /> distribution have featured in some of the contributions to this debate today. The issue of seasonal distribution bedevils the industry and still poses major difficulties. The question of access is central to progress and development in the sector. It is difficult for Irish tourism to maintain a competitive edge. It is also difficult to focus as clearly as we need to on what the customer wants and, equally important, what the customer was led to expect when he or she decided to book a holiday in Ireland. We must examine the quality of the infrastructure which impinges on visiting tourists and the standards which they encounter. Some of what Deputy Timmins mentioned in his contribution would unfortunately be a common experience for people travelling around the country.</P>
    <P>The new authority will streamline the service at national level and it needs to be effective in developing the tourism product and the whole tourism experience. I am interested in sections 8 and 12 of the Bill which deal with the registration and grading of premises. Section 12 provides that the body may continue to contract out these services. This is an area where considerable progress has been made and there has been an improvement in standards as a result. There is also some room for the contractors in this instance to make available to people who need it the kind of service for standards improvement which was previously available from CERT.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for financial aid to be made available to tourism operators. In the past this aid mostly came from EU schemes and they are now likely to be a lot less generous than they were in the past. State input in the form of grants or taxation measures would be a tremendous advantage. Sections 35 and 36 deal with the transfer of staff and staff superannuation. Not all staff have in the past enjoyed the best of deals when it came to superannuation and I am pleased with the manner in which it is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention the resort scheme which was referred to in an earlier contribution. Two areas in my county were included in that scheme. One of the towns, Kilkee, came in for a huge level of criticism. It was interesting to note that at peak periods and even at the new year, it was almost impossible to get either self-catering or hotel accommodation in Kilkee. The creation of the accommodation infrastructure has been a great advantage.</P>

      <P>The Government has approved the creation of the National Tourism Development Authority to promote tourism both from within and outside the State and the development of tourism facilities and services, including the promotion of training, human resource and marketing skills development in the tourism sector. The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide the statutory basis for this new authority. On its establishment, Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT will be dissolved and the functions currently carried out by them will be transferred to the new body. Certain provisions of the Tourist Traffic <Col N="465" /> Acts are also repealed to take account of the provisions of this Bill. This fast-track legislation will allow for the establishment of a new super authority for the tourist industry to replace Bord Fáilte and CERT. This move comes on the back of a poor tourist year, with the industry facing major setbacks from the foot and mouth disease outbreak, 11 September and the poor weather last year.</P>
      <P>While the number of overseas visitors increased by 10.3% in the first quarter of 2002, the second quarter figures showed a fall-off in demand. The tourism industry faces a challenge and I feel strongly it is time to reassess and reform to avail of the potential of the changing marketplace. The job of the new chief executive will be to form a strategy to realise the full potential of tourism within the Irish economy. He will also have to develop and maintain effective relationships with a wide range of stakeholders in the industry, both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte was established in 1955 to promote tourism in Ireland. CERT was set up in 1963 to co-ordinate the education, recruitment and training of personnel for the tourism and catering industry. We have some big events coming up such as the Special Olympics and the Ryder Cup golf tournament. It is vital there is one body marketing the State as a venue for special-interest tourism, and attracting major sporting events. That is why I am so pleased with the decision to have one authority co-ordinating policy.</P>
      <P>Encouraging Irish people to holiday at home should be a priority of the new board. The plan should focus on the growing domestic market, both North and South. People who take short breaks are important, as domestic breaks are no longer than one week.</P>
      <P>Longford is the hidden jewel of the midlands. As a former chairperson of Longford County Council, I am only too aware of the hard work and dedication of those who have focused on promoting tourism in Longford. I congratulate the work that has gone into the development of Dublin Street in Longford and we are now fortunate in having a great choice of restaurants there. No one can underestimate the demands placed on our free time in today's busy environment. Every corner of the country needs to focus on developing a tangible tourism strategy that will attract not only European and foreign visitors but also those from the bigger cities of Ireland. Longford needs to brand itself as the jewel of the midlands, the place where you can go for a weekend break to relax or just to get away from it all. Longford has something for everyone. Longford golf course is an attractive parkland course overlooking the town of Longford and is a good golfing test for players of all abilities. We are very proud of this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county offers angling, hunting and shooting, and is of interest to lovers of literature because of its associations with Oliver Goldsmith, Maria Edgeworth, John Casey and Padraic Colum. Angling is one of the most important visi<Col N="466" /> tor attractions in the county and each year thousands come from abroad to sample our attractions. There are many fishing locations and angling centres to choose from. The Shannon, Lough Ree, the Inny, the Ran River and the Royal Canal are in the south and west of the county and the extensive Lough Gowna network of lakes is in the north. The &ldquo;hot water stretch&rdquo;  in Lanesboro is famous for its specimen fish, coarse fish and top class pike. I thank Deputy Timmins who will send all the people in Brittas Bay over to Lanesboro in the very near future. We look forward to seeing them there. The Deputy will be very welcome. I hope to be out fishing that day when he arrives. With the restoration of the Royal Canal, Longford will be the ideal spot to sit back and relax. I am very hopeful that this new body will sell Longford as the perfect place for short breaks.</P>

      <P>This debate is a great opportunity for everybody to have a word on an industry important to our country. There is huge potential in the tourism industry which has gone through good and bad patches and which has had many plans drawn up for it over the years. We have a lot of questions that need answering in the debate on this Bill. We need to ask where and what investment was made in tourism in the past. Coming from an inland constituency I ask if it was wise to invest in the areas it did.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gogarty spoke earlier about how tourists do not find Dublin attractive. A lot of people would agree with him. I question the wisdom of Bord Fáilte's marketing of Dublin. We should have marketed the strong areas of the country, particularly the inland counties. Deputy Kelly spoke about Longford while I could speak about Tipperary. Other Deputies could speak about Offaly, Kilkenny and other areas that have been underdeveloped in regard to tourism. There is huge potential in the areas of fishing, walking and rural sports. Horse racing, dog racing and festivals are part and parcel of our rural way of life. We have an endless list of sights to visit such as the Rock of Cashel, Blarney, Cahir Castle and Kilkenny Castle. These have not been exploited fully and enough investment has not been put into marketing our inland counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural way of life we have become accustomed to in rural areas is about to change drastically and tourism has a role to play in regard to that change. The Fischler proposals coming before us mean that the people currently employed in rural areas will have to find alternative employment. Tourism could be a huge earner for them if properly supported. Our negotiations in Brussels should go hand in hand with seeking help for tourism for the counties whose agriculture will be hit. There is extraordinary potential for tourism in those inland counties. If this country is to continue to develop the rural communities need back-up and there must be marketing of the inland counties. Our coastal counties have benefited from tourism development. I <Col N="467" /> agree that, no doubt, more needs to be done but the inland counties have been totally neglected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gogarty made a remark earlier in regard to landowners and farmers. As a landowner I resent the attitude that people are warned off from engaging in certain activities on the land. That is not the normal case throughout the country. There may be an odd row but a dispute can occur in any section of the community. It is wrong for someone to come in here and blacken farmers and landowners. We know that in the heart of rural Ireland people are made welcome. Neither I nor my neighbours have ever turned anybody off the land. It is time for people to stand up for the good, traditional landowners of the country. People I know who own land along the banks of the Suir, the Multeen and other rivers have never turned people away but have made them welcome. In this debate on the Bill I emphasise that I have only ever seen a welcome for tourists in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to take part in this debate. I come from a county that depends a lot on tourism. I was born and reared in Westport which has a great mix in regard to tourism and industry. Thousands of people in the town have educated their children through the tourism industry. I remember a time Westport could not get Bord Fáilte, Ireland West Tourism or anybody to promote the town. At the time Bord Fáilte and Ireland West Tourism said that if Westport raised money they would match it pound for pound. The town raised about £30,000 within a few weeks and they had to match it. From that beginning Westport promoted itself.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte should look at providing funding for communities to go and sell their own product. For example, in north Mayo, which is one of the most beautiful places one could go, there is a place called Geesala. It is underdeveloped infrastructurally but has beautiful scenery and beaches. A local man, Gerry Coyle, runs a week long festival there every year with events such as horse racing on the beach, horse jumping and athletics. People who come to the festival are asked how they heard about it. There are two ways most of them heard about it &ndash; either through the local papers or through word of mouth. I do not exaggerate when I say that thousands of people attend that festival, which is a wonderful day out. The only disadvantage is that the horse racing depends on the tides. The festival got no support from Ireland West or Bord Fáilte but people come from America and England year after year to attend it. People book their holidays for that particular week in the middle of August. It is the only week that Erris makes anything from tourism and it is because the festival is promoted locally. My point is that if areas do not do it for themselves it will not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte cannot get everything right. It cannot promote every part of Ireland all over the world. However, it should look at giving areas <Col N="468" /> such as Erris, Westport, parts of Kerry etc. their own money to promote and sell their product abroad. Parts of the market in England and America are untouched. We have only a small percentage of those markets. We should make a major drive in Britain and give information to the Irish groups there to promote tourism. We should also use the regional airports for promotion purposes.</P>
    <P>Why are the Government and local authorities so against proper signage in the country? The lack of signage is the biggest single complaint of tourists, particularly in Dublin city. Recently I had to go to a funeral on the outskirts of Dublin. I had some idea of how to get there but from the time I left the city centre until I got to my destination I never came across one direction sign. There are no signs apart from those for the airport and the national roads. If one goes to Great Britain or America there are big signs to identify where one is. What do we have against telling people where they are?</P>
    <P>The other daft thing on which it is time for Bord Fáilte and the Government to take a stand is the existence of signs that are only in the Irish language. I do not have anything against the language but the signs should be bilingual. It is hard enough for some foreign tourists to understand English but they have little chance of finding somewhere in a Gaeltacht area. It is difficult enough for non-Irish speaking natives.</P>
    <P>How are the figures for incoming tourists calculated? Bord Fáilte or whoever is responsible for the figures should be in the Department of Finance. I would promote those responsible straight away because they are the best I have ever seen for getting figures. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in his last ministry spent his time trying to keep people out of this country &ndash; asylum seekers and refugees. Now that he is the Minister with responsibility for tourism he is delighted to add them into the figures when the statistics for tourism are being calculated. It is wonderful how he does it. He was the Minister for zero tolerance but it is amazing how useful such people are in terms of boosting tourism figures. I compliment the Government and the Department on that. If one goes to England to visit a relative or goes to a funeral abroad, is one regarded as a tourist on one's return? It is great when they justify their jobs but I do not know how they do it.</P>
    <P>Tourism has gone through a difficult time in recent years. I do not blame Bord Fáilte for that, I blame the industry itself. The standards are not as high as they should be and the prices charged are outrageous. The time has come to do something about it. This year was the first time that I went abroad on holidays in 17 years. I loved to go to Kerry and went there every second year for the past 20 years. I like Kerry and I like Irish food and I am not one for the sun. However, since the introduction of the euro it has become apparent that we are not competitive. Other Europeans can see at a glance what meals, drinks and taxis <Col N="469" /> cost in Ireland. We simply are not competitive in regard to accommodation, food or drink.</P>
    <P>What one looks for on holidays are nice accommodation, good food and drink at a reasonable price. In Europe one can buy a bottle of wine for &euro;5 or &euro;6. People should ask what they are being charged for a bottle of wine here rather than get a shock when they see their bill. A recent development in restaurants here is to have a separate charge for vegetables on top of the main course. The fun is over now because the euro has made it plain how uncompetitive we are in comparison with the rest of Europe. While it had its disadvantages in respect to the price increases, it is now useful in regard to comparing the cost of goods and services across Europe. It is not easy to compare value when one goes to Great Britain but when one compares the prices euro for euro one has to ask questions. The time has come for the tourism sector to start giving value for money. Irish people should be complaining if the product is not right. We are inclined to only complain to each other rather than to those to whom we should be complaining &ndash; the hotel or restaurant manager and so on. If we did so we would improve the standards here.</P>
    <P>The lack of public transport in rural Ireland is also a problem for tourism. While there has been some improvement in regard to the train service we need to develop it further in addition to buses and other forms of transport. We also need to simplify the information available to people who are travelling. The prices of all goods and services should be clearly displayed. I am glad that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is taking this matter in hand. There is nothing wrong with seeing a list of prices. I was astounded one night having had a meal in a tax-designated area in Dublin to see an additional tax at the bottom of the bill. That is outrageous. People do not mind paying for what they get, but it is not good enough to see extra costs.</P>
    <P>The Bill is timely in that something had to be done about the marketing of our tourism industry. The days of putting offices in New York and London are gone. We have to get out there and market our product. We need to market golf and horseracing, football and also places of pilgrimage such as Knock. We should be selling Knock in the same way that Lourdes is promoted. We need to bring local communities with us. I do not expect Bord Fáilte to do everything but it does need to integrate local communities into the scheme of things. It should not be a case of them and us. The best people to sell the product are those involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government and the Minister do something about signage once and for all. I feel strongly about it and have had many complaints about it over the years. The Minister for Transport is probably the best Minister I have ever seen for press releases and statements. The Government is very keen to bring in rules and regulations about everything. It would be far better if members of the Government travelled with <Col N="470" /> Aer Lingus and Ryanair, in the same way that Tony Blair does, rather than using the Government jet. They would know then what the ordinary punter has to deal with. I challenge the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Transport to drive their own cars out of Dublin Airport in whatever direction they choose. The car parks are now miles away from the airport and people are left in no man's land.</P>
    <P>Tourists coming to the west of Ireland complain that it takes them a day to get out of Dublin. It does not take a day to see Dublin but a day to get out of the city. I do not know why we cannot improve signage. The time has come to do something about it.</P>
    <P>My town of Westport has promoted itself and is an example to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>For many years tourism in Ireland was kept alive by people who returned from England and America to visit their relatives. There are fewer and fewer elderly relatives left in Ireland and the people who used visit us now go abroad on holidays. We must begin to compete and to market. We must present a product at a reasonable price and give people value for money. Some of the prices charged in this country are outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the agreement of the House I would like to share my time with Deputy Michael Finneran.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I welcome the Bill, which provides for the amalgamation of Bord Fáilte and CERT into the new body. This amalgamation will ensure a new impetus in tourism.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry is a strong one. One in 12 people working in the Irish economy are now working in the industry. It is a huge industry throughout the country although it has particularly flourished for a number of years in some spots, such as Mayo or Kerry.</P>
      <P>However, I draw the attention of the House to inland areas, particularly to my area of Duhallow, in north west Cork. It has no major tradition of tourism although there are many sites which are attractive and should be made known to tourists who want to see the hidden Ireland. The local Leader groups, IRD Duhallow and other organisations have done much work to ensure the development of a vibrant tourism industry. Over the years we have developed the Millstreet Country Park, which is a fine facility in Millstreet, and fantastic work has been done on the Glen River and other rivers around the Kilcorney and Banteer area. Much remains to be done to ensure that we can attract people who are coming to this country to such settings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major difficulties in attracting tourists to such inland areas is the small number of visitor beds available. Accommodation is available in the high density tourism areas but we must encourage people to provide accommodation if we are serious about attracting them to inland areas. If we are to encourage people to provide hostel or similar low-cost accommodation we <Col N="471" /> must provide a tax break or some similar incentive. Many small towns and villages hold traditional weekend festivals. Such a festival flourishes in my home village of Kishkeam, where we started the Maurice O'Keeffe weekend last Easter. The weekend was a resounding success but we had to find accommodation for visitors 25 miles away from the village and bring them by bus to the events in Kishkeam.</P>
    <P>CERT and Bord Fáilte will become the National Tourism Development Authority. For many years Bord Fáilte has been seen as the major drive for tourism and for encouraging people to visit Ireland. If any national schoolchild is doing a project on tourism it is to Bord Fáilte he will go for information. CERT has also played a major part in training people for the catering industry. Because of the many non-nationals who have come to Ireland to work in this industry some Irish people feel the catering industry is no longer for them. Through agencies such as CERT we must encourage more people to enter the catering industry.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the euro makes it very clear if we are pricing ourselves out of the market. Many northern Europeans have been saying recently that Ireland has become a very expensive holiday destination. Some of our own people who have gone on foreign holidays say it is cheaper for them to spend two weeks abroad than to spend the same two weeks in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If tourism is to flourish we must develop the recreation side of the industry. We must provide the best available sporting facilities for visitors. These would include facilities for golf, rugby, soccer and tennis as well as the facilities provided by the GAA. Whether one speaks of the All-Ireland final, the Duhallow final or any other, it is always a pleasure for people to come home to see matches. We must provide facilities such as gymnasiums so that when people come on holiday they find these facilities on hand.</P>
    <P>The Special Olympics will be a major attraction this summer. This will be our first time to host this event. I hope every sector of the tourism industry, whether in the host towns or at the national events, will give céad míle fáilte to those who travel to Ireland for the games so that they go home saying Ireland is a wonderful place to visit and that they received an outstanding welcome. This would send a great signal. It is a great honour for us to host the Special Olympics but we must ensure that our visitors take away wonderful memories of Ireland because this will benefit us.</P>
    <P>Irish tourism has improved in the past ten or 12 years. We have created an industry which generates more than &euro;4 billion in foreign earnings and about &euro;1.2 billion from the domestic market. This accounts for 5% of our gross national product.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border co-operation has become even more important since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. Cross-Border bodies have gelled together in selling Ireland as a whole. I hope the <Col N="472" /> new tourism authority will continue that good work.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I congratulate the Minister for bringing the Bill before us and I commend it to the House. I hope the new authority will continue to generate a successful tourism industry for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on bringing it forward. It proposes to merge two bodies, Bord Fáilte and CERT Limited under the one authority. This will allow for promotion and training under the one authority. There are other areas under the Tourist Traffic Acts that have been taken into consideration also.</P>
      <P>The whole area of tourism is a vitally important part of the economy. It has a greater emphasis in some areas than others but it impinges on practically every area in one way or another.</P>
      <P>I will make a number of points regarding the tourism industry and how it should be addressed in some areas. If we look at the areas of least activity we have to focus on the midlands area. Some of the coastal areas are quite developed and are the areas to which people are attracted. The midlands region has not been advertised or promoted to the extent that it should have been and, perhaps, it has not been developed.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to see in the Finance Bill a provision for the return of capital allowances for the provision of hotels. That may not be an important matter for the east coast or for some areas of the west coast but certainly it is important for the midlands region and the BMW region where there is still a deficit as regards the provision of hotel, leisure and conference facilities. To remove that capital allowance carrot would have killed off any opportunity for further facilities. Bord Fáilte should address the issue of beds generally. That part is being dealt with under the finance legislation. Under its own criteria, Bord Fáilte is reluctant to support or grant-aid the provision of beds in bed and breakfasts or guest houses. It should revisit this area. Speaking from the midlands area, there is a real shortage of beds. For people who come to holiday on the river Shannon and on the river Suck, both of which border my constituency, the absence of an adequate number of beds is a disadvantage to us. This matter has been brought to my attention by several people who promote a tourism outlet in equestrian or fishing competitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter which is outside the Minister's brief but is a tourism matter is the provision of pump-out facilities on the river Shannon or river Suck. At present such provision is limited. Natural amenities and natural watercourses are being destroyed due to our failure to put in place the necessary small sewerage schemes along the river and to have put in place pump out facilities alongside them. Hundreds of boats travel the rivers, many of which do not have holding tanks not to mention the use of pump out facilities. It is a cry<Col N="473" /> ing shame that is allowed to continue. While this matter is not the responsibility of the Minister it is a matter that needs to be dealt with under a tourism heading. Perhaps other Departments would take note and follow up on it.</P>
    <P>We should be more careful as regards the use of the main channel, say the Shannon, as an outfall for all industry and particularly the main industry, Bord na Móna, which over the years has drained more than 50,000 or 60,000 acres of bog into the river Shannon without any maintenance being carried out on the river. This is our great natural amenity and one of the finest rivers in Europe. I am extremely annoyed at the lack of maintenance and the opportunity presented to Bord na Móna. While it is a fine employer it has no right to destroy this fine amenity. Controls should be put in place and it should have to answer a cause and put in the necessary silt ponds.</P>
    <P>As regards tourism in the county, there are several projects in my constituency awaiting funding. There is very little tourism facility in County Roscommon and in that region. Certainly the development of Lough Key Forest Park and the proposals for the aquatic centre for Lough Ree are not exclusive to my constituency or to Roscommon. They are proposals for the midlands which would have far-reaching opportunities for visitors.</P>
    <P>Fishing is the main outlet in the tributaries of the river Shannon. I was disappointed to learn in recent weeks that Shannon fisheries board decided to impose permits on three tributaries of the river Shannon. If one wishes to coarse fish on the rivers Suck, Inny or the Brosna one has to pay &euro;35. I come from a farming background and all my life our lands and those of my neighbours have been used by tourists and locals to walk to and fish at the river. If I or one of my family wishes to go there we must have a permit costing &euro;35. If found not to have such a permit we can be fined &euro;50. It is extraordinary that the main channel of the river and rivers all over Ireland do not require a permit for coarse fishing while for these few rivers in the west, which would take the few tourists we get, there is a permit imposition. This will kill off angling tourism in the area. They do no harm, they put all the fish back into the river, they cause no damage to fences or land and people are pleased to have them. They come and stay in the bed and breakfasts and hotels and spend money locally.</P>
    <P>The question of prices is becoming an issue particularly in the food and drink areas. Many people say they consider Ireland a &ldquo;pricey&rdquo; place, that it is expensive to dine out, that the price of drink has gone over the top. In particular they point out that once it comes to 11 p.m. one can put whatever one wishes on the price of a pint of beer. This is a disadvantage to tourism. While there are no controls some people are killing the goose that laid the golden egg in this matter.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that many of our hotels serve foreign beef only. This is a <Col N="474" /> disgrace. We are supposed to have the finest beef in the world. Our stock are fed on green pasture. I am told we are importing cuts from South America which are being sold on the tables of our finest hotels, restaurants and guest houses. That is a crying shame. There is little patriotism among those involved. When people visit this country, they expect to get wholesome Irish meat about which we talk so much.</P>
    <P>Road signs were mentioned earlier. Most people who come to Ireland depend on maps rather than signs. I travelled from Roscommon to Galway, although not on the main thoroughfare, and found on two occasions that the sign for the town to which I was travelling was pointing in the opposite direction. Obviously, I knew the way but it would appear that local authorities are investing little in the provision of road signs. That is unfortunate. Road signs should be part and parcel of our facilities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this fine legislation. I compliment the Minister and wish him well in his new ministry. I have no doubt he will do a good job as he comes from an area of the country steeped in tourism and which holds the gold card as regards tourism. Although we promote tourism throughout the world, we should home in on our nearest neighbour with a population of more than 50 million. Support for tourism promotion in this market is limited and it is one on which we should concentrate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Perry.</P>
      <P>I broadly welcome the terms of this Bill and understand the reasoning behind it. The tourism industry is vital to our economy and we need to do everything we can to develop and sustain it. The Minister and my party colleague, Deputy Deenihan, outlined the facts and figures highlighting the importance of the industry to this country.</P>
      <P>We must accept the tourism industry is on the point of major change. The tourism product internationally is changing. We now face increased competition and we are subject to greater external forces. In some instances, access to competitor markets is cheaper than it is to this country. There is also a lack of tourism operational programmes in Ireland. Deputy Finneran alluded to the fact that we seem to have lost our competitiveness and, to some extent, we have lost our edge in tourism. The Minister has spoken about prices and the cost of the tourism product in Ireland. We, as politicians, and the tourism industry must face up to that. If we want the industry to improve and grow, we must get that competitive edge back, especially in terms of pricing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another difficulty for our tourism product is that we have remained quite traditional in what we offer. We have not been as innovative as regards our tourism product as we could be and as other countries have been. The tourism image has not changed all that much. The promotion of <Col N="475" /> tourism in some ways through Bord Fáilte campaigns has been innovative, but much more could be offered as regards the product.</P>
    <P>I read a paper on this industry by Frank Roche of UCD which he delivered at a CERT conference last year. The main point he made was that if we want to survive, grow, be sustainable and be profitable, thereby enabling the industry to eventually stand alone, we must reposition ourselves. That is an important point. There are opportunities available but to reposition ourselves and to make the best of it, we must make changes. One of the changes he proposed, with which I agree, is that businesses in local areas must link their products.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, we have a fantastic tourism product in Clonmacnoise, a Dúchas heritage site. When one looks at visitor numbers to Clonmacnoise, one could say they are tourists arriving in County Offaly but they are only going to Clonmacnoise and that is part of the problem we face. County Offaly is in the midlands and half way between Dublin and Galway or Dublin and Shannon. The difficulty being experienced by our county is that people are being bussed in and bussed out and the tourists are not remaining in the county. Tourists get off the aeroplane at Shannon, drive to Clonmacnoise and proceed to Galway, Dublin or elsewhere. There are other fantastic tourism products in the area &ndash; for example, Birr Castle &ndash; to which we should be able to attract visitors. There is a huge amount of marketing of those tourism products to try to attract people to visit other sites in the area but it is not always that successful.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with Roscrea Castle, which is also a Dúchas heritage site, and I worked in Portumna Castle in the past but the visitor figures for those sites are far less than those for Clonmacnoise and yet all sites are within a small radius of each other. It comes down to how we offer our product. It could be argued that someone visiting one castle would be interested in seeing another one but we are not creating enough links with businesses locally suggesting routes which visitors could take. That is what we need to do.</P>
    <P>We must integrate our products. That will require a change in thinking and in infrastructure. Some of these heritage sites only accept literature from other heritage sites within the same organisation, as is the case with Dúchas. That is a mistake. Obviously, sites have to make money to stay in business but we must ensure they promote other tourism products in the same region. People should not adopt a selfish attitude and think only about their business, disregarding what is happening elsewhere as irrelevant. We must try to link sites to a greater extent than is being done at present.</P>
    <P>The industry faces many problems. In Laoighis-Offaly, there are two tourism organisations, Shannon Development and the Midland Regional Authority. Clonmacnoise falls within the remit of one while Birr Castle falls into that of the other. <Col N="476" /> Those two separate organisations are trying to promote two areas which are really one and it is causing many problems. That is something we need to address if we want to maximise our potential.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns about the Bill. Section 8 states that the primary function of the authority will be to encourage, promote and support the development of tourist traffic within and to the State. Being familiar with the workings of CERT, I am concerned that the education portfolio of CERT will not be diminished by the merging of CERT and Bord Fáilte. Some of the courses offered in schools and to train people to return to the jobs markets are important and it is vital to the development of the industry that those courses remain available. CERT has been quite innovative in what it has provided. It has provided courses at transition year level and two year courses as part of the leaving certificate applied programme. I am anxious that function is not lost or diminished in this merger since the potential may be there for that happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably read the article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>on festival supports, the rising cost of insurance and the difficulties festivals are facing. Irish festivals are a unique tourism product. Nearly every town and village has a festival in some shape or form. Figures given in respect of the Ballinasloe Fair show that 12% to 15% of the cost of that fair is spent on insurance. I was involved in Birr Vintage Week and we spent a similar percentage on insurance. That money is raised through small contributions of &euro;75 or maybe &euro;100 or &euro;200. These festivals are finding it difficult to survive. If these festivals and fairs are cancelled due to insurance problems, we will lose an extra activity in the marketplace. This is very likely to happen if we do not try to do something about the matter.</P>
    <P>Westport House and Birr Castle had great difficulty last autumn getting insurance. When they managed to get an offer of insurance, the cost had risen considerably, which makes it very difficult for private operators to survive or make a profit. Despite the public perception, these businesses are not making profits, they are just ticking over and in many instances have quite large overdrafts. This is something which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points raised by other colleagues, including Deputy Ring, in regard to signage. If we do not make areas more accessible, we will leave ourselves open to a loss of industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the development of our canals and inland waterways, even though it does not come under the Minister's remit. There is great potential in this area in my constituency if properly developed. If we do not develop further the fishing industry which already exists in Shannonbridge, by providing marinas and banks from where people can fish, we will lose that potential in the marketplace. There are three swimming pools in County Offaly, and these form part of what people want when they go on holidays to a town. Funding for the area has been cut this year. <Col N="477" /> If we do not provide support to people in the private sector who operate these facilities, we will be offering less to potential tourists. I would like some of these points to be taken on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate. CERT has served this country very well since its formation in 1963. The staff trained by CERT have done outstanding work. The formation of the National Tourism Development Authority to promote and develop tourism facilities and services is very important. The promotion of tourism and the success of CERT in providing a céad míle fáilte has done a lot for tourism in the past.</P>
      <P>The great difficulty for the tourism industry in the future will be the retention of staff. Recently a huge number of work permits have been granted. If one were to study the number of work permits issued in the past two years, one would find that a high proportion of them were issued to chefs and other specialised staff. I know from speaking with people in the trade that there is a huge problem trying to retain staff. There is also a problem in regard to high expectations and salaries. The stacked up costs involved in running tourism outlets such as restaurants or hotels are huge. A high value added tax is incorporated into the prices and staff must work unsociable hours, including weekends. The high cost of employing chefs is a huge difficulty for a number of people in the trade.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of what has been happening in the Minister's constituency in the past year. However, what is needed for the promotion of tourism is that regional tourism offices should create new attractions and new hubs. Most tourists visit six or eight destinations. We must develop the island of Ireland as a tourism destination, which would result in repeat business. If people come to a small economy based country, travel around the Ring of Kerry, visit Clonmacnoise and kiss the Blarney Stone, the tendency is not to go back. It is important to develop repeat business, which is the most profitable business of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have failed in creating new destinations. Deputy Enright referred to promoting festivals during the summer. This is a generic tourism market which is very easy to grow. We must tap into community resources by involving the Leader partnership, local county councils and the critical mass of people to promote the county tourism plan. Sometimes a lot of money is spent in formulating plans but very little happens. As someone who comes from a Border county, I believe a great deal of work can be done in relation to the promotion of cross-Border tourism. I was very disappointed recently that the money voted for in the Estimate for INTERREG and cross-Border funding did not get approval from Europe. I was very surprised because a huge amount of money drawn down under the Department of Finance Estimate was not spent. The all-Ireland tourism body promotes Ireland as a tourism destination to people who come to Dublin, <Col N="478" /> Belfast or the Border counties. We should promote Northern Ireland tourism to people from southern Ireland who have not gone on holiday to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are talking about promoting Ireland in North America but our biggest tourism market is the European market, particularly the UK market. The low cost airlines are very important, therefore we should focus on the UK market. I am very disappointed that Ryanair will not set up a hub in Shannon or the west to bring people to the west coast. There is a possibility of a second terminal in Dublin. There are huge facilities at Shannon Airport or Knock Airport which could easily accommodate a low fare airline like Ryanair. I am disappointed in regard to the development of regional airports which is crucial to bringing people into the regions.</P>
    <P>The new body will help to market Ireland. It will provide competent staff to deal with people coming to Ireland. We have lost much of the céad míle fáilte element. The perception of parents of the trade is very different nowadays. The tourism industry is seen as just a summer job. CERT should market the industry in the schools through career guidance teachers. Parents think it is fine for their sons or daughters to work in a pub or restaurant at weekends but, unfortunately, they do not see the industry as a very worthwhile career. People do not want to work in the hotel industry, including medium-sized hotels or small restaurants, while they will work in five star hotel chains. There are good examples of people in this country who have been very successful. They have chains of hotels in the United States and the UK. These people have been Ireland's greatest ambassadors and have done outstanding work.</P>
    <P>I compliment all those hoteliers who have taken huge risks. Running a business today needs a great level of investment on which there is not always a good return. As Deputy Enright said, high insurance costs are a big problem. The cost of public liability is huge. People see the possibility of making an insurance claim as the closest thing to winning the lotto. They feel they are guaranteed money if they have a simple slip or fall. Some people have had to install CCTV systems to verify the truth of claims. Tourism is now Ireland's greatest industry. We need to continue to promote holidays on this island and the islands off its coast. Many people spend a great deal of money to leave this country to go on holidays each year. The fact that the Irish market is quiet is borne out by newspaper advertisements for three midweek nights in a hotel for &euro;100. There is great pressure to fill accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the purpose of this Bill is to amalgamate Bord Fáilte and CERT. It is important that the role of CERT, which will be modified as a result of this Bill, is supported, perhaps by acknowledging that qualifications acquired through CERT are as worthy of recognition as those acquired through institutes of technology. Those who are trained within the industry, perhaps to be a bartender or a head <Col N="479" /> waitress, should be able to communicate with customers. Ireland's greatest asset is the friendliness of its people, but I have heard from a number of sources that people in the service industries often seem tired and do not seem to have a high level of dedication. This is not always the case, especially among those who are pursuing their jobs as a long-term career.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a tranche of funds to spend creating new destinations in the BMW region, which includes County Sligo. We have to ensure that there are new and attractive destinations, such as the Border region, for tourists coming to this country. I appreciate that we may be reinventing the wheel to an extent, but we have to market new destinations so that people returning to Ireland will be able to go to new places. An example of such a destination in the north-west is the Carrowkeel megalithic tomb in County Sligo, which is comparable to Newgrange. It has not been marketed, unfortunately. There is an onus on the Minister and Bord Fáilte, not only to come up with new marketing strategies for this country, but to come up with new destinations as part of the plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share time with Deputy O'Connor, with the agreement of the House.</P>
      <P>I am glad to speak about this Bill. I welcome the fact that, probably for the first time, it combines central elements of our tourism industry by linking training with the industry to ensure we can maintain high standards. I had the privilege of spending six years as the chairperson of the Dublin College of Catering on Cathal Brugha Street, which is now part of Dublin Institute of Technology. The college trained people at different levels for the service and catering industries and for hotel management. The students of the college were given the required skills in the various areas so they could work to a high standard. Similarly, this Bill is directly linking CERT, as the training authority, with Bord Fáilte, as the tourism authority. The production of this Bill is a far-seeing development. I am glad to speak on this Bill as someone who grew up in a town that never saw a tourist and who now represents a constituency that needs to see more tourists. The promotion of tourism should be central not only to Government policy but to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried when I see the results of surveys of visitors, such as one produced last autumn, indicating that tourists find that prices, such as taxi fares, are too expensive. Some people said that prices were too dear to an unacceptable extent. Deputy Perry was right to speak about return visitors and we can be sure that people who feel that prices are too high will not return. It is not enough to get people to come once only. Visitors from the US, who returned because of family traditions, will not continue to return when the link is broken. We need to ensure that we <Col N="480" /> promote Ireland as a value for money centre. We can do nothing about other matters, however &ndash; 25% of people said that the weather was a disadvantage. It is likely that 100% of Irish people think that the weather here is a disadvantage, but it does not stop us from living here. We have to overcome the issues we have mentioned through high standards, good marketing and integrated services. Visitors should be able to arrange transport and accommodation easily.</P>
    <P>It is important that we promote Ireland as a holiday destination in the home market. According to a report in today's <i>Irish Examiner,</i>&ldquo;the number of passports being issued has almost trebled in the last 10 years, from 203,000 in 1992 to 530,000 last year&rdquo;. It is obvious that those applying for passports are doing so with the intention of leaving the country. While I welcome the fact that we can go abroad, people are probably spending more of their holiday time abroad than they are in Ireland. It is often said that the price of a week in an hotel in Ireland during the summer is about the same as that for a fortnight at a foreign resort. We have to compete against such problems. Our review of the tourism industry should include a review of the weekend break market and facilities for families and senior citizens. I know that huge developments have been made in the senior citizens market, particularly at off-peak times when there are great opportunities. As long as the cost of a domestic holiday remains prohibitive, people will take the opportunity to go abroad.</P>
    <P>I recently bought a return ticket to Paris with Aer Lingus for &euro;70 &ndash; I have not gone yet but it will be wonderful. It cost me &euro;120 return to fly to Kerry Airport some time ago and I had a wonderful time there too. It is obvious which choice one would make, however, if one were faced with such a choice on a regular basis. It is a good example of the competition in the tourism sector. The expansion of Bord Fáilte's website, which is quite a good website with links to consumer sites etc., is a good example of the type of development that needs to be used much more radically to attract tourists. The new tourism authority will facilitate such development and promotion.</P>
    <P>I commend the initiative of organisations in the tourism industry such as the Irish Hotel and Catering Institute and the Irish Hotels Federation. Such groups ensure that there is constant training and upgrading among their members. When I attended an IHCI function recently, during which presentations were made for the previous year, I noted that the focus of the institute's training during the previous 12 months, despite all the great advances that have been made in technology and marketing, was in basic areas such as hygiene standards. I commend the institute for its efforts, as it is important that the industry does not lose sight of its priorities.</P>
    <P>Despite the international situation, Ministers and Ministers of State will travel abroad for St. Patrick's Day in about a month's time. We are often criticised for such trips, as people believe <Col N="481" /> they are no more than junkets, but they represent one of the State's key opportunities to promote Ireland as a tourist destination. Attempts to attract investment and tourism will be central to our brief wherever we go in the world. Such events should be seen in a positive light as they can have beneficial effects on the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I have the privilege and pleasure of representing the beautiful constituency of Dún Laoghaire, an area that has a lot to offer both the Irish and the foreign tourist. It is the main leisure boating centre in Dublin; the magnificent new marina can take 450 yachts, all watersports are catered for and it is a beautiful area. There is a new ferry terminal and when passengers drive off the ferry the first thing they see is a large sign that tells them to go right for Dublin and left for Wicklow. There is nothing to advise people to stay in the beautiful environs in which they have just arrived.</P>
    <P>That is the type of thing that makes me question the type of promotion undertaken for areas outside the mainstream, though perhaps in a different way to Deputies Enright and Perry. Of course, Dublin as our capital city is a wonderful place to visit as is Wicklow, the garden county; but so too is Dún Laoghaire. The absence of real marketing with regard to Dún Laoghaire forced it to set up its own tourism marketing company. While some might say that is a good idea, these things should be closely linked to Bord Fáilte, and now the National Tourism Development Authority, so that there can be an integrated approach and people are welcomed and invited to spend more time wherever they land and wherever they want to be.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire is an area with top class hotels and restaurants; it is a completely renovated and rejuvenated town and area, yet the only tourist presence is an office in the ferry terminal which only opens when the boat comes in and will barely get people a bed and breakfast. This is a real problem for an area such as Dún Laoghaire and that is why businesses have come together. It is good that they have come together and that they have linked to promote the town, which has made strong links with our neighbours in Holyhead. The challenge of that is welcomed but there needs to be greater co-operation between the various bodies in promoting all areas.</P>
    <P>One of the things I question is the losing of the name &ldquo;Bord Fáilte&rdquo;, which is recognised around the world. We are over the argument about losing the shamrock as an emblem but it is a pity to see this name lost, not only for itself but also because it is as Gaeilge. Is trua go bhfuilimid ag cailliúnt ainm cosúil le &ldquo;Bord Fáilte&rdquo;. Tuigeann gach duine ar fud an domhain an focal &ldquo;fáilte&rdquo; agus muna dtuigeann mínítear dóibh é agus tuigeann siad ansin. Ba bhreá liom dá mbeadh ainm Gaelach le feiceáil in úsáid thart ar an tír.</P>
    <P>Our language and culture should always remain elements that can attract other people. If visitors can be offered good value and good ser<Col N="482" /> vice in an Ireland that is attractive to them, and that we sell them, they will return. That is a challenge for us, particularly at an unsettled time internationally. However, with the new development authority and the links established between the different bodies, we can move forward in a spirit of co-operation while, at the same time, the Minister is reviewing the area and increasing investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach for affording me the opportunity to speak in this debate. With my local authority background, I can tell her that a junket is a trip that one did not get because that is what people tend to pick on.</P>
      <P>I was very impressed by what the Minister said about Dún Laoghaire. I was reluctant to talk about Tallaght because I was interested in the point made by Deputy Perry about the need to look at new markets. I live in Tallaght, an area which does not roll off the tongues of tourists although it sees thousands of visitors every day. In some cases, they are visiting The Square but Tallaght is now the third largest population centre in the State and needs new jobs all the time. Those of us who represent the area and constituency, and have an interest in the south county area, have made the point for some time that there is huge potential in places like Tallaght and that this could be duplicated around the country.</P>
      <P>Thousands of people are attracted to my town. The Square, which opened on 23 October 1990, has since then attracted millions of people, including from Dún Laoghaire and all over the country. It is a competitive market but the people continue to come. If one looks around my area, there are several places where visitors come to including the National Basketball Centre which is situated in Tallaght. I do not want to talk about Tallaght Hospital as a tourist attraction as that would not be totally accurate but many people from the country come to it and access other services and facilities. Many people come to Tallaght and pass through to Blessington.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry's point is good and worth stressing. At a time when the market is under pressure, there is a need to be innovative and to look at ways of attracting new visitors. There are lots of ways to do that and there is huge potential in that regard in my town of Tallaght. I hope we can do that and that all our energies would go into it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, and thank him for the work he is doing. I congratulate the Minister on the legislation and take this opportunity to express my support for the National Tourism Development Authority Bill. I especially congratulate the Minister on the speed with which the legislation has reached this stage. He will have noted the positive support of the Members of this House and of the Seanad, who all wished the authority well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" />As with other colleagues, I acknowledge the contribution of Bord Fáilte and CERT to tourism in this country. Both organisations can be proud that they have contributed in no small measure to the success of the tourism industry and to the prosperity and jobs that have resulted from their actions and support over the years. The need for the new authority is as a result of the changes which the industry needs to stabilise and develop. The merger of Bord Fáilte and CERT will provide a one-stop shop which will be marketing led and provide training to meet the market requirements. I urge the authority to be proactive and strategic in its thinking and, where traditional services do not meet the needs of today's customers, spell it out and offer a blueprint for the future.</P>
    <P>In previous speeches in this House, I have mentioned the new buzz term, value for money. I hope that this authority can start off with that doctrine as one of its priority goals. The authority should be both lean and mean and it should be remembered it is taxpayers' money it is spending. When the new authority becomes operational, it will need to let the tourism industry know that its role is to support and develop the industry for the overall benefit of the industry and the nation as a whole. It will not be there to act as a substitute player which allows members of the industry to renege on their responsibilities to sell and market themselves. One has only to pick up a daily newspaper to see successful companies proactively marketing their hotels and I salute them.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from Senator Fergal Quinn's contribution in the Seanad while reminding us of his family's involvement in tourism, as it is relevant:</P>
    <P>We did not make the mistake of thinking that the world owed us a living because we had got it right once. We did not look for subsidies or tax breaks to cushion an inevitable decline in business or for grants to transform one kind of holiday formula into another. We faced up to facts and we acted accordingly.</P>
    <P>That statement spells out the basics of real success &ndash; change is necessary and our response should be to deal with it, not to wish that it will go away. As a country, all too often we turn first to Government to act as the solution when on many occasions it would better for the industry to take stock first. I do not intend to repeat the statistics associated with our tourism sector as many of my colleagues have done so as this Bill passed through the Houses, and I have been impressed by some of the fine contributions today. We know that the past two years have been difficult and that the future is uncertain. Perhaps now is the time for a call to all of our constituents to make a determined effort to take part of their holidays at home for the next two years. As a form of encouragement, the industry should respond with prices and facilities</P>
    <P>With regard to the quality of the visitor's experience, I congratulate Dúchas on the great <Col N="484" /> work it does in constituencies represented by many of my colleagues. I also applaud the work of the Office of Public Works on all our major buildings. Perhaps the list of the heritage sites still to be worked on should become part of a five year schedule, with local and regional tourism interests aware of their completion and with an agreed strategic tourism approach for the area in question involving accommodation, transport and marketing.</P>
    <P>The success of the authority will have an important impact on my constituency. As I go about my business on a daily basis in Tallaght, Greenhills, Firhouse and Templogue I am increasingly aware of how my constituents' incomes are dependent on the tourism trade. As in other areas, large numbers of my constituents work directly in the hotel trade while others work in the hospitality sector. A large number are taxi and coach operators. Their future, and the improved standard of living we all have, will be greatly influenced by the work of this new authority, as will the creation of jobs for their children. For this reason alone we should support and encourage this development. I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>

      <P>The area in Mayo from where I come is the most economically deprived in the country. In view of this we need whatever can be done to improve matters. On the face of it, tourism is a very important industry for the area but the terrible state of the roads makes travel a hazard. As a consequence, the season is very short. New tourism product is, therefore, required.</P>
      <P>Although many activities are ongoing in my area, I am angered at what is happening. For example, one of the hotels in my village, once a wonderful Great Southern hotel which employed 100 people, is a wreck. The bats are flying through it. The village was eligible for the seaside resorts scheme and applications for planning permission were submitted to the relevant authorities. However, following an appeal by An Taisce to An Bord Pleanála, granting of permission was delayed with the result that when it was finally granted the scheme had been abolished. As a result, the hotel is lying vacant and there are no further schemes to facilitate its development, which is a sad state of affairs. A number of other hotels in my area will close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters are exacerbated by rising insurance costs and many operators in the area may not be able to continue in business. I am involved in two local community festivals where insurance cover has increased by 50% this year. I cannot see how they can continue. The State must become involved in regulating the insurance industry to <Col N="485" /> ensure adequate cover can be provided, not only in respect of tourism products but also for young people who face great difficulties over the cost of motor insurance. They must often pay &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 for first-time insurance, even where they have never had accidents. Young people should only be penalised after they have had an accident and not before.</P>
    <P>Our main problem is a lack of tourism product and a short season. We need all-weather facilities. I was involved in reviving the use of the yawl, a traditional sailing boat indigenous to our area. It has undergone a complete revival. On behalf of our community I made an application for the construction of an all-weather centre. Deloitte &amp; Touche reported that although tourists were visiting the area they were not staying. Weather conditions require us to have an all-weather facility and my application was one way to proceed. Although the operational tourism programme under the national development plan promised much in this regard, the application was doomed from the outset because applications were sought a year late and there was then a six to eight week rush to have them submitted. To date they have not even been considered. I wonder why there was such an indecent hurry. I do not wish to be cynical in pointing out that it happened just before the last general election. To date we still do not have the facilities we need in Achill Island and hotels continue to close.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in feasibility studies of non-profit making activities, such as bed and breakfast operations, that would help local people attract and keep visitors in the area. The idea was to show visitors how the yawl was built and so on. It was a wonderful product but the resources were not available to see it through. How can people proceed in the absence of resources to develop communications, roads and a local airport?</P>
    <P>The initiative on the yawl sailing boat was part of a cluster of other products in the county that would have interlinked. As a result many other localities are at a loss from the failure to proceed with the initiative. It is irrelevant that many others could not make applications, because they would not have been considered. I ask the Minister to look at this.</P>
    <P>I am wary of so-called new structures that turn out to be the same constructs only with a new image. The Minister referred to the future, which is good because I am an optimist. Nevertheless, I am unsure what this legislation will do for the existing situation.</P>
    <P>There are 40 hotels in County Mayo and 80 hotels in County Galway, yet as far as I am aware, only 74 applications from the west have been submitted for funding from the operational programme for tourism. Hotels and bed and breakfasts are closing down at a time when there is a lack of product, such as all-weather facilities. There is something wrong here. The programme appears to be a cynical exercise. I ask the Mini<Col N="486" /> ster to provide a county by county breakdown of all applications submitted under it.</P>
    <P>We will soon have to compete with the applicant countries from eastern Europe. Being an island we have access difficulties whereas it is possible to access the applicant countries by road. Many of them have big populations. Despite this, we have priced our tourism products out of the market. How do we propose to compete? Hotel chains will establish themselves where they can make the biggest profit.</P>
    <P>The industry needs a proper, ring-fenced budget. Section 24 provides that the Minister may make advances to the authority out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, up to an aggregate level of &euro;65 million. Is this to be split between marketing and product development? Is it an annual or a once-off budget and if it is an annual budget, will it be index linked? Is it ring-fenced or will it be used for operational expense only? If it is a development budget will conditions be attached to provide extra incentives to the BMW region? What will happen when the accelerated capital allowance for holiday houses is abolished? Two major tax incentives were abolished. How will reinvestment occur? I do not know how it will happen in respect of our hotel in Mulranny because there are no capital allowances any more and we have a very short season. It seems the rural areas, such as that in which I live, will be doomed unless there is some magnificent change or action that has not occurred already.</P>
    <P>Where is the incentive to invest in the tourism product? There is only a disincentive at the moment because, for every &euro;100 spent, one has to wait for a disproportionate period before reaping the allowance. The Minister talks all the time about a quality product. I heard him today and he was very eloquent, but if one wants to develop a product one has to invest money. There is no incentive to develop a five-star hotel at the moment. This will lead to a proliferation of drinking houses, of which we have enough, and they will flourish. The big operators will invest where they can make money and therefore they will take their money abroad to the other EU countries. They will invest it where they can obtain the maximum having invested the minimum, such as in drinking establishments.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on his point about quality and the need to improve the product. However, why is he removing the incentives that serve as a way to improve it? By the time the hotel in Mulranny finished its dealings with An Taisce and re-applied, the incentive scheme was gone. It is not worth it if we are to see a total deceleration of the incentives that already exist. Are we all committed to the scrap heap without a future?</P>
    <P>The problem is very serious in my area. I know of three major hotels that have closed on Achill recently and one is on the verge of closing. Bed and breakfasts have closed down, as have fine restaurants because their operators cannot make a living. The season is too short. There is no point <Col N="487" /> having a budget unless there is also proper professional advice.</P>
    <P>In regard to the new board, who will decide where the money goes? If it is to be the same as before, the money will go to the cities and not to the areas that need it. We need a young, dynamic board. I ask the Minister to ensure that the board will be non-political and non-representative of the current establishment, which has not delivered in the areas about which I am talking. Applications have been made under the national development plan or the operational programme for tourism. What has happened to them? We live in hope but, ultimately, it is nice to have something that provides one with a future. We need to change the whole approach.</P>
    <P>Under section 35, does the Minister envisage a voluntary redundancy scheme? In combining two organisations there will be people lacking the necessary skills to be re-employed. What will happen? Will the Minister clarify if there will be another costly voluntary redundancy scheme? Maybe the people in CERT or Bord Fáilte Ireland are getting older or something. Will the Minister advise us regarding the age profile and how he feels about the board? It is important to have people who can do the job and deliver. It does not matter whether they are young or old as long as they are non-political, independent and have the right advice.</P>
    <P>The issues of cost and insurance need to be sorted out and I know this Bill will not do it. The rising cost of the tourism product and the need for proper roads have to be addressed. The road into Mayo is an utter disgrace and it is worrying to think that there is no hope for the future. People who come from other areas deserve a certain standard, never mind the people who live in the area. How will we advance if we do not have balanced regional development? This applies to tourism as well.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Cowley as a chuid ama a roinnt liom ar an mBille tábhachtach seo. I listened to my colleague Deputy Gogarty and feel he was making an important point in stressing how we should value the differences that make Ireland an important destination for foreign and native tourists to enjoy holidays. I have many fond memories of holidaying in Deputy Cowley's area of Mayo. I could talk about it for a long time, but in the short time I am allowed I want to focus on some important points arising from the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dennehy probably needs a couple of lessons in geography because, like Deputy Wright, he will appreciate that Fingal is very advantageous in terms of its farm hinterland and very pastoral setting, in which many people enjoy holidays as well as day-to-day life. It has many lessons to teach, as well as many to learn from other parts of the country in terms of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" />The success of any tourist location depends on a thriving and distinct cultural and physical setting. Many will be familiar with famous locations abroad, such as Venice, Amsterdam or London, which have particularly distinctive tourism product characteristics. In this country we overlook distinctive language backgrounds. I know the Minister will be aware of how important the language is to many people in the kingdom of Kerry. It is also valued by many tourists. I hope our tourism authority will recognise that it is a matter of some pride and curiosity for visitors and try to ensure proper multi-lingual signage and information for tourists, whether or not they speak Irish.</P>
    <P>Selling tourism products as authentic and enduring is something we have not done sufficiently. There has been an overly subservient attitude and a certain inferiority complex leading us to believe that, in order to entertain people from abroad, we have to somehow ape their culture by having a Texas-style fast-food restaurant or some other McDonald's-type development. It happens to be familiar to the tourists, but it might not be what draws them here.</P>
    <P>A Deputy mentioned an aspect of the tourism authority and the review of tourism that was promised for March, which I think has been delayed until April. It concerned the authority being mean and lean. The green aspect of the authority will have to be looked at far more closely because it does not have any environmental representative. If our tourism industry is to have a future, it needs to be ecologically sustainable and needs to be able to mitigate its negative effects and accentuate its benefits to local economies and their local environments and be able to withstand the environmental difficulties we will face in coming years. The tourism industries that depend on long-haul flights from London to Sydney, for example, and which emit the same amount of carbon dioxide in one flight as many industries emit in one year in Africa and Asia, will certainly dry up. There needs to be a more holistic look at our tourism industry based on thinking globally and holidaying as locally as possible. To that extent, the role of local authorities is vital in promoting tourism because there is a danger of centralisation with this new body. As Deputy Cowley said, the cities would then soak up the resources while areas like Fingal suffer.</P>
    <P>I hope the authority is not overly political when it should be non-political. The situation with CERT is an example of how a political rumour can destroy the quality of a body's activity.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Breda Moynihan-Cronin on Tuesday, 11 February 2003:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann, recognising that 2003 is the European Year of People with Disabilities, supporting the wonderful national effort that has gone into the preparations for the Special Olympics World Games, conscious of the fact that there is a growing crisis in essential services for people with disabilities throughout Ireland, and noting that no allocation whatever has been made for new services and places in 2003, calls on the Government to immediately:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;allocate an additional &euro;35 million for new places in the current year;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;arrange to meet the national bodies representing people with disabilities to agree a plan to eliminate waiting lists for all essential services within three years;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&nbsp;publish the Intellectual Disability Database, which contains the most up-to-date information on waiting lists for people with intellectual disabilities;</P>
    <P Just="Center">and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to add my voice to this very important debate on services and funding for people with disabilities. It will be watched closely by people with disabilities, their carers and families. There are gaps in the services and there is no denying the fact that much remains to be done. However, this Government is committed to providing funding and investment for services for people with physical and intellectual disabilities despite the difficult economic climate of 2003.</P>
      <P>Significant funding has been made available by this Administration in recent years which is not to say that there is not more work to do. There are areas which need to be prioritised and problems which must be identified and resolved. I am very conscious of the demands of people with disability and I am particularly concerned about certain groups who I feel should be prioritised when money becomes available. I was a health board member for a number of years and I recognise the substantial investment which has made in spite of the condemnatory tone of the Opposition motion. I hope that level of investment will be made in the future. As a health board member I met with many groups representing people with disability over the last number of years and I recognise that the case for those suffering in the autistic spectrum is one that quite clearly needs to be recognised as soon as funding becomes available.</P>
      <P>The recent figures for autism are quite alarming and indicate a huge potential drain on the Exchequer unless we get to grips with the problem as soon as possible. In the 1960s one in 2,500 presented with autism, in the 1970s the figure was one in 1,000, in the 1980s it was one in 500, in 2001 one in 125 and in 2002 one in 86. Quite clearly the figures are cause for great concern. The American experience is of an incidence of ASD is one in 129 which makes the Irish scenario sadly worse. I appeal to the Minister to prioritise autism as soon as further funding becomes available and to get involved in dealing with what will become a huge drain on the State's resources. There is evidence that if a child with ASD is given three years of early, intense and appropriate intervention, substantial and life changing progress can be made. Surely, this is a preferable option to a life sentence in an institution.</P>
      <P>Tonight's debate takes place in the context of reduced funding and it is important to make the economic case for intervention. Far too little attention has been given to date to people with ASD or similar difficulties when early intervention can have a huge impact on language skills, communication, social behaviour, developmental rates and IQ and educational attainment. That means greater employment opportunities. Quite clearly, that means a need to provide less money from the Exchequer while providing greater opportunities to participate in society. The problems in this area must be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and of the Minister <Col N="490" /><Col N="491" /> of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, indicates that while funding is not freely available, they will attempt to ensure that there will be further improvements in the disabilities sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelGrealishPD" hpid="Mr. Grealish Mr. Grealish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Grealish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be given the opportunity to speak in the House.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats are committed to providing adequate support and funding to people with intellectual disabilities be those physical, intellectual or sensory. Our policy objective in health has always been patient centred and has aimed to provide quality care at all levels.</P>
      <P>Tremendous work is being done to improve the quality of service available to those with intellectual disabilities and the appointment of Deputy Tim O'Malley as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for this area is a clear sign the Government takes its responsibilities seriously. I admit that while work is being done and funding has been allocated, there is much still to do. The health system is not performing as we would like it to, but the Progressive Democrats are committed to working hard to reform it. As the junior partners in Government we will continue to highlight the requirements in this area while fighting for additional funding for people with intellectual disabilities, particularly during this European year of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Excellent work is being done by individuals and community groups in preparation for the Special Olympics and we acknowledge the efforts being made. However, Opposition Deputies while at pains to point out holes in the health system choose to ignore the considerable work that has been done to date. The health strategy of 2001 represents a ten year view of how to progress investment with reform of the health service. One of the steps taken in the strategy's first year and funded by budget 2002 is the provision of &euro;39 million to provide 100 new residential places for those with intellectual disabilities and autism. Also provided were 75 respite places and day places. The programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability or autism from our psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate places is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant advances have been made in recent years in the provision of community psychiatry, nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres, all of which are acknowledged by Amnesty International in its report. Prior to 1997, the level of ongoing funding available for health related services for those with physical or sensory disabilities was in the region of &euro;90 million. Since then, additional ongoing funding of just over &euro;113 million has been provided to maintain and develop the services. This level of additional funding has facilitated substantial progress with regard to the development of residential care, respite care, day therapy and other services which have greatly increased the quality and quantity of the services available. In <Col N="492" /> the period 1999 to 2002 an additional &euro;70.7 million was invested in the mental health services. In the current year additional revenue funding of &euro;7.6 million will provide for the development and expansion of community services, increased child and adolescent services and the expansion of old age psychiatry services. The money will also provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and enhance the support provided by voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>Approximately, &euro;190 million in capital allowance will be provided over the life of the national development plan to fund acute psychiatry units to replace services previously provided by psychiatric hospitals. Substantial progress has been made and 18 general hospital psychiatric units are now operational. A further three units will become available to the mental health services in the near future and two are under construction. Several others are at various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>Approximately 400 community psychiatric residences are providing over 3,000 places. This compares to 111 residences providing less than 1,000 places in 1984. There are approximately 200 hospital day centres providing over 3,500 places. This compares to 39 such centres providing approximately 1,200 places in 1984. Significant funding is also being made available by the Government to support groups and organisations in the sector.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I in the Progressive Democrats are committed to improving the quality of care in the mental health sector and we will be seeking additional resources for this purpose during the Government's term of office.</P>

I commend the Government amendment to the House and congratulate the efforts made in this regard by the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I also acknowledge the presence in the Chamber of the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, who up to recently was a health board colleague of mine. It is all right for people to &ldquo;tut tut&rdquo; but we do not have to accept those people's views about politics. I currently find myself on the Government benches, but if I were on the Opposition benches I would not have to worry as much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>One is elected by the people to do a job without fear or favour. I have a strong role to play in representing the concerns raised about these issues by my constituents throughout Dublin South-West, including Tallaght, Greenhills, Templeogue and Firhouse. It is making good use of Private Members' time to contribute to a debate such as this one. If I were to accept what the Opposition Deputy said, I would not contribute to the debate but, in fairness, I think Government Deputies should do so. I have a role in trying to persuade Ministers to respond <Col N="493" /> to these issues and whatever political role I may have in future, I will continue to fulfil those responsibilities.</P>
      <P>With other colleagues, I have received a huge amount of mail from people throughout the constituency who are genuinely concerned about the funding of programmes for people with disabilities. They have asked me to present these concerns to the Government and I wish to do that as part of this debate. I raised these issues in the House as recently as last week and I do not wish to repeat what has been said by my colleagues. The Minister has pointed out, however, that despite the significant investment that has been made in the sector, other factors are contributing to the growing waiting lists, in particular for residential services. This is so, even though the number of persons in receipt of such services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The Minister pointed out that the increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than heretofore, thus adding to the need for services compared to previous generations.</P>
      <P>The Minister also pointed out that this has been the international experience in service provision in this population. I bring to my work in the Dáil the experience of my constituency, as well as my work on the local authority and the health board. I served on the Eastern Health Board which later became the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I voluntarily stood down from that authority last week, although it was something I was unhappy about. Time presses on, however, and one has to do other things in a political career. I believe strongly in the important role of local authorities and health boards in dealing with the issues that are before us today.</P>
      <P>I do not wish my remarks to be taken as patronising but on a number of occasions I have paid tributes to Opposition colleagues, particularly Deputy Finian McGrath who often brings his personal experience to bear in debates. While I do not have the same professional experience as Deputy McGrath, like him, I have experience of dealing with constituents who have problems arising from disability issues. In that regard I am happy to support them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>A few days ago, I attended the opening of a multi-million euro facility in my constituency which was presided over by the Taoiseach. At that ceremony, he was commended by the chairperson and chief executive of that service provider for the Government's commitment to providing services for people with disabilities. I am pleased to be able to put that on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of key developments in recent years in relation to the enhancement of existing services and the <Col N="494" /> development of new services to meet identified needs in the area of disabilities. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, spoke about some of them in last night's debate.</P>
    <P>This evening I wish to talk about the developments in training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Over the years, people with disabilities have been at a disadvantage in training and employment. There is now a fresh impetus to the development of services provided for people with disabilities in the areas of training and employment. These initiatives include the assignment of responsibility of vocational training and employment services for people with disabilities to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, thus bringing these services into the mainstream and opening new options for individuals, which were not previously available.</P>
    <P>Another initiative involves the provision of additional funding by the Department of Health and Children for new and existing places in day care services, including sheltered occupational services. Since 1997, the Government's financial commitment in funding for disability services, is &euro;555 million, including &euro;37.5 million in 2003. This figure includes &euro;180 million for physical and sensory disabilities, as well as &euro;33 million for rehabilitative training and sheltered work accommodation.</P>
    <P>The development of a draft code of practice for sheltered occupational services has been completed and my Department is now examining the draft document. The introduction of this code will clarify the status of people with disabilities in sheltered occupational services and will ensure that in future these services will meet approved quality standards. A review of funding for sheltered occupational services is also in progress. This will lead to a better understanding of the funding requirements of these services and will facilitate the optimal use of available resources.</P>
    <P>These ongoing developments and improvements to training and services for people with disabilities will assist them in their personal development and vocational fulfilment and will lead to increased social inclusion and a greater realisation of their economic and personal potential. The Department of Health and Children and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have responsibility for the provision of training. Health boards have taken over responsibility for rehabilitative training while FÁS now deals with vocational training and employment services for people with disabilities. Enhancements to rehabilitative training have been effective in recent years since that responsibility was devolved to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In 2001, additional funding of &euro;1.7 million was made available for guidance and assessment staff. This facilitated the provision of 38 posts. The sum of &euro;0.96 million was made available for service provider agencies and &euro;2.52 million for the provision of training bonuses.</P>

Targeted and ring-fenced funding has been provided in recent years for service areas which have been prioritised. These resources have been targeted at specific service elements, including support services for children and adults, and residential, respite and day services. This Government is committed to moving forward to further enhance the level of support available to people with disabilit<Col N="496" /> ies. With the active participation of all involved, this issue can be progressed to achieve a quality and cost-effective service for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party motion notes that the Special Olympics are being held here and it acknowledges the hard work involved in the organisation of the games. Anyone who is involved in the Special Olympics will appreciate the tremendous effort which is being put in by people all over the country. The idea of host town has been a great success.</P>
      <P>I have attended some fund-raising functions for the Special Olympics. I heard one person at a function who summed up the Special Olympics by saying that Irish people normally opened their hearts to visitors but the Special Olympics will open our minds. That is true.</P>
      <P>For too long we have concentrated on people's disabilities rather than on their abilities. We have failed to give them the opportunities to progress as they should and develop to their full potential. In his contribution to this debate the Minister spoke about the significant progress that has been achieved in terms of the growth of funding available for the disability sector. He said that the Government is committed to developing the health-funded services for people with disabilities. I acknowledge that there has been a significant increase in the funding made available. It was easy to do this because money was plentiful. It is easy to increase the percentage when one is starting from a low base. It is a pity that the process of investment in the services for the disability sector appears to have been put on hold. There is no money available this year for any new developments. Approximately 500 people will leave school and they should be going into adult services but what awaits them? Continuity is essential in any investment and a crisis situation will develop without continuity. It is vital that the Cabinet treats this matter as a priority. I am sure that people directly involved in the disability sector find it frustrating to hear Ministers arguing over who has responsibility for delivering the service or providing the funds for it.</P>

      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Seán Power, in his contribution. As a member of the Western Health Board I am only too aware of the lack of services for many people with intellectual disabilities and autism. I am aware of the case of one family where a young man with autism received no services until he was 15 years of age. He is now in his early 20s and due to staff shortages in the institution where he resides most of the time, there has been a withdrawal of services this year. This is a regrettable situation and it cannot be tolerated.</P>
      <P>I recognise that 100% of the income tax take of the country is being spent on health each year. Two thirds of the additional funding for non-capital investment has been invested in health. We all recognise that we can never spend enough money in the area of health or to provide services for people with disabilities. There have been five years of unprecedented investment and, as a result, people's expectations correctly have been raised&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to make a constructive point. The Seanad is today debating the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill. This fund is to be dedicated to areas of disadvantage. I ask the Minister to sit down with his ministerial colleagues and try to direct some of the funds dealt with in this legislation to the disability sector. It would be a worthwhile way of spending this money.</P>
      <P>My colleague mentioned the Special Olympics. It is an enriching experience for anyone fortunate enough to be involved. My home town is host to Venezuela. People of all ages are becoming involved with the Special Olympics and are recognising the wonderful contribution to society made by people with disabilities. It is marvellous to listen to the enthusiasm of the medal winners at the last Special Olympics. It is incumbent on all of us in the House to ensure that all the funding that can be made available should be invested in this area.</P>
      <P>There have been some accusations from the other side of the House regarding the delay on the disability Bill. It is important that a proper consultative process take place before this Bill is brought before the House so that it will deal with the needs of people with disabilities. The Bill will then enjoy all-party support when it is brought before the House. It is important that it be done as a matter of urgency. I support the Government amendment to this motion. I welcome the opportunity to speak and I look forward to additional moneys being made available.</P>

      <P>I will share my time with Deputies Healy, Harkin, Ó Caoláin and Gormley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the House on this important motion. I stood for the 29th Dáil on a strong health and disability platform. I had the honour of being elected by the people of Charlemont, Marino, Griffith Avenue, Fairview, Drumcondra, Clontarf, Coolock, Donnycarney, Beaumont, Raheny and Artane. The people of these areas voted for someone who <Col N="499" /> would try to do something about the lack of services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I am also a member of the Independent Health Alliance and I welcome the candidates from that group here tonight. I also welcome the other members of disability groups to the Visitors' Gallery. Since I was elected a high percentage of my queries, particularly constituency queries, have been about disabilities and waiting lists. This Government must respect this mandate and must listen to the views of parents and families of people with intellectual disabilities. Their voices must be heard. I intend to represent their interests in this Dáil and will raise the issue at every opportunity and demand services as a matter of right.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we look at the reality for many of our citizens. I urge the Government to do something about the crisis situation where many terminally ill parents are responsible for adults with a disability. We have 1,711 people with disabilities who need a full-time residential service. We have 861 people who need a day care service, 1,014 people with intellectual disabilities who need a respite service and 462 people with intellectual disabilities who have no service whatsoever. We also have a disgraceful situation where 485 people with intellectual disabilities are resident in inappropriate conditions in psychiatric hospitals. This is unacceptable. On the positive side, these figures are small. A figure of 1,711 is a small figure in terms of waiting lists and people. We can do something and can move forward if we get cross-party agreement.</P>
    <P>This debate is also about broken promises. It is essential that we remind ourselves of the facts. In a letter of 15 May, from the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, to the Federation of Voluntary Bodies, she states: &ldquo;In short, we are committed to dealing with the waiting lists for services for people with intellectual disability. If we are in a position to negotiate a programme for Government this commitment will form part of it.&rdquo;  I ask the Tánaiste to live up to that commitment. We are waiting for action. The figure of &euro;35 million is mentioned in the motion. We ask the Government to put its money where its mouth is. Figures for new developments for 2002 show there has been a serious drop in the number of places planned compared to the previous two years.</P>
    <P>I was upset and disappointed by the Taoiseach's remarks at the Mansion House about the groups who mounted a dignified protest outside the Irish launch of the European people with disabilities. His reference to a small crowd made up by four organisations was not only hurtful to our members but also misleading. It was inaccurate and out of order. NAMHI is the national representative group, founded in 1961, of over 160 organisations providing services for 28,000 people <Col N="500" /> with intellectual disability in Ireland. It is the equivalent of the ICTU. The other three organisations, the National Parents Siblings Alliance, the Irish Autism Alliance and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, have provided services to people with intellectual disabilities and are their national representative groups. It was never the intention to have a large group of people outside the Mansion House as we did not want to detract from the launch of the European year.</P>
    <P>Our purpose was to highlight our grave fears about the impact of the budget on people with intellectual disabilities. People travelled from Cork, Kerry, Limerick and elsewhere to attend. Some of them left at 4 a.m. to be outside the Mansion House in time. The Taoiseach was out of order and should apologise. During the week I was on a radio programme with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who did apologise. I fully accept his apology.</P>
    <P>Autistic people are suffering inhuman and degrading treatment which is a breach of their human rights. This is another scandal. Figures of 500, 1,000 and 1,500 have been bandied about. We need exact figures in order to plan properly for the future and provide a service. I urge Members to support this motion, particularly the call for &euro;35 million to be invested in services for people with disabilities. I ask the Government to bring in a strong disability Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. I have a strong background in the health services and am aware of the difficulties and lack of services available for people with disability. It is a shame that in the European year for persons with disabilities we should have to talk about the extent of the lack of services as outlined by Deputy Finian McGrath.</P>
      <P>The touchstone of the humanity of any society, Government or nation is how it treats its minorities. We have a significant minority of people with disabilities of various kinds. It is a serious blot on our humanity that additional services are not available for 2003. When the Government came into office its programme stated:</P>
      <P>An unprecedented opportunity has been given uniquely to us in this generation. It is the opportunity to build a fair society of equal opportunity and of sustained prosperity in an island at peace with itself. We aim to be an inclusive society but there are those who remain left out. We are committed to building service provisions and legislative frameworks which enable people with disabilities to fulfil their potential and make full contributions to the economic and social life of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was part of An Agreed Programme for Government. Unfortunately, that agreement has not been carried through in the 2003 budget. <Col N="501" /> Deputy Finian McGrath has outlined clearly the additional services that are not provided for this year. I support the call for the additional &euro;35 million for those services. I ask the Minister to address the question of meeting the various bodies representing people with disabilities. This is an urgent need.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the manner in which the disabled persons grant scheme has been destroyed by local authorities throughout the country. We have heard weekly since last November about the destruction by local authorities, including my own in south Tipperary, of the disabled persons grant scheme. What is worse is that members of some parties in this House who support this motion are voting to destroy those grants on their local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support this motion on disability. I have no personal experience of dealing with or caring for a person with disability. It is through contact with Ms Kathy Sinnott, who is present here tonight, and with parents and carers, that I have become aware of the scandalous situation that exists in Celtic tiger Ireland for those with disability. I do not use the word &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; lightly. Having read and listened to many heartbreaking stories I use the word with a clear conscience. Some of those stories include the fact that there are approximately 1,000 mentally disabled persons in psychiatric hospitals with no proper therapy and no adequate medical treatment for their particular situation.</P>
      <P>We have heard heartbreaking stories of parents and carers trying to cope at home. They are terrorised by the challenging behaviour of disabled six-foot adults. No care workers, services or adequate back-up are available to them. In 2003 the UN Commission on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was critical of Ireland's treatment of people with disability. Its members have no axe to grind. They are not members of the Opposition. The UN Human Rights Commission recommended that further action be taken by Ireland to ensure the full enjoyment of covenant rights to disabled persons.</P>
      <P>I stress that this was in the context of the new health strategy. When one walks into Leinster House the first document one sees is the Proclamation where we are reminded that we must cherish all children of the nation equally. People with a disability are not treated equally in Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we wish to accept it, the reality is that there is a major epidemic in autism, which was referred to earlier in the debate. Families want to care for their children but they need our help and support. Early intervention is critical because the challenging behaviour of autism can be substantially improved. I concur with Deputy Power and congratulate him on his speech. An apology in a <Col N="502" /> few years' time with compensation is useless. We need the services now.</P>

      <P>I endorse the motion calling on the Government to support people with disabilities, both through proper funding and the introduction of rights-based legislation. I commend the Labour Party on introducing the issue.</P>
      <P>As a party striving to create an Ireland of equals, Sinn Féin is committed to bringing about equality for people with disabilities. The enormous goodwill of the Irish people towards people with disabilities is evidenced in the widespread involvement of the public in helping to prepare for the Special Olympics World Games, which will be held later this year. This is in sharp contrast to the attitude shown by the Government to the high levels of poverty and social exclusion faced by people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have a copy of a letter penned by the leader of the Progressive Democrats who was then in Opposition but is now the Tánaiste. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, will be familiar with the content which states: &ldquo;I would like to assure you of my view that the mentally handicapped deserve priority when it comes to the allocation of resources within our health services.&rdquo;  That was the view expressed by the Tánaiste when in opposition in 1996. What is her position in regard to that statement and the commitment she made then? What is the reality today? People with mental handicap and intellectual disabilities and their families remain among the most neglected groups of people in this country.</P>
      <P>The severe cut in the budget allocated to the health boards for mentally handicapped services in 2003 is scandalous &ndash; it has gone from &euro;38 million to &euro;13.3 million. These cuts have been described by the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the National Association of the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland as bringing us back to the mid-1990s, to the period when that letter was written by the party leader of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley. The caring agencies and the voluntary bodies cannot maintain existing services, let alone proceed with badly needed new developments. I have said this to the Minister of State on a number of occasions over the past weeks and I appreciate that he is listening. It will mean longer waiting lists for day care, respite care and essential long-term residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about the most vulnerable people in this land, many of whom cannot articulate their own needs, concerns and fears. They depend on us, not only those on the Opposition benches, but all elected representatives, to be their advocates. Carers of the mentally handicapped are mostly elderly people trying to cope with their loved ones. Many of them are lone parents whose spouses have died. Can we imagine <Col N="503" /> their concern as to what will become of their children on their own deaths? This is the reality for many people. I have described it to the Minister of State in graphic terms in recent weeks. These are the people with whom we are dealing and the Government must make provision for them.</P>
    <P>We must take some encouragement tonight from what has been said by Government backbenchers. Perhaps they will translate their words into action and deliver on them during the vote to bring about a commitment to change this situation. The Government must re-examine its priorities. People with disabilities need to be assured that the funding which that sector is to receive is protected even in times of economic downturn. I strenuously emphasise this point. Economic downturn demands that there is a re-visitation of the configuration of the budget. There is one sector in our community that must be protected from economic downturn and that is those who are suffering from disability and intellectual disability. Funding must be ring-fenced and index-linked. It must continue to address not only current service needs but also the needs of those who have yet to be addressed within the wider configuration of that demand.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minster of State for listening and hope he will take on board all that has been said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I stood in front of the Mansion House a number of weeks ago as part of a protest at the European Year of People with Disabilities event. It was a cold, wet and miserable day as we waited for the Taoiseach. In trying to gauge the mood of the crowd, I detected a sense of frustration, a sense of anger. Great stoicism and resignation were also evident but behind it all a sense of dignity was apparent. It was particularly evident when the Taoiseach passed by on his way out. He stopped in front of the protesters and for the most part they remained silent. I do not know if I could have remained silent in their circumstances.</P>
      <P>Their stories were familiar because, like many people in this Chamber, I know families where there are children with a disability. I am aware of their suffering. It is very clear that as well as being very tiring and draining, much of their time is spent fundraising. The Minister of State should be aware that if the Government is not providing the money, it has to come from elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin alluded to the concern of parents about what will happen to their children when they pass on. Can they trust the State with their children? On the record of the Government they clearly cannot trust the State. I hope the Minister of State can understand this. The Government's record has been abysmal. We have had unprecedented wealth over many years and many of the friends of the Government have enjoyed the fruits of the Celtic tiger. The real <Col N="504" /> harshness of the philosophy underpinning the Government has been revealed because while those who were already wealthy have benefited, the less well off, the most vulnerable in our society, have benefited to a much lesser extent. In the past I have referred to this philosophy as Thatcherite. I have said it has been about greed, not need, but really it is Darwinian &ndash; it is the survival of the fittest. The weakest will always go to the wall.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Government has managed to paper over the cracks by wonderful spin-doctoring. I would not be surprised if at the end of this year, people really believed that the Government had done more for those with disability than any other Government, but of course that would be complete deception.</P>
    <P>We must look at what has happened. During the Nice treaty referendum campaign friends of Fianna Fáil in the area of disability campaigned against the Nice treaty. I found that most reprehensible. I very much support the motion put forward this evening by the Labour Party. It is scandalous that the 2003 budget saw a significant cut in spending. This was morally unjustifiable. We must look after the most vulnerable in our society, those with a disability. It is a very sad reflection on our society if we cannot do that.</P>

      <P>Many issues of great importance are debated in this House, but few have as real and immediate an impact on the quality of the lives of the citizens of this State as the motion before us tonight. There has been a slow realisation that for too long we have denied a group of our citizens the right to be full citizens of this nation. That group comprises those who have disabilities. They are entitled to full citizenship and the responsibility to deliver those rights rests with this House.</P>
      <P>I say this as a former Minister for Health. All of us share in the responsibility for the fact that these people have, for so long, been denied basic rights of living, of participation, of being full citizens and of enjoying the rights the rest of us demand and expect as the norm. The extent of the need was spelt out by my colleagues last night and tonight, in particular by our chief spokesperson, Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This night, 1,711 people with intellectual disabilities require full-time residential placement, 861 people require a day service, 1,014 require a respite service and more than 400 people with intellectual disabilities are living in unsuitable conditions in long-stay psychiatric hospitals. These facts have been repeated many times in the <Col N="505" /> past few hours. They are cold statistics but lying behind those cold numbers are individual people with families and friends.</P>
    <P>Let me give a glimpse of what lies behind those numbers. From all the files that all of us have from our clinic cases I have picked one. A constituent of mine &ndash; I call him Joe although that is not his name &ndash; suffers from Down's syndrome and, unusually, has behavioural problems. He is looked after by elderly parents who are at their wits end trying to mind him at home. The health board has made a complete assessment of his needs, the senior psychologist has determined what he needs, but there is no place for him. The stark and awful choice faced by his elderly parents is to cope with him at home or leave him in a long-stay psychiatric hospital. They have tried both. I have talked to them and I have seen how distraught they are in trying to cope with this reality.</P>
    <P>This is a reality of which I am personally aware but it is multiplied by more than 400, the number of people who are improperly placed in psychiatric hospitals. We saw a glimpse of some of the cases in our psychiatric hospitals in a report published this month.</P>
    <P>In this wealthy country we have collective responsibility to set priorities. This House votes money for many things. There is nothing more useful we could do with &euro;35 million than spend it on the services demanded by these least demanding of our citizens. I ask for consensus on all sides of the House, with no one scoring political points, when the vote is called at 8.30 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in the Labour Party in pressing this motion and attempting to persuade the Government, even at this late stage, not to divide the House on this issue but to support the Labour Party motion and agree to provide the resources which the Government acknowledges is needed to meet the needs of people with disabilities, whether physical, intellectual or sensory, and of their carers and families who are so badly pressed. It beggars belief that a Government which regards itself as streetwise and is sensitive to lobbies and interests could not have provided a single additional cent in this year's budget and Estimates for people with disabilities and could not have provided resources for additional places in residential or respite care.</P>
      <P>All Deputies have received correspondence from people with disabilities and from their parents, families and friends, setting out the distressful conditions in which they have to live. We have all attended meetings in our constituencies. I have attended meetings in the Carmona Services premises in Dunmore House in Glenageary with my constituency colleagues, Deputies Fiona O'Malley, Hanafin and Andrews and we all agreed that provision of resources for people with disabilities is a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" />The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley is right about one thing, there is no monopoly on compassion in this House. We heard genuine compassion from Deputies on the Government side of the House on this issue. However, why is it that when some lobbies appear before Government they get only compassion while others get immediate action? Before Christmas the Government rushed emergency legislation through the House because it had been lobbied by the powerful, able-bodied and politically well-connected building industry. That lobby succeeded in getting immediate action and emergency legislation pushed through this House.</P>
    <P>The Government can save its compassion for the building industry, for those who are powerful and able to look after themselves, and provide the resources for those who are not able to look after themselves, who need care and assistance and are in a state of distress because they are not receiving it. It is not too late for the Government to agree to the Labour Party motion.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to believe that at some stage this year when so much is happening in relation to people with disabilities, the Government will not make some grand announcement of additional resources for people with disabilities. If it is in the Government's mind to use the dormant accounts fund or to find a pot of money somewhere with which to make a grand announcement at some strategic point, it should not play games with this issue.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities need the resources urgently. I appeal to the Government to agree to the Labour Party motion, to provide the resources and give relief and comfort to those who are worried tonight about how they are going to care for members of their families who have a disability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. That no funds are available for new development in relation to people with disabilities is of major concern to me in my constituency, as it is to everyone who has contributed to the debate, irrespective of which side of the House they are on. When a case is put, it only relates to oneself or people known to one. Before coming into the House I was given a letter from the parents of a girl, who attends school in Dublin while the parents live in Kildare, expressing their concern that no funding has been made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Christmas a fine fellow in my constituency with mild mental disability caused problems in his own home and was taken by the health board and put into a local hotel with three professional people where three rooms were booked. After a week the young boy was moved to a different hotel with the three professional people but there was still no means of providing the facilities the child <Col N="507" /> needed. A week later he was moved on to another hotel, involving further costs &ndash; approximately &euro;15,000 per week was spent on the case. That no funds are available for new development means that child will remain in a rented house in Newbridge with three professional people minding him. That is because there are no services available and because the Government has ignored its pre-election pledges.</P>
    <P>I am delighted my constituency colleague, Deputy Power, had the guts to stand up here and demand the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children to sit around the table with the Cabinet and to bring in a supplementary budget. It is frightful to think of the concerns of parents in these circumstances. When people approached the Taoiseach, the leader of the Government and the Cabinet, he told them he would write to the Minister for Health and Children. Is that not a scandal and an indictment on the Government? The Taoiseach should have sat at the table and argued the point, making sure the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, had the necessary funds. From any standpoint &euro;20 million is a dot in the ocean in terms of the overall health budget or the Estimates as presented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has laid the blame time and again on the Minister for Health and Children saying he gave him his slice of the cake and he can do what he wants with it. He did not believe that the people were undermined, but they have not got what they want to care for children with disabilities. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, is a good Minister. He is in a Department that can bear fruit and he will take action if given the money and the opportunity.</P>
    <P>Those on the backbenches who are supportive of the motion did not say there was anything wrong with our motion. I ask them to put pressure on the relevant Minister and the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach should realise a letter is no good at this stage for these people, what we want is action and we want it tonight before we leave the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore is right in saying it is not too late. I hope in his reply the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will show that the Government will honour what is being sought and, more importantly, will honour those who have children with disabilities. Those who work with people with disabilities are concerned that we will not retain existing services due to the staff embargo.</P>
    <P>I support what has been said by everyone. I hope the Minister for Health and Children will make the appropriate representations to the Minister for Finance, not by letter, but around <Col N="508" /> the Cabinet table to ensure &euro;20 million is given to this sector.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Moynihan-Cronin on this motion by the Labour Party, which is very specific in calling for &euro;35 million. The amendment to the motion should be withdrawn because all we have heard is empty rhetoric and we will probably hear more of it from the Minister, the Progressive Democrats and the Government benches.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party motion is specific. There is no funding for new services development in 2003. Consequently there will be no funding for emergencies which will inevitably arise when a parent or carer is no longer able to look after their child or in the event of death. I have stated frequently when speaking to people with disabilities that this is their country too, but so far as Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are concerned this is not their country, they are a forgotten people.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in my area of Mallow and in the constituency locally, and it was always a great joy to see people becoming involved in and organising events. That is knocked on the head now and the Minister should do something about it immediately. Last weekend a person with a disability went to the local authority in Mallow in north Cork and handed in an application form for a disabled person's grant. The person was told the application would not be looked at until such time as that person paid &euro;50.</P>

      <P>In terms of intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities, prioritisation is a key issue. From time to time Governments prioritise issues. The only Government in the past 20 years that in any meaningful way prioritised disabilities funding was the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats led Government &ndash; the record shows that. That over &euro;555 million was spent since 1997 on expanding the range of services under disabilities is the classical illustration of that. While I understand and fully acknowledge the concerns of people in the disability sector, I find it hard to take some of the heckling and lectures from the opposite side of the House because, even though they were <Col N="509" /> in office at a more difficult time, they did not give the same level of prioritisation&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just looking at those opposite. I do not mean to engage in a two-way process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue is whether one has a rights-based template. I do not believe we, in the political theatre, have had a proper informed debate about that. The simplistic response has always been to do whatever the rights-based approach <Col N="511" /> suggests without looking at the consequences or the implications for the roll-out and the targeting of services or at who should get what.</P>
    <P>If we brought in rights-based legislation tomorrow morning, we would be fooling people. We would be putting a template in front of them which the system, as we know it and irrespective of money, could not provide in terms of personnel and the multidisciplinary teams required to give the kind of one-to-one disability planning programmes necessary. We do not have disability planning programmes because over a ten or 15 year period, we did not provide for speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. For 30 years we had one school for speech and language therapy yet anyone in the disability sector will know that it is a key discipline we have lacked.</P>

      <P>This is the first Government to provide for a process to lead to additional training places for speech and language therapists, physiotherapist and occupational therapists. In the interim, we have been trying to recruit people from abroad to meet the gaps and deficiencies in place.</P>
      <P>To come back to the disability legislation, there are key issues which need to be resolved. We made a contribution to the previous disability Bill in terms of the rights to assessment and so forth which should be in any disability Bill. I appeal for a decent debate as opposed to one which may appeal to simplistic political issues and be popular in terms of coming up with certain solutions which no Government, regardless of who was in power, went near. It is easier when one is on the Opposition benches to say what one wants.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the United States. I have been to the United States and have asked people about legislation there. It is important to strike the right balance. People in the disability sector there have said that the spectrum has broadened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Rabbitte. I congratulate the Labour Party on moving this motion and thank Deputy Rabbitte for giving me a few minutes to speak.</P>
      <P>In response to the Minister for Health and Children, the disability Bill introduced last year by the former Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, could not have been brought in because, while it conferred rights, they could not be enforced. That Bill was completely and fatally flawed and everybody recognised that despite the fact that five years' work had gone into it.</P>
      <P>We are debating the scandal of self-congratulation by Government and of scarcity of resources and services for people with disabilities. Parents of children with an intellectual disability, driven by desperation, demonstrated outside the Mansion House while the Taoiseach, as patron, attended the Irish launch of the European Year of People with Disabilities. Their dignified protest clearly made the point that the Government must not try to use the media opportunities to hide the fact there are major areas of outstanding need.</P>
      <P>The second and related point they made concerns the coincidence of the EYPD with the fact that this Government, in office since 1997, has chosen this year not to improve the level of funding for disability services. The Taoiseach's patronage of the EYPD cannot be allowed to signal the Government's promotion of the big lie that all is well in relation to disability when nothing could be further from the truth. The point made by intellectual disability organisations on funding is equally applicable across the entire sector. There is still no national physical and sensory disability database concerning health and personal social service needs, despite it being a key recommendation of the report entitled Towards an Independent Future, published in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" />The parents of a child with a mental handicap face every day the painful reality that their child's quality of life will always be decided by other people. Far from being the beneficiary of a comprehensive and seamless service, the parents and families face a lifetime of struggle and delay. It is surely reprehensible that in this day and age, parents have to talk about rescuing their children from national institutions yet just two days ago, an Irish mother of an Irish child told <i>The Irish Times</i> about having to rescue her daughter who had autism from a psychiatric hospital wholly unsuitable to her needs. She rescued her after a temporary stay of eight years. Let us not kid ourselves; this is not a matter of just care. If we place people with special needs in institutions totally unsuited to their needs, never mind their human dignity, then what we have is a form of incarceration.</P>
    <P>The other day I heard a woman say that not only could the carers of people with disabilities not live in peace, they could not even die in peace not knowing what will happen to their children after they are gone. I wonder what kind of statistical guff the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, could come up with an answer to that.</P>
    <P>A parent told the Forum on the Status of People with Disabilities a number of years ago that parents do not expect the State or society to take over their responsibilities. They are prepared to make whatever sacrifices are necessary but with the best will in the world, they cannot do so from beyond the grave. Imagine what it is like to lose a relative who is one's carer &ndash; one must go into residential care for the first time, even if that care is unsuitable to one's needs. One loses not just a mother or father but a home, surroundings, one's history, identity and one's entire way of life.</P>
    <P>It seems that in 2003 we have regressed to a form of the survival of the fittest. There is no service for many. There is no hope this year of a place for young adults who leave special schools at 18. There is no safety net for those who need crisis intervention in the event of illness or incapacity of the primary carer. There is no chance of respite for many people who can never take a week away on a whim. Spending in this area is a matter of political choice. The Government has made its choice and others must live with the consequences. This is the gift of the Government to people with disabilities in what should be a special year for them. It makes the Special Olympics tag line, &ldquo;Be happy for me&rdquo;, a travesty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank colleagues on all sides of the House who contributed to the debate in the name of my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. On 28 January last, I was one of a number of Members of this House who joined the protest <Col N="514" /> at the Mansion House to which Deputy Kenny referred. The occasion was the launch of the European Year of People with Disabilities. It was a sad, solemn protest by people who travelled from all over Ireland, people who represented hundreds, if not thousands, of others.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach arrived for the event and refused on his way in to meet any of the protesters. Perhaps he was afraid, even though there was no reason for fear. More likely, he just had no answer for them. Later, I saw him on television news dismissing the people who had protested. He said that there were many more inside than outside. I was surprised. He knew these were representative bodies, each of them able to count dozens of organisations among their membership. If he had stopped to talk, he would have discovered that many of them were middle-aged working people and in some cases pensioners, who had come to Dublin to express their fear. They did not want to upset the celebrations for the European Year of the Disabled &ndash; they would like to have taken part in the celebrations. They want no part of division or disagreement with other people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>There is a central fear at the heart of their protest &ndash;&ldquo;what happens to my child when I die? How do I cope with my child when he or she still needs to be helped to do many of the things others take for granted and I am crippled with arthritis or otherwise unable to do the things I used to do? How, when I am elderly, do I cope with the shouting, suffering, violence, incontinence and emotional distress my child's disability causes? How do I make policy-makers understand my child will need help and support through the many years of my ageing?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are more basic needs. I know of one family where an accident at work led to traumatic brain injury. After months of treatment, the victim of the accident, a father, was discharged to the care of his family. Unable to speak, feed himself, dress, attend to his own bodily functions, this father became the exclusive responsibility of a wife and small children. A business that depended on his knowledge and skill fell apart. His wife had to give up work and subsist on a carer's allowance. The small additional income the family received from a property meant they were ineligible for a medical card. Before long, the mother of this family had to choose on a weekly basis between what medication she could afford for her husband and what food she could afford for her children. This situation lasted for two years before a place could be found in a residential centre. By then, the accident, and the way our system had responded to it, had destroyed the lives and spirit of two people almost beyond repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is just one story. At every level, disability causes hardship and pain. I know a man who has lived most of his life in a wheelchair. He will tell <Col N="515" /> you that one of the most distressing things that can happen is when he is told, &ldquo;Your wheelchair is too big for you to come in here.&rdquo;  It is never, &ldquo;Our doorway is too narrow.&rdquo;  He is held responsible. This is a man who has never spent time with his children on a beach in Ireland because there is no beach he knows of accessible from a wheelchair. Deputy Power spoke very movingly about our experience in the House, yet when we put our minds to it, it took us three days to make these rooms accessible.</P>
    <P>Because there are so many different forms of disability and because it affects life in so many ways, the response of Government and the community must be multifaceted. A previous Government appointed my colleague, former Deputy Mervyn Taylor to a Cabinet position to take responsibility for equality legislation and considerable progress was made. He established the Commission on the Status of People with a Disability under the chair of Mr. Justice Flood, the first time such a body had ever been created in Ireland with a majority of members having a disability.</P>
    <P>The commission made 402 recommendations, many of which have been implemented in one form or other in the intervening years. Its core recommendation, however, has been at the heart of the disability movement's struggle ever since. Recommendation 43 states: &ldquo;It is the Commission's view that in relation to each person with a disability the following system should be in place: there should be a new Assessment of Needs process, underpinned by law, with the adequate arrangements made for its enforcement and monitoring and for an appeals procedure, and it should lead to a statement of needs.&rdquo;  The Government elected in 1997 downgraded the Cabinet-level position and appointed former Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, to take responsibility for this area. She, in turn, in January 2000, published Towards Equal Citizenship, a booklet which held itself out as a review of the progress made towards implementing the recommendations of the commission. Unlike the commission, the review was carried out primarily by civil servants and experts.</P>
    <P>When the review body examined recommendation 43, the bombshell dropped. This is what the report says about the legal entitlement to assessment and a statement of needs:</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance cannot accept these recommendations which imply the underpinning by law of access to and provision of services for people with disabilities as a right. This right, if given a statutory basis, would be prohibitively expensive for the Exchequer and could lead to requests from other persons seeking access to health and other services without regard to the eventual cost of providing these services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> Put simply, the Department of Finance, then and now, sees people with disabilities as some sort of appalling vista. Any concept of rights for people with disabilities will bankrupt the State. Any notion that a woman with a brain-injured husband should have an automatic right to support is a threat to our national security. The idea that a father should be able to take his wheelchair on to a beach is somehow seditious.</P>
    <P>If that is true, is it not natural for the State and the Government to ignore the needs and rights of people who have all the barriers that intellectual disability can place in their way? Is it not natural for the Government to tell people with disabilities, as it did in this year's budget, that they can wait for the charity of the dormant accounts fund whenever it is established? Of course, this is not true. If we were to introduce a comprehensive set of rights for people with disabilities, it would not bankrupt the State. It would challenge the system to respond appropriately, and it would not be before time.</P>
    <P>Tonight, we are not even discussing a comprehensive set of rights, we are discussing, as my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said, a pittance, help where it is desperately needed. No one can convince me that a Government that has turned in a massive current budget surplus this year and that is projecting equally massive surpluses on the current side cannot to give some help. The amount of money being sought in this motion is almost meaningless in terms of the national Exchequer, although a lot could be done to make the lives of individuals better and lessen the fear associated with disability.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the debate compared the amount the Government spent with the amount spent by previous Governments. I do not argue with that. No previous Government ever did enough. However, this Government and its predecessor are the first in the history of the State to be able to make unfettered choices. The Government can choose to plough almost &euro;64 million into the horse and greyhound racing fund. It can choose to spend &euro;67 million on new prison buildings and services, &euro;60 million on harbour development, &euro;217 million on the eradication of disease among farm animals and more than &euro;1,000 million on improving the road network &ndash; I could go on. I do not regard most of the payments I have mentioned as wasteful and unnecessary, as many of the areas make a vital contribution to society. The expenditure in these areas, however, compared to the meagre spending on disability shows where our priorities lie.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Job Losses.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. The Finn Valley area of County Donegal received another blow yesterday evening when Nena Models Limited announced the loss of 75 manufacturing jobs in its Castlefinn factory. This industry has been located in County Donegal for over 30 years and provided employment for 600 at its peak production. After yesterday's announcement its employment in the Finn Valley will be reduced to 50, mainly engaged in administration and distribution located in the company's Stranorlar plant.</P>
      <P>This is a most serious blow, not alone to that part of County Donegal which has suffered so many job losses in recent years, but especially to the 75 employees who have been made redundant. Many of these men and women have given long years of faithful service to the company. Many have financial responsibilities, such as mortgage repayments, educational expenses and other commitments. At a meeting last Monday attended by me and my colleagues in the House and other public representatives, we heard stories that people would have to sell their houses in the wake of the closure. They now face a bleak and uncertain future with few prospects of immediate alternative employment in their area.</P>
      <P>The only measure that can be adopted at this stage to cushion the loss of jobs is the provision of a generous redundancy arrangement. I understand the company is in a sound financial position and I also understand that statutory redundancy payments are to be increased in the near future. The Taoiseach indicated this to me in the House this morning.</P>
      <P>The Nena Models workers who are being made redundant should, and must, benefit from these factors. I appeal to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the offices of FÁS are used to initiative a training programme for those who have unfortunately lost their jobs and their livelihood.</P>
      <P>The Finn Valley is an economic and unemployment blackspot. In the past years over 1,000 industrial jobs have been lost, including 600 at Nena Models and 400 at Herdmans. This does not include the fall in agriculture employment. Not only does the absence of job opportunities cause major economic difficulties and hardship, it is also the cause of many social and personal difficulties, especially among young people, those under 25 years of age. In recent times the people of the Finn Valley have experienced such difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Government must bear a major responsibility for the loss of these and other jobs in County Donegal. The high cost of production fuelled by one of the highest inflation rates in the European Union and high insurance charges and energy costs are forcing these long-established industries to relocate in other parts of Europe, such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Russia. Nena Models has already commenced production in some of these countries. The Government's pursuit of such policies will result in further job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility for IDA Ireland and Forbairt, the job creating agencies in the Finn Valley area. I call on her and the agencies to ensure that they visit the Finn Valley as soon as possible to see for themselves the hopelessness of the job situation. The Minister visited the area a number of years ago and met people from the chamber of commerce, community councils and so on. Since then the situation has <Col N="523" /> deteriorated to crisis proportions. I am asking for a commitment that every effort will be made to attract a major industry to this area of County Donegal and to prevent it from becoming an economic and unemployment wasteland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The company in question is a significant employer in the manufacture of ladies clothes in County Donegal. I understand layoff notices have been issued to the staff. This will begin to take effect when two weeks of orders, currently on hand, have been completed. The company has advised the Tánaiste and Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the collective redundancies will be implemented on 14 March.</P>
      <P>This situation has arisen because of the loss of orders from existing customers, primarily for competitiveness reasons. It is unlikely that they will place new orders with the company before the notice which has been given to the workers expires. The competitiveness agenda is to the forefront, especially in the textile industry. The company has indicated that the redundancies have arisen due to labour costs, price competition in the sector and demand for lower cost products that are no longer competitive to produce in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Nena Models group is not confined to Castlefinn. Overall, Enterprise Ireland, the industrial development agency, which works closely with the company, considers the group to be still strong because of its branded business. I understand the group will continue to trade with its range of branded clothes, most of which will be outsourced, but this is no consolation to the workers who have lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, there is no trade union involvement in the company. However, it has indicated it will consult employees with regard to the redundancies. The full services of FÁS will be made available to those workers who wish to avail of their services. One-to-one interviews can be arranged to help people in a number of ways. Indeed, FÁS employment services in Ballybofey will be in contact with the company this week to arrange registration interviews. Following these, a skills analysis audit will be undertaken and appropriate retraining or job placement options will be offered to all the workers.</P>
      <P>The industrial development agencies are doing all they can to promote new investment in County Donegal and the north-west region generally. There were a number of overseas job announcements and investments over the past few years in Donegal town, Letterkenny and Buncrana among others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial development agencies, particularly IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and <Col N="524" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta, are continuing to promote the area. However, the final decision on where to locate a particular project ultimately rests with the promoter.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives are also being pursued in the region. Links between third level education and industry are ongoing. Cross-Border links have been developed. Furthermore, Letterkenny has been named as one of the new linked gateways in the recently launched national spatial strategy. A linked gateway is one in which two or more strong towns work in partnership to promote economic and social development in their region. The development of Letterkenny-Derry as a linked gateway will strengthen the north-west as Derry has been identified in the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland as a regional city for the north-west. A large effort has also gone into attracting expanding companies from Dublin and the east coast region to relocate to Donegal. This is very much part of the regional strategy for the area.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also working with community groups in the area to increase the level of enterprise space available for new businesses. Significant funding has been provided to Convoy Enterprise Centre. Enterprise Ireland has a comprehensive range of business development supports for clients in the Finn Valley area and these are available to support further development. I am satisfied that a focused agency approach together with a locally-based approach is what is needed to address the jobs problem in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the benefit of the flood relief scheme on the River Nore to Kilkenny city. However, recent events give cause for concern, most of which have dented public confidence in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Houses in John's Quay suffered a slippage at one stage during the implementation of the scheme. While this was being investigated, the remarks of the Office of Public Works in relation to the scheme and the condition of those houses were outrageous. The hotel at John's Bridge became another issue. It is suffering slippage at the waterside. There are concerns regarding the structure of Bridge House, a listed building beside the hotel.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee that was put in place, although it functions, does not give out at regular intervals information that would satisfy the public in respect of the works being carried out. In fact, some of the information being given out is inaccurate. When I tabled a parliamentary questions in the House to obtain more accurate information, I found that the information emerging locally contradicts that emerging at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" />A problem has arisen in respect of the spillage of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the river, which took place in 1980. Samples were taken from a particular section, where the spoil from the river is being spread. Out of 12 samples, two were found to contain levels of PCBs. The EPA has been called in, as have the health and safety authorities. While only two samples were found with PCBs content, no level is tolerable.</P>
    <P>The remark that the sites were secure is not true. They have not been secured. One site, where PCBs were found, can be accessed by children. It has been acknowledged by Dr. Stafford from the EPA that amenity areas are high-risk areas. Access to the soil cannot be permitted. However, access can be gained to the site.</P>
    <P>No samples have been taken at the site at Ossory Bridge. A third site exists at Riverside Drive. All these sites are accessed by the public and there is concern that there has been little or no reaction from the Office of Public Works in terms of informing the public. A press release was issued last week, but I have not seen any signage along the river indicating the dangers on the sites in question. I have not seen the other sites, although the Office of Public Works says they are secured, nor have I seen them being secured.</P>
    <P>Residents along the riverbank have asked to be consulted by the Office of Public Works in respect of other issues and they were told that the Office of Public Works had not even considered their position because they were not located on the maps that were shown.</P>
    <P>The public have deep concerns about health and safety matters because of this scheme. There is a need for the Department to build public confidence and engage immediately in a process that will inform the public. I suggest that the Minister of State visit this area and set up a display of what is happening so people will see what works are being, and have to be, undertaken as the scheme is being rolled out. There is a need for the Office of Public Works to strengthen its communication with the local authorities. We have ongoing meetings of Kilkenny Borough Council in which members have expressed deep concern at the fact that that body is being overlooked and is not receiving the kind of information one would expect given the size of the scheme being undertaken.</P>
    <P>All we ask is that the Minister of State views the scene, determines what needs to be done, puts in place a process to inform the public, deals immediately with the health and safety issues, has the sites in question secured properly and has appropriate signage erected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be familiar with the background to this issue. A spillage of PCBs from the brewery into the River Breagagh occurred in 1980, as the Deputy said. Most of this spillage was recovered immediately through the prompt <Col N="526" /> action of Guinness (Ireland) Limited. At that time, the Office of Public Works had no involvement with the Breagagh or Nore Rivers and was not, therefore, involved in the clean-up of the spillage or any subsequent redemption measures. The Office of Public Works's first involvement came much later as part of the preparation for the Kilkenny flood relief scheme. It had a survey carried out in 1997 to test for the presence of PCBs in the Breagagh and Nore Rivers. This identified some areas where PCBs were present in the riverbed at locations where the Office of Public Works intended to carry out dredging as part of the flood relief scheme.</P>
      <P>Guinness (Ireland) Limited agreed to carry out a further clean-up operation to remove any remaining traces of PCBs. This was done in consultation with Kilkenny County Council and Kilkenny Borough Council, the Office of Public Works, the Environmental Protection Agency, Dúchas and the South-Eastern Health Board. The work was managed by Project Management Ireland Limited and was completed early in 2002. The clean-up was carried out, in agreement with the EPA, to a Dutch standard for presence of PCBs and the material was removed for incineration abroad.</P>
      <P>The completion of this work left the way clear for the Office of Public Works to proceed with the flood relief scheme. The dredging of the riverbed is an essential part of the scheme to improve the flow of water in times of flood. The scheme involves removal of material from the riverbed and spreading it at Dukesmeadows, Bishopsmeadows and the Ossory Road. To date, the majority of the material removed has been spread at Dukesmeadow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the history of the PCBs spillage and in order to reassure residents at Dukesmeadow, the Office of Public Works agreed to sample the spoil and test it for PCBs. Twelve samples were taken and traces of PCBs above the clean-up level were found in two of these. These results were immediately made available to the Dukesmeadow residents' association in December 2002 and the Office of Public Works agreed to carry out further analysis of the test results to assess the significance of the findings. This issue is being taken seriously by the Office of Public Works. A group has been set up comprising representatives of the Office of Public Works, Kilkenny County Council, Kilkenny Borough Council, the EPA, the South-Eastern Health Board and Project Management Limited to deal with this issue. This group will meet on a regular basis until this issue is resolved. It is important to note that it is not planned to remove any further material from the river before July of this year. The immediate concern is to deal with the spoil that has already been removed. In consultation with the EPA and the South-Eastern Health Board, the Office of Public Works is undertaking immediately further com<Col N="527" /> prehensive testing and analysis of the spoil deposits. The results of this work will be available in approximately six weeks and decisions can then be made in light of them. The Office of Public Works and the contractor for the flood relief scheme are currently carrying out a risk analysis for all areas where work is currently taking place in the river to agree what actions need to be taken from a health and safety point of view.</P>
    <P>Based on the information available to date, the EPA can confirm that the present spoil deposits do not pose an immediate threat to public health. PCBs are harmful if ingested or if they come into direct contact with the skin, but the possibility of airborne PCBs does not arise given the nature of the spoil deposits. In addition, PCBs are relatively heavy and tend to sink in water and stick to soil or gravel. The Office of Public Works is taking steps to ensure that the spoil sites are adequately secured.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this issue is being managed well by the Office of Public Works in conjunction with the other relevant bodies. The Office of Public Works has been open with local residents on this matter, as with all other matters of concern arising from the flood relief scheme, and this policy will continue. I am confident the Office of Public Works will take whatever action is required in consultation with the relevant agencies when the results of the additional tests become available.

      <P>Cherry Orchard is one of the fastest growing areas in my constituency, but it is also, unfortunately, one of the most disadvantaged. The recent news that a primary school for the area was not to be considered in the current phase was a real slap in the face for residents. They have now been relegated to phase six which they feel puts them into a never-never land category and they are frustrated and annoyed that this project is being deferred again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wonderful plan has been drawn up for a new primary school which is imaginative and progressive. It includes pre-school facilities as well as a conventional primary school, a post-school facility and provision for a homework club and support groups. It represents a wonderful idea which gave a ray of hope to this very disadvan<Col N="528" /> taged community. It is estimated that about 1,000 children leave the area every day to attend primary schools in adjoining localities. Some walk and some use public transport. It is ironic that some of the parents who campaigned for school buses in 1988 are still campaigning for a primary school now. They have still not been successful in getting buses for their children, some of whom are, happily, in third level.</P>
    <P>It is almost as if there is a conspiracy to make school attendance in the area difficult. Children as young as eight have dropped out of school despite the fact that there are competent, willing and able volunteers in the area who are not legally entitled to provide an alternative form of educational facility. This is a matter that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. There is no attendance officer in the area to monitor these children and because they are spread around different primary schools it is virtually impossible to track what happens to them in terms of moving to second level. The drop-out rate is huge and is impossible to calculate.</P>
    <P>There is a wonderful new equine centre in the area which has been a great boost and looks like it will be widely used. However, it is of very little value if it is not supported by the other key infrastructural units which the area needs. There was a great sense of expectation at the prospect of the new school, but that has been replaced by anger and bitter disappointment in the local community. Parents saw the primary school as a pivotal part of the social and economic development of the area. Cherry Orchard needs that more than most areas and I call on the Minister to review the position and include this school in the plans for the current year rather than consign it to the also-ran group.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science with regard to the allocation of funding for school building projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2003 capital programme has been published and full details of individual projects are available on the Department of Education and Science website www.education.ie. The programme is designed to provide the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time. This year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million, which is four times the amount allocated in 1997, and delivers over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme. All primary schools benefit <Col N="529" /> directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his presence and I look forward to hearing his response which I hope refers to the continuation of an adequate casualty service at Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton, County Leitrim. That hospital serves the catchment area of north Leitrim, west Cavan and much of mid and south Leitrim as there is no proper accident and emergency service in the county.</P>
      <P>Less than two weeks ago a notice was placed on the door of Our Lady's Hospital which stated that casualty was closed. I lived in Manorhamilton for 11 years, during which time my family was able to access the casualty service at the hospital when faced with life-threatening crises. If I lived in Manorhamilton now that would not be the case, which is shocking. Those who live there and in surrounding areas no longer have access to a proper accident and emergency service. The Minister of State knows that you cannot put a price on such access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I came to the House, I had another look at the health strategy proposed by the Government. It has four goals, including fair access and responsive and appropriate care delivery. In the strategy we are told that the patient is at the centre of planning care delivery and that its underlying principle is to provide the right care in the right place at the right time. For the people of north Leitrim the right care is a continuation of the accident and emergency service which was in place until two weeks ago. The right place is Our Lady's Hospital in Manorhamilton and the right time is now. I understand that this is not a simple matter. I have been in contact with the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board who has outlined the difficulties faced by the board in trying to maintain the service. I am <Col N="530" /> not being unrealistic and unreasonable when I say that difficulties must be dealt with, issues must be faced and problems must be solved.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish Medical Council has issued new national guidelines and policies which dictate the circumstances in which junior doctors can operate in casualty units. The council has legitimate concerns, but while it has a very important role to play in ensuring the service is competent and professional, it is just one of the participants in this service. If, as the health strategy states, we must have the right care in the right place at the right time, the buck stops with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Rather than simply complain or accept that the doors have closed for good, I wish to put forward a workable suggestion. I propose that the service be maintained at Our Lady's which deals with life-threatening conditions and emergencies by stabilising patients before sending them by ambulance to Sligo General Hospital. This will have the effect of providing a service in Manorhamilton while taking some of the pressure off the casualty service in Sligo.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and the North-Western Health Board to do everything possible to ensure that staff in Manorhamilton get the maximum training from consultants in Sligo to deal with life-threatening crises, such as, for example, the administration of the thrombolytic drug scheme, whereby heart attack patients can be stabilised, thus significantly increasing their chances of survival.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to use his best efforts and negotiating skills to ensure that the notice which appeared on the door of Manorhamilton hospital two weeks ago, stating &ldquo;Casualty Closed&rdquo;, will be removed and that he will reinstate the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Harkin for the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton. Responsibility for the provision of services at Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton, rests with the North-Western Health Board. Accident and emergency, and casualty services for the counties of Sligo and Leitrim are provided at Sligo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton, consists of a rheumatology department and a community hospital. The rheumatology department is a regional service providing treatment for patients with muscular-skeletal disorders and-or physical disability for Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community hospital provides medical and rehabilitation services to the local community. A minor injury service has been provided at the hospital under the management of the medical officer and staffed by the rheumatology department. The service did not have the back up of <Col N="531" /> accident and emergency staff, anaesthetics, surgery, orthopaedic or paediatric services. No coronary care or intensive care services were provided on site.</P>
    <P>The Department was advised today by the board that the Medical Council recently indicated, as Deputy Harkin outlined in her speech, that non-consultant, trainee doctors in the rheumatology department could not continue to provide a service to this minor injuries unit in the absence of accident and emergency consultants. This ruling was made for the purposes of supervision and training. The Medical Council is the independent statutory body responsible for the establishment of standards in the medical profession. This, in effect, means that the unit could not be medically staffed. The chief executive officer of the board has advised that the hospital does not have the necessary critical mass of population to sustain the unit, having regard to the guidelines and policies of the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" />Accordingly, individuals who present to Our Lady's Hospital requiring acute assessment or treatment will be advised to attend their general practitioner or the emergency department at Sligo General Hospital. Patients who are referred by a general practitioner or a doctor to Sligo General Hospital will be accepted for follow-up nursing treatment in Our Lady's Hospital. Such treatment will include wound care, phlebotomy, administration of pre-prescribed medications and the removal of sutures.</P>
    <P>If a patient is brought to the hospital requiring life-saving measures, any doctor on duty will be contacted. When the patient is stabilised he or she will be transferred to Sligo by ambulance or cardiac ambulance for treatment. An ambulance service is based in Manorhamilton. I understand that the board has informed local general practitioners, schools and employers of the position.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 February 2003.</P>

      <P>The Údarás na Gaeltachta 2002 end of year review, which I have examined, shows that 2002 was a difficult year for the creation and retention of employment in the Gaeltacht. There was a net loss of 522 full-time jobs, which represents a reduction of 6% on the numbers employed at the end of 2001, mainly in the traditional manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group on the creation of employment in the Gaeltacht, which was published in December 2002, contains a number of recommendations regarding initiatives that should be pursued to attract new industry to the Gaeltacht. These include a major marketing initiative to attract modern knowledge based industry, the development of enterprise centres and initiatives aimed at fostering Irish language based job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Also arising from this report, Údarás na Gaeltachta has put together an action plan to tackle the significant unemployment problem in the north-west Donegal Gaeltacht and has taken an important step in appointing a senior officer to its regional office in Gweedore to oversee implementation of this plan.</P>
      <P>The review of the other recommendation of the working group is continuing by the Údarás and my Department to determine how they can be most effectively implemented.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 110, 126, 128 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>Under the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, are being set up in the ten health board regions throughout the country. The national drugs strategy team, which is overseeing the establishment of the RDTFs, has prepared guidelines for their operation in consultation with the relevant sectors and agencies.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have agreed that the existing regional drug co-ordinators will act as interim co-ordinators for the RDTFs. Given their knowledge and experience of the local drug problem and their relationship with local agencies and groups, I believe that the co-ordinators represent a significant resource which will greatly facilitate the setting up and initial development of the task forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national drugs strategy team will work closely with the interim co-ordinators in the setting up and ongoing development of the RDTFs. A liaison person from the team has been nominated to each task force and this person will act as a first point of contact and will work closely <Col N="536" /> with the interim co-ordinators and other interested parties to support the work of the task force.</P>
    <P>The RDTFs will represent a team-based response to illicit drug use. Each task force will be chaired by an independent chairperson and will be made up of nominees from state agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sector and elected public representatives. It is my intention that all of the regional task force members will work in partnership, in a manner similar to the local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>The national drugs strategy team met the interim co-ordinators on 28 January last to discuss the guidelines and how the inaugural meetings of the task forces should operate. The aim is to convene the first meeting of each task force by the end of March 2003. The agenda for the meeting will be agreed between the team and the interim co-ordinator, having regard to the varying needs of the different regions. However, it is envisaged that each agenda will comprise a number of core elements such as an overview of the national drugs strategy, the appointment of a selection committee to nominate a chairperson and a discussion of the structures and procedures as to how task force should conduct its business.</P>
    <P>The level of the budget available to the task forces has not yet been finalised. However, it is proposed that the task force action plans will be researched and developed in a number of stages. As the task forces will be primarily engaged in consultation and drafting their first action plan over the coming year, the bulk of funding required for 2003 will be for administrative purposes. Funding for future years will be considered in the context of the annual Estimates.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputies' questions, there are no local drugs task forces operating in the cities to which they refer. However, each of these cities will be included in the ambit of a regional drugs task force as I have described in my reply.</P>

      <P>The overall objective of the national drugs strategy is to significantly reduce the harm caused to individuals and society by drug misuse through a concerted focus on reducing supply, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</P>
      <P>The local drugs task forces, LDTFs, were set up in areas experiencing the highest levels of drugs misuse in order to have an effective framework in place for implementing the national drugs strategy at local level. The LDTFs are delivering a range of measures in the education, prevention and awareness areas. Their work is carried out through a partnership approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary sectors operating in their areas.</P>
      <P>Originally, 12 LDTFs were established in the greater Dublin area, in the north inner city, south inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot, Finglas-Cabra, Dublin 12 encompassing Crumlin, Drimnagh, Kimmage and Walkinstown, Dublin North East, canal communities encompassing Bluebell, Inchicore and Rialto, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. An LDTF was also set up in north Cork city, where the emphasis is primarily on prevention, and it has since been expanded to include all of Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initiatives implemented by the LDTFs include <Col N="538" /> community-based drug awareness in schools, youth clubs and other places where young people meet; drugs awareness programmes for parents, teachers, etc., peer education programmes, projects to prevent early school leaving and drug related prevention or rehabilitation programmes.</P>
    <P>To date, the LDTFs have produced two rounds of plans containing over 450 separate interventions, the majority of which are being delivered by local community and voluntary groups. By the end of October 2002, over &euro;62 million has been allocated to implement the plans of the local drugs task forces and to projects under the premises initiative for drugs projects. This figure also includes once-off allocations, evaluation, administration and development costs as well as a number of cross-task force projects. I have supplied the Deputies with a table providing a breakdown of the allocations by task force areas in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>I have also provided the Deputies with tables outlining the original allocations under the two action plans to individual projects in the Dublin and Cork task force areas. Allocations are for a 12 month basis and projects have also received interim funding and those that were mainstreamed would also have received other additional funding.</P>
    <P>There is also a local drugs task force in Bray which was set up in 2000 and, to date, has been allocated over &euro;1.5 million.</P>
    <P>Breakdown of allocations to Dublin and Cork task force areas to October 2002. Figures given to the nearest &euro;100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 111, 137, 152 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>I launched the CLÁR programme, Ceantair Laga Ard-Riachtanais, for disadvantaged rural areas on 5 October 2001.</P>
      <P>The 16 areas selected were those which have suffered the greatest depopulation since 1926, with the exception of the Cooley peninsula, which was included based on the serious difficulties caused for that area by foot and mouth disease. The average population loss in those areas was 50% and the total population to benefit from the programme was 284,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my consultations with the communities in the selected areas, the priorities identified were addressed under the various measures introduced in 2002 under the programme. These measures were agreed with the lead Departments or State agencies, as appropriate. Other measures <Col N="564" /> may be introduced this year, depending on needs identified.</P>
    <P>In 2002, &euro;14.14 million was spent under the various measures. It is not practical here to list all the measures and the expenditure details, so I am arranging to send them to the Deputies in the next few days.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering, in consultation with the other Departments and agencies, the allocations I propose to make for measures in 2003.</P>
    <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to annual funding for the CLÁR programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. Arising from the analysis of the preliminary 2002 population census results, which I commissioned from NUI Maynooth, the Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these additions on 17 January last.</P>
    <P>The number of DEDS in the revised programme has increased from 701 to 890 and the total population in the programme has increased from 284,000 to 362,000. Waterford is the only new county with areas being included. The average decline of population in the revised CLÁR areas is now 49.89%, excluding the Cooley Peninsula, the decline would be 50.32%.</P>
    <P>Although the provision for CLÁR programme is reduced from the 2002 allocation, I expect that I will be able to complete a comprehensive work programme in 2003. For example, I do not expect the exceptionally high level of expenditure on class 111 roads &ndash; nearly &euro;7 million of the &euro;14.14 million I spent in 2002 to arise again this year.</P>
    <P>CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources. The 2003 CLÁR allocation will be sufficient to continue this leverage and so sustain an effective programme.</P>
    <P>The Listowel rural DED was not included in the revised areas in County Kerry as the DED showed an increase in population &ndash; 1926-1996: +3.97% and 1926-2002: +4.32%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 121 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, RAPID is a focused initiative by the Government to target the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. The programme calls on Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services. There are two strands of the RAPID programme &ndash; strand I targets 25 urban areas while strand II targets 20 provincial towns around the country.</P>
      <P>I should point out that it is the role of my Department to co-ordinate the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, therefore, a matter for individual Departments to report on progress in relation to implementing RAPID proposals that fall within their own remit.</P>
      <P>In each of the areas, an area implementation team was established to prepare a plan. Plans were approved by the relevant city or county development boards, prior to being sent to the national co-ordinator for the programme at Area Development Management, ADM, Limited. Proposals from the plans were then forwarded to the relevant Department for consideration.</P>
      <P>The scale of the proposals in the plans is large and in many cases, the work involved in analysing projects is proving to be intensive. In addition, there are a number of indicative projects contained in the plans which have required additional information so as to enable Departments to clarify the nature, scale and cost of the projects.</P>
      <P>While progress in implementing the plans has been slower then anticipated, I think Deputies will agree that there is a need for some time to be granted to the funding agencies to enable them to consider the plans to ensure that the correct decisions are made and that the required funding is available to meet the priorities identified in the plans. In the meantime, it is important that the other key element of the RAPID programme, bringing about greater coherence in the delivery of all social inclusion measures, is addressed and implemented.</P>
      <P>As regards my own Department, proposals from the RAPID plans fall to be considered under the young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF, the community development programme, CDP, the CAIT initiative and funding for local drugs task force projects. The total estimated cost of these proposals is in the region of &euro;65 million.</P>

    <P>In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, the position is that the national assessment committee, NAC, of the fund, which is chaired by my <Col N="566" /> Department, is currently examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups under round two of the fund. With regard to services projects, the committee is awaiting the completion of the external evaluation of the fund before seeking such proposals under round two. The first draft of the evaluator's report was received in mid January 2003 and is being examined by the NAC at present. Proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round two and in light of the overall funding position for 2003.  </P>
    <P>A number of proposals in RAPID plans relate to the community development programme. While there has been no additional allocation of funding in respect of community development projects to date, the Deputies should note that in many cases pre-development work is under way. The full establishment of groups as community development projects in 2003 is subject to available resources but those in RAPID areas will receive due priority.</P>
    <P>As regards proposals in strand II plans for funding under the CAIT initiative, the budget has been fully committed to the successful proposals submitted between March and May 2002. No additional funding is available to distribute among project proposals received since then.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals from the RAPID plans are being pursued through the local drugs task forces. Regarding CLÁR, I refer the Deputy to my replies this afternoon to questions on this programme.</P>
    <P>It is important to restate that the Government remains committed to the RAPID Programme and its implementation. The 45 areas selected have been consistently targeted as areas of special need through various Government interventions over the past few years and this will continue under the implementation of the different RAPID plans.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Deputies should note that my officials have had a number of bi-lateral meetings with other relevant Departments over the past few months to try and advance the implementation of the programme and I would hope to meet with my ministerial colleagues in the other Departments in the coming weeks to further advance the plans.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the <Col N="567" /> RAPID programme is a focused initiative by Government to target the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. Priority attention is given under the programme to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through front-loading State resources, available under the national development plan. The programme also calls on Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services.</P>
      <P>There are two strands of the RAPID programme &ndash; strand I targets 25 urban areas, and strand II targets 20 provincial towns around the country. While the allocation of specific staff to deal with the RAPID programme is a matter for individual Departments, the Deputy may wish to note that a series of meetings, at official level, were held between my Department and other Departments during the latter part of last year to progress the implementation of the RAPID Programme. From discussions at these meetings, I am satisfied that Departments have put in place sufficient staff resources to deal with the RAPID programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should note that the budget for funding of drugs services provided by my Department has increased by 16% in 2003, although the overall level of funding available to the Department has decreased. The increase in expenditure for 2003 clearly reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to addressing the problem, particularly in areas where heroin misuse is most prevalent. While there may be additional demands on the subhead in 2003, I believe that through this increased allocation and close monitoring of spending, we can address such demands over the course of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on dispersed rural communities are well known to Members of this House. I have spoken many times in relation to the need for a settlement pattern that would <Col N="568" /> allow for the regeneration of rural areas, particularly those which have suffered continuous decline. Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in August 1999. As a result the Government is committed to ensuring the economic and social well being of rural communities and providing the conditions for a meaningful fulfilling life for all people living in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The aim is that there will be vibrant and sustainable communities able to enjoy a standard of living and quality of life which will make them attractive communities in which to live and work and where individuals and families will have a real choice as to where to stay in, leave or move to rural Ireland, whether in farming or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Rural communities should also be able to enjoy access to education, training and lifelong learning and an adequate level of social and other services and infrastructures. Their cultural identities, in particular the language, traditions, heritage and sense of community must be valued and retained.</P>
      <P>In my statement welcoming the publication of the national spatial strategy last November, I said the strategy sets down clear markers for the way ahead in rural development. The strategy addresses many of my concerns in relation to such issues as rural housing, services and cultural identity.</P>
      <P>As further evidence of the Government's commitment, I launched the CLÁR programme for disadvantaged rural areas in October 2001, during my time as Minister of State with responsibility for rural development. Last month, I announced the extension of CLÁR areas arising from the review, based on the 2002 population census, and as promised in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The breakdown on an individual allocation basis for each of the measures included in the budget Estimates for 2003 under subhead J, formerly subhead U, is provided in the following table. The table also includes details of the expenditures in 2002 and the amount sought in the Estimates for 2003 as requested by the Deputy. Subhead J1 includes the community development support programmes, grants to locally based community and family support groups, training and support services to the community and voluntary sector, funded under the White Paper for volun<Col N="570" /> tary activity, national networks of federations of community and voluntary groups funded under the White Paper for voluntary activity, C and V supports for implementation and advisory group and funding for national organisations working for the re-integration of prisoners. The precise allocation of funding as between the individual schemes for 2003 has yet to be determined as this will be dictated by the level of applications for grants to be advertised shortly.</P>
    <P>The figure of &euro;25.07 million, which is mentioned in the briefing for a meeting in September 2002 with the estimates review committee, included provision for the family and community services resource centre, FRC, has in fact remained under the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The scale of the reduction in funding to the community development support programmes is therefore less significant than figures suggests.</P>

      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on State subsidised transport services to the Aran Islands was published in September 2002. Following on from this report, my Department has advanced a number of measures to ensure best practice in relation to the award of contracts, quality of services, and value for money for subsidised island transport services.</P>
      <P>These measures include the development of a management information framework which will provide the Department with enhanced financial and non-financial systems and quality management information; the appointment of independent assessors to critically review and validate each future tendering process; the allocation of additional staff to the area so as to strengthen control and compliance with contract requirements; a specially designed software package which will enable more rigorous monitoring of the performance of all subsidised ferry operators; and an imminent competition for independent consultants to review other issues raised in the comptroller and Auditor General's report and to provide future performance indicators.</P>
      <P>The independent consultants to which I have just referred will review the ferry services to the Aran Islands as part of their brief. I have recently approved draft terms of reference for the study concerned and a steering committee has been put in place to oversee the project. This committee consists of the Dingle harbour master together with representatives from my Department, from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and from the Marine Institute. The first meeting of the committee was convened on Monday, 3 February, at which the terms of reference for the study were finalised. It is intended to convene a further meeting in early March at which, it is expected, tender documents will be agreed with a view to seeking tenders for the study shortly afterwards.</P>

      <P>The allocation for 2003 in respect of rural development cross-Border programmes is &euro;13.8 million. This includes LEADER and the rural development measures in Peace II and INTERREG III.

      <P>The funding available to me for island development has risen from &euro;7.8 million in 2002 to &euro;8.479 million this year, representing a welcome increase of 8%. It is my view that this allocation will enable me to fulfil my commitment to improving access to the islands. Since 1997, my Department has invested nearly &euro;30 million in the improvement of island infrastructure and access services. This investment has included funding for many capital projects &ndash; from the improvement of pier infrastructure to the provision of helicopter landing pads on the islands together with the introduction of new and improved ferry and air transport services. Subject to resources, the capital projects aimed at improving island access which it is proposed to fund over the coming years include major works on the ferry access piers on Clare Island and Inishturk and at Roonagh on the mainland, which serves these two islands, at an estimated total cost of &euro;13.5 million; major improvement works costing over &euro;2.4 million on the ferry landing facilities at Machaire Rabhartaigh on the mainland serving Tory Island and Inishboffin, County Donegal; the provision of a cablecar and new slipways to provide access to Inishbiggle; the improvement of piers on the Aran Islands; the construction of new piers on Clynish, Inishlyre and Insegort in Clew Bay; and the construction of airstrips on Inishboffin, County Galway and Tory Island.</P>
      <P>The improvement of island access through the regular ferry services and, in certain cases, air services is of particular interest to the islanders. With this in mind, my Department now subsidises ferry services to 14 different islands, in addition to a fixed wing air service to the Aran Islands and a winter helicopter service to Tory Island. This compares very favourably to the five islands which were served by State assisted services in 1997. It has been, and will continue to be, my Departments policy to improve, where possible, the standard and regularity of these services as contracts come up for renewal.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work.</P>
      <P>When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. In the past five years, however, the take up has been dropping significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs in recent years. In view of the above and in light of the financial pressures on my Department, it has been decided to discontinue the students summer job scheme. I have, however, requested the area based partnerships to consider alternative measures to assist students from disadvantaged areas in finding suitable summer employment.</P>

      <P>In order to advise me on the actions necessary to give practical implementation to the proposals contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, I established an advisory committee last October. The committees recommendations will form the basis of action plans which will have deliverable targets and will be aimed at strengthening the Irish language in Gaeltacht communities. Considerable progress has been made to date.</P>
      <P>For instance, the commissions report contained various recommendations, one of which related to the need to conduct a comprehensive linguistic survey of Irish usage in the Gaeltacht. This issue was discussed by the advisory committee at its most recent meeting on 13 January and on foot of that discussion, I have decided to commission such a study as the basis for the linguistic development of the Gaeltacht as an Irish-speaking area and a review of the Gaeltacht boundaries. In addition a sub-group of the committee is currently preparing an action plan which will be targeted specifically at parents of young children in the Gaeltacht with the aim of heightening awareness of the advantages of choosing Irish as the home language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions relating to various issues raised in the commissions report have also been initiated with relevant Departments, for example, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science, and meetings have already been held to progress these issues further. As Minister with responsibility for <Col N="575" /> the Gaeltacht, it is my intention to implement, in so far as possible and within the context of the resources available to me, whatever measures are considered to be necessary and effective for promoting and strengthening the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>My Department is presently establishing a strategy group with broad remit including monitoring the operation of the delivery of the rural agri-tourism measure under the national rural development programme in the regional operational Programmes. Nominations have been invited from the farm organisations, rural organisations, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Irish Sports Council and tourism promotion groups. The inaugural meeting of the rural &ndash; agri &ndash; tourism strategy group is scheduled to take place in February. The walkways access situation will be included on the agenda for discussion in the strategy group. I have also discussed the situation with the IFA and made clear that the concept of open access to the countryside that has always existed is fundamental. I have made clear my view that any proposal for Exchequer payment for access would not in principle be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Discussions are being scheduled with FÁS to ascertain the extent to which work on walkways maintenance might involve farmers. Ultimately, I believe that the access problem can be resolved through a local community approach, recognising that the value of walkways in generating tourism accommodation and income accrues to the community where farmers and other rural dwellers live.</P>

      <P>I have not raised directly with An Post its proposal to end door to door deliveries in rural areas. However, I recently conveyed my views to the postal regulator in response to the consultation paper on the regulation of the postal services. In my view, the definition of &ldquo;public road&rdquo; should be expanded to include local improvement scheme-repaired roads that are tarred at public expense but often are not taken in charge for maintenance by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>As regards An Post's programme to persuade rural residents to use roadside letterboxes by mutual agreement, I would underline the need to implement such a policy in a sensitive manner taking account of the needs of vulnerable rural residents, for example disabled and older people, many of whom live alone. As regards the latter category, it will be recalled that the security scheme for the elderly was introduced some years ago in response to attacks on vulnerable older people mainly in isolated rural communities. The scheme continues to meet an ongoing demand, highlighting the need for state services to adopt as far as practicable an integrated approach to the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>Accordingly I believe that people over 65 years of age or people with disabilities should not be required to use roadside letterboxes. I agree that three kilometres, as proposed, is a reasonable maximum distance that a person would have to travel in a rural area to post a letter in a standard envelope. I am pleased to note the proposed guarantee in the consultation paper of daily deliveries to rural dwellers.</P>

      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to bring in a comprehensive reform of the law relating to charities. The <Col N="579" /> legislative reform will be advanced through a number of stages. A review of existing charity law has now been undertaken by consultants and consideration of the report is nearing completion. The White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity, published in 2000, provides that the community and voluntary sector will be consulted on the legislation through the implementation and advisory group established by the Government to oversee the implementation of the White Paper's recommendations. The consultants' review of charity law has been circulated to the implementation and advisory group, which is considering the report.</P>
      <P>The key issues regarding an appropriate regulatory framework will be identified and incorporated into a consultation document. A consultation process, informed by the consultation document, will be initiated with a view to encouraging extensive public discussion on the legislative reform required. Proposals for legislative reform in relation to charities and charitable fundraising will be brought forward as soon as possible following completion of the consultation process.</P>

      <P>A funding scheme to support federations and networks in the community and voluntary sector was one of a number of measures introduced by the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity with the objective of supporting and developing the sector. The scheme, which was advertised on 22 October 2001, attracted 152 applications which required detailed examination and assessment, carried out with the assistance of the White Paper's implementation and advisory group. The group, which consists of both statutory and voluntary representatives, is tasked with advising on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the White Paper. A number of issues arose in the course of processing the applications received under the scheme which it was considered could give rise to legal challenge. In order to ensure that eventual funding decisions would command full public confidence, it was considered necessary to re-advertise the scheme and to seek fresh applications. <Col N="580" /> Revised application procedures are nearing completion in my Department and it is envisaged that the scheme will be re-advertised very shortly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that one of the key objectives underlying the establishment of my Department is the achievement of a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with urban and rural communities around the country as they pursue their development. My Department operates a range of grant schemes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, community support for older people and the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs. In addition, long-term funding is provided to locally based voluntary and community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives through the community development support programmes.</P>
      <P>Under the local development measure of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan, funding is available to 38 partnerships, 33 community groups and four territorial employment pacts that deliver the programme at local level. Partnerships and community groups operate in areas designated by the Government as disadvantaged. My Department is also responsible for the RAPID programme, which is a focused initiative to target the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. It calls on Government Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services. There are two strands of the RAPID programme &ndash; strand one targets 25 urban areas while strand two targets 20 provincial towns around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader programmes agreed with the Commission in 2001 will operate until December 2006 and will be subject to an independent mid-term review at the end of this year. My Department will contribute to the overall review process and will seek maximum support from the Commission. My Department will continue to implement the current Leader programmes to give the maximum benefit to rural communities. In October 2001, I introduced the CLÁR programme for disadvantaged rural areas. An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to continue the CLÁR programme, ensuring annual funding, and to consider <Col N="581" /> additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. Last month, I announced a substantial expansion of the CLÁR areas.</P>
    <P>Rural and community development will continue to benefit from programmes of the nature I have outlined. There is a clear need to streamline and integrate structures, processes and schemes to achieve more effective and efficient support for communities. This will be done against the background of and with reference to developments at EU level. Within the various schemes and programmes for which I have responsibility and through influencing other Departments, I aim to ensure that communities continue to be supported and strengthened through a range of support frameworks.</P>

      <Quest>the number of students in County Offaly who participated in the student summer job scheme each year since 1993; the number who qualified for the extra allowance due to the fact that their parents were on a qualifying social welfare income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The student summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well-off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work. When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult to obtain work during the holiday period. In the past five years, however, the take-up has been dropping significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well-paid summer jobs in recent years. In view of that and in light of the financial pressures on my Department, it has been decided to discontinue the scheme. I have, however, requested the area based partnerships to consider alternative measures to assist students from disadvantaged areas in finding suitable summer employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The breakdown of students who availed of the student summer jobs scheme in County Offaly since 1993 is as follows. The extra payment for students whose parents were dependent on social welfare was first paid in 1995 for one year only and then again in 2001 and 2002.<Col N="582" /></P>

      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, foilsíodh Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Comhionannas) 2002 i mí Aibreáin 2002. I measc na bhforálacha a leagtar síos sa Bhille, tá foráil <Col N="584" /> maidir le freagracht ghinearálta a chur ar an Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta maidir le seirbhísí Stáit a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge. Tugtar sonraí sa Bhille maidir le próiseas pleanála reachtúil a bheidh le comhlánú ag comhlachtaí poiblí agus ag Ranna Rialtais i ndáil le seirbhísí a chur ar fáil sna teangacha oifigiúla. Is faoi réir an phróisis pleanála sin, ar a dtabharfar &ldquo;scéim&rdquo;, a leagfar síos dualgas comhlachtaí poiblí chun a chinntiú gur féidir le daoine cumarsáid a dhéanamh leo, agus seirbhísí a fháil uathu, i gceachtar de na teangacha oifigiúla. Ní miste a rá chomh maith go leagtar amach sa Bhille freisin an nós imeachta i gcás ina mbeifear ag iarraidh scóip an Bhille a leathnú amach anseo chuig earnálacha den gheilleagar, seachas an earnáil phoiblí, a ghabhann do sheirbhisí a sholáthar go díreach don phobal.</P>
      <P>Is fiú a rá freisin gur ghlac an Rialtas i mí Iúil 2000 le comhionannas teangacha oifigiúla mar cheann de na prionsabal le haghaidh seirbhís ardchaighdeáin don chustaiméir. Sonraítear faoin bprionsabal seo go ndéanfaidh an Státchoras seirbhísí d'ardchaigheáin a sholáthar i nGaeilge agus nó go dátheangach agus go gcuirfear in iúl do chustaiméirí go bhfuil an ceart acu a roghnú go ndéileáilfear leo i gceann amháin de na teangacha oifigiúla. Ar ndóigh réitigh Bord na Gaeilge, mar a bhí, treoirlínte neamhreachtúla i 1993 maidir le seirbhísí Stáit a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge agus tá dualgas ar Fhoras na Ghaeilge, a thagann faoi scáth mo Roinnse, féachaint chuige go bhfuil na treoirlínte sin á feidhmiú.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>The young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities &ndash; including sport and recreational facilities &ndash; and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. While the primary focus of the fund is on the 14 local drug task force areas established in Dublin, Bray and Cork, it also operates in Waterford, Galway, Carlow and Limerick. Funding of &euro;1.9 million has been made available to these four areas and these allocations are due to finish in 2003. Details of the breakdown of the projects involved are included in the following tables, which also indicate the level of contact with the target group. There was no yearly budget allocated as the allocations were granted over the lifetime of the various projects across the four cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to future funding, the fund's national assessment committee, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining the projects funded under the first round of the fund with a view to continuing their financing up to the end of 2006. Funds that are found to be effective will, subject to resources, be mainstreamed, thereby enabling ongoing provision by statutory agencies. Qualification for continued funding will also be dependant on the successful assessment <Col N="586" /> of each project by the services steering group set up to examine the projects. The steering group, consisting of members of the national assessment committee and the four principal vocational education committees &ndash; the City of Dublin Youth Services Board, County Dublin VEC, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC and the City of Cork VEC &ndash; will make recommendations to the committee on the projects to receive continued funding.</P>
    <P>The steering group has contacted each development group in the areas involved setting out the procedure to be followed. The decision making process should be completed by mid-March 2003 with a view to the national assessment committee making recommendations to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion shortly thereafter. Each project has been provided with interim funding pending the outcome of the evaluation process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The student summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well-off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work. When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult to obtain work during the holiday period. In the past five years, however, the take-up has been dropping significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well-paid summer jobs in recent years. In view of that and in light of the financial pressures on my Department, it has been decided to discontinue the scheme. I have, however, requested the area based partnerships to consider alternative measures to assist students from disadvantaged areas in finding suitable summer employment.</P>

      <P>At a recent meeting of the advisory committee which I established in October 2002 to advise me on the actions necessary to give practical implementation, where appropriate, to the proposals contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, the issue of Gaeltacht boundaries was discussed. On foot of those discussions, I have decided to commission an independent linguistic study of Irish usage in the Gaeltacht areas as a basis for the linguistic development of the Gaeltacht as an Irish-speaking area and as a basis for a review of Gaeltacht boundaries. This study will be of critical importance, not least to the success of any action plan emanating from the work of the advisory committee. The precise terms of reference for the study are currently being drafted by my Department.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Rural Development published in 1999, sets out a vision and a framework for the development of rural communities and marks a new approach and commitment by Government to rural development. The overall strategy decided by Government provides for balanced regional development to ensure that the benefits of economic progress are distributed throughout rural areas investment in services and infrastructure, sustainable economic development, human resources development and a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The national development plan is the vehicle for delivering the commitments in the White Paper. There is a specific chapter on rural development with a commitment to public investment of &euro;8.5 billion over the period 2000-2006 in actions which directly impact on rural areas. These range from payments to farmers on, for example headage and REPS, to rural infrastructure, capital investment in the food sector and rural enterprises. Many of the other investments in the plan will also have indirect benefits for rural communities such as employment development, better roads and transport services, new housing and improved health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the national development plan investments, I also introduced, in October 2001, the CLÁR programme for disadvantaged rural <Col N="594" /> areas. An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to continue the CLÁR programme, ensuring annual funding, and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. Last month I announced the revision of the CLÁR areas. It is not practical here to outline every topic covered in the White Paper. However, I am sending separately to the Deputy a detailed progress report, presented to the National Rural Development Forum at its meeting in Portumna on 17 January last, which outlines the position up to the end of 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department assists the training and development of voluntary workers through a range of measures. I welcome the opportunity to outline these to the Deputy and to advise of current developments. The Deputy should note that these schemes do not differentiate between urban and rural communities.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a range of once-off grant schemes which concentrate on the provision of support for local self-help groups and community development. These grant schemes are aimed at developing people and their capacity to participate in society.</P>
      <P>The community development education and training grants scheme has a specific focus on the training and development of voluntary workers. Under this scheme, funding is provided to local community and voluntary groups towards training and education programmes which strengthen and increase the skills and knowledge of management committees and others active in community and voluntary organisations. The once-off grant schemes for 2003 will be advertised later in the year. In addition, regional support agencies have been contracted by my Department to provide ongoing advice and support to projects in the community development support programmes. In this context, training and development supports are provided to the voluntary management committees of the projects to help them develop the necessary skills associated with running community development projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity, published in September 2000, recognised the increased need for training and supports for the community and voluntary sector. The White Paper included a commitment by the Government to provide a new funding scheme to develop training and supports within the community and voluntary sector. Training and sup<Col N="595" /> ports to be funded under this scheme include management and organisational development and professional development of staff and volunteers; provision of education and training programmes for staff and volunteers; and specialist assistance in areas such as recruitment and legal incorporation.</P>
    <P>The scheme was advertised in 2002 and some 540 applications were received from throughout the country. The appointment of a suitable consultant to assess these applications is under way. While the scheme is national in its scope one of the criteria employed in the assessment of applications received is the geographical balance achieved in the training and support services provided to target groups. In this regard the achievement of quality training for the sector, whether rural or urban based, is the primary objective.</P>
    <P>The Implementation and Advisory Group, IAG, which was established to advise on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the White Paper has as one of its terms of reference the monitoring of developments in accreditation of training for the sector. The IAG has recently begun its consideration of the relevant issues in this area. Training and accreditation issues were considered also by the National Committee on Volunteering and a number of recommendations in this regard are contained in its report to Government, Tipping The Balance. The report and its recommendations are currently being considered by officials in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the number of students in County Wicklow who participated in the student summer job scheme each year since 1993; the number who qualified for the extra allowance due to the fact that their parents were on a qualifying social welfare income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work. When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. In the past five years, however, the take up has been dropping significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs in recent years. In view of the above and in light of the financial <Col N="596" /> pressures on my Department, it has been decided to discontinue the students' summer job scheme. I have, however, requested the area based partnerships to consider alternative measures to assist students from disadvantaged areas in finding suitable summer employment.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of students who availed of the student summer jobs scheme in County Wicklow since 1993 is as shown in the following table. The extra payment for students whose parents were dependent on social welfare was first paid in 1995 for one year only and then again in 2001 and 2002.</P>

      <P>The young people's facilities and services fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the fund, Bray has been allocated an amount of &euro;571,382 over a three-year period and funding is in place until 2004. Details of the projects for which funding was allocated follow. With <Col N="597" /> respect to future funding of the projects, the national assessment committee, NAC, of the fund, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups under round two of the fund. Decisions on round two will be made in the light of the overall funding position for 2003.</P>
    <P>The NAC is also examining the services projects funded under round one of the fund. The intention would be where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed by enabling their on-going provision by statutory agencies. However, as Bray has funding in place until 2004, their projects will not be appraised until next year.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion has allocated &euro;1,465,786 to support the implementation of projects under the Bray local drugs task force first action plan. In addition, Bray has been allocated an amount of &euro;76,184 under the premises initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department <Col N="600" /> has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. The strategy aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. The strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by end 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary.</P>
      <P>Since it was launched in May 2001, considerable progress has been made by Departments and agencies in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. The inter-departmental group on drugs, IDG, which I chair, meets regularly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set for them and any obstacles to the implementation of any of the actions are brought to light at these meetings. Six-monthly progress reports on the strategy are provided to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the most recent of which was presented in September last. In terms of progress, it should be noted that guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drugs policy have also been developed and were issued to all primary and post primary schools in May 2002; the Department of Education and Science, which a is now represented on all local drugs task forces, is recruiting extra support staff to enable the delivery of substance misuse prevention programme in all schools in the next three years.</P>
      <P>Schools in the local drugs task force areas will be prioritised in this context; a joint substance use policy committee from the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science has also been convened and is, at present, addressing the supports needed to assist in the implementation of the guidelines by schools; the Department of Health and Children has established a cross-sectoral committee to develop an on-going national awareness campaign. This campaign, which is due to be launched in March, will target a number of groups, including young people; in addition, the Department chairs a group tasked with the development of a protocol for the treatment of under-18s and good progress is being made in this area; and the report of the benzodiazepine working group was published in December last. The Department of Health and Children will oversee the implementation of its recommendations.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress is also being made as regards increasing the number of methadone treatment places. The number of places at the end of October 2002, the latest date for which confirmed figures are available, was 6,446. The equivalent figure at the end of December 2000 was 5,032.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" />The national advisory committee on drugs is currently overseeing a three year research programme on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug use in Ireland and has made considerable progress in this regard. With regard to the actions in the strategy relevant to the NACD, the Deputy should note that the homeless population research study has been commissioned and a draft report is expected in the autumn. The negotiations on the Traveller population research are currently ongoing and it is planned to commence work shortly. A longitudinal study on treatment outcomes commenced in November and a review of the harm reduction mechanisms for injecting drug users in an Irish context is also under way with a draft literature review due by April.</P>
    <P>In relation to the regional drugs task forces, nominations have been sought from the various sectors, including statutory, community and voluntary. In addition, the national drugs strategy team has prepared guidelines on their operation in consultation the relevant sectors and agencies. The team met with the interim co-ordinators on 28 January to discuss the guidelines and the inaugural meetings of the task forces. The aim is to convene the first meeting of each task force by the end of March 2003.</P>
    <P>My Department also has responsibility for the work of the local drugs task forces, which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. Currently, there are 14 local drugs task forces, 12 in Dublin, one in Cork, and one in Bray, which was, designated an LDTF area in 2000. All the LDTFs, with the exception of Bray, are currently implementing their second round of action plans and, to date, over &euro;14.5 million has been allocated. In total, the Government has allocated over &euro;51 million to implement the projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997. The Deputy should note that in addition to the moneys available under the action plans, &euro;12.7 million was provided under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas. To date, over &euro;11 million has been allocated to projects under this initiative.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also note that the young people's facilities and services fund operates in the 14 local drugs task force areas and in a number of other urban centres, in Limerick, Galway, Carlow and Waterford. The main aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. An amount of approximately &euro;59 million has been allocated to date under the first round of funding. It is intended to submit a further progress report on the strategy to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in April 2003.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Planning and Development Act 2000, requires, <i>inter alia, </i>that all county development plans must contain policy objectives regarding the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht including the promotion of Irish as the community language, where there is a Gaeltacht in the area of the development plan. While not wishing to comment on specific proposals contained in the draft development plan for County Galway, I would generally support any reasonable and practical measures which seek to protect and foster the language in Gaeltacht areas in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>My Department submitted its views in relation to that part of the County Galway draft plan pertaining to the Gaeltacht by way of a written submission on 5 February last and informed Galway County Council of its willingness to offer whatever appropriate support and advice necessary in assisting the council in its legally binding responsibilities regarding the protection of the linguistic heritage of the Gaeltacht. I am separately mailing a copy of the submission available to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 4 of the regulations under the Act, which relates to control of development, obliges planning authorities to notify both myself, as Minister, and Údarás na Gaeltachta where the development would materially affect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work.</P>
      <P>When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the European Union and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. In the past five years, however, the take up has been dropping significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs in recent years. In view of the above and in light of the financial pressures on my Department, it has been decided to discontinue the scheme. I have, however, requested the area based partnerships to consider alternative measures to assist students from disadvantaged areas in finding suitable summer employment.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of students who availed of the scheme in County Kerry since 1993 is as shown below. The extra payment for students whose parents were dependent on social welfare was first paid in 1995 for one year only and then again in 2001 and 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. This target applies across the Civil Service and not just to individual Departments. As at December 2001 &ndash; the most recent figures available &ndash; the percentage of people with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.78%; the position in my Department and the Legal Aid Board was 2.61% and 2.29% respectively. I am informed that this figure may be somewhat higher as there are people with disabilities employed throughout the Civil Service who do not wish to declare their disability.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance wrote some time ago to all heads of Departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target. For my part, I am anxious to ensure that this is achieved and my Department continues to liaise with the Civil Service Commission in an effort to recruit people with disabilities wherever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested to note that in light of the commitment in the PPF and in order to establish how to improve adherence to the target, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Civil Service Commission, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Irish Civil Service. The research is completed and will be published in early 2003. The research maps out the <Col N="605" /> current arrangements in respect of career progression for people with disabilities, highlights the challenges they face when seeking to progress their careers and makes recommendations for a model of best practice in this area for the future. I look forward to reviewing its findings in due course.</P>

      <P>The legal requirement for motorists to have third-party insurance cover arises out of the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts and these come within the responsibility of the Minister for Transport. An agreement drawn up between the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland and the Minister for the Environment provides for compensation arrangements for innocent victims of uninsured drivers. The relevant section of that Department now forms part of the Department of Transport.</P>

      <P>I understand that when the extent of the difficulties facing the company began to emerge, the board and management of IFI considered a very wide range of options for the company which might provide a basis for establishing a viable business going forward, most of which would have entailed the Arklow plant remaining operational. While I was apprised of the company's efforts in this regard, it was not my role to seek plans for particular options, such as the feasibility of having a stand-alone operation at Arklow.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, despite the identification of a number of significant cost savings as part of the efforts made to save the company, it was not possible to establish a basis for a viable future for the company and the board decided that it had no option but to cease trading.</P>

      <P>I understand that the liquidation is progressing in an orderly and efficient manner. However, efforts by the liquidator to sell all or part of the assets of the company on a going-concern basis have, unfortunately, been unsuccessful to date.</P>
      <P>The liquidator has also advised me that, based on legal advice received, he has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements to enhanced redundancy payments. It is estimated that these claims increase the total value of unsecured creditors compared with the statement of affairs produced by the board in November last by more than &euro;60 million, although any dividend payable to the workers concerned will be reduced by the amounts received from the ex gratia fund of &euro;24.5 million provided by the shareholders. It is expected that these additional claims will have the effect of reducing the prospective dividend to unsecured creditors generally.</P>
      <P>The liquidator has updated me on certain issues concerning pensions issues for the employees based in Belfast and, in particular, that he has appointed Hogg Robinson Trustees Ltd. as independent trustees of the staff retirement benefit plan covering employees in Belfast. It is understood that he was required to make such an appointment under the relevant pensions regulations applicable in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>the reason retired members of the Permanent Defence Force receive a major cut in pension when qualifying for a retirement pension from the Department of Social and Family Affairs at age 65 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces pensions schemes provide for the payment to a retired NCO or private of a special increment &ndash; currently &euro;6.64 per week &ndash; in addition to basic pension for each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years. As a general rule, the special increment continues to be payable until the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension, at age 65, or old age contributory pension, at age 66, at which stage the increment ceases to be payable. The maximum personal rate of either social welfare pension, &euro;157.30 per week, is considerably greater than the maximum special increment, &euro;66.40 per week.</P>
      <P>The current arrangements are in accordance with the principle of integrating occupational benefits with social insurance benefits in the case of employees, such as NCOs and privates, who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts. The method of integration used in the case of NCOs and privates is more advantageous than the standard method of full integration applicable in other public service employments.</P>
      <P>The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the Commission on Public Service Pensions in its final report, published in January 2001. The commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pensions framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. While the commission did recommend a modified integration method in the case of public servants who retire on relatively low levels of pay, this recommendation will have no impact on the current arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and privates.</P>
      <P>Previously, the application of the integration principle in the case of NCOs and privates was specifically considered in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission, which did not recommend any change in the arrangements in operation.</P>

Slaughter premium advance payment totalling &euro;512 and <Col N="614" /> national envelope top-up advance payment of &euro;36.56 issued at the correct rate in respect of all eligible animals. The balancing payments are due to issue in April 2003. The person named submitted one application in respect of ten animals for the 22-month tranche of premium under the 1995 special beef premium scheme. Following an on-farm inspection it was discovered that six of the animals were ineligible on age grounds. The person named was found to have made a false declaration due to serious negligence and was thus excluded from the special beef premium scheme for the calendar year 1995. The moneys paid to the person named were subsequently recouped from moneys due to him under 1997 and 1998 premia schemes. Thus there are no outstanding payments due to the person named in respect of the special beef premium scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named participated in the 2001 extensification premium opting for the census system. Based on his own declarations, the person named had a stocking density of 1.9941 livestock units per hectare. This would qualify him for payment of extensification premium at the low rate of payment. Prior to payment the Department is required to carry out stocking density cross-checks against the CMMS database to ensure that the true stocking densities of holdings are within payment guidelines. Initially, the outcome of this cross-check revealed a discrepancy involving some five animals that had the effect of bringing the stocking density of the holding to outside of payment limits. The discrepancy has since been resolved and a payable order for &euro;1,485.00 due to the person named issued to him on 20 January 2003. On the same date a payable order for &euro;14.85 due in euro compensation also issued. The sums paid represent payment on the 45 male animals on which 2001 special beef premium had already been paid.</P>

The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered extreme hardship as a result of the milk quota system. However, the named person may be eligible for a new entrant allocation under the milk quota restructuring scheme if he satisfies certain criteria in relation to age, education, etc. This scheme is operated on behalf of my Department by co-operatives and dairies and I recently announced some changes for the 2003-04 quota year. These <Col N="616" /> will allow a qualified young person to purchase a new entrant quota allocation and set up as a milk producer in their own right on their parents' holding provided they form a milk production partnership together.

      <P>The person named was an applicant under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. It is a requirement of the scheme that a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare must be met. The animals required to establish the minimum stocking density must be owned, possessed, held and maintained by the applicant on the holding for at least four months of the year. The Department is satisfied that the animals in this case were not in the ownership and possession of the person named or maintained on his holding for four months. He has been written to on this basis and given the opportunity to appeal the decision to the agriculture appeals office, Post Office Box 5, Portlaoise, County Laois.</P>

      <P>To be eligible for slaughter premium animals must be slaughtered in licensed meat export premises, local abattoirs within the EU or exported live to a non-EU country. On 15 April 2002 three animals were sold by the person named for export to Northern Ireland. Animals slaughtered in Northern Ireland are recorded by Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland and the details are transferred to my Department's database to be verified against the relevant export details. Payment issues automatically for eligible animals.</P>
      <P>Following the issue of the statement by the Department in July 2002 advising the person named of eligibility under the slaughter premium scheme regarding these three animals, further checking of records revealed no evidence that the animals had been slaughtered. As a result no payment can be made in respect of these animals under the slaughter premium scheme.</P>

      <P>There are five former employees of the Dublin District Milk Board who are paid a salary by my Department but are not working pending new procedures being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" />Following protracted discussions, my Department understands the Department of Finance and the Civil Service Commission have now agreed to issue the excluding order. As soon as it is issued, this Department can assign these five ex-milk board employees to duties.</P>
    <P>The background to this is that following an EU decision that the milk regulatory function of the Dublin and Cork milk boards was contrary to EU competition policy, the function of the boards were transferred to the private sector in 1995.</P>
    <P>To protect the interest of workers and comply with the commitment in the Programme for National Recovery and PESP that privatisation would not involve redundancies, one of the terms of the milk board rationalisation agreement was that if the transferred employees were subsequently made redundant by the private sector they would be deployed forthwith to the public sector at an analogous salary.</P>
    <P>To date 49 of the relevant 69 employees have been made redundant. All exercised their option to transfer to the public sector and were assigned to this Department. Of these, 44 were assigned to appropriate duties. Under the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956, the five remaining former employees cannot be appointed to the civil service until an excluding order under section 5 of that act has been issued by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The total wages for these employees since their commencement is &euro;721,561.38 while their total wages for 2002 amounted to &euro;194,069.88.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 to 217, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 3 December, I set out the approach of Ireland and our EU partners to Tibet. There has been no change of policy in this regard. In common with its EU partners, Ireland regards Tibet as an integral part of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legal government of China. The Government believes that the best way to achieve progress in relation to the situation in Tibet is through peaceful dialogue between the Government in Beijing and the Dalai Lama.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recalled on 3 December the bilateral contacts the Government has had with China during which <Col N="624" /> we have highlighted our concerns in relation to human rights abuses, and recorded the level of concern in Ireland in relation to Tibet. I also set out the on-going efforts at the UN, including at the Commission on Human Rights, to address issues involving the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in China, including those in Tibet.</P>
    <P>Since I made that statement, two cases have been brought to my attention. These involved two Tibetans who were charged by the Intermediate People's Court of Kardze prefecture in Sichuan. Since April 2002, when they were arrested, widespread concerns have been raised amongst EU partners and NGOs, including those in Ireland. Some ten other people were reportedly detained in connection with these cases; I understand from reports that Tsultrim Dargye, Tamdring Tsering and Ashar (Aka) Dhargye may remain in detention; the whereabouts of Choetsom and Pasang, said to be monks at Jamyang Choekhorling monastery, are still unknown.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that the cases of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche and Lobsang Dhondup were based on confessions, that torture was involved, and that no evidence was made public. The charges against Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, who was sentenced to death, with a two &ndash; year suspension of execution, involved violent and terrorist acts in Sichuan, including an explosion at Chengdu's main square in April 2002. The charges against Lobsang Dhondup, who was sentenced to death, involved a bomb attack on a police station in 2001, in which one person was killed, as well as illegal possession of guns and ammunition.</P>
    <P>The EU Troika ambassadors carried out two demarches to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to make known their concerns on these cases. The Troika pressed for information in these cases, including on the status of the appeal procedure, the location and level of the court, and urged that observers be allowed access.</P>
    <P>Despite these efforts, on 26 January Lobsang Dhondup was executed, and the sentence of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche was upheld. The EU, with Ireland's full support, issued a declaration on 5 February, expressing deep regret and disappointment at the execution of Lobsang Dhondup, despite international concerns at the lack of transparency of the process in these cases.</P>
    <P>In the declaration, the EU reiterated its concerns about the conditions under which the trial was conducted, and the lack of certainty as to whether due process and other safeguards for a fair trial were respected, adding that it considered this a serious violation of the rights of the two defendants. It also reiterated its policy on the death penalty, including its insistence that, in cases where the death penalty is maintained, the internationally accepted minimum standards should be respected. This should include all possible safeguards to ensure a fair trial and adequate, fair representation, as well as the need for clear and convincing evidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" />The European Union has voiced these concerns to the Chinese Government, urging it to review the case against Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and expressed also its expectation that his death sentence will not be carried out. Ireland and the EU will continue to avail of every opportunity to raise their concerns regarding the situation of Tibet through the EU-China human rights dialogue, as well as through appropriate action at the UN, including at the Commission on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>The issue of criminal records of persons placed in a residential institution in the past <Col N="627" /> is addressed by section 35 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 and section 258 (1) of the Children's Act 2001. Section 35 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act states:</P>
      <P>For the avoidance of doubt, a person who was detained in an industrial school pursuant to the Children Act 1908 other than a person who was so detained as a consequence of a conviction for an offence, shall not be subject to any disqualification or any other restriction that is a consequence of a conviction for an offence.</P>
      <P>I have made arrangements for an extract of the Children's Act 2001, which outlines the conditions for non disclosure of certain finding of guilt for offences committed by a minor, to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>My Department currently maintains archive records in relation to approximately 41,000 former residents of the old industrial and reformatory schools system. These former pupils were placed in the schools by way of court orders. These records are maintained in the Department's offices in Athlone and are in paper form with copies in electronic format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original paper records are maintained in a secure storeroom in the residential institutions redress unit in my Department's offices in Athlone. Access to these records is only permitted to officials currently employed in that unit. <Col N="628" /> Many of the records concerned date from the late 1800s and the bulk of them cover the period from the 1930s to the 1970s. The majority of the records are in poor condition and would not remain intact if they were subjected to repeated physical handling. In order to avoid any repeated handling of such records and to facilitate ease of search and retrieval of information from the archive, my Department has processed copies of the records in electronic format onto a computer based document management system. Access to the electronic records is limited to those officials working in the residential institutions redress unit and the system is protected by being located on a stand-alone computer server and passwords.</P>
    <P>In recent years, copies of and extracts from the archive records have been given by my Department to a number of third parties for a variety of purposes. On occasions the Department has been legally obliged to discover material from the archive to co-defendants in civil actions being taken against the Department and the religious orders that owned and managed the institutions. In addition, in cases where former residents have applied to my Department through their solicitors for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 the records would issue directly to the nominated solicitor concerned. However, records are only released to the solicitor with the written consent of the former resident in accordance with the terms of the FOI Act.</P>
    <P>In order for my Department to meet its legal requirements in relation to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and, so that the Commission can carry out its investigative role, the archive records have also been given to the Commission, mainly in electronic format. My Department has also made extracts from the archive available to the gardaí from time to time to assist them with their investigations of allegations of abuse in some of these schools.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently processing requests under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 for access to records by former residents of the old industrial and reformatory schools. However the FOI Act does not address the often sensitive issues arising in these records or matters such as tracing of family members. To this end, and in order to provide a comprehensive, compassionate and supportive service to the former residents of these institutions, my Department has agreed to support the provision of an information and mediation service for those former residents who wish to access their records without the need to make a request under the FOI Act to the Department.</P>
    <P>The new service, Origins, will be operated by Barnardos, having regard to their established competence and experience in the release of similar forms of information to persons in similar circumstances. All relevant records held by my Department have been given to Barnardos in electronic format to facilitate the operation of the new service. Access to the records is strictly controlled and restricted to those Barnardos person<Col N="629" /> nel working in the Origins service and then only in circumstances where a former client requests Barnardos to access their personal records. Barnardos will act as agents of my Department and the operation of the service will be governed by a legally binding service agreement. My Department will grant aid the operation of the new service and to date, &euro;200,000 has been paid to Barnardos to establish the service and assist with the recruitment of appropriately trained professional staff. I am satisfied that the new Origins service should provide significantly improved access to personal records to the former residents of the old industrial and reformatory schools.</P>

      <Quest>the effect circulars sent from his Department in October 2002 and February 2003 in relation to the processing of application for resource and special needs assistance will have on the time it takes for a child with special needs to be provided with the support he or she requires; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's circular of October 2002 to all schools advised of the introduction of a term-based approach to the processing of applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support. Under the term-based approach it was indicated that applications for the supports in question received in my Department by close of business on 8 November 2002 would be responded to in the week commencing 9 December 2002. It was further indicated that applications received after 8 November 2002 would be treated as applications for the final school term and that the closing date for applications for this term would be notified to schools early in the second school term.</P>
      <P>The circular of February 2003 advised schools of the procedures which would apply in respect of applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support for the last term of the current school year. It advised schools that all applications received by close of business on 7 February 2003 would be rated as applications for the last school term and that my Department would respond to these applications in the week commencing 7 April 2003. It was subsequently decided to extend this cut-off date for applications from 7 February to 14 February 2003 in order to give schools some additional time to submit their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the term based approach was necessary in order to enable my Department to cope with the major expansion in the level of resource teacher and special needs assistant support being sought by and allocated to schools. The level of this expansion is reflected in the fact that the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from 104 in October <Col N="630" /> 1998 to 2,300 at present and the number of special needs assistants has increased from 299 to 3,800 full-time and a further 1,000 part-time posts over the same period. The previous lack of set application and response dates had posed significant administrative difficulties for my Department's payroll and grant payment systems. I am also aware that the lack of clarity in relation to the timing of the decision making process had been of concern to schools.</P>
    <P>While the introduction of the term-based approach may have an impact on the speed with which some applications are responded to, I am satisfied that its introduction was necessary to ensure my Department's continued capacity to process the volume of applications now arising. I am also satisfied that the impact of the term based approach in bringing greater clarity and certainty to the process has been generally welcome by schools who now have much greater assurance as to when their needs will be met and can plan accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Employment of school staff is primarily a matter for the boards of management of schools who have a statutory responsibility in this regard. School authorities have a duty of care to their pupils and normal practice is to insist on letters of reference from previous employers before offering a position. However, the schemes governing bus escorts and supervision and substitution arrangements for post-primary schools both require appointees to be vetted by the Garda Síochána. The procedure involves the proposed appointee signing a form of consent to his-her proposed appointment being sent for Garda clearance. In addition, under the Sex Offenders Act 2001, it is an offence for a person who has previously been convicted of a sexual offence to apply for a position that involves access to children. My Department's own guidelines for dealing with allegations and suspicions of child abuse have also recently been revised in consultation with the education partners and copies have been issued to all primary schools and in-service training has been provided to primary school teachers to support these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also consulting with the education partners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seeking their observations on the issue of Garda clearance for teachers. As large numbers of appointments are made every year, significant Garda resource issues arise. Screening procedures other than Garda vetting, such as references, will be <Col N="631" /> explored in the discussions with the education partners. In addition, the child protection joint working group, composed of officials from the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Education Northern Ireland, has recommended the establishment of a confidential mechanism across the United Kingdom and Ireland for the reciprocal identification of people who are considered to be unsuitable to work with children and young people. I intend to bring proposals to Government in the near future with a view to establishing a cross-governmental working group to finalise proposals for legislation on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. This scheme was superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.</P>
      <P>The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard per-capita grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Both St. John's national school and St. Paul's national school receive funding under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The level of funding provided to schools by my Department in respect of ancillary services will increase from &euro;102 per pupil which was paid in 2002, to &euro;127 per pupil for 2003, i.e. &euro;63.50 per pupil per service. Based on current enrolment figures, St. Paul's national school will receive &euro;29,718 for 2003. As St. John's national school already has the services of a full-time secretary under the 1978-79 scheme, they will receive a total of &euro;16,192.50 in respect of caretaking services only. This grant, which is the maximum available to schools for the current year, is expected to issue shortly.</P>

      <P>A permanent position as a learning support teacher may only be filled by fully recognised and fully probated primary teachers. Qualified second level teachers who have not undergone a post-graduate primary conversion course to qualify as a primary teacher are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools. In addition such teachers would have to be fully probated in order to apply for a permanent position as a learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>In this connection I should point out that my Department grants restricted recognition to teachers with a recognised post-primary qualification to enable them to teach in special schools where a proportion of the pupils attending the special school are of post-primary age, i.e.12 years or older, and where second level programmes are being provided by the school. Furthermore, there is a temporary scheme, currently in operation, whereby recognised secondary teachers are entitled to the higher rate of remuneration for any work carried out in a temporary or substitute capacity at primary school level. I emphasise however that this is a temporary scheme which was introduced in response to the teacher supply situation at primary level and there are no proposals to establish such a scheme on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>My Department is examining the feasibility of providing a modular type course for second level trained teachers currently teaching in primary schools who hold the necessary academic qualification in Irish. This course, if introduced, would enable such teachers to obtain full recognition as primary teachers.</P>

      <P>The 2003 school building programme has now been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. On the basis of the budgetary allocation it was not possible to include any further projects in 2003. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects that could not be included in this year's programme.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, only eligible children qualify for free transport. In order to be eligible for school transport, primary school children must live at least two miles from and be attending, their nearest national school.</P>
      <P>The child referred to by the Deputy, resides 2.1 miles from his nearest national school and 2.5 miles from the school concerned. As the child does not attend his nearest national school, he is not basically eligible for free transport. However, he currently avails of concessionary fare-paying transport, as there is room available on the service and no extra State cost is involved in facilitating him. The other children referred to by the Deputy are also not attending their nearest school, and are ineligible for free transport to the school concerned.</P>

The plan contains a provision allowing for a mid-term review which is currently under <Col N="637" /> way. Expenditure under the plan over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is also, in general, on target to maximise the drawdown of EU funding. It is recognised however that expenditure must be maintained at a level that respects the public expenditure ceiling set by the Government and takes account of wider budgetary priorities.</P>

      <P>My colleague Deputy Cullen, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has recently announced his intention to review the national climate change strategy due to the continuing emissions increases as a result of the volume growth in the economy. An analysis of the strategy will assess existing and potential new measures to achieve Ireland's target, 1990 levels plus 13%, under the Kyoto Protocol. This review is being undertaken by the cross-departmental climate change team, and will take into consideration all sectoral elements including afforestation levels.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is confident that the review will be finalised during the first half of this year at which stage the impact of funding levels for forestry in 2003 will become clearer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, grants up to a maximum of &euro;3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the pool in question, Drogheda Borough Council has re-examined the design of the swimming pool and its funding proposals. The council submitted an addendum to the original preliminary report in respect of the Drogheda pool in early November. This documentation is currently being examined by the Office of Public <Col N="641" /> Works. Once this assessment is complete, the proposal will be considered further.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the contradiction between FSAI's 1999 recommended daily allowances for all ages for fluoride of zero and the claim in the fluoridation forum report of 10 September 2002 that the tolerable daily intake is 12 milligrams for eight year olds and above; and if he will consider the cessation of the fluoridation of water in the public water supply.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3812/03]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and <Col N="644" /> teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.</P>
      <P>The chief executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, has informed me that in 1999, the food safety authority's scientific committee issued two reports that referred to recommended nutritional dietary allowances for Ireland. However, there is no FSAI recommendation in either report on a dietary allowance for fluoride.</P>
      <P>The forum on fluoridation reported that for both children over eight years and adults, a no observed adverse effect level of 10 milligrams of fluoride a day is considered appropriate. In order to reach that level of exposure, large amounts of water and toothpaste would need to be consumed over long periods. The Deputy may be interested to note that a recommended dietary allowance is not the same as the tolerable daily intake of a nutrient: the latter is an estimate of the amount of a substance in food or drinking water that can be ingested over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I established the forum on fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was recently launched and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
      <P>The forum also concluded that: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected; and dental fluorosis, a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel, is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research. Ultimately, the forum took an evidence-based approach to its examination of water fluoridation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 to 267, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>An agreement between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation provided for a sum of £500,000, &euro;634,869, to be allocated, on a strictly once-off basis, for a limited pilot project for warfarin testing in general practitioners' surgeries. The terms of the deal allowed for payments to be made by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board to general practitioners participating in the scheme on a first come, first served basis until such a time as the available funds were exhausted. A special consultation fee of £27.50, &euro;34.91, was agreed for each patient visit. To date there has been no collation of the results of the pilot scheme so I am not in a position to comment on the outcome.</P>
      <P>Information on the exact number of doctors involved in the scheme is not kept in my Department. I have requested the General Medical Services (Payments) Board to provide this information and will forward it to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>In excess of 65,000 claims under the scheme, were received by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board. A total of 39,611 of these claims were processed by the board. The funding available allowed for the payment of 18,180 claims. The remaining claims remain unpaid. However, I am happy to inform the Deputy that some additional funding is to be made available in the current year which will allow for the payment of a number of the unpaid claims. The exact details regarding the amount of funding to be made available and the methodology for its dispersal is yet to be finalised. My Department has also been informed by health boards that in many areas of the country general practitioners were providing this service for their patients prior to this particular project, and that they continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The Department must be under the clinical and administrative control of one or more Emergency Medicine Consultants devoting the whole or major part (eight or greater sessions) of their clinical time to the day to day supervision and training of the junior medical staff.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Western Health Board that recognition for the accident and emergency department at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, has not been withdrawn.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>EU Directives 98/34/EC and 98/48/EC, the transparency-technical standards directives, require draft technical regulations to be notified to the EU Commission and to other member states in advance of their adoption.</P>
      <P>The procedure is intended to provide transparency and control with regard to technical regulations which impose binding legal rules regulating the characteristics required of a product such as levels of quality, performance, safety or dimensions, including the requirements applicable to the product as regards the name under which the product is sold, terminology, symbols, testing and test methods, packaging, marking or labelling and conformity assessment procedures. As national measures of this nature could create unjustified barriers to trade between member states, their notification in draft form and the subsequent evaluation of their content in the course of the procedure help to diminish this risk. The procedure was not followed at Bill stage with the 2002 Act and as a result, 14 of the 53 sections of the Act are affected. However, important aspects of the Act such as the establishment of the Office of Tobacco Control and the power to regulate smoking in the workplace remain in place.</P>
      <P>As the Act is a public health measure it was considered that it was not notifiable to the Commission as a technical regulation. It was also considered that the requirement to introduce commencement orders in the case of the Act would allow for notification of the commencement order in draft form thereby meeting the requirements of the transparency directives. However, following correspondence and discussions with EU Commission officials on this matter and having obtained legal advice from the Attorney General it became clear that any attempt to commence the affected sections would result in considerable uncertainty as to the enforceability of sections in question.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I decided that the quickest and most appropriate way of resolving the issue was to repeal the affected sections and to re-introduce them by way of a new Bill which would then be notified under the transparency procedure and, on completion of this procedure, would be re-enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was further complicated by the fact that the Act was the subject of a legal challenge in the courts by the tobacco industry in three sets of proceedings. The court was advised of the problem with regard to some sections of the Act and of the attempts made through the Commission to resolve the issue. Each set of proceedings was discontinued. The problem can be <Col N="650" /> remedied and it is my intention to proceed with amending legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that I am now proceeding with a package of measures to control the smoking of tobacco in all workplaces and I have published draft regulations which will prohibit smoking in places of work from 1 January 2004.</P>

    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that responsibility for the management of industrial relations <Col N="651" /> and disciplinary issues in individual health agencies rests, in the first instance, with local management. It is the practice that in the event of an industrial dispute occurring, once an employee withdraws his or her labour payment of salary ceases. It is generally the case under grievance procedures that employees remain on full pay while the relevant issues are examined.</P>

    <P>These figures include the cost of flights for deportees and their Garda escorts, but not the cost of Garda overtime or subsistence. These latter costs are not readily available.</P>
    <P>The figure for 2002 includes the cost of chartering three aircraft, one to Algeria in January and two to Nigeria in March and November. These charters were necessary as commercial airlines refused to carry some of the deportees concerned following earlier disruptive behaviour by them on board regular flights. There were no charters in earlier years and none to date in 2003.</P>

      <P>My Department is in the process of compiling statistics on the overall cost of providing services for asylum seekers in the State for 2002. The information is being compiled in co-operation with the main Departments, in addition <Col N="657" /> to my own, which are responsible for the provision of services to asylum seekers while they are awaiting a determination on their asylum applications, namely the Departments of Social and Family Affairs; Education and Science; Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government and the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>While detailed statistics for all relevant service provision may not be available, it is expected that the total cost of providing services for asylum seekers for 2002 will be shown to be in the region of &euro;300 million as compared with some &euro;212 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>In 2002 the total cost to my own Department of asylum and related immigration activities, including the provision of legal aid and advice by the refugee legal service, was in the region of &euro;46 million.</P>
      <P>No detailed costs are available to me for 2002 for the provision of services to persons who obtained refugee status in the State. Such costs would be met by the relevant Departments providing such services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of ongoing operational initiatives have yielded significant dividends in terms of curbing the number of people entering this State as illegal migrants.</P>
      <P>The development of Garda national immigration bureau liaison arrangements with immigration authorities in other jurisdictions, particularly in France and the UK, has had a substantial impact on reducing the flow of illegal immigrants on certain routes to Ireland. For instance, the continuing co-operative strategy on the Cherbourg-Rosslare ferry route has resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of persons refused permission to travel on this route on the basis that they were carrying false or inadequate documents.</P>
      <P>Attempts by illegal migrants to gain entry at the frontiers of the State are being checked by effective controls at the point of entry. In 2002 immigration officers refused leave to land to 4,417 persons, a considerable increase on the 2001 figures of 3,301. In this context, the recent extension of the Garda national immigration bureau's computer system to the main ports of entry to the State will provide invaluable assistance in detecting and preventing illegal immigration.</P>
      <P>Together with this emphasis on prevention of illegal immigration into the State, we are focusing resources on ensuring the removal of those persons found to be illegally in the country. The successful implementation of this initiative is reflected in the increased number of deportations effected last year, 521, which shows an increase on the previous year's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" />I view the continued operation of these initiatives as a critical element in our efforts to combat illegal immigration into this State.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I have brought forward the Immigration Bill 2002 which on 4 February 2003 passed all stages of the Seanad and is awaiting Dáil Second Stage. The Bill places an obligation on a carrier to ensure that each non-national passenger seeking to land in the State or transit a port in the State has a valid passport and, if necessary (depending on the nationality of the person) a visa. Contravention of these requirements will constitute an offence punishable by a fine.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in section 4, creates a statutory offence for an employer to employ a non-national without an employment permit or for an employee to work without an employment permit. Current law as set out in Article 4 of the Aliens Order 1946 only makes it an offence for the employee to work without an employment permit. It sends a clear message to employers that the employment of illegal migrants has serious consequences and should make Ireland less attractive to illegal migrants.</P>
    <P>In relation to the refugee determination process, it is also my intention to have a number of substantial amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 enacted which will deal, in particular, with the misuse of the asylum process. Such abuse gives rise to a situation where some 50% of asylum claims are not being pursued to finality, thus tying up large amounts of resources in the asylum processing area which could be more effectively utilised for other purposes, such as integration initiatives for refugees. The amendments, a number of which have already been agreed by Seanad Éireann, in the Immigration Bill 2002 include provisions aimed at ensuring that applicants more actively pursue their asylum applications, the more effective application of the Dublin Convention and at ensuring that claims for refugee status which are manifestly unfounded are dealt with in a more accelerated manner.</P>

      <P>Ireland is supportive in principle of the concept of a common EU asylum and migration policy based on the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam (Title IV thereof) and its related protocols. However, one of the principal considerations of the State in considering whether to take part in the adoption of measures in the asylum area, and more especially the immigration area, under the Amsterdam treaty provisions is the consequences for the maintenance of the common travel area with the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of Title IV of the EC treaty to Ireland and the UK is subject to the provisions of <Col N="659" /> a Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam the effect of which is that the State has three months from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council by the Commission to notify the President of the Council in writing of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure (Article 3 of the Protocol).</P>
    <P>The Irish position in relation to the establishment of common EU asylum and migration policies is quite clearly set out in the Declaration appended to the Treaty of Amsterdam which states:</P>
    <P>Ireland declares that it intends to exercise its right under Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IIIa (Title IV) of the Treaty estab<Col N="660" /> lishing the European Community to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of its common travel area with the United Kingdom. Ireland recalls that its participation in the Protocol on the application of certain aspects of Article 7a of the Treaty establishing the European Community reflects its wish to maintain its common travel area with the United Kingdom in order to maximise freedom of movement into and out of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland can also opt to participate in any instrument after it has been adopted by Council (Article 4 of the Protocol).</P>
    <P>The Deputy will find attached a tabular statement which provides a summary of the proposals dealing with the common EU asylum and migration policy published by the Commission to date some of which have been adopted by the Council while others are still being discussed at Council working party level.</P>

Although headline crime reflects to a major degree what in the past was defined as indictable crime, the two categories are not identical.</P>

      <P>My Department has a key role in the development of disability equality policy and legislation. As part of that remit, my Department collects data on the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service, excluding Civil Service data which is collected by the equality unit in the Department of Finance. Although the target has yet to be achieved, there has been a degree of progress in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Government commitment in the Programme <Col N="662" /> for Prosperity and Fairness requires that &ldquo;every Department will take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service at an early date&rdquo;. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of each individual Department to consider the question of the action to be taken against agencies under their aegis that fail to reach the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee established and chaired by my Department helps to monitor and guide progress in relation to the target. It has supported a number of initiatives in recent years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to, chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this option at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April, 2001; commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations; the report, published in November 2001 and titled &ldquo;Research Project on the Effective Recruitment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service&rdquo; provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to assist future progress; my Department, in partnership with the Equality Authority, launched an employer resource pack on 3 December 2002 to assist public service employers in the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The statistics for each local authority, health board and the overall public sector figures are tabulated as follows. The statistics are based on figures at 31 December each year. The statistics for 31 December 2002 are currently being collected.</P>

    <P>*The overall public service figures given for December 2000 and December 2001 are provisional figures as returns are outstanding from a number of individual public service bodies.</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is responsible for the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. The 3% target is based on the definition of disability set out in the Civil Service Code of Practice on the employment of people with disabilities. This definition includes people with physical, sensory or psychological impairments. In order to maintain confidentiality, the following statistical returns made by Departments and offices do not specify the nature of the disability. The following table shows the percentage of employees with disabilities in each Department.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included a commitment to a review of the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service to ascertain ongoing adherence to the 3% employment target. While Departments met the target in the mid-1990s, since then the percentage has dropped below the target and as at December 2001 the percentage of people with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.78%. The <Col N="664" /> Department of Finance has written to the heads of all departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their legal obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target.</P>
    <P>In light of the commitment in the PPF and to improve adherence to the target, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The research, which was carried out by a team led by Goodbody Economic Consultants, will be published shortly. The research examines career progression for people with disabilities, highlights the challenges they face in pursuing their careers and makes recommendations for improvements. The Department of Finance is considering the recommendations and will be drawing up proposals shortly. Officials from the Department of Finance are meeting with the Civil Service Staff Unions to consider the recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. This target applies across the Civil Service and not just to individual Departments. As at December 2001 &ndash; the most recent figures available &ndash; the percentage of people with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.78%: the position in this Department and the Legal Aid Board was 2.61% and 2.29% respectively. I am informed that this figure may be somewhat higher as there are people with disabilities employed throughout the Civil Service who do not wish to declare their disability.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance wrote some time ago to all heads of Departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target. For my part, I am anxious to ensure that this is achieved and my Department continues to liaise with the Civil Service Commission in an effort to recruit people with disabilities wherever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested to note that <Col N="666" /> in light of the commitment in the PPF and in order to establish how to improve adherence to the target, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Civil Service Commission, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Irish Civil Service. The research is completed and will be published in early 2003. The research maps out the current arrangements in respect of career progression for people with disabilities, highlights the challenges they face when seeking to progress their careers and makes recommendations for a model of best practice in this area for the future. I look forward to reviewing its findings in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to allow asylum applicants to take up paid employment pending a final decision being made on their applications.</P>
      <P>There are a number of key reasons I believe that the present policy on access to work by asylum seekers should not be changed.</P>
      <P>Section 9(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that an applicant for asylum shall not seek or enter employment. It must also be borne in mind that under the 1996 Act asylum seekers only have temporary permission to remain in the State pending the determination of their applications. However, we must face the fact that, despite its humanitarian purpose, large numbers of persons are seeking protection under the 1996 Act, which gives effect to the State's obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention, for the purpose of avoiding legitimate immigration controls in order to gain a foothold in the State for economic reasons. Similar trends are being experienced by other EU states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that any extension of the right to work arrangement would greatly undermine the Government's asylum strategy which is aimed <Col N="668" /> at greatly increasing processing capacity to deliver more speedy decisions in applications for refugee status with a view to ensuring that new applications are dealt with within six months, and increasing the numbers of repatriations which are arising in respect of persons who do not qualify for refugee status.</P>
    <P>The current statistics clearly indicate that significant progress continues to be made in the processing of asylum applications and that the increase in processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's asylum strategy is making a real impact on the backlog of cases on hands. This is evidenced by the fact that the number of backlog cases, that is, cases which are more than six months old, on hands in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is now down to approximately 1,450 from a figure of 6,500 approximately at the end of September 2001, the vast majority of which are in the final stages of processing. The ORAC is currently scheduling asylum applicants who applied in January 2003 for interview.</P>
    <P>Extending the right to work would have a very negative impact on asylum numbers as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so. The immediate effect of that measure was a threefold increase in the average number of applications per month leading to a figure of 1,217 applications in December, 1999, compared with an average of 364 per month for the period January to July 1999. This represented the highest ever number of applications received in the State in any month to date.</P>
    <P>Any significant increase in applications would also have a significant negative impact on our capacity to accommodate asylum applicants while they are awaiting a determination of their claims. As things stand at the moment, the ongoing provision of services to meet the reception, health and welfare and accommodation needs of asylum seekers is an enormous challenge for all the State agencies who work in this area. The total cost to the Exchequer of the provision of services to asylum seekers was &euro;300 million approximately in 2002.</P>
    <P>Any proposal to grant asylum seekers access to the labour market at the present time would also undermine the current and effective work permit system which provides a comprehensive channel for legal migration to the State. Some 40,000 <Col N="669" /> work permits were issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2002 as compared to 36,000 in 2001 and 18,000 in 2000.</P>
    <P>It is a well established fact that those engaged in trafficking and those seeking to access the labour market without going through the appropriate legal channels are very quick to identify any perceived attractiveness of a country as a preferred or easily accessed destination. It is clear from the profile of applicants, and the results of the determination process, that a significant number of people have come and sought asylum in Ireland with a view to seeking work. Many people are already working illegally. It is my very strong belief that any extension of the right to work to all applicants would be portrayed abroad by people traffickers to potential victims as a cast iron guarantee of a right to work.</P>
    <P>The greatest service we can provide to those who should be recognised as refugees is to ensure that their claims are decided speedily and that nothing is done which undermines this policy priority by attracting large numbers of non-genuine applicants to the detriment of genuine applicants. Overloading the process with large numbers of new applicants who come here under the misguided expectation that they will be able to work would be totally contrary to the State's obligations under the Geneva Convention and could completely negate the major investment in effort, time and resources which has gone into bringing our overall strategy to its current status.</P>
    <P>A recently adopted EU directive laying down minimum standards for reception of asylum seekers in member states provides that if a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the presentation of an application for asylum and this delay cannot be attributed to the applicant, member states shall decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant. The position of the State in relation to this directive was set out in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 131 of 6 February 2003.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Garda inspectorate, which would have the power to investigate complaints and which would also have the powers of an ombudsman. Work on the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill to provide for this is well advanced, and I intend bringing this to Government in the near future with a view to publication later this year. I would hope for early enactment by the Oireachtas and every effort will thereafter be <Col N="670" /> made to establish the inspectorate as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>As I have previously explained to the House, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order 1925.</P>
      <P>The function of visiting committees is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee has free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of its prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>Members of visiting committees receive no remuneration. Vouched expenses for travel and subsistence are paid, on the authorisation of the Prison Governor, in line with Civil Service rates.</P>

Tynagh Garda station is open to the public from 11.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. Monday to Saturday inclusive. When not open, a public access call box and call diversion system is in operation and connected to the district headquarters in Loughrea.</P>
      <P>The Tynagh area is policed by gardaí from the Loughrea district and from the community policing headquarters in Portumna. Resources are augmented from within the district-division as required. The area is also patrolled by the divisional traffic unit. I am further informed that local Garda management is satisfied that the current personnel strength of the area is adequate to meet the present needs of the area. However, the situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Tynagh Garda station will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The small claims procedure is a special mechanism for dealing with consumer claims within the District Court structure which is designed to handle such claims speedily, inexpensively and informally without involving a solicitor. It is administered by the Small Claims Registrar whose function it is to process the claims and, if possible, reach a satisfactory settlement without the need for a court hearing. The current threshold for small claims applications is &euro;1,269.74, which has been the upper limit since July 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Courts Service is considering a review of the operation of the small claims procedure which will include the issue of increasing the monetary limit which applies to claims made under the procedure.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 316 together.</P>
      <P>As I previously explained to the House, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of visiting committees is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me <Col N="676" /> any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee has free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of its prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Medical services in the prison system are provided by qualified medical practitioners, while educational services are, in the main, provided by the vocational educational committees. During the course of their inspections, the visiting committees meet the professional staff attached to the medical and educational services. Where difficulties are highlighted or identified, the issues can be raised by the committee with the local prison authorities or indeed may be referred to me as is provided under the legislation.</P>

The type of work undertaken would typically be the repairs necessary to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of an elderly person living alone in unfit or unsanitary conditions, and would include such works as repairs to chimney or fireplace, repair or replacement of external doors and windows, minor roof repairs, damp-proofing of rooms and provision of heating appliances.

The scheme was 17th in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2002-04, published in April 2002. As of the level of competing demand and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 to 328, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 seeks to balance the rights of owners and occupiers of protected structures with the overall obligation to protect and conserve the country's architectural heritage. I am very conscious that the co-operation and support of the owners and occupiers of protected structures, as well as public awareness and appreciation of our heritage, will be critical to ensure that this heritage is passed on to future generations. Draft guidelines for planning auth<Col N="680" /> orities on architectural heritage protection, published in December 2001, note that the best method of conserving historic buildings is to keep them in active use. It is recognised that a degree of compromise will be required in adapting a protected structure to meet the requirements of modern living, while seeking to minimise the impact of adaptations on the fabric of the structure. The final guidelines are now nearing completion in my Department. They will reinforce the recommendation for a practical approach to the protection of the architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have extensive powers under Part IV to assist the owners and occupiers of protected structures in conserving heritage properties, including through the provision of financial help or by doing necessary works itself. Planning authorities can also purchase properties where it appears necessary to do so for the protection of the structure, although where the structure is a private residence the purchase cannot be compulsory. There is no obligation on house owners to insure their houses. Questions in relation to the operation of the insurance market would be appropriate to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national spatial strategy, NSS, indicates that in relation to gateways and hubs, the focus for action must lie in establishing consensus on integrated spatial frameworks for land use, planning, urban design, transport and public service delivery. The relevant enterprise and infrastructure development authorities and agencies will be consulted in the development of these frameworks. The relevant local authorities &ndash; county councils, city councils and town councils, as the case may be &ndash; have primary responsibility for driving the preparation of these frameworks and translating their provisions into statutory development plans that will guide the development process through the planning system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The frameworks will focus on the practical realisation of the gateway or hub. In some cases, more than one local authority may be involved. However, provision has been made in the Planning and Development Act 2000 and in the Local Government Act 2001 for the preparation of joint plans and the use of joint committees between local authorities to address cross boundary issues, including transportation issues. Regional authorities, in co-operation with the local authorities <Col N="681" /> and city and county development boards in different areas, will also support the process.</P>

    <P>My Department has placed numerous advertisements since January 2001, mainly on foot of statutory notification requirements. There has also been a range of advertising campaigns across the <Col N="683" /> whole media spectrum over the period in question to highlight issues of relevance to my Department. The Department also funds the operations of ENFO, the environmental information service. ENFO provides an authoritative source of factual information on the environment and sustainable lifestyles. This is achieved, <i>inter alia,</i> through providing access to a drop-in centre, a library, exhibitions, leaflets, CDs and videos.</P>
    <P>The Department has had responsibility for heritage functions since June 2002. While some general advertising costs in relation to these are included in the above expenditure figures, other advertising costs were charged to individual heritage projects and programmes and have not been included in the above figures.</P>

      <P>The student summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work. When the scheme was introduced, unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. In the past five years, however, the take-up has dropped significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs in recent years.</P>
      <P>In view of above and in light of the financial pressures on my Department, it has been decided to discontinue the scheme. There are no plans to develop a replacement scheme. The Government has decided to shift the focus of available resources towards educational initiatives targeted at disadvantaged students.</P>

      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to annual funding for the CLÁR programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. Arising from the analysis of the 2002 population census, which I commissioned from NUI Maynooth, the Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these additions on 17 January 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" />The critical criterion in the review was to maintain the 50% overall reduction and involved identifying and including any DEDs with a 50% plus population decline contiguous or near to existing CLÁR areas.</P>
    <P>In the case of Monaghan, seven additional DEDs were included with an additional 2,705 population benefiting from the programme.</P>
    <P>These DEDs meet the criteria of the review in that they are both contiguous to an existing CLÁR area and maintain the average population decline for the revised areas.</P>
    <P>The statistics for the areas specifically referred to by the Deputy are:</P>
    <P>Knockatallon (Sheskin DED):&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;49.43% decline 1926-2002</P>
    <P>Mullyash DED:&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;54.71% decline 1926-2002</P>
    <P>Oram (Church Hill DED):&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;40.19% decline 1926-2002</P>
    <P>The Sheskin DED showed a decrease in population for the 1996-2002 period, the Mullyash DED remained constant while the Church Hill DED showed an increase in population.</P>
    <P>These DEDs were not brought into the revised areas as they were not contiguous or near to an existing CLÁR area.</P>
    <P>Although the provision for the CLÁR programme is reduced from the 2002 allocation, I expect that I will be able to complete a comprehensive work programme in 2003. CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources. The 2003 CLÁR allocation will be sufficient to continue this leverage and so sustain an effective programme.</P>

      <P>My responsibility in relation to INTERREG, Phase II and other EU funded programmes relates only to those aspects of the various programmes, which are within the remit of my Department. As the Deputy may know, there are a variety of delivery mechanisms for these programmes, involving a broad range of interests. The Deputy may wish to note that the process for selecting applications under the current Phase II and INTERREG IIIA programmes are significantly different from previous programmes. New procedures and systems are required to cater for such changes.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that one of the key objectives of the establishment of my Department in June 2002 was the Government's recognition of the need to address the issues of regional and social balance in a more effective way and the achievement of a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities around the country.</P>
      <P>In the western region, the counties of Clare, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo, the Western Development Commission manages the western investment fund. In support of its brief to promote economic and social development, it has funded 18 community-based projects amounting to &euro;1.4 million.</P>
      <P>In Gaeltacht areas and off-shore islands the national development plan funds the improvement of infrastructure which benefits the entire community in these regions.</P>
      <P>In addition to the national development plan investments, I also introduced, in October 2001, the CLÁR programme for disadvantaged rural areas. An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to continue the CLÁR programme, ensuring annual funding, and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. Last month I announced the revision of the CLÁR areas.</P>
      <P>Although the provision for the CLÁR programme is reduced from the 2002 allocation, I expect that I will be able to complete a comprehensive work programme in 2003. CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources. The 2003 CLÁR allocation will be sufficient to continue this leverage and so sustain an effective programme.</P>
      <P>The rural development fund is available to finance research, evaluations and pilot actions to provide information and advice to policy makers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the local development measure of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan, funding is available to the 38 partnerships, 33 community groups and four territorial employment pacts that deliver the programme at local level. Partnerships and community groups operate in areas that are designated. Some &euro;45.5 million was allocated to <Col N="689" /> these groups in 2002. The corresponding allocations for 2003 have not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>The national drugs strategy forms part of the wider social inclusion strategy and the strong commitment to areas of disadvantage in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Under the plan, just under &euro;155 million is available to fund the strategy, the bulk of which is earmarked to fund initiatives in the local drugs task force areas. In 2003, over &euro;16 million is set aside in the Vote of the Department to the fund the strategy, of which approximately &euro;12.5 million is NDP &ndash; related.</P>
    <P>My Department is also responsible for the RAPID, revitalising areas through planning, investment and development, programme. RAPID is a focused initiative by the Government to target the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. The programme calls on Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services. There are two strands of the RAPID Programme &ndash; strand I targets 25 urban areas while strand II targets 20 provincial towns around the country.</P>
    <P>My Department operates a variety of grant schemes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, a scheme of community support for older people, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
    <P>In addition, long-term funding is provided to locally-based voluntary and community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives through the community development support programmes. My Department's community development support programmes are included in the national development plan with a commitment of almost &euro;140 million, £110 million, over the lifetime of the plan 2000-2006. These programmes are included in the sub-programme for social inclusion in the Regional Operational Programme.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;30.09 million has been committed to community and voluntary services in 2003, which will enable my Department to continue the above programmes, albeit at a somewhat reduced level. Due to the tighter economic situation, it may not be possible to progress the expansion of the community development support programmes at the same pace as in previous years. Any further expansion will have to take account of our existing commitments and the available resources.</P>
    <P>Given these budgetary constraints, it is necessary to ensure resources are best deployed and address priorities. In that context, I intend to undertake a review of all the programmes and activities which come within the remit of my Department with a view to achieving optimal coherence across the various schemes and maximising the effectiveness of the programmes for local communities. This process will shape the future development of the Department's pro<Col N="690" /> grammes. It is intended that the results of this review will lead to the targeting of available resources in a more strategic manner for communities across the country.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. The strategy aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>My Department also has responsibility for the work of the local drugs task forces which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. Currently, there are 14 local drugs task forces &ndash; 12 in Dublin, one in Cork, and one in Bray, which was designated an LDTF area in 2000.</P>
      <P>The role of the LDTFs is to prepare local action plans after an assessment of the extent of use in the local area and the service gaps that need to be filled. The plans include a range of measures in relation to treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply. In addition, the LDTFs provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services in these areas, while at the same time allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of those services. They are designed to complement and add value to the extensive range of interventions being delivered through the State agencies.</P>
      <P>All the LDTFs, with the exception of Bray, are currently implementing their second round of action plans and, to date, over &euro;14.5 million has been allocated. In total, the Government has allocated over &euro;51 million to implement the projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the extent of cocaine use in Dublin area, comprehensive figures are not available, however, I am aware that the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, has reported that its services are beginning to notice an increase in those presenting with problems related to cocaine use, though it should be noted that the numbers involved are still low. Services for cocaine users primarily involve counselling and additional counsellors and outreach workers have been recruited by the three area health <Col N="691" /> boards of the ERHA in the last number of years. In addition, the Northern Area Health Board has recently established a treatment clinic dedicated to cocaine misuse in the north inner city.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, has commissioned a national population survey which is due to be completed this summer and this should give us a a more reliable picture of drug use nation-wide, including cocaine.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the increased allocation for drugs services provided by my Department for 2003, I am confident that any extra measures that may need to be taken to tackle cocaine use can be addressed in the context of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008.</P>

        <i>Offshore Islands</i>Capital grants for economic and social development on offshore islands</P>
      <P>Subsidies for operation of ferry/air services</P>
      <P>My Department also funds the work of the local drugs task forces and the premises initiative for drugs projects. These plans are assessed by the national drugs strategy team and allocations are ultimately approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The funding for the projects in LDTF areas is channelled through the relevant Department or State agency.</P>
      <P>The western investment fund, administered by the Western Development Commission, provides loans and can take equity in companies though it does not actually provide grants.</P>

    <P>My Department also provides assistance directly to various organisations involved in the promotion of the Irish language and its related culture in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Annual grants are paid from Ciste na Gaeilge &ndash; which is financed from the proceeds of the national lottery &ndash; to certain established Irish language organisations. Applications from organisations that have not previously received assistance may also be examined. Assistance is also approved form the fund for miscellaneous Irish language projects on the basis of applications from the groups initiating them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate the difficulty in providing information in respect of the method of application in respect of the large number of schemes outlined above in the time available. I have therefore arranged for my officials to forward details of the various methods of application direct to the Deputy. I should mention that information on application procedures is available on my Department's website and will shortly be published in the Department's section 16 FOI Handbook, which is now being finalised for publication.</P>
    <P>Currently a variety of approaches are taken to the advertising of the various forms of grant assistance available from my Department. These include the issues of press releases and placing of advertisements in national and local print media as appropriate. Information on all schemes administered by my Department is also available on the Department's website at www.pobail.ie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. The strategy aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to <Col N="694" /> be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>My Department also has responsibility for the work of the local drugs task forces which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuses, particularly heroin. Currently there are 14 local drugs task forces &ndash; 12 in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Bray.</P>
      <P>The role of the LDTFs is to prepare local action plans which include a range of measure in relation to treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply. In addition the LDTFs provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services in these areas, while at the same time allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of those services. They are designed to complement and add value to the extensive range of interventions being delivered through the State agencies.</P>
      <P>All the LDTFs with the exception of Bray are currently implementing their second round of action plans and to date over &euro;14.5 million has been allocated. In total the Government has allocated over &euro;51 million to implement the projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should note that in addition to the moneys available under the action plans, &euro;12.7 million was provided under the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs to community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas. To date, over &euro;11 million has been allocated to projects under this initiative.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also note that the young peoples facilities and services fund operates in the 14 local drugs task force areas and in a number of other urban centres &ndash; Limerick, Galway, Carlow and Waterford. The main aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. An amount of approximately &euro;59 million has been allocated to date under the first round of funding.</P>
      <P>In addition the Deputy should note that under the national drugs strategy 2001-2008 it is proposed to set up regional drugs task forces &ndash; RDTFs &ndash; in the ten health board regions throughout the country. The new task forces will bring together the relevant statutory, voluntary and community sectors to assess the service needs and the extent of drug use in their areas. It is my intention that all of the RDTF members will work in partnership, in a manner similar to the local drugs task forces and that they will hold their first meetings in March 2003.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. To this end my Department is involved in a wide range of investment programmes, both EU and national, to promote this objective.</P>
      <P>In addition to the EU programmes and the national development plan investments, I also introduced, in October 2001, the CLÁR programme for disadvantaged rural areas. An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to continue the CLÁR programme, ensuring annual funding, and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. Last month I also announced the revision of the CLÁR areas.</P>
      <P>The CLÁR programme, ceantair laga árd-riachtanais, was introduced on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness for a targeted investment programme in both urban and rural disadvantaged areas. CLÁR complements both the RAPID programme for disadvantaged urban areas and RAPID 11, the programme for provincial towns.</P>
      <P>The 16 regions originally selected for inclusion in the CLÁR programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula, which was included based on the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease. The average population loss in these regions was 50%.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the outset. These measures, under which co-funding is provided to Departments, State agencies and local authorities, support physical, community and social infrastructure.</P>
